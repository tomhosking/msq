0,How much should you tell your children about your sorrows and joys?,"I come from a house where no one talked about anything except paying electricity bills, rent, or studies.  I was never asked questions about myself, my social life, friends or lack of them etc. My parents never told me anything about their lives.  I want my child to share her sorrows and joys with me so I think I will have to start first by telling her about myself. This way I will set an example that it is normal to talk about your life to parents and vice versa.  At what age should this be started? What is the way to start this? What should and shouldn't I talk about? "
1,How soon until I can take my newborn to take a walk outside?,"I understand that newborn's immune system is still weak and crowds/strangers are to be avoided. Knowing this, how soon can I take my newborn outside, for example to take ~1 hours walk in a non-crowded park? Any particular things to pay attention to when doing this? "
2,How can a parent who is known by their child or teen not to be teetotal raise their offspring in sobriety?,"Individuals up to 18 yrs old (or 21 in some jurisdictions) are not supposed to drink alcoholic beverages. But it is an open secret that this obligation is being notoriously broken and convincing children to actually keep it is a great challenge for parents.  Can the very fact that a child knows their mother or father does occasionally have a drink prompt them to drink prematurely? Can this make it more difficult for such a parent to talk to their child once they find out the child was drinking prematurely?  I remember watching a TV show were a mother returning home with her quite young child found an unexpected party thrown for her there. And she did have one drink there, though somewhat grudgingly, for she was kind of irritated with this surprise party. Later the show humorously hinted the child got seriously drunk there.  This made me think, how could such a mother talk to her child after this party?  “But Mum, you were drinking this yourself!”  “I can, you can’t. Fine enough?”  I suppose such a dialogue isn’t going to be any helpful…  Or should parents of children of any age be teetotal to gain credibility while expecting their children not to drink? "
3,How do you prepare a toddler to sleep in a strange place (a hotel room)?,"We're preparing for our first overnight vacation since my son has outgrown a crib.  He's been in a ""big boy bed"" for several months now, and still is very proud of this fact (and very proud of his bed in particular).  The last time we traveled overnight, my son was less than a year old.  Now he's two-and-a-half.  I'm a little worried that he might not handle sleeping in a strange place as well as he did when he was younger.  Is it common for children of that age to become upset about sleeping in a strange bed?  Is there anything I can do to prepare that might make it easier on him? "
4,How to deal with two 10- and 12-year-old brothers fighting?,"I am a father of 10- and 12-year-old boys. Both used to play happily and regularly and fought on occasions. The younger boy used to complain about his older brother with some deep cries and proof of the older boy hitting him hardly.  I used to be in a seperate room from the brothers. I travel a lot and find less time with kids. I, at times, get angry with the older boy and shout at him to not hit the younger boy. But my wife used to tell that the younger boy starts to hit his older brother playfully and the 12-year-old, being irritated, hits back.   As a father how do I handle this situation without hurting any of my kids?  How to solve the situation with the younger brother being hit by lovable, good older brother, who loses his patience with his younger brother's regular playful ness? "
5,How do I deal with my baby pulling herself up in her crib?,"My 6 month old daughter has started to pull herself up to a kneeling or standing position. It's like someone flipped a switch-- she went from not climbing on anything to climbing on everything, all the time.  Which is great!  The problem is when we go to put her to bed.  My husband and I are pretty hands-off during her bedtime.  We put her to bed, say goodnight, and leave.  She usually fusses for about 5 minutes, but goes to sleep.  But now she pulls herself up on the crib walls and cries because she gets stuck there.  Unless I help her down, she'll mostly only get down by falling over. I'm afraid that she could hurt herself, and it's taking her much longer to get to sleep.  Would bumpers for the crib be safe?  What should I do?  (Note: I have lowered the mattress on her crib, so she's not in danger of falling out, just falling and bumping her head on the crib bars.) "
6,Can my 18 months old boy learn from watching movies?,"Everyday, my 18 months old boy is always asking to watch a movie by coming to my laptop and requesting to watch movie by talking with his baby talk style. I have a good serial cartoon movies for him. But sometimes he feel bored with the same movies which I chosed for him.  Before I am going further, actually, can my 18 months old boy learn from watching movies? If it is yes, do you have any recommended movies which has good contents for my boy to learn? "
7,From what age should I require the child to speak the foreign language which I want her to learn?,"Considering: Should I make my child respond to me in my language? and Enforcing minority languages at home  The child is currently 2 years 4 months old. I speak to her in foreign language X. Other people speak to her in native language Y.   Child understands X but prefers to speak Y. I think she finds Y easier to speak.  I want the child to learn to speak X. Until she starts speaking X she won't learn how to speak it.   So, from what age should I apply the tactic that ""I will reply to you only when you speak in X with me""? "
8,At what age can we expect a baby to be carried in a back pack baby carrier?,We don't intend to purchase a stroller. We intend to purchase a back pack baby carrier. At what minimum age is it considered safe to put the baby in the back pack?  I think just born babies can not be put in the back packs since they can't support their heads(?). At that age we have no choice other than to carry him in our hands? Do we? 
9,Have there ever actually been any studies proving some immunizations cause autism?,"   Possible Duplicate:   What are the objective arguments against immunizations for infants and children?       I have heard a lot about autism being caused by some immunizations, but haven't found any studies actually proving this.  Have there been any?  Or have there even been any strong correlations?    Saying something like ""nearly all children with autism have had immunizations"" means nothing since over 98% of children have been given immunizations.  That's pretty much like saying ""nearly all autistic children fit within 98% of the scope of all children"". "
10,Condoms in a care package: Parents advice,"Following a bit of advice in Meta, I wanted to ask for the advice that parents who have this experience (or know who has) what is best.  I am strictly not looking for opinions about whether this is right or wrong.  I am in an organization that happens to be religious and we are doing care packages for our outgoing seniors to college.  A lot of food and toothbrushes and things have been collected, and that's awesome.  I've spoken to my pastor and she said not only was it fine by her, and knowing the congregation, I believe it should be no problem.  Setting aside that preface, my question is: *how best to do this logistically for the kids (who are now adults).  The care packages are going to be received by mail, will include all sorts of food and things, but I want to include condoms as my contribution.  As parents, is there literature or packaging that should accompany these in the care packages?  These are going randomly to about 100 of our college students almost evenly split gender.  Caveats:   Enough food and clothing has been collected They don't expire until 2019 The recipients will be both adult men and women and I'm concerned about any embarrassment when the packages are opened around peers.   What, from a parent's personal experience, is the best way to include condoms in a college care package?  Instructions?  Put them in an envelope to avoid initial embarrassment? Do you think they would like instructions (condoms come with them and I can copy them and include it).  This question is not about whether it should be done (that has been established), it is about best logistics &amp; packaging, and your experience as a parent on this. "
11,"Is it possible to train a 3-month-old breastfed baby to sleep through the night? And if yes, how?","My wife is breastfeeding our 3-month-old baby. The baby will wake up every 2-3 hours to be fed. So she won't be sleeping through the night.  I wonder whether it is possible to train a 3-month-old breastfed baby to sleep through the night? If she can't sleep the whole night without waking up because she will be hungry, then at least can we reduce the frequency of feeding? Can we possibly train her to do that? My wife needs her sleep too.  "
12,How often should the cloth diaper be changed and how to know when it is the time to change the diapers?,"Infant will be on his bed, so how will I know that it is the time to change his diaper? Do I have to wait for his crying? Do I have to check every 15 minutes whether his diaper is wet or not?  These would be cloth diapers.    New question:     How to check the diaper every hour at night? Should I set an alarm after every hour to get up and check for wet diapers every night? What is a practical solution for this?  "
13,How to deal with a one year old who resists sitting in shopping cart?,"We have an 11-month-old boy who is very mobile (has been walking since 9 months) and now loves to play, run around, and climb on things. One problem we have is that when we're in the grocery store, he'll usually sit calmly in the cart at first but his state eventually deteriorates and he desperately wants to be unbuckled so that he can run around. We've tried to keep him preoccupied with food or toys, and it helps, but it usually doesn't last long.  We've started (perhaps mistakenly) to let him out and push the cart around in the store. (He also loves pushing his stroller around at the park or anything that has wheels really). It works for a while in terms of us being able to continue shopping, but eventually he gets bored and wants to run all over the store. This, of course, is not conducive to shopping, and he doesn't follow us around much; he just wants to run (i.e. top speed/max distance run). He really resists being put back into the cart (e.g., screams, flails, etc... an early tantrum maybe?).   Before taking him to the store we've tried making sure he    is not hungry has recently woken up from a nap yet has had some time to run around at home for a bit and has access to toys and things to distract him.   He shows similar behavior after being in his high chair for a while. Once he is done eating, he tries to get out of the seat, flails, and screams. We've tried teaching him some sign language (e.g., ""all done"") but he doesn't understand that this will get him out of his high chair much easier than screaming. Generally, it seems like he doesn't like to be restrained. He will sit in a stroller calmly for a while, but it's obvious that he really just wants to walk. Other than this problem, he is mostly very happy (e.g., smiles and laughs a lot, loves to play with us, be around other kids, etc.).  It seems like most questions and other internet resources on tantrums are geared toward toddlers, specifically 2-3 year olds. There's not much on one year olds, and the issues seems to be different. E.g., our son isn't upset that we're not buying him a toy or a candy bar, he just wants to walk around.  TLDR; How do we deal with a one year old who wants to walk/run around but needs to sit in a shopping cart?  "
14,My 7-year-old doesn't want to go to before-school childcare - how do I engage her with the opportunities in this situation?,"When I talk to my 7-year-old daughter about before school childcare, she says it is ""boring"" and ""doesn't have friends to talk to"".   My personal thoughts (not that this is necessarily helpful in a conversation with my daughter) is that boredom leads to creative thinking, and reflecting on the world.  I get that the situation is a bit dreary - what constructive things can I give to my daughter to make the best use of the time?  My question is: My 7-year-old daughter doesn't want to go to before-school childcare and dawdles making us an hour late  - how do I engage her with the opportunities in this situation? "
15,6 month old hitting her head on the floor when turning over onto her back,"She just learned how to turn from on-the-stomach to on-the back, but since she's still new at it, she would hit her head onto the floor on her way down (with a soft playmat on top, but still not that soft considering the floor beneath is wood).  Should I be concerned and stop her from doing so on her own? Can she suffer a concussion from hitting her head? "
16,What symptoms call for an immediate trip to the doctor?,"   Possible Duplicate:   How do you know when it is time to take a child to the Doctor?       As a new mother, I tend to be very worried. I'm always afraid I might be missing something, or not noticing an important symptom. I was wondering if there are symptoms that call for immediate contact with a doctor. For example, when I went for my first visit to my baby's pediatrician, she told me that if I ever see green in my baby's spit-up I should immediately call her. Are there any other signs I should look out for? I'd love to compile a list.  To start:   Green spitup High fever (Consistent) Projectile vomiting (a single isolated case is probably perfectly normal)  "
17,How to help a child understand length of time?,"My question stems from an article I read, which says      Parents are presenting a clear choice for the child. ... For example, “If you sit on the steps, it will be for 10 min. If you do not sit on the steps, you will have to stay in the house for the rest of the day, three more hours. Ten minutes is shorter than 3 h.” With younger children, some parents have drawn timelines for the child to illustrate, for example, how 10 min is shorter than 3 h.   And my question is, how do I illustrate that?   I've also seen that a 4 year old I know cannot grasp what 1 hour (or any amount of time for that matter) means for him. Yes, the hour hand moves from one number to another, but how long does it take to do that? Even adults sometimes lose track of time, and 1 hour may sometimes seem much longer or much shorter, but we have a basic understanding or expectation of what 1 hour feels like. We wouldn't look at the clock to see if 1 hour has passed yet, after just 2 minutes.  At what age will a child get a basic sense of how much time has passed or is yet to pass? How can parents help the child understand? "
18,"What are the natural ways to increase the blood, and the amniotic acids flow to the uterus during pregnancy?","That's the question.  What are the natural ways to increase the blood, and the amniotic acids flow to the uterus during pregnancy?  What should be the duration and intensity of the exercises (if any)?  "
19,Getting out of rewards for what kid does,"My 6-year old, 1st grade son started taking some language classes past August. This is a language we speak about 50% of the time home. These classes are pretty tough, teach reading, writing and speaking. The kid sees very little point in learning the language (especially reading and writing), as family and friends can speak to him in English. Still, he is doing pretty well in it, and I am confidant that he will move on to the next (intermediate) level.  However, to kick start the learning (back in August), I told him that he'll get a Xbox if he successfully finishes this year. My sense is that he is putting in the effort for the Xbox.   So, come June, he passes the final exam, he gets the Xbox and then what? I am wary of dangling another thing in front of him to go to the intermediate level. How do I convince him that he needs to continue learning?  As a note, this is the only instance where we offered a specific reward after one thing. Otherwise, our attitude will be, finish your work, you can watch TV/play with your friends once done - I do not know if you'd call that a reward. Of course, school has its own rewards stuff, over which we have no control. "
20,Pros and cons of C section (Cesarean) delivery?,"Are prenatal classes worth it?     +1 for mentioning the unexpected information about the c-section. No one wants to have a c-section with their first baby, but I know so many women who wound up having to have one and were so emotionally traumatized by the experience because they failed to consider the possibility beforehand. My best friend had some serious post-partum depression because of it.    This comment has received 3 upvotes.  Since I have myself chosen the C section type of delivery for my baby, I am curious to know why would this be termed ""traumatic""?  Of course this is a major surgery, but still it isn't the 1530 era where every person having a C section was bound to die.  My doctor has just told me that you'll be having a difficulty in doing heavy duty jobs for sometime but after that it'll be all fine.   What can be the reasons to be traumatized by a C section? Do I need to be wary to some side effects of any kind? "
21,How long should a 3 year old be sent to his room?,"Our son is almost 3 years old and he's been getting worse about talking back and not obeying our directions (such as ""put on your shoes"" or ""pick up your toys"").  We're thinking about implementing John Rosemond's ticket system where he gets 5 tickets per day and after he loses them all for 5 misbehaviors, he is sent to his room for the rest of his day.  The thing we're not sure about is whether is this an appropriate length punishment for an almost 3-year-old.  So my question is: Is an entire day too long for a 3-year-old to be sent to his room?  If so, what is a more appropriate length of time?  We were leaning towards starting with a 1 hour room punishment after losing 5 tickets.  And after that time is up, he gets 3 tickets back.  Subsequent loss of all tickets would result in perhaps a 2 hour timeout.  This is starting to seem a little too complicated, however.  Thoughts?  Right now he gets a 1-5 minute sit-down time-out for these types of misbehaviors, but he rarely seems to care at all.  Sometimes he even asks for a time-out in lieu of doing what he's told. "
22,"A stranger's child throws a piece of garbage onto the ground, out of sight of their parents. Should I say or do anything?","I am a male childless adult living in England.  I rarely interact with children.  Last weekend, I observed how a boy (perhaps 8 years old) threw a piece of garbage onto the ground, despite being metres away from a bin.  His parents (or at least, an adult couple who appeared to have that role) were just around the corner and did not see what happened, they appeared perhaps 5 seconds later.  In such a situation, should I do anything?  Some alternatives I could think of:   Do nothing, it is none of my business. Tell the child to pick up the garbage (clean streets are everybody's business).   Pick up the garbage myself and throw it away (it is not up to me to reprimand a stranger's child and it is not my immediate problem if he grows up throwing garbage onto the street). Pick up the garbage myself, hand it to the parents, saying I believe your child just dropped this on the ground or similar.  Might get me some strange looks. Tell the parents what just happened. Anything else?  "
23,Is it appropriate for parents to cry in front of their children?,"Sometimes a parent may be feeling sad (for whatever reason) and needs to cry.   Is it harmful, or could it even be good, to cry sometimes in front of your children? What does research say? "
24,Why do toddlers hate getting their face cleaned off with a wet washcloth and is there a better way?,"After every meal it’s a battle to wipe off my toddler’s face. He really fights it (This paints a pretty good picture). I’ve observed this to be quite common for toddlers. Is there an easier way to clean a toddler's face which is just as efficient? And why do they hate it so much?   I vaguely remember it as a child and yes it’s uncomfortable for a few seconds but I would think they would at least get accustomed to it just like they do with other uncomfortable things, like diaper changes.   "
25,Learning to propel oneself in a swing,"At what age do children generally learn to propel themselves in a swing? Is this something that they generally figure out on their own, or do parents/older siblings teach the skill? How do you teach it without personally demonstrating? (Swinging makes me dizzy, anymore.)  I can't remember how or when I learned. I do remember that I still much preferred the ""baby"" swing in preschool, but I don't know if I still needed to be pushed or not.  (My daughter is nearly 33 months old, and loves to be pushed in the swing. Incessantly. She's physically precocious and fearless, but doesn't generally follow instructions. I keep hoping anyway.) "
26,Making isolation not feel like a punishment,"My six year-old son is very extroverted, and prefers to play with someone.  My three year-old daughter is strong-willed but introverted, and prefers to play on her own.  When they play together, my son is very controlling trying to maintain my daughter's participation in his activity of choice, which inevitably leads to conflicts.  We are working on teaching him more sociable ways to play, but the bottom line is that in the mean time, playing together is very stressful on my daughter, and playing apart is very difficult for my son.  We give him several chances to make it work in the same room, but after that we usually end up making him play in his room for a while.  This gives respite to my daughter, but my son perceives it as a punishment.  To a certain degree, that's okay, since he is the instigator and the one invading his sister's space.  However, giving my daughter enough alone time makes my son's perceived punishment too harsh, but reducing the time apart to make the punishment reasonable doesn't give my daughter enough alone time.  So you can see our dilemma.  What ideas do people have for isolating an extremely extroverted child without him perceiving it as a punishment?  Put another way, how do you help an extremely extroverted child learn to enjoy playing on his own? "
27,Party games for the 4-th birthday,"We are organizing a big party for our 4-year old daughter. We rented a room, and expect 20-30 kids (most similar age) and the party is from 2pm to 5pm. What is the best way to manage the party (in terms of party games, toys, etc.), so that the kids are happy, and there are no casualties and property damage at the same time? What kind of party games would you propose for this age group?  Unfortunately there is pretty much nothing in the room, so we have to organize everything ourselves.  "
28,What would be a good kit for cardboard construction projects for a pre-teen?,I really enjoyed making things out of cardboard as a kid and my daughter (10) loves physical construction as well. Some of the things I'd like to provide her tools for :   Easily cutting cardboard    Klever Cutter (cost is about $3 ea. but I suspect they don't last long. Can't replace the blade. Skil powered cutter (downside: expensive and a bit more dangerous) Powered scissors  - Seems like the best option.  Connecting Cardboard. I'm thinking maybe brads.   What would be a good selection of materials and tools to provide my daughter that would allow her to make cardboard-based construction projects safely?  What level of supervision would be required given the materials recommended? 
29,How to plan/prepare for raising a child,"My partner and I are slowly getting ready to have a child. I think raising a child comes with great responsibility and I'd like to be well prepared.  I'd like to introduce my child to things such as a second language, music, coding etc as soon as possible.  However, I realized I don't even have the slightest idea on how to raise a baby. I've never been around babies for longer than a couple of hours.   How do I know when to feed, when to start teaching language, when to start teaching my child things in general?  How does one get to know these things? Many of the books etc seem so opinion based. Are there any good factual studies? Guides? "
30,What house rules are appropriate for pre-teens?,"As my kids grow, they need different limits. Right now, the house rules are reactionary as a result of something we didn't like happening. Things like, ""call home if you are going to be somewhere other than where you said you were going to be"" originated when my son told us he and his friend had gone to visit another friend without telling us in advance.   I would rather be proactive so that the boundaries are clear at the start. But I'm not sure what I need to have boundaries for! Be respectful and be safe need more detail.  What house rules are appropriate for pre-teens? And how did you arrive at these rules? "
31,How to ensure that necessary things get done when time is short?,"My question is based on the following assumptions:   I think that children learn by their success, if a certain behavior ""works"" to get what they want or not. In consequence: A child should never succeed getting something e. g. by screaming or a tantrum, as it otherwise has learned: ""If I'm screaming (or misbehaving) long enough, I'll finally get what I wanted.""   The problem: Often the child does not want to do what it is supposed to, maybe as it wants the freedom to decide itself what do to at what time.    This is not possible however, if there is not enough time to wait, e. g. in the morning if we have to go to nursery school to be there on time.  Recent example: Our son (3.5 years) does not want to brush his teeth and we only have some minutes left until we have to leave.    In the evening I just leave him alone in the bathroom and say ""call me if you are ready"" and some minutes later he calls me on his own to brush his teeth.    In the morning there is not enough time and if I am afraid if we just leave without brushing his teeth, he will learn that he just has to do everything slowly to avoid this unpleasing ""duty"".  A similar problem is getting ready on time: If I tell him, to put his clothes/shoes on... and he does not do it, what measures are there to motivate him to do it in time?   So how could I motivate him to support me without using force? "
32,How do my wife and I stop our son from learning to swear from us?,"My wife and I both tend to have... colorful language (for me it tends to be far worse when driving).  Our son just turned one, and is starting to become more verbal.  He's not quite at the point where he's repeating whatever we say, but it is just around the corner.  While I think that we're well equipped to explain to him what is and is not acceptable language, it will likely be a while before he is able to make that distinction.  While I generally consider profanity to be ""just words"", we'd rather avoid having issues with other parents or teachers.  What can my wife and I do to avoid our son picking up some of our more colorful vocabulary?  Slip ups will happen from time to time, at least until we can get used to the new restrictions.  How can we mitigate the damage of any lapses?  Are there any general strategies that can demonstrate proper behavior without causing confusion along the lines of ""do what we say, not what we do""? "
33,Should I be concerned about my daughter's behavior (or my wife's)? Trying to co-parent,"For reference, please see my previous question.  As a newly divorced father I have worries and I am not sure if I am making too much out of them or worrying about nothing. Getting some sleep at night would be nice as this weighs on my conscience every night.  To start, maybe not applicable to the conversion but worth noting my ex-wife does work, and has been on and off Prozac (currently back on for the last 2 years) and I have been noticing some strange behavior. Telling me something that did not happen, accusing me of not telling her stuff that did not happen, accusing me of losing or taking something my daughter had that she did not have.  Whenever I pick my daughter (now 4) up, her eyes always seem puffy like she has been crying or tired.  I see her once a month for the weekend.  I don't really notice any strangeness when she is with me, happy go lucky 4-year-old, likes to color, go to the park, go on walks, watch some TV, eat. I can tell you getting her to bed is a challenge, she is constantly up and down, drink, bathroom, more drink, story, bathroom again, before the end of the night you feel like you negotiated a peace treaty.  For the past year, every time I have to drop my daughter off, she cries as soon as we hit the street she lives on, sometimes it's just whining, sometimes crocodile tears, when I do drop her off, she will not shy away from her mother, doesn't really run to her, but is not in any sign of distress when she grabs her and carries her inside. A couple of times she has stood by car and cried and my ex had to come grab her.  The relationship between me and my ex-wife is stranded to say the least, she is constantly trying to trick me into signing stuff (sign off my rights, defaulting on the divorce, telling me she doesn't have a lawyer so I don't need one, etc.)   Based on what is given here should I be worried about anything? Not wanting this to turn into a wall of text, yes it is more a gut feeling that something is wrong, couple of things that stands out:  She doesn't want to go home and of course the crying when she has to.  When her mother does Skype with her when she is with me, my daughter does not want to talk and will run from the phone. I Skype with my daughter every Wednesday and as soon as she sees me she smiles and I try to talk to her but usually every time my daughter asks ""When are you going to come pick me up?""  I do discipline my daughter, maybe not the same way my ex-wife does or for the same things and my ex-wife tells me nothing on how when or where to do so.  I do not want to call Child Protective Services (CPS) I think that's maybe a little more drastic than what the situation calls for and I am not trying to make my relationship any worse with the ex. I am just wondering what if anything can be done? When I ask or question my ex about anything it will usually turn into a fight and gets nowhere and getting any info out of her about what she does in a given situation usually leads to ""You are the father figure it out"".  Just in case it is important, location Maryland USA. "
34,Is this diaper rash caused by starting on solids?,"My son is 5 months and just started solids last week. So far, so good, until today.   My wife just told me that she thinks our son is having a reaction to something he ate. She said that his BM had the look/consistency of peanut butter and that he has a very bad diaper rash (with some blistering). In the last 48 hours he has eaten a few bites each of Earth's Best apples (yesterday) and Earth's Best carrots (today).   Has anyone else seen something like this, with either Earth's Best brand or just with apples or carrots in general? If so, what did you do about it? "
35,"How can I make my preschool child brush his teeth, and similar mandatory tasks?","Most tasks and chores can be taught by letting the child experience consequences, because those consequences are mostly immediate and direct (e.g. not going to the playground if the child won't put on shoes). That's discussed in this question.  But some tasks are mandatory (like brushing the teeth in the morning, or other personal hygiene), but the negative consequence is neither immediate nor direct (e.g. possibly cavities after some months) and there might not be opportunity for removal of privileges before an extended separation from the parent (e.g. about to go to day care).   How do you deal with these mandatory tasks? How do you come up with suitable consequences that are both immediate and reasonably linked to the task?  "
36,"How do you gauge if a show, movie or story may be too frightening for your child?","My 2-and-a-half year old seems to be fond of shows that I would have expected to be too scary for someone his age.  He loves to watch R.L. Stine's Goosebumps (he was introduced to it at daycare by some of the older children), and gleefully watches some rather rough scenes of predation on nature shows and short youtube clips.  Not once has he ever showed signs of nightmares from watching this sort of stuff (although we try to keep viewing restricted to at least several hours before bedtime).  However, there clearly is a line for him, and he seems fully aware of it.  There have been some things we've watched where he says it is too scary, and asks to watch something different.  I'd rather not expose him to stuff that he considers too scary, even if he is good about telling me if something is too much.  Since that line between ""fun scary"" and ""too scary"" varies wildly from child to child (we have a 4 year old cousin, for example, who finds the music from Thomas and Friends too scary), how do you identify where the line is for a particular child?  Just because we haven't had problems with nightmares yet doesn't mean it can't become an issue.  I'd like to   Are there cues that can be used that don't rely on the child saying ""this is too much""?   "
37,How concerned should I be about husband's anger display around baby?,"My husband got angry at me during an argument yesterday and threw his keyboard (in shattered) and ripped down the whiteboard (may have thrown it, I don't know. We had left the room) on the wall and raged a bit more (I heard a few bangs, but doesn't appear to be more damage). I was holding my 9 month old (who screamed), but left the room and closed the door. I was a bit scared and I know my son was, but likely from reading my reaction. I calmly reassured him and played with him alone in the other room and he bounced back quickly, but it alarmed me.  Before baby, nothing like this had happened. About 6 months ago, husband threw and shattered a mug in anger during an argument, though.  I don't know how concerned I should be. Keeping my son safe is obviously my #1 priority.  I know he would not intentionally hurt either of us, but the display of rage is intimidating and frightening.  I am seeking professional help to try to help with my part of the communication problem. In this case, we had a disagreement and he started stonewalling, which is his usual. I normally can just let it go and let him cool off (sometimes takes a day or two), but yesterday, I was just tired of  like my concerns were being rug swept, and I kept on talking and  really raise my voice.  I know I need to work on my tone with him, because obviously, it triggers something for him, but I also know it is 100% his responsibility how he handles his anger when triggered. To me, throwing things seems like an unacceptable display of rage, particularly in front of the baby.  Yesterday, I was feeling triggered by his stonewalling and raised my voice. I know that was my responsibility, and when he told me to pause, I should have listened. Like I said, I am seeking therapy to learn how I can catch myself before raising my voice. I know I had a major part in the argument and it was disrespectful of me to continue talking, even when he was telling me to pause, as he clearly needed some time to cool off. And I also think raising my voice was probably inappropriate in front of the baby. But I feel like throwing stuff is over the line. I need some perspective.   In my family, we raised our voices, but never threw anything. I can't imagine that ever being acceptable in my family, and I would be ashamed to tell my family that my husband has done this and that I have stayed.  I think for him, raising voice must be a big trigger. I'll try to remember for the future. He was verbally and physically abused as a child and especially teen.  I've asked repeatedly for us to go to therapy and he refuses. I think we had some problems with communication before baby (me having a tendency to want to hash out the argument and quickly get through it, him straight up stonewalling on most disagreements), but baby has really highlighted it and made it much worse.  How concerned should I be? Now that baby is in the picture, he has often told me to shut up and called me stupid, called me a bitch Or told me to stop bitching (neither are acceptable to me, and my family would never have treated each other that way), and these two incidents of throwing things. When I talk to him calmly later about the names and the shut ups, he says it doesn't seem like a big deal to him. I haven't brought up the throwing stuff, but my guess is he will try to say it is my fault for continuing to talk/argue when he told me he wanted to stop (again, I realize I should have stopped, but I think he should have gone for a walk or something, anything, rather than fly into a scary rage like that).  I'm just concerned about our son seeing this as he grows. I was scared (I don't think he would intentionally hurt either of us, but I know plenty of people say that and end up in horrible situations...my sense is it would never be intentional, but it is intimidating...made me feel like I had no choice to shut up and get away so as not to be hurt by some random debris from his rage).   I don't want my son to grow up thinking it's ok to call names or throw things in anger. If husband won't seek help, is there any way he will get better, though?  I already am just like, well I 100% can never have an argument with him in front of our child again...which I think is unrealistic. My next thought it, well, I have to work really hard to own my way of handling the anger and work on healthy expression.  But it is like eggshells sometimes. He gets so moody, cranky and down right snappy with me about little things (not being able to tell him exactly which pocket the keys are in in the diaper bag, for example), and it feels quite disrespectful. At the same time, he seems overly concerned about me not showing him respect. As best I can tell, he interprets certain tones as disrespectful (i.e.:yesterday I was worried and he took it as being condescending, which started the argument), and seems to interpret any disagreement as disrespectful. I'm a smart woman, and if I disagree, I want to be able to tell him. I obviously need to consider my tone (it must be coming off differently than I intend), but I just feed like there are some big double standards on his part.  It's been a stressful year. Sorry for the long post. Can anyone offer any perspective/insight? Is my olnly option to end if? Am I blame shifting? He is a fantastic father otherwise and a pretty decent partner a good potion of the time. I want to believe we can work through this, but the blame-shifting, demonstration of rage and refusal to go to counseling with me have me worried. I want to do what is best for my baby.  "
38,Do babies want to be carried in order to develop their eyes?,"There have been a lot of questions on this site regarding the phenomenon of a baby needing to be not only held, but carried.  In my specific situation (7 weeks old baby), my baby wants to be held, in a stomach down position and carried around (simply holding is not enough, neither is carrying in another position).  I have read some research on the topic and have concluded the following:   When trouble is afoot and you need to get away quick a crying baby can be a liability. Hence evolution selected for babies, which keep cool, when the mother moves it from A to B. The baby is programmed in a way, that it is not enough to just hold it, you need to be moving while holding, for the instinct to kick in. This is a distinct feature. For example in cats, you only need to hold them by the scruff for the same feature to kick in.   However I think there might be another factor: Boredom. Since my baby wants to be 1) held 2) on its stomach (which gives it a good view) and 3) moving (changing scenery) boredom must be playing a factor here as well? Maybe babies, who are just developing their eyes, need to be carried in order to train their eyes?  Is there any research backing or disproving this? "
39,Putting a one year old in the crib and shutting door,"Will it hurt a one year olds development if the crib is used as a place to play with toys, turn cartoons on and shut the door as a way to keep them from under foot several times a day?  My grandbaby's daddy does this and I don't like it. I never put my babies in their crib unless ut was bedtime or naptime.  This bothers me and worries me at the same time.  Am I wrong to feel this way? "
40,5.5. month old not eating as well anymore,I have triplets and my bigger one has slowly been taking less and less and now the other two have surpassed him. His weight curve has also slowed down but nothing to be concerned about according to our pediatrician. I am bottle feeding. To put it in perspective - my other two have been eating on average 1100ml/day and this one is eating 980ml/day. This may seem like a lot but over time this is a considerably lower amount of calories.   I am just wondering if anyone else had a superstar eater turn into a ho-hum eater? Any suggestions? Thanks 
41,What are baby scissors for?,"We recently bought baby scissors (like shown here) and hoped to use it for cutting fingernails. These are not good for that. However, their name is not baby nail scissors so we should not expect them to be good for that purpose.  What are baby scissors good for?

Includes protective cover for save and tidy storage. To clean, we recommend a clean, damp cloth. Do not clean in dishwasher. ..."" "
42,Are fidgets an effective tool for helping ADHD children focus?,"Fidgets are small toys or gadgets that can be twiddled, poked, and/or clicked. The idea was explained to me as giving fingers something to do that doesn't take much brain power, allowing an ADHD child to concentrate better by channeling their distraction into the fidget so they can listen to the teacher better.  My son is nine years old, in the 4th grade. I would like to explore this option in his 504 plan with the school, but first want to know it's going to actually be a concrete benefit, and make sure I'm exploring the right sorts of fidgets.  Is there scientific research that supports the utility of fidgets? Are some ADHD children more likely to benefit than others -- e.g., would a primarily-inattentive student be more or less helped by a fidget than a primarily-hyperactive student? "
43,Is that wrong to shake a bottle with baby formula milk?,"I've been told that when preparing a baby milk out of a powder it's important not to shake the bottle, but use gentle stirring to dissolve the formula.

Personally I can't understand why bubbles would stay for longer than a couple of minutes inside of a liquid. Am I wrong? "
44,"Questions about ""Peaceful Parent, Happy Kids""","I just heard about Peaceful Parent, Happy Kids by Dr. Laura Markham (on this site) and I started looking into it. I really like some of the things I've read about this approach to parenting, but I have some questions:   Does Dr. Markham actually recommend rewarding misbehavior? I can't find it now, but I read a customer review on Amazon that said something to the effect of ""My life is so much better now. When my son hits my daughter, I just hug him and tell him I love him."" I don't see how this could possibly reduce misbehavior. If anything, basic psychology says you can expect the misbehavior to increase. Does Dr. Markham really say you should turn behavior problems into games?     In one example, a child wants the parent to move from a particular spot on the couch and the parent is supposed to make fun and games with the child... but not move from the spot... Another example is about spitting, instead of consequences for spitting in the house the solution was to take the child outside to make a game of spitting out there. (source)   This seems impractical to me. I barely have the energy to get my kid a drink, let alone take him outside for spitting contest. Also, I think this could lead to problems at school where it's just not possible to make games out of everything, or when I'm in the middle of something and can't.   I'm not necessarily looking for a product review, but I'm wondering about the approach itself. "
45,Convincing 18-month baby to sleep in the morning - using a training clock?,"Our 18 month old son goes through phases of waking up early (between 4:30 am and 6 am) and sleeping to a decent time e.g. 6:30-6:45. So his early waking doesn't seem to be due to hunger, and he is not particularly happy that he woke up... but somehow cannot settle himself to sleep. He shares a room with his older sister, and falls asleep by himself in the evening. Any drastic measures as ""leave him to cry""... are not easy to implement for us, as this hauling would also wake her up :( and result in 2 grumpy kids. Has anyone used the toddler training clock in a similar case? I've read some opinions ranging from: ""it's so bright that my kids are awake from it"" to ""great tool"". Is an 18-month old too young to get the clock concept? Any tips on how to introduce it to him? Any other tips? THANKS!   "
46,Why would a 15-year-old just stop talking. Like 'Selective Mutism'?,My 15-year-old daughter just stopped talking and I have no clue why. She won't talk to anybody. She has gone to her principal about the situation. Her principal has given her permission to write her answers on a piece of paper in order to talk to her teachers. She will type her answers on her phone and text me her answer!   This breaks my heart not knowing what I can do to help her. It started 11/18/2014. She had just found out that her best friend was switching from her school to another. Even though she was still living in the same house it was truly killing my daughter. She keeps crying herself to sleep. Could this be over this and that she's depressed and doesn't want to talk to anybody but her friend or what? I honestly don't know what to do about this. Can somebody please tell what to do about this? 
47,What should parents consider when selecting a pacifier?,There are a wide variety of pacifier styles and many boast claims of being more like the breast or more natural. What criteria should parents use in selecting a pacifier? Should it be based solely on finding the one that a child will accept?   
48,Can temper tantrums indicate a behavior problem?,"I understand that temper tantrums are relatively normal for many children.  However, some children seem to have far more temper tantrums than other children their age, and others far fewer.  Can temper tantrums be indicative of problems that should be addressed?  If so, how do you tell the difference between ""normal"" temper tantrums and ones that indicate a problem? "
49,Why don't my twins sleep for a longer stretch of time?,"My twins are 4 1/2 months old. They are exclusively breastfed. We start our bedtime routine at 8: we take a bath, breastfeed, then rock to sleep. By 10 they will be asleep. However, each 2-3 hrs they will wake up to breastfeed. They never slept for more than that.  Is this normal? Aren't they supposed to sleep for a stretch of 5-6 hours yet?  "
50,Child worse than tattling she lies,"Anyone have any thoughts on this?  I observed Bella - 6 years old. Playing with children. This was all in the time frame of 30 minutes.   Sophia accidentally brushes her lightly on the arm. She said loudly, Sophia hit me.  While Bella was coloring 12 month old baby gently with flat palm of hand touched her hair. She again loudly said, Evie pulled my hair.  Then the kids were playing tag, when she got tagged she yelled, Tony is hitting me.    My step daughter (has two kids of her own) is engaged to Bella's father and I am concerned as if she is like this at 6 what other lies is she going to tell when she is 14. They say she does this all the time (school/home) - it is a problem but stumped as what to do. Apparently, her mother is like this too. Poor thing, no one in the family wants to play with her now (we have a lot of grand-kids). Who can blame them? She is lying and trying to get kids in trouble when they have done nothing. I see red flags. Her dad says she has always been like this.  "
51,When do you start increasing the amount of solids?,"My 6 month old has a breastfeed in the morning then a break and has rice cereal.  Most of the time she will have 2 tablespoons and finish this.  I give her a different food at lunch time after the breastfeed.  She doesn't see to be interested.  She has had 1.5 teaspoons of sweet potato and avocado.  She doesn't like fruit and other vegetables.  I try each new food for 3 days as recommended.  When can I be offering her a solid food for dinner? How much food can you offer a baby at one meal? Should I persist for a longer period of time with the one food?  All the foods I have tried have been cooked and pureed, except banana and avocado.  All the foods have been given as a single food, that is not mixed with another food.  Foods given are sweet potato, broccoli, pumpkin, pear, apple, avocado and carrot. "
52,What are the pros and cons of using a nanny-cam?,"We are seriously thinking of hiring a nanny, as my wife wishes to hold on to her job in these tough times. I have seen what are called, ""nanny-cams"", that help us monitor the nanny at home. A video on a website, showing nanny mishandling the kids, is enough to instill fear in me to worry about the decision of hiring a nanny.  That apart, I wonder if has anyone tried these surveillance cameras. More questions follow me, a resident of Michigan: Could such a 'hidden-camera' it be termed illegal, and could it lead to lawsuits, etc.? Should the presence of a camera be disclosed to the nanny (employer-employee contract)?   Would greatly appreciate any help, information on this topic.  EDIT  Now that my daughter is seven years old, wanted to share. I was not sure if I should answer my own question, so editing it in.  I did install cameras, and seriously recommend it. I told and showed the nannies the cameras before I hired them. Note that it is legal to record, even without telling the nannies, in all fifty states (as long as it is not private areas like a bathrooms). Though there was no abuse, I caught a few things: neglecting my daughter while they talked on phone, putting her in a pen and watching TV, handling her food in unhygienic ways, etc., It helps a great deal to know, and hence fix.

53,How to talk to my 4.5-year-old daughter about death?,"My 95-year-old grandmother is about to pass away and I want to prepare my 4.5-year-old daughter who was supposed to visit her soon. Even though she lives far away, my daughter has visited her several time (about 3 times per year) but I assume it's a different conversation if she sees her every day. My concern is that I don't want to scare her or freak her about about death in general.  What is the appropriate conversation to have if any? Should I not mention the word ""death"", should I explain it in abstract terms. How do you tell a 4.5-year-old kid about the death of her great grandma? "
54,How to deal with an 11-month-old child crying during/after eating?,"My 11-month-old son has so far always been a good eater, although he has often had a habit of crying when his milk was finished, or at the end of meals. This has generally been ok to deal with.  However recently in the last few days he has been having a sudden full meltdown mid food, with angry crying and throwing himself around in his chair (worse than his typical end of meal crying, which is a lot more manageable). It's generally been food that he likes (and he may resume eating it once calmed down) - Is this probably down to teething, or could it be related to anything else? (it's noticeable that he doesn't seem to do this when eating yoghurt - which is one of his favourite foods).  He only has milk at start of the day (and occasionally on evenings) - he has rarely got upset mid bottle (not recently). He has got angry with similar consistency to yoghurt foods (such as mashed potatoes). He has only 7 teeth so we try not to give him anything that requires too much chewing.  Have other people experienced this and do you have any advice for dealing with this issue? It's happened 3 days in a row now. The other point to note is that we were away visiting relatives on the weekend, and he's been doing this since we have come back, could this also be related to the issue?  Update Edit:   I think it was teething, it did seem to go away again.   I found if he kicked off too badly, I would take him out of his chair and calm him down, then once calm again, he would go back to eating if he still was hungry.    "
55,Giving the baby away in New Jersey?,"I am a pregnant woman: if my baby is proven mentally retarded, what's the procedure I should take to give my baby away to the state foster care?

I understand I will never be capable of raising a mentally retarded baby myself.   I live in New Jersey. "
56,How to address hemming and hawing?,"Our six year old son has difficulty paying attention, so we often quiz him afterward about things he was supposed to be paying attention to.  He has started hemming and hawing for a long time (like a minute or more), when he doesn't know the answer.  We didn't notice at first because subconsciously it makes us want to give hints or even supply the answer.  We think it is a sort of defense mechanism, and the frequency with which he uses it suggests he also uses it at school, which makes us worry he is not learning as much as he should be.  So how long is it normal to hem and haw at his age?  How can we differentiate between when he is honestly thinking or just stalling?  What are some good strategies to address it? "
57,What can help my son overcome his fear of ghosts and demons?,"My son is afraid of ghosts and demons no matter how much I try to convince him that there's nothing to be afraid of. I read the questions and answers about fear of ghosts, so I thought that as movies help to scare them, what about movies helping them lose their fears?   What are some common things that can be done to help children adress their fear of ghosts and demons? "
58,"Is ""hot saucing"" bad parenting?","""Hot saucing"", a technique where a small quantity of hot sauce is introduced a kid's mouth as disciplinary action, is considered bad parenting.  Though I have not done hot saucing (possibly because my nine year old loves spicy food) I have used a similar technique as a form of control. Call me a prude, or over the hill, but the first time my son swore (he was four then), I washed his tongue with soap. Done once, it has been effective so far. He associates bad words to disgusting taste in his mouth. I think it works a subconscious level.  Has anyone else tried similar ideas? Were they effective? I understand that one technique cannot solve all problems, but what are the major pitfalls of such techniques? "
59,"Is it okay to restart breastfeeding after a delay, and continue until after a child is 2 years old?","Around six months ago, we stopped breastfeeding my first child  after my wife and I found out that my wife was 3 months pregnant.   In about 1 month my wife will give birth to our second child. At that time, my first child will be 20 months old.   We are planning to start to give breast milk to him again, because we still have 4 months to go until he is 24 months old. Is that ok? And also is it ok if we plan to breastfeed him for longer than 4 months? It means my first child will still be breastfed after he is older than 24 months old. "
60,Should we get her a doll?,"Winter is coming, and with it, Christmas and presents.  We have a 3 years old daughter, who has an almost 2 months old sister, and it's time thinking about which toys to get her (we have almost full control, since we have to choose for presents from grandparents as well).  In particular, we are wondering about the benefits of dolls.  Currently she has neither dolls nor tea parties (she has tons of cuddly toys though).  When she wants to play tea parties, either she gets actual dishes or she uses objects or toys which look like dishes (or not…).  As for dolls, yesterday she took a jar of pickles, named it as her newborn sister, and used toilet paper to dress it.  It seems like not having a doll or tea parties would help developing imagination.  On the other hand, we can see she tries to identify as her mother and she'd probably like to have a doll which she could dress and play parent with.  So, I'm wondering about the implications of realistic toys versus ""hijacked toys"".  What would be the benefits of having a doll against having her making a doll of whatever she can find ?  Should we get her one ?  I'm wondering about the implications of realistic toys versus ""hijacked toys"".**  Side notes :  I won't buy her a doll just because she's a girl, because I don't want to enforce gender stereotypes.  I'll buy her one if I think it's beneficial to her mind.  But gender stereotypes are not the point of my question.  Answers addressing primarily this issue are off-topic.  In addition, she goes to school, but currently she doesn't have much out of school interactions with other children so we're not much concerned about her being jealous of other children toys. "
61,Why would my 9-week-old refuse to nurse from breast?,"My 9-week-old has recently started to refuse to nurse from the breast. She will only eat from the bottle (pumped breastmilk).   She has successfully breastfed since birth, she also uses the bottle rarely, just on the occasions when her mother is away.  The breast is not too full for her to latch on. She drinks the milk perfectly fine from a heated bottle.   When we try to put her to the breast, she moves her head away and cries and won't latch on at all. But then, she will accept breastmilk from the bottle with no problem at all.   What can the problem be? And how do we get her to nurse from the breast again when she refuses? "
62,How will a child learn to express themselves in the absence of verbal communication?,"I'm curious to understand - if you don't teach a child how to speak then will the child develop a new language to express itself?  When a newborn is brought into the family everyone wants to look at it, talk to it, play with it, etc. The child learns by constantly observing, processing and reacting, and children have a very adaptable mind. Unlike adults they pick up things faster because their minds aren't subject to inertia.  So if you play with a child, smile, laugh and take care of it well, but never talk to it then how will it learn to express itself? I know that talking to a child is very important - mothers talk to their children to make them feel safe, and sing lullabies to make them fall asleep. Nevertheless, assuming that everything else remains the same what will the child learn in the absence of verbal communication? "
63,How can we get some free time (on daily basis)?,"I'm a working dad of a 3 m/o boy. My wife is on a leave and she will be a 'full time mom' for several more months. The newborn changed our lives to an extent that we don't have free time, at all (yeah, that must be a news for all of you in 'already parents' category, right?). Our baby boy needs/wants constant care and physical contact, even while sleeping (otherwise he'll wake up screaming, demanding another round of 'rocking'). When I get back from work I start taking care of him while my wife starts doing chores. Most of the time we have to take shifts to eat or go to the bathroom. At the point I managed to put him to sleep, my wife is already sleeping, I'm near the melt down point and have no more energies to do anything else. If I have some fuel left in me, well, than I have to do my part of chores.  To sum it up, at the end of the day, we feel exausted, miserable and grumpy. In our previous life we had a lot of free time for our hobbies/passions and it's so hard not to 'blame' the kid for it.   Notes:   Grandparents or a nanny are not a viable option.   I said 'blame' just to express the feeling of weariness, we wanted to have a baby and we're doing our best to take care of its needs and putting all our love and energy into it.  The baby is healthy, it just doesn't sleep more than 12h/day (and at night sleeps max 3h before waking up to get breastfed)   Can you suggest some ways to carve out some free time for ourselves during the day (I'm not looking for a full day solution - sure, I can take a day off but it's not a 'long term' solution)? "
64,How can I supplement my Pre-K child's education?,"My 4 year old is in Pre-K. She is the youngest in her grade too.  I have consistently had preschool and Sunday school teachers tell me for the past 2 years how mature she is in class. She shows other signs of intellectual maturity or ""giftedness"" such as awareness, memory, and attention to detail.   She also gets bored very easily, asks for me to give her homework, and asks to go to school more.   Is this a phase most Pre-K kids go through? Since she can't start Kindergarten until next year what kind of things can I do to give her more education that she seems to be craving? Likewise, what kind of schooling should I be looking into for her to excel once she is in school?  Both her father and I are tested/considered ""highly intelligent"", so it is probable that she may also be. Therefore  we want to be sure we are educating her adequately. "
65,How can my toddler learn to stay under the blanket at night?,"My 2yo son slept in a sleeping bag (see image below) until around 1½ years old, then he didn't like that anymore so we switched to using a blanket. He moves around so much while sleeping that the blanket usually isn't covering him at all. This hasn't been a problem so far during summer, but now the cold season is coming and we think he'll get too cold at night. He's already rather cold in the mornings -- with cold hands and cold feet -- so the current mode of operation won't do.  We're not tucking him in ""English style"" with the blanket going under the mattress, but average ""European style"" where it's just draped over him. He's very active and dislikes being restrained, so ""English style"" is not an option.  I've learned to stay underneath my blanket during sleep, but I have no recollection how I learned it -- can we somehow ""teach"" him, or does it only come naturally with age? How can we keep him under the blanket?   What we're already trying:   We are re-covering him several times during the evening until we go to bed ourselves, and sometimes again during the night if we're up for any reason.  We are dressing him in warmer pajamas and socks to keep him from getting cold at night, but we can't comfortably dress him warm enough in winter. If we dress him warmly (so that he wouldn't become too cold without the blanket) then the blanket makes him too warm and he wakes in a sweat, so we avoid that. We are trying to find a sleeping bag that fits his current size (92cm) but seem to be rare in these sizes; apparently they're only popular for infants but not so for toddlers. Even if we find one, there's a risk that he'll reject it, just like he ended up doing half a year ago.    "
66,Why use rice cereal as a first food?,"Searches have come up with when and which one, but no why. Why is it recommended or common to feed infants rice cereal as their first food? Why would we feed our daughter a processed food over a natural alternative? "
67,How long do children normally read without comprehending?,"My son is six years old, nearly finished with his first year of school.  He reads pretty well, on par with his age I believe.  What concerns me is he has difficulty answering basic questions about a sentence immediately after he reads it.  For example, ""On his bed was a cuddly teddy bear.""  If I ask what was on his bed, he can't answer without re-reading it, then he answers in his halting reading voice, even though he knows perfectly well what a teddy bear is.  It's like he reads the words without connecting them to the real world objects.  Is that normal for a child just finishing his first year of school?  If so, when should I expect him to start comprehending what he reads?  Is there anything I can do to help? "
68,"How do I get my child to eat healthier, better and more varied?","I have a ten-year old child and it's about that time in their lives when she is constantly getting invited to stay over at other friends' houses either for the weekend or a night. To be honest, as a single dad, this can be a huge relief and allows me to get some work done over the weekend, so I am generally OK with her staying over at her friends'.  However, there's a problem: she is a very picky eater. She doesn't eat vegetables and a lot of other stuff people generally eat (no sauces, no soups, nothing with a particular strong smell). This results in a lot of anxiety for her and for me. She is ashamed to admit she ""doesn't like stuff"" for the fear of seeming spoilt (which she is to an extent, I raised her on my own and cater to her every desire). I don't like her to feel this way.  So, what should I do? Should I talk to her friends' parents and tell them to brace themselves to host a particularly picky eater? Should I force diversity into her weekly diet so she gets used to variety? Should I talk to her friends? "
69,How do I persuade my 4 year old daughter that School is Cool?,"As a kid, I used to like School more than anything else. Perhaps, because I came from a broken home and school is the only place where I have friends and people listen to me.  Now that I've a daughter, I want to be there for her and perhaps in that endeavor, I might have given her more than I should have - time, toys, games and attention.  She have been going to pre-school (play-school) for the last 2 years but she hates school. She would rather be at home, playing around with me or her mother and be happy on her own in her room with her made-up friends, animals, toys, dolls.  Her new school is starting next month but every-time we mention about the new bigger school, about meeting new friends, she hates it and is fighting back against the very of a school.  What are my options? Should I make our home boring?  I've reduced her toys, hidden some of them and have stopped buying her new toys and games for her iPad.  How should I help her to let her know that School is indeed a super cool place to be.  UPDATE/EDIT:  All the answers and suggestions were good. There isn't a specific answer per se and so I'm skeptical marking anyone as the 'correct' answer.  My daughter is 6+ months into her new school and she is enjoying herself very much. Lots of friends, sports days are fun, likes her choral recitation sessions and the colorful days where she gets to dress in specific colors (in India, almost all schools wear uniform). She even likes the bus ride home even though, according to her, it's a bit long and makes her sleepy all the time.  Thanks everyone. "
70,Should I cancel child support?,"I'm the father of an 11-year-old boy. I've had custody since he was ~1 1/2. His mom does not have her life together and probably never will. I was a single father at the time but have since remarried. His mother has been paying support (albeit about 30% of the court recommended amount) since then, but has been unemployed for over a year now, and her unemployment has now ran out. She's asking me to cancel the support order and forgive arrears for the past 2 months so she doesn't go to jail.  My initial reaction is that it's her problem, not mine. She is a constant source of stress in our lives, and the life of my wife of the past 4 years: frequently being selfish and causing all sorts of problems. I would not consider her a good influence in his life at all, but she is his mother. I can live without the money; it wasn't that much anyhow, but every bit counts.   I feel like this would be awful for my son though, and I can only imagine that she'll make it clear to him that she got in trouble not because of any fault of her own, but because I refused to cancel the court order.   What are my options here? Should I insist she give up legal rights if I cancel it, so I can at least have a silver lining of not being legally required to deal with her more problematic outbursts? Should I just leave support in place and let her deal with her own mess?  "
71,"Games mentioned in ""Baby Talk"" by Sally Ward","I am reading ""Baby Talk"" by Sally Ward, and she mentions a number of games you can play with babies that I'm unfamiliar with.   Have you heard of these? How do you play them?   Clap hands Hidey peep (not peekaboo) Patacake (is that just the pattycake rhyme? Can a 9 month old really play it?)   She also mentions that there are actions to row row row your boat, but I only ever remember singing it.  I feel silly having to ask! "
72,Breaking 5 year olds tantrums,"My 5 year old son has recently got into the habit of getting into these incredibly annoying tantrums. They start when he doesn't get his way and can often rumble on over a couple of hours. They usually peak at bedtime.  When it occurs he doesn't do anything. He lays on the floor and says ""nothing"" when you ask him to do something. After a while mixes this up with raspberry-blowing spitting and saying the word ""poo"".  I start off being over nice, attempting to coax him out of his tantrum. I make some jokes to try to get him to smile. I offer to help him do things. Ask if he wants to pick a bedtime story etc.  This practically never works.  I then get frustrated and shout. This usually lasts about 10 seconds. He cries and says he doesn't like me.  I become calm again but I have a child who won't go to bed. At this point I put him to bed. I pull him up. I then hold his hand and steer (encouragingly pull) him towards the bathroom, I ask him to do everything that is expected off him. He doesn't. I sit him on the toilet. I wash his hands. I gently edge him towards his bedroom and get him into his pyjamas while he continues to say ""nothing"".  During this process he protests a little bit but I am not aggressive. He isn't being dragged along the floor. He doesn't like it but does reluctantly comply. He does edge a foot up about 3cm from the floor so I can slide on his pj's etc.  I hate doing this final step. It isn't right but if I don't, if I leave him outside his room he will sit there and start saying words he knows he is not allowed to say. We once left him for 45 minutes and he laid there contently running through the list of things he is not allowed to do.  What am I supposed to do? We have taken away his treats the next day but doesn't seem to do anything.  Has anyone else dealt with this behaviour? Does anyone have any advice? Just want to add. 70% of the time he is well behaved. 25% of the time he is a bit silly. This is like 5% of the time where he seems to get into the mindset where he doesn't want to comply with anything and wants to try to press to buttons. "
73,How can I convince my parents to accept my approach on school?,"I'm a 16 year-old junior in high school. I often spar with my parents over the fact that I'm failing many classes. The issue, however, is not that I do not understand the material; it's that ""failing"" is simply my approach to passing.  I tend to get high 70s to low 90s in the first quarter of each semester without having to study, pay attention in class, or even do the work. Then, in the second quarter (which usually comes with more ""difficult"" work), I can exert about the same level of effort and pass the class.  For example, in class #1, I earned a 77 in the first quarter. Therefore, I only need to earn a 63 in the second quarter to pass.  77 + 63 = 140 140 / 2 = 70   Often, I sit in class programming on my laptop while listening to music. When this is not an option (because of a strict teacher, etc.), I generally write down math problems to solve, or zone out.    I'm a fairly knowledgeable guy, IMHO, and I know most of the things that my high school teachers (public school) are teaching. My standardized test scores have always been pretty good for my age (for example, I took the ACT at age 12, and got a 26). I may or may not go to college (I want to be a computer programmer), but if I do decide I want to, I will apply for scholarships that are based solely on ACT scores (planning to take it this spring).    My parents have different goals for me. They feel that I should have a 90 or above in every class (they've lightened up from 95 to 90), and to get a full ride to college. They constantly push for me to do more than expected (often bribing me, or threatening to take away my things if I don't comply).  I've had a discussion with them before about possibly not attending college and instead going straight to the work force, and they seemed quite disappointed. They said many things like: ""it's so sad that you think that"", and other demeaning things along those lines.    I'm not trying to spill my whole education history online, but I thought some background information might be helpful.  My real question is: How can I get my parents to accept that I'm only trying to pass (that I will, in fact, pass), and that I'd like to spend my time doing harder/better things?  They often tell me that I'm smart, but they are constantly pushing me to get better grades, or get onto me for having sub-par grades (by their definition). This trend has occurred throughout my life, even when I was younger when they would require I read x number of chapters or for x number of hours to earn time on a computer or watching TV.  I'll be 17 soon, and I believe I'm being treated like a young child. How can I get them to treat me like the age I am? Also, I feel like they rarely hear me out when I disagree with their way of thinking. How can I even start this conversation without them immediately shutting it down?    Note: As I type, they are arguing with me over schoolwork I haven't done. "
74,4-year old unconcerned about pending death of pet,"We learned recently from the vet that our dog has cancer and probably only has a few months left (he's old, don't feel too bad).  My 4-year old daughter reacted to this by saying ""good, this means I'll get all the attention"" (as in, once the dog has gone)  She is an only child and is in no way starved of attention and if anything the dog gets very little. I'm not sure if she's joking here, but my wife is a little concerned. Is this a normal reaction? Something to be concerned about? "
75,"In what way does reading story books to babies help them (besides falling sleep), and at what age should it be started?","There is a cultural difference.   Where I come from there is no concept of reading story books as a bed time ritual to babies. Though I do remember my father telling me mythological stories in order to divert my attention from food so that I could forget about the tastelessness (IMO) of the food and eat it quickly.  I would like to know that besides making the baby sleep and eat properly, are there any other long term benefits in reading story books to babies?  At what age should the process be started? "
76,How to make my 8-year-old son repay for a broken item?,"My eight-year-old son mistreated an iPad and broke a screen protector. It was an accident but very easily preventable. Had the impact been much worse, it would have been ruined.  The way I was raised - and still much believe - is that the relatively small cash value (a bit under $10) is much less important than the mistreatment. This is especially true when it isn't his iPad.   Should the cost of replacing said protector come from allowance for general chores or have its own dedicated (and preferably unliked) payment, such as cleaning the bathroom a few times? Should it be handled another way entirely? "
77,Why is a 7 year old always suggesting catastrophic outcomes?,"What's a good way to deter ""worst case"" questions? My son loves to pipe up with oddball rebuttals. Some recent examples...     me: We'll be getting to Grandma's in about five minutes, yay!   son: What if the car blows up?   On a field trip:     air force pilot: Our parachutes are designed with inflatable straps, so if I land in the water I won't drown!   son: What if a shark attacks you?   While cooking dinner:     me: Please set the table, food will be ready soon.   son: What if the stove catches fire and the house burns down?   Pretty much every event, whether mundane everyday events or cool things like learning about parachutes (he loved that field trip, which is what really confused me when he piped up with that borderline-rude question), is met with some sort of catastrophe theory. It's difficult to carry on a normal conversation sometimes, and while I often manage to calmly point out the low risk of random house fires and car explosions, I also find it frustrating and don't always respond politely. "
78,Can an infant choke on spit-up?,"I have a 5 week old daughter. She spits up after feeding sometimes (especially if she feeds too much in one sitting). We have been worried about her choking on the spit-up. Especially in the night while we are sleeping.   We have been trying to minimize the spit up by feeding her less in one sitting and keeping her upright after feeding for half an hour, and she sleeps on a slight incline on her back, and watching her for a while after she's asleep to make sure she's OK, but we are really exhausted too. Do we need to worry about her choking so much? What if she spits up while we are sleeping? "
79,Both parents are exhausted from 6.5 month old child waking up every hour at night,"Our 6.5 month old used to sleep well; put up/put down. She'd fall asleep on her own at around 8pm only to wake up once for feeding. She would then wake up around 5:30am to then be held to sleep till 7:00am (the last part I don't know why).  2 weeks ago, she started waking up every 40 minutes to 1 hour throughout the night. She would cry fairly hard as soon as she woke up and the cry would escalate very loudly if she was not tended to within 30 seconds. As soon as she's picked up, she falls right back to sleep and you have to hold for at least 3 to 5 minutes before putting her down. Even then, she would wake up again in 10 minutes.  As you can see, this makes sleep impossible for both working parents. We now have splitting headaches during the day and I'm afraid we will lose our minds soon.  My kid is very happy during the day and never cries during day time nap either. She only becomes difficult at night.  The thing is, we put her to bed at the same routine as before. She falls asleep on her own at 8pm every night.   What's wrong? Is there light at the end of tunnel? Please tell me this won't go on until she's 1 year old or even longer. "
80,How to react to an eleven-year-old sneaking out at night to look at the stars?,"During the holidays, two kids from two families that we are friends with snuck out at night to look at the stars. The mother of one twelve year old boy reacted with an outburst of anger and severely berated her son, while the parents of the eleven year old were mostly amused but tried to explain possible dangers and asked their son to not go out on his own again.  The different reactions made me wonder how I would have wanted to react in their stead and what would be the most appropriate answer to such an excursion.  The boys didn't do anything ""wrong"", that is, they didn't steal, destroy, or take drugs. They just wanted to see the night sky (and some falling stars), and did that alone when their parents weren't too enthusiastic about a night without sleep (they have younger children who don't yet sleep through and value a good night's sleep highly). But of course getting out at night might be dangerous for kids of that age (although I cannot quite imagine them getting mugged or abducted).  So what is the right way to react to that?  Is it appropriate for children that age to be that independent? Or should the understand that they at least have to tell their parents first? And what is the best way to tell them? On the one hand I feel that the anger of the one mother would certainly instill a feeling of not doing something like that again in her son, while the bemused and relaxed explanation of the other parents might show their son that he can basically do whatever he wants and his parents will be okay with it. "
81,I'm getting distant from my father,"I'm 25 years old, my parents got divorced when I was 22 years old. I've been staying with my mother since. My father has moved out and lives quite far from me, so occasionally about once every 2 weeks I'd see my father and maybe spend a Saturday or the weekend with him.  Before my parents got divorced, I got along well with my father and we had good times, but I was never really THAT close to him. Now since my parent's divorce, I feel I have drifted away from my father even more.  Whenever he calls me up, I don't really have anything to say to him. He just asks me how is my day, how is things going, how is my work and stuff like that. But I feel there's nothing much to talk about, and whenever I see him once about once every 2 weeks, there is really nothing to do or talk to him about. Furthermore, he is quite an dominating person (not dominating in a violent way but he acts like he is the head of the family, making decisions what to do), and I feel I'm already 25 years old and I have my own life, so sometimes when I see him once every 2 weeks, he tells me things like ""hey lets go for a movie then go for lunch"". But the problem is I feel I'm already an adult and I have my own plans.  I still love both my father (and mother) and I don't want to offend them in anyway, but sometimes I feel its unnecessary for my father to call me up few times a week and to make a huge effort to spend time with me, one reason being I'm already 25 years old. How do I deal with this whole problem? Is it normal to drift away from my father since he moved out and I don't see him often? "
82,How to read an English story book to the kid when we don't talk in English at home?,I am not a native English speaker nor is the country I live in. However since English is given a higher preference here over the native language I would like my kid to learn English from an early age.  English teaching starts here from playschools.  We do not talk in English at home. I wondering how should I treat the English storybooks which I am supposed to read to him?  Should I read them in English loud only? OR Should I read them in English loud first and then translate them in Hindi sentence by sentence explaining the meaning of each word? Will that not be terribly boring for him? OR Should the English story books be considered only at the age when he is big enough to understand and read the words?  The child isn't born yet. What process w.r.t the problem in the question should be followed at what age? 
83,Hard and painful stool in infant - is this normal?,"On several different occasions my daughter (7mnths-12mnths) was trying to poop, but then she would start crying like she was in pain.  When I checked her diaper she had a big hard fat poop coming out, but it seemed stuck. I've had to actually help her push it out.   Is that normal?  What can I do to help her feel less uncomfortable? "
84,An incident happened at school and child didn't (want to) tell the parent,"I'm asking for a friend of mine, who's the parent. Her child is 12 years old.  Yesterday, at school, the child's classmate was horribly beaten up by a teacher. And I mean horrible. It ended with the teacher banging the child's head to the wall (allegedly on purpose), and pushing him out of the class so hard he fell on the floor. Parents are suing everyone they can, but that's not relevant to my question.  The whole school community was abuzz with this news, and everybody knew of the incident by that evening. All except my friend, that is. Her daughter didn't say a word to her parents, even though they asked her how school was, like they always do. She was sullen though, but at the time, it didn't seem suspicious. Later that night, my friend learned about the whole thing directly from the victim child's mother, and was rightfully shocked. That something like this happened, and more so that her daughter witnessed all this and never said a word.  Now how my friend handled that with her daughter is not really ideal. She demanded to know why she had been kept in the dark about all this, and how she was embarrassed that she was clueless when the parent talked to her. She probably thought this was under the umbrella problem of her daughter just not talking to her a lot these days. Her daughter just kept quiet and said ""well, [my friend] didn't want to tell her parents either&hellip;"" Now that my friend has had the time to reflect, and talk it out with me, she feels that may be it was too traumatic for her daughter to repeat or re-live, and that's why she didn't say anything.  My questions are:   Is it the fear of re-living the trauma that kept the child quiet? Something else? How can my friend ask her daughter, and get her to talk about this? Should she even try to get her to talk about it? My friend obviously did not react well when she found out about the incident. How should she make up for it to her daughter?   Some updates based on the responses here:   The mother wanted her daughter to tell her about this because   As a parent, she wants to be in the loop when something major and especially disturbing like this happens at school. This has the potential to affect her daughter directly or indirectly. and She's worried the victim's mom may have felt that she and her daughter don't care enough for her son to discuss what happened to him. (I don't really get this part myself. But the two moms are close-ish, so figure what you will.) It was not about missing out on gossip. and possibly Other children told their parents, why didn't her daughter tell her?  The daughter is most definitely not frightened of her mom. There may be a disconnect between them though. The mom does over-react a bit at times. The daughter is not afraid of the teacher who lashed out; nobody is. He is an erratic guy, who lost control with a student and got himself fired and sued. He's not a malevolent authority figure to be afraid of.  "
85,How to help my 18-year-old who may be the victim of bullying?,"My 18-year-old son is in high school and near graduating; like 40 days from now he will graduate. He is so smart and into business and science and gets top grades so I am thankful. He is so respectful to me and his mother and to all the elders. Before this, my son was in a different country, so he had a different culture and way of making friends; now it is different and he just doesn't like the type of people here.   Two months ago, he found a group of friends and he's been hanging around with them now, he went out with them like six times now and stopped all of the sudden, when we asked him he said that ""I don't like the type of people here"". They weren't really his friends, they just let him sit with them talk to him about school and that's it. They don't go out or anything like that. He is not depressed or sad, he just likes to be alone. I know that that's normal to be alone. Heck I like to be alone sometimes, just so I can gather myself.  Now, two weeks ago he started complaining about this kid who has a mental disability. That kid just goes around the school and keeps swearing at everyone, but for some reason he found that my son gets angry real quick and so he just started to push the limits until my son hit him, the school were so shocked of my son's actions that they forgave him because they know that he is good.  After he hit him, he regretted it. Yet, that boy still keeps coming back and just saying the same mean things. My son came to me today and was just so angry because that boy called his mother a bad word. He said ""He can say anything at me and I won't get mad, but not at my family""  We keep telling him to ignore him, and that he will just go away, but I think that he is displaying his anger which is what the boy wants out of him so he just pushes. I think it's his new friends that are bringing him trouble because he tried to say that once but didn't finish what he was saying.  What should I or we do as parents? Is it right that he should just ignore him because there is only 40 days until graduation? "
86,From what age should I expect the child to pick up her toys which she scattered while playing?,At what age should this be started?   How to go about it such that the child doesn't feel bored? 
87,What light colors will help calming down before bedtime?,"I just bought a color led strip (like similar to this one) and installed it so that the ceiling can be lit with any color.  We're making experiments on which color would have better effects on calming down my little lady. Some sites like this just recommend to use soft lights but doesn't specify what colors: yellowish? very dim purple?  Does anyone here have experiences about relaxing colors, or have used soft lights in the bedroom to help the child falling asleep? "
88,Assertiveness for 6-year-olds,"So our 6-year-old daughter is quite a sensitive person and she finds it difficult when the other kids at school argue with her (or even with each other).  We're normally quite a quiet family. We wouldn't normally shout unless something was really wrong. So she has trouble laughing it off when other kids shout at her at school - to her it's really upsetting.  Of course this is all part of normal life, I want to help her learn to cope with it.  I think what she needs to come up with is an assertive response, rather than bursting into tears. She tries to stop herself but she doesn't have much success.  Can anyone recommend resources - maybe a book or DVD? - that might be helpful? Or other recommendations for ways we could help her to cope?  We've tried role-playing with me / her mum playing the part of the other child, but she finds even that too upsetting.  She's not being bullied - this doesn't happen very often, and it's the kind of thing which many other kids her age would laugh off or even enjoy and treat as a game. I want to help her understand that she doesn't have to treat it as the end of the world when someone else has a cross tone of voice - they might not mean it (with her classmates, usually they don't mean it) and even if they do mean it, I want her to learn to be a bit more thick-skinned, because I think that would make her feel happier.    It's the group-dynamics type stuff that she has a problem with. The standard 'establishing a pecking order in a group' stuff that even adults do. She finds the 'storming' stage of group participation extremely painful. "
89,Have you experienced shaming of motherhood and how did you cope with it?,"It seems common for people to have negative opinions or even attack women who embrace the very important role of being a mother.   As someone whose own mother is a successful professional, I fully support any woman who chooses that. So I would like to avoid discussing the rights which women already have in western nations. But it seems to have developed into an socially conceded axiom that women must prefer pursuing a career path over being a stay at home mother. There is a social stigma surrounding it and sometimes if you speak positively in appreciation of the importance of a mother's role in her child's development, people are quick to accuse you of degrading women. If you're a stay at home mom or endeavor to be one, people seem very quick to suggest that you pursue a career and almost militantly attack any suggestion that you might have a fulfilling life as a stay at home mother that will benefit your family. Sometimes this is extended beyond being a stay at home mother to treating motherhood itself as if it is morally wrong.  So this is for moms, especially stay at home moms, have you experienced such things? Are there social barriers and have they led to more tangible barriers in the way of being a stay at home mother or even just as a mother? Did this affect your decision to be a stay at home mother or not?  I realize that this can be a sensitive issue and there are some mothers struggling to cope with being a stay at home mom and then there are many cases of mothers who would absolutely love to stay at home, but feel don't have that opportunity. Maybe sometimes the grass is greener, but I would like to hear personal experiences from stay at home moms and those who have considered it. How often have you come across hostility toward motherhood and how has it affected your life and what did you do to overcome it? "
90,At what age does bed-sharing become detrimental to a child?,"I'm making an assumption that there has to be an age at which bed-sharing no longer provides a benefit to either party and in fact is harmful to at least one of them. Are there any studies that prove this point? If so, is it possible these studies are simply biased by cultural norms and don't show actual harm to parent or child?  Hopefully the study would answer these questions:   When should parents stop sleeping in the same bed as their child?  What kind of issues can this cause for both the child and the parent if the bed-sharing continues beyond what is recommended? Does the answer vary depending on whether we are talking about a single parent vs. a couple?  "
91,Parenting an adult child who has recently experienced great trauma,"I am a parent to adult 'children'. I would appreciate any wisdom that can be shared.  My youngest and his wife delivered a healthy, normal weight baby on their due date, but on the first full day at home, the baby started having difficulty keeping her oxygen level up (she would turn bluish). They took her to the ER, where she actually stopped breathing. Unfortunately, although she had nearly every test known to man, they never came up with a reason why she stopped breathing. She was discharged after 12 days, most in intensive care.  Since then, my son and daughter-in-law have been hypervigilant, and are definitely not enjoying being parents. ""What if...?"" is the main thing on their minds.  Are there any studies that deal with how to help new parents who have experienced a newborn's near-death experience to enjoy their baby more? "
92,Sympathetic Adults,"You all know adults who undermine your authority when you're out and about with your children.  They coddle your kids when they misbehave, and your kids know it and take advantage of the situation to see how much they can get away with, especially when your focus is elsewhere.  I want this to be a relatively generic question if possible, but for one example, my son does this thing where he waits for his little sister to pick a toy, then instantly he wants that toy and none other, even in a room full of toys, and even though it didn't interest him until it interested her.  He then starts pestering her about letting him play with it.  He knows we don't tolerate that pestering, and if he came to us we would make him play with something else, so instead he approaches a sympathetic adult, puts on a sad expression, and starts whining about his sister not ""sharing.""  Those adults then treat him like he's the victim, give him lots of attention, and spend a lot of effort finding him a toy he will like better.  If we comment on his attitude, they take his side.  First of all, why do adults do this?  Second, what are some ideas to either stop it quickly or teach kids not to take advantage of it?  I'm not talking about grandparents or other relatives here.  With those people we have had plenty of time to lay out our expectations.  I'm talking about people like receptionists, nurses, retail workers, waiters, etc. with whom we don't have time to have a lengthy discussion on parenting.  Consider that our situation might be worse than other parents.  My 10 year-old has cerebral palsy, but we still expect her to behave to her potential, which others are not usually aware of.  However, it is not in her nature to intentionally take advantage of her situation.  My seven year-old is quite small for his age, and since he is homeschooled, is often out when other kids are in school.  I think this leads people to unconsciously set their expectations lower, as if he were preschool age, which he can kind of pass for.  He's really the one who milks it for all it's worth, usually at the expense of his sisters. "
93,How to motivate yourself to read stories to a kid whom you know cannot understand and respond accordingly?,"From: How to read an English story book to the kid when we don&#39;t talk in English at home?     If you start immediately, it won't matter what language you're speaking; either way it will be babble :) Language comprehension takes time, regardless of whether the exposure is monolingual or bilingual. But early exposure, even in the womb, has been shown to increase a child's level of responsiveness to specific languages, which (presumably) facilitates learning the language later on.   It seems to me that if I start this as a ritual, I'll feel like talking to walls since I will know that the kid doesn't understand what the hell I am speaking and won't be responding either.  Hence the question: How to motivate yourself to read stories to a kid whom you know cannot understand and respond accordingly? "
94,How to make young kids become more involved in meal planning and cooking?,"I'm trying to involve my 5-year old and 3-year old more in meal planning and eventually cooking. Right now, they're a bit picky (like most) and so we have a pretty limited set of maybe 5-6 dinner options.  My goal is to broaden their choices. For example, I found that when we started making pizza, my daughter, who doesn't like tomato sauce on pasta, suddenly thought it was OK.  What are good approaches to make young kids become more involved in meal planning and cooking? What is your personal experience with this?  For example, I thought that a cookbook with lots of photos and generally kid-friendly foods, that are easy for kids to help with many steps, could make them look at some photos of meals and say ""oh, that looks interesting"". "
95,My 1-year-old cries several times a night. Could it be pain and what to do about it?,"I've got a 1-year-old chold. He's got almost 12 teeth (4 molars), he's been pretty constipated from Nurofen.  I've stopped giving Nurofen and am giving Movicol and Coloxyl as well. Seems to be working. He also has yoghurt so I'll be cutting that out starting today too.  He is fully breastfed, has solids quite well. Mostly lunch and dinner and also has those packet purees. Rafferty's Garden.  He sleeps a solid block from 7:30 - 11:30ish, then after that time, while I don't time it, or count how many (usually I'm out of it), he screams out in pain about every half hour. Well, it seems like pain. I've usually brought him back into bed by this point and he cries out and flings himself around. It doesn't seem like night terrors as it seems like pain to me. He sometimes wakes up and sometimes not. I'm exhausted.  Anyone experiencing this?  I'm wondering if it could be a dairy intolerance, I'm wondering should I keep him in his room despite the fact it's more exhausting to get up 10 times a night?  Any assistance or suggestions would be so helpful and appreciated. "
96,When does a toddler understand the joke of a man falling down on purpose?,"A few days ago I was watching a circus show with my almost 3-year-old daughter. There was a guy who was doing some pirouettes on a horizontal bar: he would turn several times in a row and then stop to make some jokes.  After a while, and since he was also a comedian, they put a mattress on the floor so he could fall on it. And this is what happened: for us adults it was clear that he would turn and turn and, in a certain moment, release from the bar and fall on the mattress as if he had fallen down. Also, he would walk a bit on the bar and then pretend he slid and fall on the mattress again.  All of this was funny and they (him and his assistant) were making funny faces. However, the subtleties of the joke were not clear at all to my daughter, who started to feel very anxious and helpless.  I explained to her that it was a joke and walked her to the side of the stage to show how big the mattress was, and how he was not hurting himself at all when falling on it. However, none of this helped and she kept feeling very sorry for the man. I decided to just move out for a while and come back when the show was over, to see how the man was smiling and feeling perfectly safe.  In any case, what remained interesting to me was the fact itself: She felt empathy (something they gain when they are around 3 years old). But how can a toddler infer in such situations that things are just a joke? I see itself as a kind of irony, which is something that a kid just starts understanding when a bit older (5-6 years old?). "
97,How to implement natural consequences to make an 8-year-old stop being rude to a sibling?,"I have an 8-year-old son, a 6- and a 2-year-old daughter. My son is a model student but really likes to argue. He's extremely stubborn and always right. When he argues with me, I'll correct him and laugh it off when he continues.  Now, I'm a fan of natural consequences, so long as the child is not in any immediate danger. When he argues with other kids at school, for instance, and I learn about it later, I'll explain to him that arguing is not a very good way to make friends. This is a natural consequence that I'm okay with.  Of his two sisters, only the older one is old enough to argue back. She's much more relaxed and considerate than he is (surprise, she has more friends). But she can also be extremely annoying (""What'cha doing? What'cha doing?! Huh?! Huh?! Huh?!""), so the two of them clash a lot.  Unfortunately, the natural consequence of losing friends doesn't exactly apply at home, and my son does worse than arguing with his sisters. Today, he was holding a treasure box and shaking it, which was making a lot of noise. His older sister wanted to know what was in the box, to which he responded by hiding it. When she asked again, he just ignored her. This kind of thing really gets on my nerves, so I asked my son irritably ""Why are you being a jerk? She just wants to see what's in it. What do you get by holding out on her?"" This made him feel really bad, but he still wouldn't let her see it. He just pouted and sulked. His sister, unable to take a hint, persisted, so I told her ""Just leave him alone. He doesn't feel like being nice right now.""  I'm sure there's a better way to handle situations like this, but it's hard to think clearly when I get irritated. In the past, my wife and I had a hard copy of ""the rules"" that helped us by giving us clear consequences (e.g., rudeness will result in being sent to your room) so we didn't have to make quick decisions when these things happened. But there are two problems with having rules like this:   You end up with a rule for everything, which you have to enforce. It's not much of a natural consequence.   So how should I deal with this behavior? "
98,What are the guidlines for 6-month-olds sucking toys?,What is the guideline to be followed on allowing 6-month-old babies to suck toys? Obviously the cheap plastic ones are a strict no no.  Is there any specific materials that have been proven safe? Are teethers safe?   There seems to be 2 schools of thought at home    To not allow any toy close to her since she sucks everything (which seems a bit too extreme to me). Give her as many toys as possible so that she can have fun.  
99,How to help (and bathe) a toddler who is terrified of the plughole in the bath?,"Our 2½-year old has very recently developed a fear of the plughole in the bath. She is not just afraid but properly terrified to the point that I bathed her in her baby brother's bathtub-in-a-bath tonight. She seems to believe that if the water can disappear down the plughole, then maybe so can her toys and flannel (and what if she herself could disappear?)  We've tried to talk to her about it and we've tried to demonstrate that only water can go down the plughole, but she becomes frantic and upset. This wasn't a problem last week and doubtless it will pass, but what is the best way to help her overcome this fear now? Have other people experienced the plughole-terrors? "
100,"How to answer someone who says, ""What he needs is a good spanking!""","I was in a restaurant when my 2.5 year old decided to throw a major tantrum. I used time outs, so I scooped him up and carried him towards the door (he was crying and flailing). Much to my embarrassment, an older woman stopped me and said...     What that child needs is a good spanking!   I kind of had enough on my plate, so I just ignored her. But I would have loved to have said something wise in return. I think if I had said ""I don't spank my child"", she probably would have said, ""It shows!""  If you've been in this situation, what have you done? What do you wish you had done? "
101,At what age should sleeping and eating schedules be fixed for a kid?,"Kid isn't born yet. I would like to know at what age should we start fixing the sleeping and eating schedules for the kid, and also expect the kid to follow?  Besides eating and sleeping are there any other schedules which need to fixed for kids? "
102,How to talk to a teen daughter about her weight,"My daughter is 16 and is gaining weight. My wife and I are on board with what needs to be done - and there's a lot to do.  But as to talking to her about her weight, we are at a loss. She's an ultra liberal feminist, so any discussion about her weight has and will inevitably lead to accusations of ""fat shaming"" and make things worse; we've been there already.  She points to celebrities who are fat and successful.  The last argument about her weight she pointed to the medical profession's opinion that ""a little"" overweight isn't the worst thing in the world. And she points to us - her parents - who are also slightly overweight. Perhaps she's right, and perhaps there's a middle ground. And perhaps, she's living under our roof and so our rules? I suspect we need to choose the right time and the right words - this is where your advice is needed.  Some background: She's not obese, but she's about 25&nbsp;lbs (11&nbsp;kg) over her ideal weight (she's 5'3"" (160 &nbsp;cm), ~160&nbsp;lbs (73&nbsp;kg)). I don't know her BMI.  She's a couch potato, is in love with her phone and laptop playing games and chatting with her friends. She's in between seasons (she plays field hockey and softball). She does not drive.  Her eating habits are horrible, too. She snacks on crap, and eats second and third helpings. All the junk food she gets she buys herself with money she makes from babysitting - another occasional low calorie activity she does with a 2-year-old.  We are not the best role models, but we don't eat off-mealtime, and we don't buy junk food. While consistent mealtimes are important, it just doesn't work in our household. We have a son who is in scouts, sports, and a band, and so there is that logistic. I coach both my kids, and volunteer in the scouts and band. So sports and other activities just make each day very different than the other. My son, by the way, is slightly underweight.  We started to limit what we cook and what we put on the table in order to limit the amount of food she eats.  We try to have dinner ready for early evening. If that can't be done, preparing something in a slow cooker can work - the kids can help themselves if we're not around. Or they can make something on their own.  We plan to lock her out of her phone, laptop, and Wi-Fi until she does things around the house that elevates cardio activity: doing yard and gardening work.  We also want to get her a walking app for her phone, and have her walk or jog a couple of miles a day as a requisite for getting her phone and laptop privileges, but, the irony is she needs the phone to use the app.  I'd like to get her to a gym, but none of her friends want to go, and none of the gyms will take her without an adult present. The YMCA would take her in a limited duration program, but getting her there is another problem - we work during the day, as does all of her friends' parents. Evening trips to the gym could work in theory, but with sports, scouts, band, and other community groups we're a part of, that all doesn't make it easy or consistent. We are members; we just don't go that often.  Any advice on what else we can do? Most importantly, we need to talk to her - that's our biggest concern, attempts in the past have lead to horrendous fights with her.  What has worked for you?  EDIT:  Thanks all for the responses.  I waited a long time to respond so as to be able to try most of the suggestions in earnest.  So far, things are going well.  She has not lost weight, but she has changed attitude.  For my wife and I, the first plan of attack as suggested was to back off the talk.  Next, my wife enrolled in a gym, and has been there for almost 4 months now, and has lost 40lbs.  For me, I'll be joining only in between seasons, so not the best, but I'll still be on the field as I coach.  Also, we eliminated all junk food in the house, and, we were particularly careful around Halloween and Thanksgiving which are traditionally difficult to navigate food- and drink-wise.  Next up is Christmas and New Years, and we're staying home.  Still, no talk - only action.  And my daughter seems to be responding: substituting green tea for soda, yogurt for ice cream, and she's no longer buying junk food with her babysitting money.  Meanwhile, better planned meals allows to have however much she wants without us having to say anything.  Thanks all! "
103,6-year-old bed wetting,"It seems that most questions on this site about bed wetting involve toddlers. My 6-year-old daughter (almost 7) still wets the bed almost every night. After she was potty trained (a long, difficult process), she wore night time diapers for years. For about the past year, we've had the same routine:   Before she goes to bed (around 8:30 pm), she always goes potty. I sometimes let her have a little drink because I feel guilty making her go to bed thirsty. We wake her up around 10:30 or 11 (when we go to bed) to go potty. If we wait until after 11 she is usually wet already. We wake her up at 3:30 am to go again.   The 3:30 potty time is the most problematic. We used to set our alarm and wake her up ourselves, but this was always a battle because she's groggy and uncooperative at that time in the morning. Over the past few months or so, we've been setting her alarm for that time. This was working for a while, but sometimes she sleeps through the alarm, or the alarm malfunctions, or we forget to set it.  We have a plastic cover over her mattress but we're constantly running out of sheets. We've changed her sheets almost every night this week. What should we do?  Edit  I'm also wondering: is it okay to make her change her own sheets? This seems like a pretty natural consequence to me, but it also feels a lot like punishment. "
104,6 year old is suddenly (shockingly) rude,"I am not a parent yet, however, this is about ""How I should behave with a 6-year-old who is suddenly very rude to me""  The story: I am from India and I am Dark, (you can check out my profile) and almost every relative of mine is very fair compared to me and all of my cousins even the small ones have said that to me that I am dark.  One of my 6-year-old cousins had said that to me a couple of times before and I took it casually, as it is more of a curious question from him to me, like ""brother, why are you darker than me?"" (Translated in English)  However, recently (in last 45 days) he has somehow figured out that he can use the skin ""color"" as a tool/way to use it against some and make them feel bad about it. A couple of days back, there was a party at my place and he came to me said, ""You are dark, gorilla-like. You are slightly dark but monkey like and your hair is grey, you're old."" (In case you want to know, I am 28 and I have grey hair from the age of 21)  I was shocked when I heard his tone and the way he said it. It was amazing how he thought he could use that against me (I don't know where he could have caught that, maybe in school or maybe at home)  I was just quiet and I didn't  speak a word to him the whole party and he still carried on saying things to me. (It was my way of saying it doesn't affect me.  People have said much worse things to me)  So my question is: ""How should I behave with a 6-year-old who is suddenly very rude to me"" ?  PS: I did not get offended by him, I was shocked. I want to know what the correct way that I should behave with him so that he doesn't do that to others. I am old enough to not get offended by kids, like I said before people have said worse things.  Update: I met the cousin again yesterday and tried to observe him if he is saying anything like before. However he did not say thing rude but was quite playful with me and was hanging around me for a long time. "
105,"Should I be concerned that my 2 year-old cannot pronounce sounds like ""vee"" and ""fee""?","Our first child had no problems speaking quite clearly. However, our second child who is 2 years old has trouble pronouncing sounds like ""vee"" and ""fee"". For example, ""vessel"" becomes ""bessel"" and ""Sophia"" becomes ""So-bee-ia"". Will this problem naturally correct itself as she grows older?  We know a friend who had a 4-year old who needed speech therapy, though I do not know why he needed it and whether it was helpful. How do we know if speech therapy is helpful or necessary? "
106,Should we expect the kids to make an eye contact always?,"Having seen so many questions on this site dealing with the kids not making an eye contact, I was wondering if there are times when we should ask the kid not to make an eye contact?  I remember my childhood and adulthood when my father and mother used to hit me as hard as they can, and I also remember myself staring in their eyes back! That used to be my way of telling them ""Huh! If you think you are physically strong enough to hurt me so am I strong enough to ""deal with you""! Go on now, why have you stopped!""  Seeing my stare my father used to yell at me saying ""Keep your eyes down or I'll take them out""! It usually didn't deter me ever.  I remember in schools too we were always expected by our teachers to keep our eyes down when we were being scolded! Making an eye contact was always taken as a challenge by the elders.  I see on this site parents always complain that their child doesn't look at them while being scolded. Is this just a cultural difference, or there are times when we should expect the child not to make an eye contact?  "
107,Son (22) has to keep initiating contact between son and parents after moving out,"Me being 22, I moved out a year ago (about half an hour drive away) to live with my girlfriend after I proposed too her.  I always (and believe I still do) had/have a good connection with my parents and experienced a good childhood, despite my parents having had to deal with a heavily handicapped and unfortunately now deceased son.   Since I moved out december last year I am the one who keeps asking ( about 1 time a month) when it suits my parents to meet again, so we can have a laugh a drink or anything else. Not once last year they asked me to come over neither did they ask if they could come over for a cup of coffee or anything else.   If they're going to do stuff with my family, for example they go for a walk or go bowling they don't invite us or me alone.   My dad called me once last year and my mom probably about 2 times. They do give the occasional whatsapp, but those are mostly: remember grandma's birthday or whatever.  I love my parents and I assume they think I am too busy (Working 42 hours a week, buying a house, preparing a wedding and taking care of my chronical sick girlfriend, so I am also running an household), but I'd love it if they would simply give me a call when they would go out bowling or visiting my grandparents.   It kind of hurts to see on Facebook that they do fun stuff with my brothers (23 and 15) who still live at home without even inviting me.   I would like some advice about how to approach them, because at the moment I do feel left out.  Response to questions given:  Q: Before you moved out, were they happy in your choice of a girlfriend/fiancee?  A: I believe they were  Q: Were they disappointed when you moved out?  A: I don't think so. They said they would miss me, but things never got emotional.  Q: Did they help you move?  A: Yes they did.  Q: Did they rely on you for anything when you lived there that they're having to do without now?   A: Only my presence  Q: In other words, can you think of any reason they might be upset with you for leaving them?  A: No I can't think of anything. The only thing I took was my own playstation and they gave us a refrigerator.  Q: Were they solicitous of your affections and attentions when you lived at home?  A: Yes they were. I could tell them anything and they told me more about their life as I got older (finances etc.)  Q: Did they really hear you when you spoke with them, and respect your opinions?  A: Yes they did. We were not any emotional wonders being a family of 4 men. But when I spoke up they listened  Q: Did you all go out together to do things everybody liked, or that just a few liked?  A: We did the occasional funfair or zoo. Sometimes they would go out walking and since that didn't tend be my thing I would stay home. But they always asked me.  P.S. It's kind of the same for my brothers. I barely see them and they barely ask me to meet them.  P.P.S. My parents in law do actually contact both of us to meet up, or ask for an occasional coffee/tea  P.P.P.S If this is not the right setup for this kind of question you are free to edit it or tell me in the comments.

108,8-year-old refuses to blow his nose,"My 8-year-old son constantly has a runny nose. When he sniffles and I hear it, I'll usually ask him to blow his nose. Sometimes he starts arguing and whining as soon as I ask - for some reason he hates blowing his nose - but usually he'll go get a tissue and pick his nose with it.  Today, we were waiting for the bus in the car and he was sniffling like crazy. I handed him a tissue and told him to blow his nose.     Son: [starts picking his nose with the tissue]      Me: No, son, you have to blow.      Son: [yells] I did blow my nose!      Me: You need to blow harder.      Son: [practically crying] I did! Nothing ever comes out when I blow   my nose!!      Me: No, you didn't. If you blew your nose I would have heard it. And   from the way you're sniffling it's clear that snot would have come out   if you actually blew into the tissue.      Son: [more arguing and crying, bus arrives]      Me: Well, put the tissue in your pocket in case you need it later.      Son: Eww! No way! Then I'd get snot in my pocket! [leaves tissue on car seat]      Me: Thanks for getting snot on my car seat.      Son: [crying, gets out of car] Why am I always the worst?!      Me: [drives to work angry, posts this question]   Am I being unreasonable? Isn't it bad for you to constantly have a bunch of snot in your nasal cavity? Like, can't it lead to a sinus infection or something? "
109,How often should my wife breastfeed our newborn?,"Our newborn is one week old and a boy. When we were still in hospital, the nurse was giving formula milk to our newborn every 3 hours. But since we brought our baby home, we exclusively breastfeed our newborn but not every 3 hours. We only breastfeed our newborn if he is crying.  Is that OK? Which one is better breastfeed newborn periodically (for example every 3 hours, if the newborn is sleeping, we should wake him up to be breastfed) or breastfeed newborn only if he is crying for milk? "
110,Are egg yolks safe for pregnant women?,"Is it safe for pregnant women to eat egg yolks?  I'm sure scrambled or fried are fine, but what about over-easy or sunny side up where the yolk isn't cooked solid?  If it makes a difference, I'm located in Canada, however I don't know that it will matter. "
111,What could be the reason of food accumulation (pooling) between front lower teeth and lips in mouth of the toddler?,"I have a 24+ month old toddler. Over a long stretch of time, he has been a slow eater because food pools in the front of his mouth. Especially between his lower teeth and his lips this is true. Food gets stuck there and it looks like he just can't move it. Finally, after he has been coaxed to drink enough liquid, the food goes down, but feeding is a long, drawn out process because of it.  On a related note, he does not speak words. He just babbles and otherwise grunts.  He is quite a good communicator really, but just can't form those meaningful words. I mention this just in case it is related to his feeding problem.  What could this be indicative of, his food pooling problem? Are there any notable conditions like this where I could go in and see a doctor and say he has condition X and the doctor knows what I am saying? "
112,"Should I be concerned about my 10-month-old still not knowing how to pronouce words, just saying ""er...er....er..."" instead?","I have a 10-month-old daughter. She just keeps on saying ""er...er...er"" but never pronounces ""b"", ""p"", ""m"", ""f"" etc. in words. We are already talking to her always and showing her slowly how to pronounce ""mama"" (with the mouth shape), but it still doesn't help!  I think by the age of 8-10 months, children are able to pronounce simple sounds like ""mama"", ""baba"", ""papa"" etc., although they might not know their meaning.  Is this normal? What should I do? How can I help her? "
113,Toddlers cries when mum or grandparents leave the living area,"He is one year and eight months. We live downstairs (grandparents live upstairs) and there is an exit door that connects to the genkan (we live in Japan- entry area) before the front door. No problem if mum or grandparents are just in the other rooms which he plays but god forbid they try to leave. No problem if dad (me) leaves even though I look after him for many hours a day. Mum and grandparents used to sneak away and then it was no big problem however now my son is starting to watch them closely to avoid them sneaking away. He even misses mum a lot when she is away do shopping or appointment- stay at home mum. Happily playing with toys makes no difference. What can we do?   To demonstrate that many answers to somewhat relevant questions don't help. He has moderately good contact with many family members. He is already running downstairs and involved as much as possible in household activities- vacuuming, putting up and down temporary barrier and hates being in the playpen- the only punishment that I am allowed to do (it works) and he doesn't really follow being told no. ""bye bye"" was possibly the most distressing words in the English language for him but not as much now. The situation is bad for him and us although Grandpa seems now to be able leave without hysterics, Grandma finds leaving very hard. It is worse for mum and also him as he ends being carried in a baby sling rather than playing. No answers that say its normal or try to make feel better please. I am fine except for the his extended crying when mum has to leave without him. As I said it is mostly the leaving not the separation so how to make adults leaving easier for him?     "
114,What are best practices for managing student-teacher relationships?,"Often the focus is on the relationship between teachers and parents, which makes sense largely because the parents seek to manage their relationship with the teachers.  My question is: as a parent, what approaches or best practices work for getting students to manage their relationship with their teachers? Clearly the teachers' job is to manage students, and telling them how to do their job would be foolish.  I am asking this question in part because the selected answer for this question on How can we make the most of Parent-Teacher consultations?  basically says ""don't expect anything meaningful from parent-teacher conference day"" and to find alternative methods of communicating with the teacher.  I guess I see this as an alternative method. "
115,Could green poop be caused by an allergy to breast milk?,"Theoretically speaking, could green poop be caused by an allergy to breast milk for an breastfed infant starting after four months of breastfeeding? I don't know if that is even possible.  Infant poop is usually yellowish, but what if it were foamy and explosively or dark green and very runny. Could an allergy to breast milk cause this?  I've heard that it could also be the result of a common cold virus infection which may affect the infants stomach. Has anyone else heard about this? "
116,What are things to consider when purchasing a baby backpack?,"REI.com is currently running a sale on their selection of baby backpacks. I'm not looking for a product recommendation because ultimately that's like asking someone's favorite flavor of ice cream. What I am interested in are people's recommendations on what to consider when purchasing a baby backpack. We live at the foot of one and near several mountain ranges so do a fair amount of hiking. We have twins so can make concessions on one backpack (better for mom, roomier etc.) if we can make them up in the other.  Are there better positions for the baby to be carried in? How much room for carrying stuff is necessary? Is there anything in particular to stay away from? Are particular bag features safer than others?  Edit My twins are 3 months old, but were two months premature and currently both are just over 9 pounds. Even if we cannot use the carrier straight away I'd like to purchase two during the sale. "
117,How to deal with a toddler who has formed a habit of throwing things including food?,"My 18ish month old baby loves to throw. She has several balls that she likes to toss around with me and her coordination with throwing is getting quite good. The problem is that she likes to throw other things too.   While I have gotten her to stop all out chucking things across the room, she still tosses them down onto the floor. She never does it out of anger. It's usually when she has completed a task with something for example, when she is done drinking her water, she tosses the mug onto the ground rather nonchalantly.   The same thing occurs with toys, when she has completed playing with a toy, she tosses it away. I have zero problem with her placing anything on the ground. She's rather good at helping mama and I clean up before she goes to bed, however I do mind the tossing.   Has anyone had any success or does anyone know a method to  practice that will teach her to place things rather than throw? And also, does anyone know anyway that this could carry over between things she shouldn't throw (i.e. her mug) and things that are intended to be thrown (i.e. a ball)? "
118,"As a parent, how do I discipline kids who refuse to comply without physically or emotionally harming them?","Core Question  My 13 year-old younger brother defies any attempt to control him and my parents do not/can not tell him to do anything that he doesn't want to do.  He simply refuses to do it and there is nothing they can do about it. (e.g. time out fails miserably and if told to sit in his room he frequently does not go even for a short time)  Full Question  My parents are extremely busy and have not had enough time to develop a healthy relationship with their kids.  A major issue that has arisen unchecked from this is the fact that my 13 year-old brother has become defiant of any attempt at discipline.  Short of physically restraining him, which he knows my parents won't do, they have no options when he refuses to comply and as a result, in my own opinion he has not been disciplined for any reason for several years.  How can I (assume I am the parent in an identical theoretical case) or what can my parents do to punish him for doing something when he becomes violent without physically harming him yet not letting him ""win"" all the time?  What can I do in my present situation?  It is silently driving a deep wedge between my parents and myself and I am no longer comfortable talking to either of them about anything private.  Just to note, in this situation I am not the parent (16 y/o older brother) but have written it from that perspective since trauma resulting from years of this has made me question whether I want kids or not when I am grown.  Is there a way to deal with this and prevent it before it gets this bad? "
119,At what age can/should a child be able to clean themselves after bowel movements?,"How can parents find the right time to encourage a child to clean itself after bowel movements?  Our son is nearly 4 years old and it is still difficult for him to get to the toilet early enough (see here: How can we potty-train our pre-schooler outside the home?). During our holiday, for 2 weeks everything worked perfectly and he always told us when he needed a toilet, so that there was not a single ""accident"" in those two weeks (even in a foreign environment).  When we got back to the kindergarten after the holiday, 2 days went well and then he started again to poo in his underwear (also at home), so that we finally decided to make a step back to diapers (as he often stated, he did not want to go to the toilet, because it was ""too far"" and seemed not to be willing to cooperate).  At the same time he said each morning, that he did not want to go to the kindergarten (when asked for reasons, they were manifold and mostly concerned preferring to play at home with certain toys...) .  I got aware of the fact that the kindergarten teacher let him clean himself, when the diaper was full - I assume to show him that it was not an enjoyable job for them - which at first seemed to make sense to me. (Sure they helped him afterwards, but he had to start putting the diaper off and cleaning as good as he could.)  However I  then learned, that he seems to see that as a punishment and therefore does not tell them less than ever if the diaper is ""full"".  So we then thought, that it might have a strong negative impact to force him cleaning himself. And I got aware of the fact, that at home we had never allowed or encouraged him to clean himself, so he was forced to do something which he maybe thought was forbidden.  I've been talking to several kindergarten teachers and they claim that the other kids (>3 years) are also cleaning themselves.  That's why I'm asking.  I understand that this is much easier for the kindergarten teachers and that autonomy is a good thing to learn, but I wonder   are those kids at the age of 3 really able to clean themselves appropriately? what about hygiene (washing hands, ...)? what about children with special digestive troubles or disorders? Our son has bowel movements at least once daily, sometimes 4 times a day and it is often quite loose bowels, so maybe more difficult for him to get aware of it coming out and for sure much more difficult to clean, as it is quickly distributed everywhere in the diaper... After long ""research"" we finally seemed to find the reason for that: he seems to have an imbalanced gut flora which might cause those frequent and often loose bowels (as well as weakening his immune system etc.)       Update We made some good progress during the last weeks.   we encouraged him also at home to clean himself and made clear to him that this is a privilege to be allowed to do that, and after some days of seeming to be not very comfortable with it, he now tries to clean himself voluntarily. for 7 consecutive days he managed to leave his pants clean, which gives us hope that we're on a good way (he normally poo'es in the morning before going to the kindergarten and in the evening before going to bed - and most days he seems not to have had more bowel movements than those two.)  "
120,Do we have to wrap an infant in the warm clothes after his birth?,"My all relatives have been telling me that the inside of the womb is warm so when the baby comes out he needs to be wrapped from head to toe in warm clothes so that he doesn't get ill due to the temperature difference.  I would have followed that advise without being skeptical if it were cold here.    The room temperature here is 37 degree Celsius and the outside temperature is 45 degree Celsius. With this temperature range does it still make sense to follow that advise? If yes, then for how many days?  Is that advise based on any scientific facts? "
121,Does the kid who is active at night in the womb retain his night activeness once he comes out?,"I have always noticed that my kid (not born yet) is mostly active at night in the womb.    I just wanted to know that will this activeness pattern have an effect on his sleeping schedule when he comes out? Is there any relation between the two? If yes, then how to counter it? "
122,"3.5 Year Old Boy Crying, Not Potty Training, Does Not Listen, and Is Mean To Others","My son has been horrible lately. Most of the day he is throwing a fit and crying about everything. He rarely follows directions. We have been trying to potty train him for around a year as well. We will ask him if he needs to go and he will scream ""no!"" We will ask him again, and the cycle continues and ends with him peeing or pooping in his pants.  He has also been mean to other children. He will go up to another child and hit them, push them down, or take a toy out of their hand. I care for a couple of under two year olds and my son harasses them a lot of times.  Is this just a normal 3 year old phase? I am having a hard time coping with his behavior and feel that ultimately my reactions are making it worse.  How can we make it through this stage? How can I without screaming at my child way too much? "
123,"How can we make parents more attractive than TV, video games, etc.?","Maybe I'm too early to ask about this, since my status changed to be a father since 25 September ago.. But I'm very curious about this.  I learned from my surroundings (my friends family, my neighbours, etc) that their children (middle/high school) are mostly far more attracted to others than us as the parents. Their children are more attracted to TV, hanging out with their friends, playing video games rather than spending more time with the parents.  I think it's alright if the children can learn good values from those, but what they do not? Maybe this is not happening to all families...  But I think the parent's enemies right now are those things (TV, video games, etc).   Why are they more attractive than us (as parents)?  How do we make ourselves more attractive than those things?  I hope my questions are clear, since I'm not from US. "
124,Can it be harmful if my 2-month-old daughter tries to stand?,"This is about my second daughter, who is now 2 months old and happily smiling at me ^_^    An awful lot has happened with my 1st daughter since she was born...I've forgotten quite a bit about the ages at which infants should start turning, lifting their heads, when they should be at what weight, etc.  But something tells me my second daughter is fast. Too fast, perhaps, which is why I'm asking this question here.  She's been fast with everything so far. She was born in under 1 hour, doubled her weight in two weeks, started lifting her head almost immediately after birth (she can hold it up and control it completely now), and since a few weeks, when I lie her down in bed on her belly, she's starting to show signs of wanting to go crawling.   But here's the thing. Lately, she starts squirming and showing general signs of being displeased. There seems to be nothing in the world I can do to please her at that moment, except...help her stand on her legs. When I do that, she turns all smiles and becomes happy once again. Her stance is quite firm already; I can sometimes even let go for a sec (which she thoroughly enjoys, obviously).   Of course, as a good parent, I want to stimulate everything they indicate they are ready for. However, there's this gnawing concern I have when letting my daughter stand like that...she's barely 2 months old! I vaguely remember some doctor saying to me in the past that stimulating the legs, hips and back at too early an age can cause deformations later in life, because not all the cartilage has turned to bone.   Is this true? What should I do here?  "
125,How to balance between giving an oil massage and a daily bath to an infant?,"Room temperature: 37 degree Celsius Outside temperature: 45 degree Celsius  [website]  Don't bathe small children too often, especially not daily! There's a risk they develop a skin condition like dermatitis.   I have heard several recommendations about giving daily an oil massage to the infant. It is said to strengthen his muscles and bones etc.  From: [website]  Dabur Lal Tail is an Ayurvedic Baby massage oil made from time tested ayurvedic ingredients which has many proven benefits for the Baby. Its massage helps in strengthening baby's bones and muscles and is proven safe and effective for better overall physical growth of babies.      Doctors from the Pediatrics department of Jawaharlal Nehru College conducted a clinical research under stringent rules and measures where the effect of massaging a baby with Dabur Lal Tail was compared with the effect of other massage oils, talcum powder and no massage. In the research, it was clearly proven that babies who were massaged daily with Dabur Lal Tail in comparison with no massage experienced 2 times faster increase in weight and height.      Clinical Research further proved the positive effects of Dabur Lal Tail massage in inducing better sleeping pattern in Neonates and Infants, which is very important for a baby’s development.   Now, if I oil massage him daily will I not have to bathe him daily too? Will it make sense to oil massage him daily and bathe him once a week? Any precautions to be taken in this case? "
126,Does a newborn *need* some kind of cradle?,"[website]  One of the things that your unborn baby does respond to is movement, so during the day it is constantly being rocked as you move about. At night when you are resting or lying down, that will not happen so much, so perhaps the baby is not being rocked to sleep.   This made me wonder that do we really need some kind of cradle for the newborn? Does it actually help in making the baby sleep?  Is it possible to make the baby sleep without purchasing any cradle? If yes, how?  P.S. Cultural difference: Infants/toddlers are not allowed to sleep separately from parents, no question of even letting them sleep in a separate room. "
127,How do you support/cope with your 15yr old daughter wanting to become a boy?,"I'm going to give a quick history on this to support my question. When my daughter was 12, her &amp; I moved to my hometown, where we already had friends and family that we are very close with. After moving she joined 4H, track &amp; band (her grades weren't the greatest) and really started coming out of her shell.   A couple new students started at her school, 1 of them a grade above her. After hanging out with these friends she started to copy their style (colored hair, music, ripped shorts/jeans &amp; whatnot). I had a ""unique"" style &amp; friends in school as well so I had no issues with that. But she then decided that she was bi-sexual after awhile.   After these changes she started having issues getting along with other girls at school, started developing anxiety issues, then started having issues getting along with these friends, 1 of which started cyber bullying her(on top of the general teenage girl drama). As sad as it is to say, it seemed like it was a trend in this group of girls &amp; boys to cut yourself and post attention grabbing things on facebook, they ALL did it. Things were going so horrible for her that I wanted to get her out of that town, and away from these kids, so we moved back &amp; she returned to her previous school. Since we've been here her grades have improved tremendously, she made several friends the first day of school, &amp; the cutting stopped, as well as the depression, she seems very happy &amp; upbeat now which means more to me than anything.  She now is insisting that feels like/would prefer to be a boy. When she's at school it's like she lives a double life. As hard as it was I let her get a very short haircut, she dresses more like a boy now and goes by a boy name at school around her friends. She plans to take testosterone as soon as she's old enough, which is one thing I will not support at 15 years old.   So far what I keep telling her is that this is a big decision and these are changes that you can not fully make until you've grown up, gotten out of school, etc. As a teenager you are gonna spend all 4 years of highschool just trying to figure out who you are, you can't make these kind of life decisions as a teenager. I also tell her that being a teenager &amp; being in highschool is hard enough, making these decisions right now is going to add to the highschool angst. I am fully supportive of her feelings and wishes on this, &amp; she's very open with me, we are very close, but I will not allow her to make any drastic changes to her body. If once she graduates she still feels strongly about this, I will support her all that I can.   I would just like to know if there are any other parents out there that are going through anything similar to this, when you know your child may have a long hard &amp; painful road ahead if they follow this path, how you handle it? What do you say to your child about it? What are your feelings?  (Please no disrespectful comments) "
128,Why are some babies always fussy and crying while others are always cheerful?,"I have noticed this very often. I have seen babies who are cheerful ever. My brother in law's daughter has never (not literally though) been seen crying/fussy etc. While as my brother's baby son is always fussy/crying. In hospitals too I have noticed the pattern with the visitors. No, I am not talking about ill babies.  I would like to understand what causes such huge temperament differences among babies.  One thing more I have noticed is that the fussy babies are usually weak and the ever cheerful babies are mostly healthy.   Is this related to health? Is this genetic? "
129,How to know whether your child is being bullied?,"Being a working person I may not be always near my kid. Also, it is a possibility that he may not tell me that he has been undergoing bullying somewhere because of fear or some other reasons.   How would I get signals about him being bullied somewhere? OR   How do I teach him to tell me if he's being bullied and by whom? Before that how do I teach him what is bullying?   What is an appropriate age to talk about the same with the child?   Kid isn't born yet. "
130,Is complimenting children where they can hear it good or bad?,"TL;DR: Is there anything wrong with praising children to their parents while the children can hear it?  From R. Kipling's ""The jungle book"":     ‘How beautiful are the noble children! How large are their eyes! And   so young too! Indeed, indeed, I might have remembered that the   children of kings are men from the beginning.’      Now, Tabaqui knew as well as anyone else that there is nothing so   unlucky as to compliment children to their faces. It pleased him to   see Mother and Father Wolf look uncomfortable. Tabaqui sat still,   rejoicing in the mischief that he had made, [...]   Is praising children so they can hear it really considered bad behaviour, or is it just based on superstition?  I can think of a situation where a parent just reprimanded a child for doing something bad, at which moment praise could be unwelcome - but other than that, it seems to me that children hearing their positive treats praised can only increase their self-esteem? "
131,Are outlet covers needed with tamper resistant electrical receptacles?,"When baby-proofing an electrical receptacle (aka, ""outlet""), is it necessary to use covers:   When the electrical receptacle is ""tamper resistant""? "
132,"When to stop using formula, and how much cow milk to give?","Here in France, I understand it's common for kids to stay on formula until age 3. I've heard they stop around 2 in the US? Anyway, our current routine for our 2y9mo daughter is a bottle in the morning and one in the evening.  Does she still need formula? Or, more precisely, what would be lacking (or gained) by cow's milk? Does it need to be whole?  How much milk should she be drinking per day? "
133,How can I mitigate how my toddler has generalized a fear related to insects/flies?,"I'm typically careful of not instilling needless fears in my toddler as I want her to be afraid of important danger and not everything and anything that might be dangerous.  We went for a vacation recently and I was being followed by 3-4 deer flies. I kept waving my hands around to shoo them away and my daughter understood that these bugs bite but has generalized this idea to ALL flies. She also got bit by something (deer fly or black fly) but I'm not sure she noticed what bit her or what happened (just saw a scab in her scalp).   This became a problem later during our vacation when she would break down at a restaurant because a (regular) fly was wandering around our food and also in the car until I managed to get the fly out. I don't mind my toddler being afraid of deer flies but being afraid of all flies is going to be hard on her! They are sort of difficult to tell apart as well so I'm not sure how I can help her out. I've tried explaining to her that they are not the same kind, that the regular flies don't bite. If one landed on my arm, I'd leave it there so she could see that I'm not scared.  I assume this fear is simply going to pass like many other things but are there any actions I can take to speed up the process?   I live in a place where most bugs are not dangerous at all; at most they will take some of your blood but there is no venom involved or direct threat to life. How do people living in places like Australia teach their toddlers to distinguish between a dangerous and a non-dangerous creature?   ETA: I was thinking some light exposure like trapping a regular fly and doing some observation involving the ""protection"" of a mason jar may be good for a start.  "
134,How should a parent react when their child comes out of the closet to them?,"Several of my good friends, including my best friend, are gay/lesbian/queer. All of them have told me that coming out was one of the most emotional and difficult things they've ever had to do. Their parents' reactions ranged from shock and vulgar ignorance (""You mean you like to do it in each others' [censored]?"") to rejection to loving acceptance.   How should a parent react when their child comes out to them? Obviously some reactions are more positive than others, and ideally all parents would love and accept their child as they are, for the person that they are. However, not all parents can do that -- this is the case I'd like to address as much as possible. What should a parent do after the initial shock has worn off? How can a parent prepare (as much as anyone can) for what could be a very surprising conversation?  I'm going to request an emphasis on professional opinions and cited studies in addition to personal experience. "
135,"My sister thinks her kid can ""swim"", but he can't breathe in the water. This is DEFCON-1 danger, right?","I am a childless uncle who just became very worried about the water safety of my nephew. Whether this is my business, or not, I'm thinking of making it my business:  My nephew (who is 4-yrs old) recently finished ""swimming"" lessons. However, he can't roll right/left to breathe while moving forward. And, he can't float on his back. All he does is swim out to a person standing in the pool; breathe; swim back to side of the pool.  This Thanksgiving weekend, I was at a bar adjacent to a huge pool at a resort. On the far side, my nephew was taking leaps into the pool and ""swimming"" out to my father. Then... rather than take a leap, he turns left and starts running along the side of the pool. It was a cool day, very few people were out, and no one was near where my nephew was running.   Am I wrong in thinking that this was a life or death situation? My sister is blowing me off about this. She is proud he can ""swim"". Am I wrong to think that a child needs to know how to float on his back, or be afraid of the water? My nephew is currently fearless of ""swimming"". That is incredibly dangerous?   I've read the opinions of the haters of ""ISR infant swimming survival"". They argue that ""ISR"" terrifies the child. Yes, it is terrifying. And, that is how it should be. If you can't get on your back a float, you should not (get in) / (fall in) water deeper than you can stand. That's obviously common sense, right?  btw: My first memory is the ""final exam"" of my ISR training. I was innocuously asked to put shoes on. Then the instructor sat next to me, tied the shoelaces together, and threw me in... That was torture. I found the name ""Dr. Harvey Barnett"" in the ""about"" page of infantswim.com . My instructor's name was ""Harvey"". If that Harvey taught swimming in central Florida in the late 1970s, I might have found my man. I do forgive him though. He made me into a strong swimmer. "
136,Has this crib been recalled? Should I not sell it?,"We have a hand-me-down crib that has a drop side and I'd like to sell it but I'm wary of re-distributing a recalled crib. FWIW, We never used it because our first foster placement was much older than crib age and we're doing some purging as we get ready to move. I'm not prepared to move furniture for theoretical future children.   It definitely has drop sides. I'm guessing it is five or six years old. It's last tenant is four now, and I know it was given to her parents by another family. So it predates the drop-side ban.  But I put my whole weight on the drop side and it didn't budge. So it seems sturdy to me. And the CPSC's poster about crib safety says ""Prohibit traditional drop sides"" but actually shows the exact mechanism that this crib uses:    Are there some drop-side cribs that are safe? Or should I be throwing this out/selling it only as a toddler bed?   PS. I did read What should I look for in a crib?  "
137,Grandparent put a diaper on my toilet trained child,I was out for 5 hours and my mom put a pull-up on my 25 month old daughter who refused diapers at 19 months. She never used a pull-up before though she has 2 cloth trainers that are thick but they still made her feel wet. She did pee in the pull-up btw.  I took them off her as soon as I noticed. The past 3 pees have been straight to the floor waiting for a diaper to catch it. She didn't even tell me she peed which she used to do because we do have a lot of accidents when she is distracted or doesn't want to stop playing.  I'm really trying not to make a big deal out of the diaper because I don't want it to be this power struggle thing now but I am definitely ticked that her training is going down the drain - pun intended.   Has anybody else (unfortunately) gone through this? What did you do? 
138,Is it okay for an infant to sleep 10-12 hours at night?,"Our 4-month-old baby regularly sleeps for 10+ hours at night. I know this isn't normal (and we feel pretty blessed for it), but is it okay? Are there any health problems or downsides to this? "
139,Is there any benefit to not responding immediately to a crying infant?,"Crying is a newborn's favorite activity. They cry whenever they feel hungry, unsafe, or uncomfortable. But sometimes I prefer to not respond to crying as quickly as possible, in order to teach my newborn to be patient for what he wants. Can I teach my newborn to be patient in this way?  Is there any physical/biological development happening when babies cry?  Please share any good reference about this topic. "
140,I love my step son so much but it irritates me when he compares me to his dad,"My step-son keeps comparing me to his biological father, and I don't know why.    I've been in a relationship with this woman for almost 3 years. She has been married previously and has a 6 year old son. I have a great relationship with her son. He loves me so much and trusts me a lot; there hasn't been any conflict between him and me.   I feel, however, his biological father is irresponsible:   He left his Mom when she got pregnant and had to stay home while he had to work and provide.  He is about 29 years old now and he is still in school  He doesn't have a car and he lost his driving license due to DUI several times.  He lives in his gf's apartment and works in a restaurant.    In contrast, I'm from a wealthy educated family, I am educated and have a great job with great pay, and I feel I don't have a lot in common with my step son's biological father.   My step son sees me as his role model; he always tells people that he wants to be like me when he grows up, and he once told me that his dad is smart but I'm smarter than his dad.   But there is something that he often brings up and I don't understand why: His dad is 6'4"" and I'm 6'2"" and he often tells me that his dad is a little taller than me. I always act cool about it and acknowledge that, but he keeps telling me that every couple of weeks, anyway. Why is he doing that? Sometimes he says that his dad has more hair than me too. I'm cool with the facts but when it happens frequently, it kind of gets on my nerves.   I once talked to him about his comments, and he said he understands but sometimes he brings it up again. Any idea why he does that? As well as the comparisons, he often acts protective of his dad when his dad makes a mistake and his Mom calls it out.  N.B: I never talk down about his dad in front of him. Ever. I always shield him from the frequent fights his mom and dad have. I always say that their fights doesn't make them bad people, I say to him that 'it's just your dad and your mom can't get along and that's why they aren't together'. I've never told him that his dad is a loser, I actually tell him that he is lucky to have two dads so he can learn different things from both.    Why is my step son saying the things he is, and comparing me to his biological father? "
141,How to deal with sibling/child who doesn't contribute and is stressing out their parents whom they live with?,"Context/Story  I have a sibling who's stressed/saddened their parents whom they live with, with their lifestyle. Communication is poor to nigh non-existant between parties involved. (1 parent felt like any attempt to confront the individual would've been met with 'fuck you') I've been disconnected as I've spent the last 3 years in intense schooling, mainly focused just on keeping myself afloat.  Most recent incident was a starkly silent family dinner where I felt I perceived tension/awkwardness was rather stifling.  The person in question is   Low-20s (age) currently doing work/study rotation (in post-undergraduate school with a career related part time job) to finish off a post-undergraduate degree, eventually take a related license exam. They were advised to work from home as it is dull work or something. A point of friction in the past with their parents was a few failed courses which delayed graduation. Has had a strong/unhealthy interest in playing video games from a young age &lt;= 11, parents were busy and the parenting was so-so arguably Lives at home with parents, recently moved to a small/quiet town (nice place for seniors to retire, not so great for young new-ish grads) 40 minutes from suburbia (previous town), 1 hour and 40 minutes away from a big capital city, their network of friends moving all over to pursue their careers etc.   Primary points of friction appear to be   Sleep cycle leans towards being a night owl (my understanding is this is prime time to be undisturbed as normal people are asleep, don't want to be interrupted this days for dem online multiplayer games) Absolutely awful, unapproachable and ungrateful attitude when in their early waking hours (related to 1st point) Cycling through an abundance of video games, movies, shows, etc, entertainment Lack of engagement outside of leisure/entertainment activities or social life? The house hold has recently moved to a location that's great for retiring seniors not so much new graduates. (My impression is their friends have kept in touch online and I know they play games together online.) Prefers to stay on the computer at home, leaves room for meals. Bathroom is connected to their room.  Doesn't help with chores, (grandparents used to consider this their duty and would be irritated if someone took their work as it made them feel useful, additionally parents didn't emphasize independence or helping around the house, as they wanted us to devote all our time/focus into academics) Hasn't been going out of the house much outside of work/school, I asked and they haven't been going to the gym recently.   Other Considerations  I feel it would be somewhat hypocritical for me to call them out on this as I wasn't much better either previous years, when on break from school. I believe that the fact I haven't lived at home for any extended period of time recently, makes me look better. Or at least I am out of sight and out of mind, free to live however I like and suffer the consequences of my actions.  This has been a problem for them since childhood for them (only thing they really seem to want to do is play games, which I don't know if I can blame them as I feel the same, much of the time).   A few years ago there were issues with the individual angrily screaming, yelling, punching the table and walls over online video games. A polite request to calm down, and maybe not play if the game is clearly not making them happy and just angry was met with: ""BUT IT'S A GAME I CAN'T WIN"" followed by seething with anger.  A recent discussion with the individual about this makes it seem that this should be slightly better.  What can be done?  My belief/understanding is that unless a person wants to change themselves or wants to be helped there is very little an outside party can do. But I suppose I owe at least 1 attempt at a cringey/awkward intervention, that will get brushed off before I return to being overwhelmed at school. As far as I can tell/believe there's a nasty feedback loop of snowballing.  I share little in common with my sibling besides common vices and parents. We aren't that close either and didn't like each other while growing up (I wanted computer time too, which they would be loath to share), and I've spent most of the last 3 years focusing on passing school.   What are the best things that a younger sibling can do? What are the best things the parents can do? Otherwise context is ~1st generation? Asian/American/Canadian low to middle class suburbia. We're pretty much low to no public displays of affection and don't like to talk about our feelings.  Current planned future approach  My current impression, at this point is the only effective thing to do as a sibling is state this discomfort across the entire household, and suggest they move out to survive on their own (out of sight and out of mind, no longer creating friction). Or if not make some serious effort to make their parents happy since they've sacrificed a lot to do right by us.  Though I don't know if there's any stock in my words when I wasn't much better in the past.  Follow up Hypotheticals for my current planned approach  Hypothetical 1 good/bad end?: if they were to somehow agree to move out but fall apart, are they  just a lost cause that should be truncated? My parents won't be around forever and I can't/don't want to spend my life burdened babysitting/enabling their lifestyle. I have enough trouble trying to get by.  Hypothetical 2 nothing changes: they don't want to move out, (It's a pretty sweet deal living with your parents , economically ,etc.) and doesn't change their lifestyle, doesn't help around the house.  We're still at square 1 here then.  Thank you for your time, sorry for the long post, I'd be happy to add any more details I can/feel comfortable sharing. "
142,Helping a child cope with a parent's relationships,"First- if anyone has a better title suggestion after reading this feel free to edit. I had a hard time formulating a brief description.  My oldest son is the result of a failed relationship that ended when he was an infant. I started dating my husband seriously when he was about 15 months old and then remarried when he was 4. I have always had full custody. He visits his dad more or less every other weekend, less so when he was a baby. All this time, I have been in a monogamous, stable relationship that produced two more children. We have a happy, healthy home that is grounded by a happy, healthy marriage.  On the other hand...my son's father is a womanizer. (Hence, we are no longer together, amongst other reasons.) He had several relationships when we first split; he was often staying with one girl one month and then with another the next month, which resulted in very little visitation due to his reluctance to ""freak out"" his gf's by bringing a baby home. Eventually, he found a girl that had a kid the same age as our boy and he married her. Kinda all of a sudden. They played house: since she had a kid it was now convenient for him to have his son over, so he went over there a LOT and grew close to his step mom and brother (reluctantly-this boy was not very nice to my son physically or emotionally.) Two years later it was over. On Christmas Day, when my son was FINALLY going to spend Christmas with his dad.  Within weeks of his divorce, he showed up at my house with a new gf to take my son to the zoo. I guess the play date with the kid wasn't her thing because he showed up a month later with a different girl. This girl moved in with him after about a month and now they are engaged. My son was devastated when his dad got divorced before. He still misses his step mom and step brother (it's all I can do to be sympathetic. Only because I love him I manage-they were nearly intolerably awful people). He asked me upon return from the zoo-date if he should call dad's date ""mom"" or her first name. Now, he's getting amped up for the wedding and a new step mom. I'm happy that at least this girl is nice and she seems to truly care for my son (unlike the other one playing house) but I'm concerned that all these relationships are damaging him. He asks me all the time how come daddy gets to get married all the time and I only got married once. When he was young, first of all, he didn't hardly notice, and if he did notice the ""frequency of turnover"" of his dad's partners I was able to provide fairly ""light"" and pre-school friendly answers like: ""daddy is still practicing making friends-those girls aren't mommies"" or when he got divorced I managed the explanation: ""everybody is like a puzzle. There are lots of pieces and you have to try different things to see if they fit. The last piece of everyone's puzzle is a special piece that actually fits in two people's puzzles. One piece fits perfectly into both to join them together to make one big picture (our family). Daddy thought he found a fit (like you do when you do puzzles) but it turned out the picture was mixed up and it wasn't the right piece."" That explanation was satisfying for him but, I can't help but wonder, how else, besides the strong example we have set in our home, can we teach him the value and seriousness of making good relationship choices? He idolizes his father, so I fear that he gives his father's life choices equal weight. I am not so obtuse that I don't see that equalization is logical in his mind, and in other instances an advantage (in the sense his good experiences are doubled.) But as a mother I can't help but want to mitigate or prevent harm though.   Without preaching, or criticizing his father, how can I teach my son to choose healthy relationships over lust based flings, and ultimately, the value of a marriage? The upcoming wedding is a very very big deal. I want him to have fun, and be happy for his dad, but I wish he could understand that for now, it's his dad's big day not his.  Btw-my son will be entering middle school next year. He's 10.  I realize marriage is often a religious topic, so I should mention that we are not religious, but have taught the children the basics of a few of the major world religions and about spirituality in general, so answers based in any faith (or lack thereof) are welcome.

143,Can admonishing hinder a child's mental growth?,"I recently got into a heated argument with my sister over her not admonishing her 5-year-old son. Sometimes he does things that really need a firm warning. For example, doing things that might cause physical harm like trying to walk on the couch's arm rest. Or running around opening all the doors - fridge, wardrobe, all the rooms, etc. Or eating while running around the house.    Although opening doors or eating running around isn't something wrong but it just isn't good manners.    So she tells me that he is not at an age that deserves admonishing. That's because that would hinder his mental growth. She says that warning a kid deters them from exploring and learning. I am of the opinion that manners should be taught from an early age.     What is the right amount of warning? Does it really hamper a child's mental growth?   And by warning I do not mean threatening. I mean something along the lines of ""Don't try to walk on the arm rest. You'll hurt yourself."" or ""No TV for you if you dont sit at the table and eat"". "
144,Is it considered harmful in the longer run to frighten the child so that he behaves the way we want?,Not sure if there is a cultural difference. In our family it is considered normal to frighten the child so that he behaves the way we want.  Example- Parent: Eat that quickly or the God will punish you! Parent: Don't go on the stairs. The ghost is hiding there and it'll catch you! Parent: Be quiet or the police will grab you!  Does this kind of behavior from the parent's side has any abnormal effects on the baby in the longer run? Can this behavior be accepted as normal?  Has any research been done on this aspect? 
145,Device to prevent child from loosening harness release of car seat,"My daughter, age 3, can now reach the harness release of her car seat, and has lately be defiant. And I worry about her loosening the harness while I drive. She complains she's ""too tight"", which to me means it's ""just right"".  So I'm looking to buy/build some kind of ""shield"", which:   Prevents the child seat occupant from touching the harness release. Allows a parent to reach under the shield to release the harness.   Some things I'm thinking of is, this shield:   Would be sat on and hang over the front of the seat. Could not be removed unless the harness was unbuckled.   Some concerns I have though, this shield:   Can't interfere with the child restraint's safety features Can't introduce additional risk to the child. For example, a hard device which could break and lacerate the leg.   So some questions for you guys:   Is there a device on the market like this? That accomplished the same goals. If there isn't a device already; what materials could I use? I originally considered plastic, but worried about the additional risk from breaking. Another idea is very thick leather, to prevent the child gathering it up, to get around the shield.   I've highlighted the harness release, imaged on a similar seat model.   "
146,Baby / toddler girls - is it necessary to wear swim pants to prevent infections or inflammations?,"We have just been on a beach holiday in Italy with our almost two year old girl. For a whole week she'd happily run around on the beach, sit and play with the sand, or go in the water, all the time completely naked. For us parents (and more generally in our cultures, i.e. in central and northern Europe) it was completely natural to let her be naked.  Until one day a lady seeded some doubt in my mind. She approached us and said we are in the wrong by not having our daughter wear some swim panties, because (unlike boys') girls' genitals are more susceptible to infections, inflammations, or similar, caused by sand (but not by going in the water?!). She may have meant that the sand can go up through the vagina if no panties are worn.  Is this viewpoint a reasonable cause for concern (for future beach holidays)? Anyone any ideas about this? "
147,Daughter saying whole sentences at home but not in kindergarten,"My nearly 3 years old daughter is capable of saying whole sentences by now and using them nicely while at home with us.  However the kindergarten staff claims she speaks very little and not capable of saying whole sentences.  We tried to explain them the situation, but so far they were not able to ""convince"" her to talk the same way like she does at home.  Is this a normal behavior? Should we be worried or take her to professional help?  Possible causes that I can think of are:   She can get what she want without talking too much as the staff know her very well and love her. She is very shy so maybe she's just being too shy to talk much when with other children.   Knowing the cause might help, ideas for more possible causes are also welcome. "
148,Why do babies suck their fist?,"My daughter is almost four months old. Few weeks ago she discovered and started having a lot of fun with her little hands: she keeps putting them in her mouth, she loves playing with the toys, etc.  However, recently we have noticed that she also sucks a lot on her fists. Especially from 3-4 hours before her bed time, she will start getting anxious and placing the fist in her mouth.  I did read some articles about the pain they may start having by this time, since teeth are starting to develop and this hurts them. However, and if this is the case, I wonder how can sucking their fist soothe them.  Is there any other possible explanation? Could it have to be with stomach ache? "
149,How to handle a biting toddler in the crèche?,"My daughter is in a child caring facility (a Montessori children's house, for what it's worth) in a crèche group of children from about 1 year to 3 years old. For some months now, one child from the group causes issues by biting other children severely (including my own daughter).   I do not want to make the case blaming the other child, since I do not believe that she does it with evil intents, but the situation is somehow stuck. The teachers (do you say so in this age-group?) don't really know what to do, since it tends to happen, when they are occupied elsewhere. The afflicted children are having nightmares and do not want to visit the group (last Friday I had to stay for half an hour until my daughter was ready to enter the group's room and today it's been quite the same, when my wife brought her there - usually she barely looked back when entering), and we (and other affected parents) have our duties, which means that we can't really decide to stay home with our daughter.  Voices have arisen to suspend the ""responsible"" child from the group, but we don't believe that this would be easy and the right thing to do (my wife is the parents' representative in our group). The kid is already having a hard time (she is raised bilingually and is therefore a bit ""behind"" - language-wise and I believe that her parents are getting divorced) and she would move to the older group this summer anyway.   If the facility can expound that they have done everything they can do to solve the issue, would it be reasonable to recommend the parents of the child to get professional help? How could this professional help look like and what would be a empathetic way to recommend it? "
150,How to encourage 17 month old to walk?,"TL;DR: my 17 month old son could walk 10 - 20 steps two weeks ago. But now he refuses to walk. What should I do to encourage him?  Long version: my son had some serious eating problem when he was 8 month old and this lasted for around 6 months. So we accept that his development is far behind his peers. He has not walked independently yet, and currently has only 6 teeth.  However, 2 weeks ago he started learning to walk. At that time, he really enjoyed his new skill, and he could walk on his own from 10 - 20 steps. That was in the weekend. He goes to daycare on weekdays, and in the following week, after coming back from daycare, he walked less and less. And now he just refuses to walk, in fact he seems afraid of walking.  I have no idea what happened to him at the daycare. Perhaps he tried to walk and fell down very badly.  Question: how do I encourage him to walk again?    @anongoodnurse: Yes, he still likes cruising, but he is crawling most of the time. He doesn't pull himself onto his feet, but he will walk a little bit if we hold his hand. "

152,Should we put our a child in a preschool with a primary language we do not speak?,"We have an almost 2 year old daughter and we are looking around for preschools to put her in. We are in Vancouver, Canada which has a large Chinese population and Mandarin is very common. Neither of us speak any Mandarin whatsoever.  My wife feels that our child will benefit greatly from attending an exclusively Mandarin speaking school, however I'm concerned that this will cause additional stress in the household and it may make our child feel somehow alienated.  If we do endeavor down this path, I'm confident that we will both learn the language along with our child, however neither of us is bi-lingual and I'm sure it will be a challenge. We both took the required French classes in schools, but it never really stuck for us.  Does anyone have any experience with a similar situation? What kind of hurdles are we going to need to overcome? And finally, do you think it is really worth it? "
153,Should I be concerned that my two-year-old doesn't interact with kids his age?,"I have a 22-month old boy who is currently an only child. He's a very smart, outgoing child  who has never shown any sort of developmental issues. He enjoys books and music, has an amazing memory, and is speaking in long phrases and sentences.   Both I and my wife work full time, and until recently our child spent his weekdays with his grandma.   None of our nearby relatives have kids in his age range, and he hasn't had that much interaction with children his age. We've tried a couple baby/toddler groups through the local school district, and he's encountered children in public places like the park and play areas with some frequency. We're friends with another couple who has a daughter a couple months younger, but we only see them one evening every month or two.  Recently, grandma decided to go back to work full-time. We put our child in a home daycare with a woman who takes care of her own son and one other boy (18 months and 24 months).  It's been almost two weeks now, and he doesn't seem to be adjusting. Our provider says he appears anxious during much of the day. He watches the other boys, but never really interacts or plays with them. She tells us that keeping music on does help him relax somewhat, but he's still very clingy to adults, and he tends to cry if left alone with the other two boys, even for a moment.  Some of this certainly seems attributable to being abruptly put in this new situation with new people, but it is a tad worrying to me (and our daycare provider is clearly concerned).  How worried should I be? Should I just continue to give him time to adjust? Should we be actively seeking more opportunities to have him interact with kids? Do I need to discuss this with our pediatrician? "
154,Can I save rice cereal for a baby for short periods of time?,"We've started feeding our baby rice cereal. I try to make small amounts and make more if he needs it, but sometimes I make too much.  I understand that once you've prepared rice cereal (mixed it with breast milk), you can't really put it in the fridge and save it. But is it ok to save it for an hour or two? (I just tried to feed him and he wasn't hungry. He'll probably be hungry in about an hour or so. Can I save it till then?) "
155,When will I feel the same attachment for my next child as my firstborn?,"My second child is due towards the middle of next year. This was an expected, planned pregnancy.  I have no worries or reservations about having another child. It's something my wife and I both wanted and we agreed upon the timing.  That said, I have found this pregnancy to be much less exciting and emotionally charged than the last (it's less pregnant, if you will). I know some of this is just because it's not new and many of my fears/worries about pregnancy were assuaged.   However, my lack of excitement is much more severe than I expected. I feel less emotionally invested in this pregnancy than the last.   I have read about some fathers needing a long time to feel attachment to their child, but these articles are usually about fathers who felt this with their first child. They're not about parental attachment to additional children/pregnancies.  I don't have any worries about whether or not I will love my next child as fully as possible, but I do wonder when that will happen.  Is this a common (or not uncommon) feeling during additional pregnancies? Is there any trend regarding when this attachment develops (such as during a stage of pregnancy, during labor/delivery, or some time frame after birth)?  If those questions are unanswerable, does anyone have advice on making pregnancies more exciting for the parents?  Edit: Since there have been a couple responses that I feel might have confused the question, I wanted to clarify that I'm not concerned about my ability or potential to love my new little one. I've emphasized the relevant part of the question above.  I also wanted to add that we found out the other day that we're having another son. I'm marginally more invested now that I have a more concrete image of who's coming, but I still can't help but feel a little guilty about how little excitement I'm feeling.  However, I have found that two things are helping to make me more excited:   - Trying to decide on a name for my new son  - Asking my firstborn questions such as, ""Do you think we should get a baby?""  I think these work because I'm adding to the mentality that there will actually be another person in our family soon. "
156,How to stop my 8 year old son from doubting and/or speaking against the existence of God?,"I am a Muslim, and so is my husband. Our 8 year old son is refusing to learn how to offer namaz and does not offer prayers either, and in his school, he has been slapped and beaten by teachers for questioning the righteousness of God. (In my country, which is Pakistan, it is common for boys to be beaten to motivate them to learn, this happens in every school with the exclusion of international ones, which are extremely expensive.)  Recently, he came back home with half of his face completely red. When I asked him what happened, he told me that his teacher slapped him hard for asking ""Why is God so hungry for praise?"" and although this doesn't sound too much cruel in English, in Urdu, it was said in a very harsh and informal manner, which was ""Khuda itna bhuka kiyun hai tarifen or namaz key liye?""  He keeps doing these things often, and I am afraid that one day, he will get us in a very bad situation. I do not want the scholar at school or anybody to say that we should kill him, which is becoming more and more possible. (In Pakistan, there is a law set by the government that anybody, of any age, will be hanged for speaking vilely against God.)  I cannot ask anybody for help in this case, the answer will very surely be ""Beat the blasphemy out of him!"" and I do not want that.   Is there a way I can make my son realize that there is a God, or if not, then how can I teach my son not to say things like these in front of anybody ever again and just listen? (We have already tried telling him nicely, but he never acts accordingly.) "
157,6-year-old child taking about an hour and a half to get to sleep,"When we put our 6-year-old child to bed, he can take between 45 and 90 minutes to get to sleep, if we leave and don't lie with him. If we do, it's 20 to 30 minutes. His 4-year-old brother, who sleeps in the same room, only takes 10 to 20 minutes once we leave the room.   They have a bedtime routine leading up to it, that involves gradually slowing down the activities and the bedtime is consistent. It works well for the younger child and not the older one - the 6-year-old had the same problem when he was 4.    Is the time range normal for a child of that age or is it likely to be an issue?  What other tricks can help him sleep?  "
158,"When should a child transition through the different car seats, to none, and to the front seat?","What parameters (age/height/weight) should be considered when determining which type of car seat a child should use, or whether to use one at all?  When should they be allowed to sit in the front seat?    Ideal guidelines would fill in a table sort of like this:               | Infant Carrier |    Car Seat    |     Booster    |     No Seat    |    Front Seat  | =================================================================================================== Age Range    |                |                |                |                |                | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Height Range |                |                |                |                |                | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Weight Range |                |                |                |                |                | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Citations of industry standards, publications, or laws would be appreciated.

159,How do I get an easily distracted 5 year old to eat more?,"My 5 year old who used to be on the 91st centile for height is now below the 50th and we think the gradual decline has been since he started not eating so well. We believe he only eats just enough food to keep him going because he wants to get down and play. He also eats quite slowly  compounded by his constant talking instead of eating! It's a constant battle to ask him to keep eating!  Should we feed him richer food to ""fatten him up""? Should we let him eat as much cereal as he wants before bed regardless of how little dinner he ate?  Any advice welcome!  thanks. "
160,Experience with travelling long hours in a car with a 10-week-old baby?,"I am due in ten weeks and have planned a trip to Exmouth from Perth over 2 days, 8 hours one day, 4/5 hours the next. Is this feasible with a 10-week-old baby? Has anyone done trips this long with a 10-week-old before? "
161,When and how should I teach my kids to touch-type?,"My eldest is just getting to the age where she could start getting interested in typing things on her own.   I'm wondering whether to 'go the whole hog', and give her a keyboard with no letters on (probably a homemade Das Keyboard), and a typing program right from the outset. But I'm not sure whether that might not just put her off completely.  On the other hand, if I just let her start out 'normally', she could just end up as a hunt-and-pecker who is 'good enough' to not make the effort to type properly.  Are you aware of any research or data points on this question? Failing that, do you have any experiences to recount? "
162,7-month-old boy does not want to drink,"Our baby is 7 months old, we never had any major problems in feeding him but in latest month, he is refusing almost to drink any milk or water. Currently he is drinking probably around just 20-30 ml a day.  Baby looks healthy and behaves normally and is putting on weight. Currently we are adding some water in his food.  I would like to know:   Do you have any ideas why he has this behavior? How to help him to drink more liquid? Could be connected with toothache?  "
163,Why is my toddler afraid of talking puppets?,"My 2-year-old son enjoys having stuffed animals around him as comfort objects, as well as playing with toy humans and animals. Ever since the first time he saw a talking puppet (around 18 months old, probably) he immediately avoids looking at it. This is for any kind of puppet - animal puppets, human puppets, etc.   He doesn't cry or act afraid in any way other than that he refuses to look at it, as if it kind of freaks him out. He does this for puppets in videos as well as at a live puppet show, and has even happened with hand puppets up close. What's at the root of this behavior? Is this common? "
164,Non-nutritive sucking during feeding?,"We're new parents, so a lot of ""simple"" questions.  Our boy does a lot of non-nutritive sucking during feedings.  His pattern is usually    10 minute feed (or occasionally 10 minute non-nutritive sucking) 10 minute non-nutritive sucking, or just having the nipple in his mouth 10 minute power through sucking where he really gets his food.   Is this ""normal""? Is this hurtful? The pediatrician said he should just feed for half hour, or he ends up burning more calories than he gets from the food.  WE sometimes extend to 35 and he finishes all. "
165,My 8-year-old daughter was bullied at school. What should I do and advise her to do?,"My 8-year-old daughter is a soft and gentle girl. She hardly has any friends at school and most of the time plays with no one at break time. Yesterday a guy in her class hit her, punched her and pushed her.  I asked her how she handled it and she told me that she told the teacher yet the teacher did nothing. I am not happy and I am angry seeing someone hurting my child.  What should I do? How do I deal with this situation and what shall I advise her to do? "
166,How do you prevent a toddler from waking too early?,"My 18 month old has started waking up progressively earlier every morning for the past couple of weeks.  It used to be that he would wake up between 6am-7am, which was no problem because I would wake up at 5:30am to walk the dogs.  If he woke before 6am, I'd give him some milk, change his diaper, and lay him back down, and usually he'd be asleep or quiet in his crib for at least another 30 minutes.  Now, however, I am at the point where he is waking up at ~4:45am.  I try the same approach, and if I am lucky he will be okay until 5:15am.  This is starting to wear on me, and also I can't really walk the dogs in the early morning now.  The only impact on him has been that sometimes he wants to nap in the morning instead of the afternoon, and ends up a little more tired throughout the day (nothing major though).  The weird thing is that he is SUPER consistent about what time he wants to go to bed (6:30pm).  This time hasn't changed in months.  Should I make him stay up later than he wants to in the hopes that he will sleep in later?  I don't really think ignoring him when he wakes up early would work, and it's not terribly consistent with our parenting style anyway (right now I tend to ignore him if I just hear him talking to himself...I attend to him once he gets upset...which is like 4:45am...).  Any ideas? "
167,What is the best strategy for adjusting an toddler's sleep cycle during Daylight Savings?,"With Daylight Savings coming up, we are worried about getting our son transitioned to the new time.  How do we get him to sleep an hour later, when we're struggling with keeping him from waking up before 6am as it is?  Is there any way we can avoid a long, drawn-out process of learning the ""new"" time he has to wake up and go to sleep?  Will the same techniques work for the Spring, when he winds up waking an hour earlier? "
168,How to approach the mother of the twin toddlers I babysit about their seeming developmental delay?,"I'm a mother of three grown sons and have been a nanny to dozens of children. Last year I started babysitting 3 week old twins. They were only 2 weeks early, but their development is significantly delayed. They are now 15 months old. They neither talk nor walk. Only one (the boy) pulls himself up to stand - using the table or sofa for help.   The parents don't seem concerned and are still feeding them formula and applesauce!  I'm getting very uncomfortable about the twins' developmental delay and wish the mother would discuss it with me. She is an older, first time mother (44) and doesn't want to hear anything negative. Am I concerned for nothing? I have raised dozens of children, but this is the first set of twins I've worked with since they were 3 weeks old.  If there was a problem, wouldn't the pediatrician say something to the mother? "
169,"How can a 3 years old understand and use the words ""because"" and ""why""?","I recently tried to explain to my daughter (3 years old) that she was crying a lot because she was exhausted. The reason she was so tired was because she did not sleep after lunch. When asking her why she sang rather than trying to sleep, she told me ""I did not sleep because I cry a lot"". Obviously she does not understand the words because and why (not that I am surprised given her age). But, how can I explain these words to her? Or how can I ask my questions another way so she can give me relevant answers? "
170,What to do when my 3-year-old holds poop in and won't go in diaper or on potty?,"My son is almost 3 (33 months) and for the past few months, he has been holding his poop in, to the point that he won't go for many days a time. When this started, the doctor advised us to give him Miralax to make his stool softer so it comes out more easily. Even with the Miralax, he still managed to hold it for two days at a time sometimes, but at least it was coming out at all, so we continued with it.  Anyway, we've been giving him the Miralax for months now, and now he's (supposed to be) going to preschool in September, which of course requires that he be potty trained. We don't want to hold him back since he's developmentally ready otherwise, so we started potty training a few weeks ago.  He picked up the potty training really quickly – for peeing – but he still holds his poop in no matter what. If he's sitting on the potty, as soon as he's about to do it, he stands up and just keeps holding it in (and once he starts to stand, if we even so much as ask him to sit back down, he screams and cries).  We have tried everything to convince him (or distract him enough) to sit and poop: reading books, singing songs, playing games, playing with toys, offering him snacks/treats (graham crackers), giving him stickers, etc. Nothing works.  As of today, it has been a week since the last time he pooped, with the exception of a little bit today and a little bit yesterday (both of which ended up all over the bathroom floor since he won't sit down). The doctor says now we should give him an enema to force it all to come out, but even so, that won't solve anything going forward since he still won't go in his diaper or on the potty in the first place (what are we going to do, give him an enema every week, indefinitely?).  The issue isn't that he's scared of the potty itself, since (a) he was holding it before we started potty training, and (b) he knows exactly what he's supposed to do, since he has no problem with peeing (he sits down himself, points it out afterward, knows that it gets emptied into the big potty, etc.).  It's that he just won't poop, ever – not in his diaper, not on the potty – and the only reason why anything comes out at all is because we've been giving him the Miralax every day (and even then, these aren't ""full"" poops, just whatever happens to come out because it's soft enough that he's unable to hold it all in).  I'm at a complete loss as to why this even started, and what if anything we can do that would actually help. Is it a behavioral problem? Medical? Both?? Help!    UPDATE: I just wanted to update this question since a lot has changed since I originally posted it. We discovered there was a specific situation where he would go in his diaper voluntarily: in our bedroom closet with the door closed. So we knew then that the withholding was intentional, since it was now established that he could go if he wanted to.  So we let him continue going in the closet and, over time, found that he usually went around the same time each day. Based on that, we then had him sit on the potty when we knew it was most likely he would need to go. We also managed to find two things that distracted him enough to sit (blowing bubbles and playing with his toy laptop).  By doing this, we were able to get him to go on the potty without really realizing it (so he didn't try to fight it), and then made a big deal out of it every time he did. Over time, that helped establish that that's what he was supposed to do, and now he does so voluntarily. He hasn't pooped in his diaper in probably 3 weeks by now.  I wouldn't say he's ""fully"" potty trained, in that an adult still needs to go with him and distract him (and occasionally remind him when he needs to go in general), but finally we made progress. "
171,How do I tell my 13-year-old son I am his biological father?,"I have a 13-year-old son and now that his mother and I get along well, we want to tell him that I am his biological father.  I had an on and off girlfriend at that time and when we were off I met my son's mother and he was conceived during that time. Once she found out she was pregnant she moved back to her home town, which is an eleven hour drive from where I live. I got back together with my ex and we decided to relocate so we could be close to my son. Halfway there a driver on the other side of the road fell asleep and we were in a terrible accident. Things became a bit more difficult from there. My uncle who is 3 years older than me started talking to her and one thing lead to another, they are married now with 2 kids of their own. He raised my son as his own. Needless to say every present I sent on birthdays and Christmas was returned for about a year so I eventually stopped. A lot of things happened since then and they agreed to tell him now.   Because my uncle married my son's mother they have always been a part of our family, he kind of knows me because he's seen me at family parties etc. but he doesn't yet know that I'm actually his dad. And he looks exactly like me.   Does anyone have any suggestions on how to tell him? Or what to tell him? All 3 of us will be present when we tell him. Should we then send him for counseling? What reaction can we expect? Can I ask to then have him every second weekend so we start bonding immediately? I have no idea how to approach this. "
172,How do you pass hand-me-downs to a younger sibling without fostering resentment?,"A recent blog entry that I read discussing hand-me-downs made me wonder about what it must be like to a younger sibling who receives the bulk of their clothes and/or toys as hand-me-downs, recycled from the older siblings.  As the blog points out, just because a child is the oldest doesn't necessarily mean that they won't get clothing or toys passed down to them from older children (cousins and neighbors were mentioned as being good potential sources), but in a family dedicated to saving and passing on lessons of the importance of recycling and reusing, it seems very likely that the youngest children will get far fewer ""new"" things.  The larger the family, the more this would seem to be an issue.  Do younger children tend to get frustrated by the idea that the majority of their belongings once belonged to an older sibling?  If so, what can we, as parents, do to mitigate this potential source of frustration and/or resentment? "
173,Kid throwing ice cream cone back to the vendor,"Description of the scene  A video I saw portrays a kid in the arms of a woman who (I assume) is the mother. The kid is maybe one year old (my naive estimation). They are at an ice cream shop and the vendor tricks them (now very popular among ice cream vendors) by giving them an empty cone where the kid was expecting to receive ice cream as well.  The customers are enjoying the trickery.  The kid didn't expect or appreciate the empty ice-cream cone. She then throws the empty cone at the vendor and starts a (fake, IMO) cry. In the shop, everybody laughs (including the mother) and the ice cream vendor quickly gives the ice cream to the kid.  The mother's reaction  I'm not judging the woman's response, but trying to put myself in this position and think about what a good reaction would be. I am well aware that this is just one recording and getting ice cream for this kid can be an exceptional moment. That being said, this video appears to be bad parenting to me (I am not a parent and know little to nothing about parenting)  The kid expresses anger by throwing the cone and then cries toward their mother to immediately get what they wanted. This might teach the kid that for any trouble, anger and cry is the good reaction to have. Also, the mother's reaction to laugh might lead the kid to think his mother does not care about their emotional distress or even that she enjoys seeing them angry.  Question  What would be the ideal response on the part of the mother?  Should she have punished her kid for throwing the cone? If yes, what type of punishment? Should she have refused the ice cream from the vendor or at least delay the reception of the ice cream by the kid?  "
174,Are deli cut meats bad for a 15-month-old?,"We've been feeding our 15-month-old deli ham for dinner pretty regularly.  Recently, a family member was alarmed that we were feeding him any kind of deli meat because it is ""bad for them"".  We typically get Prima Della Black Forrest Ham or Oven Roasted Chicken.  As usual, the collective wisdom of Google muddies the water, so I'm wondering if deli meats are a big no-no?  If so, can somebody point us to a realistic meal plan? "
175,What credentials are available to identify a babysitter as trustworthy?,"Following on the heels of What are some good places to find trustworthy babysitters?, once we are interviewing potential babysitters, what should we look for to identify them as trustworthy?  Of course there's ""chemistry"", where you just gauge the vibe you get from talking to the person, and how well your kids like them during the interview; but that's very subjective and going to differ from person to person.  I'm more interested in things that the dedicated babysitter can do to help assure the parents that their children are in good hands:   CPR and First Aid certifications would make me feel better, but I doubt I would have made the time to get them at that age INA - International Nanny Association (which I only mention because it's mentioned on sittercity.com) A background check would be nice, but performing it myself or through a service could be expensive/invasive/time consuming and it would be nice if it was just something offered through a service.   What else should you look for? "
176,How to convince an adult son to seek medical help?,"Our son who is 26 is seeking a restraining order against us, his parents. We did not have any problem whatsoever for the first 25 years. After that, he had a career failure. We suspect he developed a mental problem after that.   He stopped communicating to us and to many of his friends). For several months he was talking reluctantly when he was visiting us. For the last seven months, we have not seen or talked with him at all. He blocked our phones, does not answer e-mails, we don't know where he lives. Before that, he answered one of my e-mails saying he has PTSD and needs some time alone. After that, several attempts to contact him by phone or e-mail failed.  Actually, he blames us based on those attempts. We don't care if he wins it or not, but we must do something to convince him to seek a medical help. I hope we'll see him in court and will be able to say several words to him. My wife (his mother) wants to say we love him, but I think this is exactly what he hates about us. We are not ""helicopter parents"", though perhaps I was overprotective. But anyway, we were friends for the 25 years of his life.   What can I say to him? Should I say anything? Maybe anybody who was in my son's shoes can advise? "
177,7 year old son is soiling himself,"my 7 year old son is soiling himself. he can use the bathroom for #1 but he never goes for #2. he either ""sharts"" or poops a little just enough to stain his underwear. and holds the rest in. I have to force him to go poop and when he does his poops are huge. I've tried so many things. he tells me he doesn't know when he poops himself. had anyone experienced this?? and what have you done to correct it? I'm losing all patience and need help! "
178,How do you respond to a teenager who has started to smoke?,"How can you best handle this?  Coming off as too strong and authoritative might invite ""rebellion"".  Too lenient makes it seem okay.

179,Why would a hospital not allow the recording of a baby's ultrasound video while in the lab?,"I took my wife to take our first ultrasound. I was told be an operator/receptionist while we made an appointment that it is OK to bring a camcorder with us. But when we were there, the ultrasound technician told us another story. She said that camcorder is not allow to record our baby but they can provide us a 3 min copy of ultrasound movie from the lab's monitor instead. (Actually I wanted to see my wife face when she saw our baby for the first time, but DVD still better than nothing)  Is this a common practice in US or in PA? Is it the law? All my friends have their first ultrasound video to keep a good memory. (My friends are not in the US.) I still do not understand why they are not allow us to shoot our VDO.  "
180,When do infants and/or toddlers develop survival instincts?,"I am a father of a 10 month old son. I love to observe my son acquiring and developing new skills like crawling, responding to questions, and imitating other's behavior. Moreover, I was flabbergasted when I witnessed my son operating our TV remote.  As a recent development, I observed a new skill in him yesterday. He crawls on carpet freely with out any problem, he enjoys it. Yesterday, we (my wife and I) wanted to see how he would respond to crawling in grass. We left him in the middle of a small grass field. I think he felt the grass poking his palm and knees and then ,to our surprise, we saw him for the first time standing himself straight up without any support and stood up for at least 20 seconds and then carefully came down to a sitting position, maintaining the balance. Our jaw dropped with that sight. I could not believe that my son stood up without our or any thing's support. With that event, I totally forgot to capture the sight in my phone. I waited for 15 more minutes after that with my phone camera on to try capture the same sight again, but all in vain. He did not like the grass to crawl on, in the first attempt I guess.  Now my questions are:     How and when do infants &amp; toddlers create or develop the ""survival instinct""? By survival instinct I mean my son wanted to avoid the grass and instantly he got the instinct or a reflex to stand up. Is this behavior part of the genetics of Homo Sapiens? I am curious to know what else kids/infants/toddlers learn from instinct which was never taught to them?  "
181,How to get new 'earworm song' for six year old boy?,"My six year old boy has heard Sir Mix A Lot's song Baby Got Back. (From a movie I think).   The chorus has the right mixture of irreverent delight that would appeal to a six-year old.   The challenge is that we hear it at breakfast and dinner - every day for the last month. I like big XXXXs.   So it's time for a new song. But how? What would logically replace that song in his mind, and be appropriate?  My question is: How to get new 'earworm song' for six year old boy? "
182,How do you keep a toddler safe around water?,"We recently moved to a bigger apartment complex which has swimming pool, play area etc. My son who is 2 years and 9 months old is very excited about the place. Most of the times he sticks to the play area playing with sand, sliders and swing. But sometimes he walks near to small fountains near kids area. It's a garden fountain and though it's just 10cm deep, he peeps in and tries to catch water. Also he wants us to take him near the swimming pool.  How much ever we explain, at that moment he says ""no water"". But he continues doing same next time.  He is not understanding the seriousness of water. We have not yet started teaching swimming to him.  How to explain him about the dangers of water? At the same time we don’t want him to be afraid of the water as he has to learn swimming some time sooner. Please help me how to resolve this issue.   What I am thinking is if we allow him to the kids' pool with proper floaties, swim vests, or inflatable tubes and of course we will be present all time, he will enjoy and also he will be satisfied with water and stop pestering us by going near fountains and pools himself.   Please guide me if you have any other suggestions/tips.  Also whats the right age to start swimming classes for him? "
183,Could cold/flu-induced asthma lead to other triggers later in life?,"My 15-month-old is currently going through her second bout of a cold-induced asthma. It's relatively minor as this time my wife and I are better prepared - the first time did require a trip to the emergency room, and was much more scary.  Anyway, my question is whether anyone has experience with an infant and toddler who developed a virus-induced asthma trigger first, specifically a cold or flu, and developed a second or third unrelated trigger as an older child?  Personally, I've been asthmatic (exercise-induced, mostly) for most of my life, although today is fairly well managed. I remember many trips to the hospital, especially when I was 5 to 10 yrs old, although I do not remember asthma attacks related to viruses.  Anecdotally speaking, has anyone else experienced a similar link?  "
184,How to remove brown stains from colored underwear?,"Our long period of potty training is still ongoing, and at the moment, a lot of underwear it falling victim to that.  After washing by hand with clear water and washing in the washing machine at 60 °C, there still remain brown stains in many of the (colored) pants. What is a good way to get rid of those stains?  There was a similar question about cloth diapers How do you remove stains from cloth diapers?, but sunning is not an option during fall and winter and bleaching in general does not work well with colored clothes, I suppose.  (Should somebody propose to just trash the stained underwear, this is not acceptable for us, as is is not only a question of cost but also a waste of ressources, especially as we need really many of them at the moment - sometimes 1..5 per day) "
185,My 18 month old cries when he realizes that he made a mistake,"I have a parenting situation where I'm unsure of the right behavior.  My 18 month old child is usually shy and doesn't mingle with people easily, but if someone spends time with him and goes a little slow, he becomes friendly and responds.  Few days back we went to a 3 year old's birthday party. There were many children of different ages, mostly between 1 to 4 years.  My kid wanted to play, but as there were many unknown faces he roamed around holding my finger (I tried many times but he was not ready to let go of my finger while walking around.) He danced to his favorite songs and played, but all the while with me or his mother nearby.   Suddenly he mistook my friend for me, and holding his finger started to dance and play. Everyone in the party knew he had made a mistake and all were amused.  Soon he saw me in front and realized that he was holding someone else's hand. Everyone burst into laughter (including me), but he started crying. I didn't like that. Was I wrong to laugh?    A similar incident happened at a store where the light was dim and he mistook a lady for his mother, and when he realized his mistake, he started crying again. I really felt bad when he cried and I told him, ""It's OK"", and tried changing the mood.  What are some of the ways I can best respond to him when such a situation arises? How can I teach him not to cry, or to believe that he has done nothing wrong when something like this happens? "
186,Why did these two pre-schoolers swap their tantrum behaviour?,"I have just noticed this in 2 boys, aged 3,4.  The 3 year old used to throw tantrums quite frequently over trivial matters (such as me holding the ball I'm throwing in the right rather than the left hand).  He stopped doing this somewhere in the last 3 or 4 months, while the older one started throwing tantrums over similarly minor things.  When the younger one would throw the tantrums, the older one used to quietly watch (kind of in awe or taken aback).  He would look at the younger one as if puzzled by the behaviour.  Now the older one has taken on the frequent tantrums, and the younger one looks on in awe.  I'm not sure what's going on here.  I'd like to reduce the frequency of the tantrums, but the weird thing to me is the behaviour swapping.  Will this continue to happen? (ie tantrums from one but not the other and vice versa, in periods?) "
187,"How does a child develop ""handed-ness""?","I've noticed that my son generally experiments fine motor skills initially using his left-hand (stacking, eating with utensils, coloring) and then shifts to using his right more often.  I'm honestly not sure if there's a hand he prefers or if he just goes with the one that's closer to the object to be manipulated.  When does a child typically settle on a dominant hand?  Additionally his grandfather (mother's father) is ambidextrous, is that a genetic trait that's often passed along? "
188,How can I deal with my 12-year old son's rebellious behaviour?,"My son is a very loving child and fun to be with usually....ever since he turned 12 he is suddenly the resident expert in the house on anything from how to drive a car to how become president. You sense the sarcasm here?   He loves to argue and thinks suddenly that every rule is meant to be broken. We have always had strict discipline in our home so this should not be a shock for him when he has a consequence for poor choices, yet he acts appalled and says all sorts of hurtful things. His favorite phrase is ""well how do you know?""   He is a smart kid but get only c's and b's. The teachers are constantly after him to make more of an effort. His room is a disaster, he thinks he only needs to shower one time weekly and I feel as though I have become a nag nonstop!   I know it's developmental, but how much do you let go and how much do you ride them for? I guess I never though teenage years started at 12! Any thoughts or suggestions would be helpful! "
189,Should I show more anger when unhappy with a child's actions?,"I am naturally a very conserved and patient person. I think this is sometimes confusing to a 4 year-old, who can easily tell when his mother is unhappy with him due to her tone of voice. For me, I may tell him to stop (or else, etc.), in a matter-of-fact tone of voice, which generally doesn't do anything unless he is pre-inclined to agree.  The time when it is most annoying is when I don't think the action itself requires disciplinary action. It is just annoying me. Like constantly buzzing his lips and blowing raspberries. Apparently, he can enjoy doing it for long periods of time, and really if he's having fun with it, should I care? Usually I might ask him to stop, but then just let it go, because I don't want to put him in time-out for it.  Meanwhile, his mother can just say his name in a warning tone of voice and he'll stop. It's worth mentioning that he is not as familiar with me. We've known and been around each other pretty often for almost 6 months.  Should I make more effort to say my words in a different tone of voice? Should I be more harsh, and start using time-outs even though his choice of fun is just annoying me a bit? Or do I just continue as I have been, and rely on the fact that eventually we'll better understand each other and he'll grow out of it? "
190,Does scaring children really traumatize them?,"I'm not talking about scaring as a way of enforcing desirable behaviour, like ""eat your veggies or the bogeyman will get you"". I'm not even talking about serious scares like faking somebody's death. Just the regular ghost sounds, jumping up from behind with a ""boo!"", inside out eye lids...  As an older sibling, I did this to my brother and cousins all the time. They'd have a laugh too, after the initial scare. I still love to scare people, and I do it to my nephews aged 4 and 5. My husband feels that I'm scarring them or traumatizing them by doing that. I argue that they don't show signs of being deeply affected by it. They still like having me around. Husband argues back saying it's because they like other things I do with them, like playing and reading, and I'm family. But if I keep up the scaring, they may start to avoid me.  I obviously don't want to wait till that happens. So my question is, does scaring children really traumatize them? As I said before, I keep it ""age appropriate""- at least according to me. Is that bad too; is any kind of scaring bad? Kids enjoy the occasional scary joy ride, though. So where do we draw the line?  P.S : My question concerns pre-schoolers above the age of, say 4, as I do think scaring babies confuses and upsets them.  Update : The parents don't mind as long as the the kids are occupied and aren't crying/complaining, which they don't, on being scared. (They do shout or run at the initial scare, I mean to say that it doesn't escalate beyond that) I've asked the parents, the kids haven't been particularly afraid of the dark or going into a room alone. "
191,How do toddlers pick their first words?,"My son has a pretty eclectic selection of vocabulary.  Some words seem to have been picked up from my wife and I repeating them (such as ""uh-oh"" and ""daddy"").  Others seem to have been learned without us doing much to single them out (""balloon"", ""blue"", and ""duck"" for example).  Other words we've been trying to teach him (see here) seem unaffected by repetition.  Some words he's learned seem completely random.  For example, when looking at my iPhone booting up, he pointed to the Apple logo, and said ""ball"".  I said ""that's not a ball, that's an apple"", and he immediately smiled and said ""apple"" quite clearly.  Yet he doesn't seem to associate the word with the logo, or even my phone, as it seems to be a catch-all word to him (it is now his favorite words, but seems to be used for anything from ""I'm bored"" to ""hello!"" to ""oooo! Look at the wind chime!"").  I can't seem to figure out what the pattern (or patterns?) is to how he chooses his words.  Is there one? "
192,Should I encourage my 2 year old to figure things out on her own?,"My daughter loves books and we regularly read tons of books to her everyday. She can sit and listen to the same book over and over for 30 min+. Earlier this week, we bought new books for her and these books have questions/games related to the stories at the end.  Sometime when she does not know the answer, she simply says she does not know and wants me to tell her the answer.  Another example is with an art and craft activity where she glues paper, feather, and beans to make animals. She holds the glue stick different from me and I would rather let her hold it the way she wants but my wife wants to tell her to hold it like us.  I was tempted to tell it to her the answer or what to do but I also want her to figure things out on her own. If she cannot do it yet then I will let her skip and come back later. I think if I just tell her the answer when she says she does not know then she will rely on me and does not want to think on her own.  Should I encourage her to figuring things out on her own? What are some good strategies to encourage my daughter to figure things out on her own? Any recommendations for this situation? "
193,How to go about regaining the trust of my child?,"After divorce, the mother got custody of our now 12-year-old daughter.  The mother has committed at least 9 (provable) acts of transgressions  indicating active application of parental alienation, most of which is still continuing. The Parental alienation syndrome (PAS) is the effect it has on our daughter. Due to its insidious nature, the parental alienation took place over two-plus years to reach this current state at which I at last woke up to it. Previous to this period the relationship was fine and normal.  Having experienced PAS, my child is very reticent and unresponsive to my attempts in rebuilding our relationship. The condition is very much like sulking, but with an externally inflicted cause.  I have intermittent telephonic access (controlled by the mother: I call her and ask to talk to my daughter), and see my daughter twice a week for less than an hour each time. I want to use these accesses to try and salvage something of a relationship with my daughter.  I've looked at legal options but will not take that route - can see only harm and stress affecting my daughter on top of the PAS. I've informed the mother that I'm aware of what is going on, but no helpful response from her side (yet), but I'm working on it, although I'm not holding my breath.   What approaches can I try to invoke interest, cooperation and joint bonding experiences? What can I do to (re)bond with my daughter? "
194,Can learning sign language be harmful for babies' speech development?,"   Possible Duplicate:   Does using sign language really accelerate a child&#39;s ability to speak?       I am considering teaching my 8-month-old sign language, and I can't sneeze without finding resources extolling the virtues of sign language for babies (most of which use subjective arguments, like easing you baby's frustration).  However, I worry that signs could end up as a ""crutch"", and might hinder my daughter's verbal speech, and maybe even hinder her communication in general (verbal or nonverbal).  Are there any actual studies showing that teaching babies sign language is helpful?  Even a study that concludes it doesn't hurt would make me feel better. "
195,Programming with a baby,"I'm wondering what parents programmers (or really any working-at-a-computer job) have to say about staying at home with an infant while trying to get some work done; is it at all feasible?  How much work might you actually do?  Long term or short term, one child or several; not real relevant right now to me, but I've often wondered. "
196,My 2.5 years old daughter asks to learn to read,"My daughter is a big fan of books. She can spend one hour in a row looking at her books, and often asks my wife and me to read her a story.  We are a french family.  For 2 weeks, she's been looking at words written in the books and mimics the act to read with her finger. Then, she says she wants to learn to read.  So, my question is : how to teach a young child to read? Is it possible? I learned to read with the ""methode boscher"" (french book), where each letter is decomposed into a sound, then concatenated (P + A gives ""PA""), but I'm not sure she could understand that.  Finally, I tried to make her guess words beginning with a particular sound, an exercise I already saw in prelearning reading. But she didn't understand the exercise. "
197,How to get toddler's mind off of a single topic (vehicles),"Our son turned two a month ago. We spend a lot of time with him and give him many different toys and books to play with and learn. He used to be interested in all of it; until ~3-4 months ago. Now, his conversation is dominated by trains, planes, helicopters, cars and busses. We can not talk about anything else with him, after every few words, comes a sentence about sitting in a train, or him pretending his hand is a airplane or interrupting us with ""toot-toot traaaaain Choo Chooooo!"". At this point, he makes 4-5 word sentences, a couple of sentences at a time; but all about the same things.  At first, we were just happy he could talk at length (in his limited vocubulary, with many repeats) about the various modes of transportation, but now we fear that it has reached a point of obsession. How do we temper his love of all things with wheels? Or, is this a phase that he will grow out of?  We took away all his cars, trains etc and provided alternative toys that were new to him (this didn't help); A week later, we gave him lots of vehicular toys to see if the obsession dampens (no signs of that happening so far). We also try distracting him: He absolutely loved looking at all the animals at the zoo, but the next day we were back to talking about trains. We regulary go out to cycle on his balance bike - again, he loves it, but will try to zoom across the road if he sees an airplane or a bus.  We would love for him to learn about and explore other things, and, not have repeat conversations about the same topics again and again and again. "
198,Toy safety 3 years old - what are the reasons?,"What motivates the 3 year old limit for toy safety?   To make it clear, I am not referring to the choking hazard itself. It is obvious that small parts present a danger and accidents can occur when small children play with toys intended for older children.   My question rather refers to what is behind the 3 year old limit. Is it motivated by biological / anatomical development, i.e., are > 3 year olds capable of coughing to get small bits unstuck from their throats? Or is it behaviour, i.e., 3 year olds can be trusted to not put small bits in ther mouths? Or something else? In other words, why does the standard say 3 years? "

Bad, because it is false motivation? No interest in learning as such?

200,2 year old demands milk midnight,"my younger son turned 2 in June, he has a sleep issue that worries me and my wife.   He fells asleep at late hour like 10pm every night only after long cuddling. He always wakes up around 3am demanding milk, and flies into a tantrum screaming at the top of his lungs if his demand is not satisfied, a few times he ended up throwing up.  We resisted his demands as much as we can, on the advice of at least two doctors; besides he has a cavity in one of his teeth. It's hard. The doctor says one week would see things improved, but now it's been like that for months and there is no sign that he wants to change his pattern!  Sometime I figure that maybe it's just that my boy is different: he has a good appetite and he a big in his age, maybe he just feels hungry. On a separate but not irrelevant note, he is a little slow in speaking and he is very stubborn! He seems to have a strong attachment to me since I gave him most company.    What should we do now? Keep holding our ground or just giving in to make him happy and give ourselves a break? "

He was born 2 months early, so his adjusted age (equivalent age for a full-term baby) is about 6½ months and his development is approximately at that stage according to our pediatrician.  I've read several  about babies sleeping in their own rooms as early as one week after birth. The American Academy of Pediatrics suggests that waiting at least 6 months mentions that this view is shared by the UK Department of Health:     On the basis of their study results, investigators in Scotland   endorsed the United Kingdom Department of Health’s advice that the safest place for   an infant to sleep is in a crib in the parents’ room for   the first 6 months of life.   We are considering moving our child to his own bed since he is at the equivalent age of a 6½-month full-term baby. However, we still have a few questions for those that have dealt with this decision before:   Are there other medical aspects to consider before moving the baby to his own room? Based on your personal experience, what challenges should we expect? Also based on your personal experience, which of your worries could have been dismissed?  "
202,"8 month old not babbling, when to worry and what to worry about","My wife and I have two boys: a 3-yr old toddler and an 8-month old infant. The toddler is doing extremely well with all physical/motor and emotional/intellectual/communication aspects.  My 8-month old, physically, is also right where he should be. He's crawling, sits up by himself, is starting to pull himself up on to things (yikes), rolls over, picks stuff up with both hands, etc. No concerns there whatsoever.  We also have a copy of the de facto standard, Baby 411, which cites a whole slew of autism screening questions, and again, absolutely no concerns on the autism front: he makes strong eye contact, enjoys being around us and his older brother, cuddles with stuffed animals, is not ""off in his own world"", etc. No concerns.    What I am becoming concerned about is his language/communication skills. This is one area where we've seen relatively no development since he was a newborn. On one hand:   He does squeal and laugh when he's really worked up and happy   Extremely rarely, we'll get a quick ""Ahhh"" (vowels only, no consonants)  He cries when he's upset He absolutely can hear (we've tested this thoroughly - sneaking up behind him and making a noise to see if he turns his head, etc.) He does seem to respond to his name by making eye contact with us   But, on the other hand:   He's 8 months old, and not a single consonant sound (not a single ""Ba"" or ""Ga""), etc. When we engage him isolated and directly (without our toddler there to disrupt), he just doesn't seem interested in communicating back and forth with us; either that, or he just doesn't ""get"" that he can try to engage us back; it just doesn't occur to him     Finally, my question:  If you ask the Google Gods ""8 month old not babbling when to worry""-and similar queries, you'll get an ocean of blogs and forums of parents with identical stories to ours. And in almost every case they get the same regurgitated/canned responses:     All babies are different and acquire skills at different rates.   Yes, I understand that, but: if my son is still not verbal at, say, 30 years of age, clearly something is wrong. So my point is that, at some point between 8 months and 30 years of age, he'll cross over a barrier where it's no longer acceptable to just chalk his lack of communication up to ""All babies are different.""  So my question(s) is:   What is this barrier/when is this point? At what age do you finally worry that he may have some learning disability, or something else going on? Once a child crosses over this barrier, what are some concrete/actual causes for lack of communication (when neither autism nor physical/hearing disability are present)?   Update 3/9/2016:  About 3 weeks after posting this question, my son started babbling and using consonants (of course!). He's now 11 months and jabbers/babbles constantly, says ""Da!"" when he looks at me, and occassionally acknowledges my wife as ""Mom!"" (lol). So he's not quite at ""Dada/Mama"" yet, but I have faith he'll be there soon. I'll post updates to this from time to time as I think it may help other parents.  Update 10/4/2016:  Our little guy is 18 months old now and is exactly where he should be on the milestone chart (below, under the accepted answer). He barely made a noise for the first 8 - 9 months, then started becoming more and more verbal in his 9th/10th month. And now he's got a repetoire of dozens of words that he says with correct annunciation (more or less) and under the right circumstances. He's even starting to put 2- and 3-word sentences together (I love you, etc.).  All this to say, that we're no longer even remotely worried about him, and I advise any other parents with the same concerns that we had to read through all the answers to this question. The accepted answer was truly the best, but many of the other upvoted answers provided a lot of great guidance and emotional support. "
203,Discussing early literacy tools with parents,"I have three couple-friends, all with toddlers (12-14 months), who rarely ever involve literacy in their child's lives. As an educator and researcher I know how strong a correlation early reading has with academic life, and I'd like to see my friends children have access to all the opportunities reading has to offer.   Currently, every one of the couples spends their entire evening unwinding by zoning out on the couch. I think unwinding is completely deserved of all working adults, but some of that time could be put to good use interacting with books, papers, even mail.   I have the resources and experience to have the chat, but I'm wondering how to best structure discussion on the subject without making anyone feel targeted. How, as a parent with a legitimate interest in your child's well-being, best like to hear constructive criticism? And how would that discussion be structured?   "
204,How can we teach our 5-year-old daughter to be patient?,"Our 5-year-old daughter is so impatient. She wants everything to happen the moment she asks us to do it. For example, when she is watching cartoons and the episode ends, she asks us if we can check if there is a cartoon the moment it ended. She asks me for water and when I'm walking to the kitchen, she asks again. You get the gist.   How can we teach her to be patient? Is not changing the channel when she asks us to check if there is a cartoon and tell her to be patient a good solution? "
205,Techniques for teaching children from the start about how to read advertising?,"I took a class in high school that taught media literacy and it has been one of the few learning experiences in high that really stuck with me. I'd like my boy to learn from the beginning, when he's just starting to see advertising, how to read and understand how advertisers are trying to manipulate him.  We already live in a household without much advertising (get TV from Netflix so there are no commercials, avoid websites with ads, etc) so it's jarring when we leave our house and are bombarded with billboards, buses wrapped with ads, and flying banners, and the ads on the TVs in airports.  The obvious thing would be to talk about the ads when we see them and explain to him what they are trying to do. Are there are formal techniques for teaching media literacy to young children? Does a household without advertising make it better or worse for a child to understand what they are seeing? "
206,How long does chilled breast milk last after taking from the refrigerator?,"I took a bottle of breast milk out of the refrigerator and forgot about it. At room temperature, how long is it good for? Can I put it back in the fridge? "
207,My 4.5yr-old girl is afraid of death. What should I do?,"Last night my wife (as usual) was putting our 4.5yr-old baby girl to sleep. Our daughter becomes very chatty at that time and (especially in the presence of mom) expresses thoughts and things that happened during the day. Just then, our daughter told her mom that her eye is hurting her and if this a sign that she is going to die. My wife politely explained her that this is not the case. My daughter then asked if there are certain parts of the body that when they hurt mean she is going to die, and finally she said that she is afraid of death and she does not want to die.  2-3 days ago I had a discussion with my girl during playtime when she decided that one of her dolls is dead. I explained to her that if she (the doll) is dead, she'll never wake up again, and that is ok, because everybody eventually dies in the end, and this is the way of life.  Are those two events correlated? Was I too cynical? What should we do now?  "
208,At what age does a toddler stop being a toddler?,"I just told someone on parenting that a baby becomes a toddler when it starts moving around. The question which came back was ""what age does a toddler stop being a toddler?"".  That got me searching, and I found at least one reference that said ""Toddlers are babies from one year to four years of age"".  I'd never consider a four-year-old as a baby. Is this just me, or a geographical difference? "
209,My 5 year old's second language: Why is it not coming naturally?,"I live in Israel. I am a native English speaker. My wife is Israeli. My five-year-old son speaks Hebrew.  He understands when I talk in English.  But he has a lot of difficulty in saying a sentence in English on his own.  He will say it in Hebrew, I will tell him to say it in English, he'll repeat it in Hebrew.  Then I'll tell him 1 of the words in English.  Then he can sometimes stumble through the sentence, as if having told him one of the words has triggered in his mind the recollection of the other words.  He translates words pretty well from English to Hebrew.  The other direction is a bit more difficult.  My questions are:  a) Is it because I am his only English speaking exposure that his English is not ""natural"" to him., i.e., if it were true that kids pick up languages so quickly, then, why is it still so hard for him to speak in English?  b) How can I help him improve his English:  (he hates the effort that I ask him to put in to try to talk in English)  c) Could it be that my enunciation is not so good, and that is a major problem? Should I work on speaking more lucidly and clearly?  Also, another problem is that recently he has developed problems in his Hebrew, mixing up the sounds sh and s - in fact; I noticed he is copying how some other kids in his pre-school are talking :(  I expect he will learn English with time and patience and perseverance.  But the question is, why is it not coming to him naturally and spontaneously and organically like everyone says it should be for kids, and like his Hebrew was?     P.S.: He also has English exposure from songs on CDs/tv shows. Instead, it seems to come to him as it does to an adult, in a rigid logical way. As if he stores everything in Hebrew, and translates all English to Hebrew before handling. i.e., as if he does not think in English, only Hebrew.  I guess that it's just a silly myth that all kids are magically amazing language learners.... "
210,Should I try to long-distance parent or will I do more harm than good?,"My long distance ex and I have a 4 year old son and we're trying to figure out what to do post-breakup.  A little backstory, we've always been long distance (different countries) and we've been very on-and-off. I've TRIED being there to a certain degree (lots of facetime calls, trips to see them, etc.) but we're not really bonded the way a father and son probably should be.  I'm not really a good dad I don't think. I try my best, but parenting doesn't come naturally to me and I don't find it particularly fulfilling. I also haven't been physically around enough to get ""better"" at it.  At this point I'd pretty much only be sticking around to do the right thing, but I don't want to do more harm than good. I'm not looking for judgments of my character here, and there's a lot I'm leaving out. I'm purely concerned with what's best for my son within that framework.  Does anyone have a background in child psychology or even personal experience with anything like this? Is it better for a kid to have a long distance not-very-good dad or is it better to step away completely so that the ""father figure"" role can be filled by someone else? Is there some kind of middleground? "
211,How can I keep my infant from sleeping while bottle feeding?,"We've been trying to get our infant on a schedule, but he tends to fall asleep before he's done eating, which makes it challenging, because he doesn't finish, and wakes up hungry too early. It also makes it more difficult to burp him and once or twice he has choked a bit on the milk.  He's exclusively bottle-fed. I don't know of any other way to properly support a newborn for feeding other than holding him, which I'm sure makes him warm and very comfortable – who wouldn't fall asleep?  Does anyone have any suggestions for how to help him stay awake during feedings so he can finish safely and completely? "
212,How to breastfeed exclusively in a joint custody situation,"I have a friend who is single and finds herself pregnant unexpectedly. She and the father have no relationship at this point and don’t plan to, other than co-parenting, from separate households.  It will be a joint custody arrangement from the start, with my friend, the mom, having primary custody and dad regular weekend/overnight visitation. Or so she plans.* She also plans on exclusively breastfeeding her baby, perhaps bottle feeding breast milk, but definitely wants to avoid formula (for cost and health reasons).   Anyway...  She has been asking me for lots of advice, seeing as I have 4 kids she figures I have all the answers (HA!) but especially she asks me about BF’ing (Breastfeeding) because I’m the only person she knows who’s done it and feels comfortable enough discussing it with her. I do have a lot of experience about lots of stuff, and BF’ing for sure, but one area I don’t have any experience with is how the logistics of EBF (exclusive breastfeeding) works, or doesn’t, in a situation where dad will potentially be taking the baby overnight or for the weekend, which is the situation she’s contemplating.   Obviously, advice in that scenario is going to be different than in a two-parent home, or if formula feeding, or if single parenting totally solo. I don’t want to give her advice that won’t be practical for her. Of course, a lot of what I have to offer is relevant and useful-latch techniques, engorgement, over/under supply, back pain, bras, etc-but she’s also asking me stuff like:   How will I keep up my milk supply over the weekend/night? How many bottles do I need?  How will I know how much milk to send since I can’t measure intake per session?   I can attempt to answer these questions, based on my experience, but I think it would be more beneficial to her if I can provide her with answers based on the wider experience of this community.   I say “or so she plans” because this what she talks about with me, as someone who has no idea what the hell she’s gotten herself into. None of us did, as first time parents, even if was our plan to become parents! But, in her case specifically, she didn’t plan on having children. In her mind, with being single and all she figures she will need either the time to rest or to catch up on “everything else” and so justifies the time away from baby. I personally don’t see how this plan will be feasible, having been through the “4th trimester” X4. I can’t imagine packing up my newborn baby, breastfed or not, and sending him off for the night or weekend. First of all, because I know I’d spend the night/weekend strapped to a pump, and certainly won’t be “resting” or getting “anything else” (never mind “everything”!) done. And then there’s the anxiety/longing because of the separation. However, before I make assumptions about how she will feel (maybe she won’t miss her baby like I did when I left mine for even a few hours or consider 12 pumping sessions in 24 hrs for 3 days straight as tortuous and not “restful” at all), I’d like to know if anyone else has direct experience with this situation or something similar.  I’d rather give her information that is experience/fact based than on speculation, even if it not my own. I appreciate that my friend thinks I know it all, but I don’t.    I want to be as supportive as I can, but I also want to help her have realistic expectations. I think she has some ideas (as ALL parents-to-be do) that aren’t quite...practical...in regards to this custody thing (which is still not set in stone) and breastfeeding, and how they influence each other. I am not trying to dissuade her from either the custody arrangement or breastfeeding-I really just want to give her solid advice as to how she could pull it off and then let her decide if that’s how she wants to proceed.

213,How old does a child have to be to start using a pacifier?,"I guess I'd have to say I'm still struggling with this question, which is why I'm throwing it out here for others to answer: what is your feeling on giving pacifiers to young children, and how old does a child have to be to start using a pacifier?  I know that many people frown on using pacifiers, but when my kids are crying, sometimes I just need to get them to calm down, and giving them a pacifier is one option I use to try and calm everyone down. Besides, there's something strangely funny about seeing my daughter put TWO pacifiers in her mouth.  Anyway, what are your experiences with them, and how young is too young? "
214,How to make my son stop pulling my clothes?,My son is now around 6 years old. Today he pulled my sister's clothes in a gathering. This is so embarrassing. He did this after a few months.   What does this gesture mean and how do I make him realize that this is not permissible? Shall I punish him?  
215,What are some good places to find trustworthy babysitters?,"Our children are 3 and 10 months, and we're thinking about finding a regular babysitter so that we can get out of the house a little more often.  In the past we've relied on nearby family, a high school aged neighbor, and another couple in our neighborhood that we're good friends with. Unfortunately, though we know a lot of people, most of whom are happy to take our kids, not many of them are geographically close to our home.  But these days...   Our nearby family is less and less of an option as they appear to be starting their own baseball team ;) The high school aged neighbor is no longer trustworthy (He was house-sitting for other friends in the neighborhood and decided to take their car for a joy ride... when he was 13! His dad's response? ""But he's a good driver!"") The couple we would sort of trade babysitting with work opposite schedules and have limited time to see each other, let alone take our kids. We feel bad asking, and have a hard time scheduling even when we do ask...   So I'm hoping there's like an eHarmony for finding babysitters. There's got to be - I've seen one for dog walkers! Somewhere that parents can leave comments/referrals, etc.  I'm leery of using something like Craigslist because of the prevalence of scams/etc. We've asked our daycare provider for a few references but we're still waiting to hear back from her.  We're a good 20+ minute drive from the nearest university. Is that too far to ask a college student to drive? (Come to think of it, maybe not? I regularly drove longer for a $7/hour job when I was in college...)  Has anyone heard of anything like this? "
216,Is there an infant-equipped transportation service with car seat to and fro airports?,"My 6-week old child, my husband and I are taking a flight from East-cost to West-cost.  Is there a taxi or other transportation company that will provide a car seat on a short notice?  And also would you recommend that vs. bringing your own car seat?  If the latter, any recommendations for light-weight car-seat that are suitable for such trips? "
217,How to clean the vagina of a newborn?,"She is 9 day old. I am seeing some whitish sticky substance surrounding her clitoris for past some days. Do I need to clean it? If yes, how? "
218,What are the dos and don'ts related to massaging an infant?,"I was thinking of giving him a strong head massage, but then I read somewhere that newborn heads are not supposed to be touched strongly since bones aren't joint at the back of the head.  What are the dos and don'ts related to massaging an infant?    How to hold the infant and how much pressure should be applied where?      If I put him on his tummy for back massage, he won't be to support his neck and his nose will be buried in the mattress. What's the way out? "
219,Restricting infant on almost every move,"Most of the times I restrict my 10 month old on doing things which I feel would have a negative impact on him. For example, I say NO in a louder tone when he makes a desperate attempt to put his hand to loose cables in home, when he tries to hold shoes or when he tries to pull window blinds but then he stops.  The same practice is adopted by my spouse. But sometimes we act good-dad-bad-mom, good-mom-bad-dad.  My question is whether this is a good practice of restricting infants/toddlers? We feel that we are imposing authority on our son on almost everything which in future would affect him adversely. He would develop the same fear for everything. He would also fear that someone would say NO on whatever he is attempting to do? "
220,How to know whether I am producing sufficient breast milk?,"I have to breast feed my 9 day old for 1 hour. That is frustrating for me, and doesn't satisfy her too. Then I have to feed her about 60 ml formula.  How would I know whether I am producing sufficient breast milk or not? Or the problem is somewhere else?  How to know whether I am producing sufficient breast milk?     You mean ""for 1 hour"" in a row or during the day?    1 hour in a row. That's the reason of frustration!     And 60ml formula, at once or during the day? just to make sure     60ml formula at once.   In morning (6:00 AM) I feed her breast milk (around 25 minutes), then she sleeps for about 2 hours in a row. Then I feed her 60ml formula (at once) and she sleeps for 4 hours in a row (unless she's wet). Then again I feed her breast milk (1 hour in a row) and try to make her sleep. At this time I often have to give her formula because she keeps on making sucking signs with her lips after I take my breasts out of her mouth and remains active even when I swaddle her when I put her to sleep. "
221,Teenage Boy wants to live with his Mum,"I have 3 kids. The eldest boy is 20 and is studying at University, my middle son is 17 and still at school and my youngest is a 12 yo daughter.  About six and a half years ago my wife left and at the time she agreed to my request that we maintain 50-50, week-about custody. For me this arrangement has been good as I have been able to maintain good relationships with the kids and also start and maintain a new relationship with my new wife of 5 years.  Life at my ex-wife's house(s) has been a bit of a rollercoaster for our children. In the 5 years that I have been with my new wife, my ex has had 7 or 8 boyfriends, none of which have lasted more than 14 months, and some that she has moved into her house (with their own kids) within days of meeting them on-line.  My ex is an 'intense' parent. Some call them martyr-mums. When she is between boyfriends she focusses her love and attention on the kids very intensely. She also tends to treat them more like friends rather than parent-child. What this means is that during those times the kids get very attached to her.  In contrast I am a more even, but less intense, parent. I probably don't tell them enough how much I love them, but that is probably more a bloke thing than anything else.  Of course, kids being kids, they can be incredibly selfish as most of them think the world revolves around them. So what has happened at various stages during the last 6 years is that any or all of the 3 of them have decided that they want to live solely with one parent or the other, whether it is me or my ex.  Now when they have come to me in that time (all 3 have done so at various times) and made the request to live at my place full-time, I have almost always said No, as I have told them that it is not fair on the other parent when that happens, and that I believe that the best outcome for everyone (parents and children) is the 50-50 split. There have been exceptions though, most notably 5 years ago when my ex felt physically threatened by my eldest boy, and I agreed to her request for me to take him.  Unfortunately my ex does not take the same stance, and while she may not encourage the children to live with her full-time, she does not encourage them to maintain the 50-50 access. I have found out recently from a mutual friend that my ex never liked the 50-50 arrangement and has always wanted the kids to herself. This has meant that my middle son spent some time in the last 2 years living at her place full-time (until she moved boyfriend no 6 or 7 in and my son didn't get on with him).  So once again, my ex has been between boyfriends, and once again my middle son is saying he wants to be with his mum full-time. Because he is over 16, he can legally choose where to live. He is coming to me this weekend, but this is the first time he's been at my place for 5 weeks. I really miss him and just want the arrangement to go back to 50-50.  Is there anything that I can say to my son to try and fix this? Should I even be trying to persuade him to go back to the 50-50?  I only have just over a year before he heads off on his own big life adventure, and I would really like to have him in my life for half of that time.    UPDATE - 20th April, 2017  Well 18 months later I thought I should share how things went.  My son is now half way through his 18-week basic training in the Royal New Zealand Navy. While he has always continued to keep up the contact with me (more so, now that he is away from home), he never came back to me 50/50 before he went off on his big life adventure.  He spent last year trying to get into the armed forces, and spent most of the year working after dropping out of school. I was dismayed by some of the decisions that he made, but without much access to him he got very little 'good' advice. His mother even encouraged him to drive around illegally on a learners license for most of that year. Which ended up with him being caught and having to sit, and pass, his driving test.  However, since leaving for the Navy he seems to have had a renewed interest in me and more importantly, my (and his) family.  My ex is still doing her damnedest to keep him as close as possible by almost controlling his activities during his 4-day leave over Easter when he flew back down here to our home town. His car had mysteriously had the battery drained so she ended up ferrying him wherever he (or perhaps she) wanted to go.  Anyway, I do feel that I have a better relationship now with my son since he has been released from the apron strings.  "
222,How do I address a 6 year old child's love/hate relationship with sport?,"TL;DR My nephew becomes upset when playing football with family. How can I encourage him to have a healthier relationship with the game?    Before the football (soccer) world cup, my 6 year old nephew hated football. He didn't support a team, his family aren't too keen on the sport and he wasn't too interested in playing it at school.  Now he's seen it on TV and he says he 'loves' the game. He wants to play all the time, collect football stickers etc. Obviously we're fine with a genuine interest in a sport and we would like to encourage him to be active and explore new activities.  However, when we actually start playing, my nephew gets very emotional, namely:   A lot of rolling on the floor and crying foul (picked up from TV of course) Making up rules because he doesn't really know them (his official rulebook are the kids in the next class) Accusations that we adults are playing unfairly   I want to reach a state where we can just play football without having it end in tears and my nephew being sent to the thinking step.  My approach so far has been:   Giving him some coaching to improve his game, with the aim of addressing the point about adults playing unfairly. When he takes the advice, his game genuinely improves, but he often doesn't want to do this. It's not complicated advice either, e.g. standing a few paces in front of the goal line if he's in net Recognising his mood changes and trying to pack the game up before the point of no return, but he doesn't want to comply and the other adults don't spot the signs either   My question is, how can I encourage my nephew to develop a healthier relationship to playing football with his family? "
223,What to do if my kids would not listen to my reasoning?,"I have a boy, 10 years old. I think he is quite smart and can understand all the reasoning as good as any intelligent adults.  Unfortunately, he can be quite difficult to deal with. He has some bad habits, such as shutting himself up and refuse to have any outdoor activities because he is quite addicted to computer games and comics. Another bad habit is that he would often make his sister cry for no reason ( or as he often puts it, ""out of pure pleasure""). I try to reason him out of his bad habits, but it simply doesn't work. He would just frown and shout at me. It should be noted that I won't getting into a shouting match with him, not even once ( unlike so many of other parents). When he shouts, I just look at him in his eyes intensely and call him out for this poor behavior: ""boy, you are losing your cool, and I don't like your manner, if you continue this behavior, no one can talk to you at all""  He would then just walk off and lock himself up again. And he would just continue his bad habits. He does not respect my authority as his parent, neither does he behave like a grown up person.   How to deal with such a problematic kid? Should I just cane him in order to restore my authority? "
224,How can I explain to my child that I'm not superman?,"If you asked Grace (2 1/2) right now ""What can't daddy do?"" she would probably not understand the question. Daddy can move anything, fix anything, run as fast as lightning; simply put, there's nothing Daddy can't do.  Except honestly, I'm a programmer for a living, and I don't work out. Like most (not all!) of my fellow IT guys, I'm not all that strong. And when it comes to fixing stuff, I'm really not all that great at that. C'mon, I had to go to Home Improvement Stack Exchange just to fix a dryer duct! And sure I used to be fast in high school, but I have a hip injury now that prevents me from running much at all.  But she doesn't know these things. To her, I'm a freaking superman.  So the other day, we were driving along when she said she wanted to go to the toy store. (It's actually a salvage center at a local landfill. Protip: they love [tex]100 toys!!) Except that it was the Sunday before a national holiday. In Canada (the only country in the world that values time off more than additional pay). So as you can imagine, it wasn't open. And that's when she had the perfect solution.     ""Maybe Daddy open it!""      - Gracie   And try as we might, my wife nor I could get it through her head that no, Daddy can't open the toy store. (Daddy is a very big fan of not going to jail.) And I know it's very common, and of course it feels kind of cool to be thought highly of, especially in areas I'm historically horrible in. And I don't want to just crush her spirit, or make her think I'm bad at everything.   But I want her to know who I really am, to know the things I'm good at and not good at. I want her to know that it's okay to be not good at some things and that no one expects perfection. I want her to have a realistic sense of who I am. How can I do this in a way that isn't damaging to her? "
225,"Two year old starting creche, completely hyper when he comes home","Our son (2 years &amp; 9 months old) is starting creche, we've had some ""introduction days"" where we drop him in for a few hours each day to become accustomed to the change.  Normally he's an energetic - but NOT hyperactive - child, he rarely sits for long, always on the go. We do lots of activities together, he especially enjoys the messy parts of baking and loves to eat the food he helped prepare.  However for the last few days he's come home from creche absolutely hyper, bouncing off the walls, and today completely sabotaged a cooking task we were doing. After creche he no longer seems able to listen, constantly grabs anything &amp; everything he can reach.   It's exhausting, and worrying.  He's been dropped in over the last four working days, lengthening the stay each time. This new behavior is more pronounced the longer he stays.   Has anyone experienced anything like this? I'm fairly sure this is a temporary change until he settles into his new routine, but obviously the fear is this won't go away.    So, should I worry, is it a watch and wait sort of thing, or will this just go away and we'll get our well behaved little boy back soon?  Update It took 2 - 3 weeks but he settled down :) "
226,How can I help my toddler with his booger problem?,"Warning: this one may be a bit gross...  My son, who is almost three, fairly regularly gets large clots of dried mucus wedged deep up his nose.  They can stay there for days without coming out on their own, and they cause a noticeable whistle when he breathes.    The rubber suction bulb our hospital gave us when he was a newborn does absolutely nothing to help; the masses are too far up, and too big.  Not to mention my son hates to have them shoved up his nose!  He can still breath with them, and they only really seem to cause him discomfort when they've been there long enough to have hardened (at which point they'll typically come out on their own after a few more days, usually with a big sneeze).  There is a medical reason why my sons... boogers... may be a bit bigger and thicker than average, but we've seen a specialist, and he agrees that they're not symptomatic of any actual medical problem.  So the question is: what, if anything, do we do about this?  Do we try to extract them for him?  We've tried teaching him how to blow his nose, but he just doesn't seem to be getting the idea. "
227,"Toddler recently pushing me away, no cuddles, not saying goodnight etc etc and I'm withdrawing a bit - is there light at the end of the tunnel?","Our daughter just turned 2 in May. My wife and I haven't really had that many issues with her, but recently she's being odd.  Every time I go to give her a hug, cuddle or kiss she either pulls away or tells me no.  She's no longer saying goodnight or goodbye when I go to work and generally doesn't seem to care all that much if I exist at the minute.  It's only been happening a couple of days but I'm pretty worried about it more so because I can feel that I'm withdrawing away from her as well in a 'fine, go to nanas then (when they left to visit this morning) - I don't need to say goodbye type thing' - which is ridiculous I know but it's difficult to break the thought pattern.  I've ordered a couple of books to better understand and have done some reading and I know she's not doing it simply to cause me grief but I just...is there light at the end of the tunnel?  Will this pass?  Can anyone lend advice on how to best deal with it.  It doesn't help that our last real interaction was me telling her off and then pretty much yelling at her to not climb the stairs by herself - I found her halfway up them, shit myself and let emotions rule the voice that should've said she shouldn't go up them alone. "
228,How disruptive is an occasional exception to a toddler's sleep schedule?,"My son's sleep patterns are pretty good.  We start our bedtime routine around 20:30 - 21:00, and he's usually in bed by 21:30 (and asleep within minutes).  We have been planning our activities and schedule around that routine as a fairly hard deadline, even on vacations and other special occasions, for fear of causing lasting disruptions in his sleep schedule.  He's almost 3.  What are the chances that a night of staying up late (for example, staying up an extra hour or two to enjoy holiday fireworks) would cause problems on subsequent nights (or mornings)?    What can we do to mitigate the disruption of such special occasions?  "
229,How to find websites to help 5 year olds to learn to read,"What are the primary ways I could search for websites which contain stories suitable for five year old children learning to read?  I've tried using phrases like ""Children learning to read stories"" and similar keywords but I usually end up at sites which have mostly games or videos - neither of which I am looking for.  So, does anyone know how to find sites which contain stories to help young children learn to read? "
230,How to help our 2.5-year-old daughter deal with an abusive 5-year-old boy?,"In the Kindergaden, our 2.5-year-old daughter has periodic confrontations with a 5-year-old boy, who used to hit her on the head with a toy. She is totally scared of him up to not willing to go to the Kindergarden.  What are modalities before changing Kindergarden - try to explain something to her she should e.g. shout aloud for help, or talk to parents? How not to let her alone with this? How much is to protect and how much to learn to react properly? In general she is full of courage, so not a fearful kid.  "
231,How to Handle 5 Year Old Disrespect/Not Listening in Public?,"Our 5-year-old daughter is a very smart, sweet, and usually well-behaved girl. She usually hates to get in trouble and responds well to correction. However, lately she has been getting into some trouble at school for not listening and refusing to participate one day, and has been not listening to us and getting very angry about having ""rules"". She is going back to her younger behaviors of having trouble leaving places, such as family get-togethers, grandma's house, etc. She gets mad and STAYS mad, will pout and carry on for quite a while before she finally comes around and usually apologizes. I do not know where this has come from and have tried to figure it out. She likes school, and says she likes her teacher and friends. My DH (spouse) teaches at her school, so he is pretty in the loop about her days there, and he states that she is most always happy when he sees her, she plays with pretty much anyone. There have been no changes at home, other than I started working full-time in June, but that coincided with her starting kinder, so she wouldn't be home anyway. She is very moody, and the littlest thing can cause so much drama. She had been sick a couple times right in a row and her tonsils are still swollen, but not red, so I don't really think she is sick or anything that would be contributing... I kept hoping it was just a growth spurt or something because she has sprouted up recently and all her pants are short.  I have gotten some great insight and advice from other posts on here, but the biggest question I still have is what to do when she doesn't listen while we are out, or it is something time sensitive.  For example: We are at a family function and when we let her know it's almost time to leave, she says ""No!"" and is defiant, and ran away from DH. This turned into over an hour of issues where she was saying she didn't care if she got in trouble, no one ever helps her, wishes she didn't have a mommy &amp; daddy, etc. To me, that is just unacceptable behavior, and I don't want to let her ""get away with it"". I find it hard to ignore because we are GOING to leave at a certain time, and so at some point it becomes a matter of force. Or sometimes I tell her it's bedtime and again, ""NO!"" and won't come, the consequence has been losing a bedtime story. But of course, telling her that just warrants more drama crying and anger. I feel there must be a consequence to defiant, disrespectful behavior, is that wrong? So many posts here say to ignore it. If I just ignore it, she will not be in bed. Do I just say ""I am available to read stories and tuck you in now, later I will not be""? I know it is getting to be a power struggle, and I want to nip it in the bud as it's new behavior. I am all for ""positive parenting"" but it's so hard for me in the moment, when she is being so rude! "
232,Is feeding the right time to talk and read to a kid?,"The kid will be born tomorrow. I wish to know if feeding time is the right time to ""talk"" to him and read him stories?  I am asking this because I have heard that kids fall asleep while breast feeding and I think my continuous chatter will not let him sleep.   Also, my parents say that while eating we should concentrate only on food and shouldn't even talk. I afraid that talking and story telling during feeding might turn out to be a bad habit(?) Is my concern valid?  So, what is the appropriate time for story telling? At what age will timing matter considering that the child will consider it a babble initially? "
233,How to know whether the baby has had her fill while breastfeeding?,"She is 24 days old.  How to know whether the baby is sucking breasts because she's hungry or because she is entertaining/soothing herself?  Accordingly I wish to know when to take the breasts out of the baby's mouth.  Update:  About 10 days back I used manual breast pump to measure how much milk I can produce in one go. It was 15ml in 2 minutes from one breast. After 2 minutes the same breast couldn't produce anymore milk at that time.  Usually I put baby to one breast for around half an hour. She sucks for few seconds and then takes a break for another few seconds, so on and so forth.  She falls asleep while sucking but does not leave the breast and the sucking process continues. After half an hour I get tired with the sitting posture therefore take the breast out and put her to sleep.  The baby sleeps for around 5 hours at one go during the day.   I feed her after every two hours. Assuming the baby is sound, in roughly how much time should I expect from her to get her fill with one breast at one go? "
234,How long can formula be stored in fridge and freezer?,"Sometimes we make formula and later realize that kid isn't actually hungry. Formula is expensive so I would like to know for how much time is it safe to store it in fridge, and freezer?  Though it is written on the formula packet that we shouldn't be storing it, should the warning be taken too literally? "
235,My 9-year-old daughter is a wallflower around friends. How do I help her?,"My daughter is almost 9 and entering the 3rd grade.  She has a lot of friends at school from being in sports and girl scouts.  However, when we see them at a public place our daughter pretends she doesn’t know them, won’t say hi without being told to, etc.   Whenever she’s in a group she’s a wallflower.  She will only go up to a friend if they’re by themselves, she doesn’t go up to a group of multiple friends.   Is this low self esteem or social anxiety?  How do I help her? "
236,"Baby always rolling over and ending up sleeping on his stomach, is it dangerous?","Our 3 months old baby is very keen on rolling over and being on his stomach. Most of the time he automatically rolls over in a few minutes after we put him on his back, including during bed time. Is this dangerous? We are particularly worried that   his nose maybe blocked when facing down it is said that SIDS risk increases when a baby sleeps on his stomach   If it is dangerous, how can we stop this, especially during bed time or other times when we can't watch him continuously? "
237,Toddler is in bed but wakes up an hour early and walks into our room,"We have recently transitioned our 2 year old from a cot into a bed.  We did this with some reservation but he appeared to be ready as he would constantly ask to go into his bed.  Also he started climbing onto the top bar of his cot so we thought it might be best to move him to his bed.  However now he is in we have a problem that when he wakes up early he can get out of his bed and walk around the house.  Typically into our room.  In the past we could leave him in in his cot and he would either churp away or cry to be picked up at which point we might leave him for as long as possible.    He has always been an early waker even though we never got up early to him.  At least from as long as I can remember anyway.  As he is only waking up 45min to 1hour we are finding it hard to tell him to go back to sleep, especially as he has already woken up walking around.  He wakes up at 5:30am - 6am instead of 6:30am which we would be happy with.  We are hesitant to completely close his door so he can't get out but apart from that we don't know what to do.  Why?  Just a personal thing at this stage in that we like to have his door ajar just so we can hear him if necessary.  His room is completely dark so when he wakes he won't be able to see much (so there's no morning light issues).  We have tried telling him it's not time to wake up yet however he is already fully awake by that time it seems tough to ask him to go back to sleep (for 45min to 1hr?).  He goes to bed early-ish in the evenings and at times has good sleeps during the day.  We don't force either of these and try to work in with his state each day, although we also stick to a routine as much as possible.  UPDATE Sept: I thought I would provide an update to this.  Our little guy is much better now although he is still waking up once during the night (at which point I just pick him up and take him back to bed) as well as waking up early.  However he is slowly getting better.  Now although he complains more often than not it's not a continual cry.  Things that we are doing now include:   Purchased a Gro clock and have been constantly drumming in that he can only come into mummies and daddies room when the sun comes up.  He gets the concept and it's almost... working. Started a sticker chart.  Although he doesn't fully understand it is a nice treat for him now and he sort of understands when he isn't allowed on.  He is only allowed one when he has stayed in his room. I started off hoping into bed with him for a month in the core of winter but the last 4 weeks I've been filtering that off so now I don't need to and just take him back to his room (although he does still complain and cry/grizzle at times).   So it's been about 4months.  Slowly but surely he's getting there. "
238,Should I use timeouts with my goddaughter if her mother doesn't?,"My goddaughter is 2.5 years old and lives in another state.  We video chat every week, which she looks forward to, but I only see her in person intermittently.  She is also an outgoing and assertive child, which I love, but it leads to her testing her boundaries on acceptable behavior even more then the average 2 year old.  I have pretty extensive experience with children, and so my instinct when she pushes her boundires too far is to put her in a timeout as I would with the other kids I mentor.  However, her mother almost never uses timeout's with her, preferring to discuss and reason with my goddaughter about why her actions are bad, even in situations where I would usually use a time out (in addition to explaining why the actions were bad during the time out obviously).  I have the mother's full permission to use punishment/timeout when I'm visiting my goddaughter, and I often take my goddaughter out for some fun time somewhere while her mother works when we visit where I'm the sole adult anyways.  I have no doubt that I can use a timeout, my concern is how effective they will be.  She isn't use to the concept of timeout form her mother, and doesn't see in in person often enough to become familiar with them from me.  Will she understand what a timeout, which she rarely sees, is about, and why it is happening, and/or just think it's something her godfather does sometime?   Should I be trying to better emulate what her mother handles misbehavior, or stick to the sort of timeout routine I would use with other children I mentor, and see more regularly?  "
239,5yr old Addicted to Mobile Devices - Need Advice!,"So it started when he was 2yrs old, we gave him his first bad habit.. eating while watching youtube videos. It worked, he ate well..like a zombie. (Parent Fail #1).  Now at 5, he LOVES playing a plethora of iphone/tablet games. 50% are educational puzzles and strategy stuff like 'Cut the rope'..but mostly he prefers action games that involve fighting and/or racing.  I was hoping this would be a great tool for him to exercise his mind, however we are painfully realizing that his is terribly addicted and has no internal abilities to stop craving it 24/7.  We try to be very strict with putting time/place limits on it.. but he just cant stop receptively asking for it without a major tantrum if left unquenched. Last weekend the grandparents and mom took him to a massively cool book fair ( he normally loves books ) , but the whole time he couldnt stop talking about Dad's phone.. he couldnt focus on the moment.   So should we just cut it out completely until he is much older? or implement some newfound solution we've been missing all this time?  This IMHO will be the biggest challenge of our generation. "
240,Gifts for teachers at private schools?,"How typical is it for parents to give end-of-school-year gifts to teachers at a private school?  If it is usual or frequent, what types of gifts and how expensive?  (My 6 yo has 4 teachers for his kindergarden class.) "
241,Extended family not catering for baby's routine,"We have a 15 month old child. He is the only sub 10 year-old in my side of the family. I recently got into a dispute with family, as they wanted us to arrive for a family occasion at a specific time, not earlier or later (reason: don't want too many people in the house at the same time). Whatever the reason, we would be happy to oblige if it wasn't for the child; for a variety of reasons related to the child, 30 minutes earlier suited us much better, and did not have any direct impact on the hosts other than the above reason.  We were told by an intermediary family member, that this demonstrated a lack of respect to those who were hosting the event. I replied that when it comes to anything involving a family with a small child, that you should not demand anything in terms of timing, but, understanding the complexities of managing little ones, a mutually agreeable consensus should be reached. I was then told that we ""cannot go through life expecting everyone to do what we wanted to on our own timescales"" (this straw man type argument is a familiar pattern with some members of my family). It was said that when their kids were young, they always bended to fit in with other people.  This was said by a member of my family who had children (many years ago) and presented as if it was an undisputable fact. However the experience of my wife and I completely disagrees with this. If a friend invites us to a social event and the time doesn't suit our daily pattern we either decline (not a realistic option with a family get-together) or suggest an alternative time (usually reaching a compromise). My wife's side of the family are all too willing to make sacrifices/compromises in order to accommodate us &amp; their other grandchildren (eg multiple sittings for meal times to suit various routines). Herein lies another issue with dealing with my family - when they present things as fact which I find not to be true in my experience. I don't know how to approach it constructively - it just turns into a brick-wall situation where person A states scenario X is true because of person A's experience, and person B disagrees because of person B's experience.  A few extra things to bring more colour to the scene - I feel that better direct communication prior to the day with the hosts could've improved the situation, I did not know how important it appears to be that we turned up 30 mins later, and perhaps they did not know the ins and outs of our child's routine (but should they need to know that? Is not a request from the parents enough - we are not intentionally awkward people). They were also a bit taken aback when we said we needed evening food some 2 hours before everyone else had theirs, but they coped with that. They gave us some bread &amp; cheese, which was fine, we didn't expect them to bring the full evening buffet forward for us.  My one thought as justification for the families' attitude is that my family are too far away in years from the time when they had little ones to remember what it was really like.   Also, by ""routine"" I mean his nap time, his meal times, and the fact that he falls asleep in the car very easily (which can be a blessing and a curse).  This leads to a few questions. 1) Who is right - is it ever OK to demand a fixed time of arrival for a family with young children. I am not asking this because I want to say ""ha the internet I was right"" but more to test our parenting radar/intuition. If I am considered right then it will boost our parenting self-esteem, if not then we will try extra-hard to be humble in the future.  2) Am I right to expect higher standards from family members in terms of catering for our us and our little one, than from friends? Are the standards I am expecting unreasonably high?  3) Crucially, any suggestions on how to move this forward? At the moment I feel reluctant/trepidatious about spending more time with the family on away turf, as I feel they will be unwilling to make compromises (around timing and other issues) for the sake of my child (this fear is based on this &amp; other incidents, where a quiet calm request to do things differently for the sake of me or my wife has been met with a (sometimes aggressive) no). I have already listed above a couple of the difficulties of discussing issues with my family but here's another one. My wife &amp; I would rather sit down and calmly discuss issues whereas my family are a lot more aggressive with disagreements, and rarely seem to actually resolve things. I (correctly) believed as a child that there must be a better way to resolve differences than this.  EDIT clarification:  Thanks for the responses advising to say no to family events, I see the reasoning behind it and will probably try to use it in the future.  However it was not an option on this occasion because it was a two-day event, that we had already committed to. We were only told of the time requirement in the last 10 minutes before we left at the end of the first day, and much of the food prep had been done for the next day. So to have told them we couldn't make it from there would've been, understandably, taken rather badly by the rest of the family (some of whom had travelled 3+ hours to be there).  I'm not sure what we could've done differently on this occasion (ideas welcome), just that we can chat about it with the hosts to avoid the scenario in the future. "
242,My 2-year-old son is still not talking. Is this normal?,"I have a 2-year-old son. He still isn't talking, he'll say words here and there like ""bird"" when he sees a bird and he'll say words like mama or dada sometimes but never in correlation with my wife or me. It's become a real sore spot of frustration as he turns 3 in February.    My primary concern is that he might have an underlying issue that is being ignored by our doctor.  He sees a speech therapist once a week but still has the same issue.    My questions are: Is this normal? I see kids younger than him talking more complexly than he does. If it is normal, what's a program that seems to have good results to get him to talk?  He's a very happy and healthy boy, it'd just be nice to know what he is thinking. "
243,"Can we say ""bad boy"" to my 2-year-old son if he misbehaves or does something which we don't like?","My 2-year-old son has learnt a new word ""No"" recently. He is aware of what ""No"" indicates and when to tell this in the perfect situation. If he doesn't like anything or if we change the channels on television.    First word coming out of his mouth is ""No""  And it is really aggressive.  Sometimes he started beating us (hitting us repeatedly).    We started saying ""Bad Boy"". He feels irritated if we use this expression. Is this a good approach to stop his ""No"" behaviour? Or do you have any better ideas?  "
244,How do i deal with the urge to laugh when my daughter cries?,"I have an infant daughter who cries a lot (naturally; she's three months old) and most of the time I find it more funny than anything else. I feel pretty awful about this but I think it's just due to the fact that I know there's nothing serious wrong (she's just hungry or cranky and impatient). If it is serious then I do get worried and it's not funny. And I naturally do tend to her cries.  However, as she gets older I am concerned that laughing when she cries is going to be a bad reaction to have. No one likes being laughed at and I don't want her to feel like I don't care about her. I also feel awful about finding it funny in the first place, but can't help it.   Is it bad that I find it funny? How do I deal with the urge to laugh so I don't hurt her feelings when she's older? "
245,How to increase my 2-year-old son boy weight?,"My 2-year-old son has is weighing 10KG. When he was six months old his weight was 10KG. After a year and a half, he is still 10KG. As a parent, we are giving him healthy food which contains more protein and fat. He is eating very little and he raised his hand and saying ""finished"". How to change his adamancy.?   We are really worried because his weight is not changing at all.   can anybody let us know how to increase his weight and the body mass?   Any advice on this please.  "
246,14-week-old waking many times a night: poor sleep associations already? can we sleep train yet?,"My 14-week-old has been a poor sleeper since birth. He was ""colicky"" for the first 7 weeks, so did not sleep well. Then until about 10 weeks, he was starting to improve: there was less inconsolable crying during the day, and he would start the night by going 3-5 hours before eating again. However, he never actually slept the full 3-5 hours, because he won't fall asleep nursing--he requires soothing, rocking, carrying and sometimes a pacifier to get him to sleep. After the first sleep stretch, he would go for 2-3 hours before a second feeding, but after that one he was restless and gassy for the remainder of the night.  So, it wasn't great, but it was slowly improving. Then around 10 weeks everything took a nose dive and seems to be only getting worse. I think it is a combination of teething already (our first son also got teeth early), gas, and possibly continuing reflux that is contributing to the steadily worsening sleep. Also the three month growth spurt has probably contributed.  He has been on Axid for several weeks, and it's not clear that it has helped; we are considering Prevacid, but it's not clear that reflux is much of an issue any more. I give Tylenol and/or Ibuprofen when it's clear he's teething, but that only helped a couple of nights. I don't eat dairy, and have tried eliminating various other foods--again, doesn't appear to have made a difference. We gave him Biogaia probiotics when younger but that didn't help; I've just started him on FloraBaby infant probiotics. He's still swaddled tightly, and often has a pacifier to help fall asleep, although not always. Have tried having him sleep in the swing, which seemed to help for a while, but not any more.  He goes to bed around 7:30 or 8pm, but then wakes up 40 minutes later to nurse (because I can't nurse him to sleep, so he's already hungry by then), then 1-2 hours later for the rest of the night. During the day he eats every 2-3 hours, and naps are not great, again because he won't go to sleep immediately after nursing, so he usually doesn't sleep longer than 40 minutes before getting hungry.  My question is, can he already have made sleep associations that I need to break? He doesn't nurse every time he wakes during the night, only after 2-3 hours, but he wakes more frequently and needs to be soothed, re-swaddled, given the pacifier, held, etc. If the frequent waking is due to pain (gas, teeth, reflux), then does that mean that sleep training wouldn't be effective? With our first sleep-challenged child, I read Weissbluth, Ferber, Baby Whisperer, etc., but I can't find anything helpful for this particular situation. "
247,Baby screaming every night with fit in his mouth,"My 6 month old baby has been doing this 3 nights in a row. He suddenly wakes up screaming. Holding him doesn't help, he keeps moving his header right and left, ignoring me. It can keep going for several hours.  His puts his hand in his mouth and shakes around. He throws away the pacifier.   Giving him food calms him down temporarily, although he jumps on it as soon as he sees the bottle coming.  I also tried acetaminophen and homeopathic drops for teething.  Is he having a growth sprut? Extra hungry? Teething? Ear infection?  He is also very nervous during the day.  "
248,how to teach persistence to 3 year old,My 3 year old daughter gets very frustrated when things don't work for her the first time.  She seems to go from happy to crazy upset immediately.  Is this a time-appropriate developmental thing?  I think this is partly my fault because I don't have a great temper.  How can I model better behavior for my daughter to improve her happiness? 
249,How can you tell if a toddler went pee in the potty?,"Sometimes the pee is such a small amount I can't tell unless I watch. We have a sit down potty and can look, but this is impossible with the  kind that sits in the big toilet. Unfortunately there is no room in the main restroom for another toddler potty.   Daycare says they use drops but I can't find them anywhere. Any suggestions? Maybe I shouldn't even care? "
250,Are there any health risks for mother or child when using a sauna or steam room while pregnant?,"Are there any risks to either the mother or baby from using a sauna or steam room while pregnant?

251,How to answer child's hard questions,"I have recently found myself facing my sweet 9-year old cousin, who looked at me with those big naive eyes, and knowing me as the geeky aunt who knows everything, asked ""why did the Germans do this to us?"" Meaning the holocaust. At which point I found myself opening and closing my mouth in search of something to say, because I'm 30, and I still don't know why.  I have more than one young cousin, and my friends' children, and I will eventually have children of my own, so I anticipate facing this kind of questions more than once. So how do you answer a child's questions about cruelty, injustice, bigotry - about evil? I can't explain to a child about the banality of evil, can I? It's such a cruel thing to accept. But what other answer is there? How should I have answered my cousin's question? "
252,How to get children to participate in housework without using reward/punishment,"This is sort of an exploratory question, as I haven't really been confronted with the issue (yet).  I've been looking around for ways to get kids to do chores. I'm a bit put off by the fact that pretty much every source I can find suggests creating a reward system (possibly with punishments), and further, those rewards are often financial. It's my understanding that using punishment and rewards is bad because it basically makes the behavior contingent on whatever external motivator you've arbitrarily chosen, and thus the behavior will disappear when the motivator disappears (see ""Punished by Rewards"" by Alfie Kohn). And using money as the reward strikes me as a particularly bad choice, encouraging greed.  Nonetheless, the question must be asked: how DOES one get kids to do a task that ""must be done,"" but which is inherently uninteresting? I'm leaning towards ""be a role model"" (in particular, don't expect to offload all the work you don't want to do on your newfound slaves) and trying to get the kids to understand the reason it must be done anyway (e.g. dishes must be washed so we don't get sick). But I admit I haven't got any experience.  So I guess my question is, aside from setting up a reward/punishment system, how can one encourage children to participate in tasks that need to be done, but aren't really fun/interesting? "
253,Improving a parent preference?,"My wife and I arrived at my in-laws today at the end of a 3 day couple's retreat away from the kids (3yr8m boy and 1yr10m boy). We were both very excited to see the kids again and wondered if they missed us at all.  My wife was ahead of me as my older son appeared. She crouched down to the ground with her arms wide open to greet him with a big hug, but he saw me behind and ran around her to hug me.  The second didn't see me and ran to his mom immediately, then after hugging momentarily he noticed me, extricated himself from his mom, and ran to me. Both boys wanted to be in daddy's arms for the next 10 minutes.  My wife was heartbroken. Didn't her boys miss her at all? Do they even care about her? Would they be just as happy if she didn't even exist? These are the thoughts running through her head all day.  My wife is a great mom. She is a stay at home mother, she does crafts and plays with the kids all day. She does have to discipline as well (no hitting, but she does raise her voice semi-regularly). Is there some way to help my boys be as excited about their mom as they are about me? Does their behavior reflect on their mother's kindness and parenting ability in any way? "
254,Issues with naming first child with name similar to mine?,"My partner is 39 weeks pregnant and we still haven't chosen a name for our boy. There is a name we both really like and fits all our criteria, except that it is very similar to mine.  My name is Jonathan, but everybody I know calls me Jo, John or by my last name. I'd like to name my son Nathan, but I'm worried that it might lead to confusion or that people will think that I like my name so much that I named my son with almost the same name (just short of being Junior).  The thing is, I don't really identify as Jonathan too much and I really like the name Nathan. Am I overthinking this? Is anybody in the same situation? (For example, being called Mary-Jane and naming a daughter Jane). I'd like to know if I can expect judgment, criticsm, being ridiculed, etc. "
255,"16 month old, former good sleeper, now screams entire nap","We've got a 16 month old girl who has been on a fairly regular sleep schedule for a long time now.  Recently, in the matter of about a week, she refuses to nap anymore though.  We do our normal nap wind down, and when we get to her crib she whimpers and when put in the crib she screams at the top of her lungs standing at the edge.  She will do this for the entire minimum of an hour, which we try to enforce. Before this she was pushing up to 2.5hr naps, which were great.  The nap time is on a regular schedule, and since she's started doing this she is clearly showing signs of being tired as it approaches.  Her ideal sleep schedule is:   Wake 7am. Nap 9am Wake 10-11 on her own. Nap 1pm, or 2pm (about 2-2.5 hrs after previous wake) Wake 3-4pm Bedtime routine about 4 hours after last wake (bath, change, book, milk bottle, in crib) In crib usually about 745-830, depending on day's timings Generally cries about 15-20 minutes, sometimes needing an extra rocking, but then goes to sleep well. Sleeps through night ideally, sometimes one wake.   This all went out the window recently with her refusing to nap.  Its also gotten more difficult to put her to sleep at night since, when she cries more than usual.  She has always cried when going to sleep, but now more.  She has been waking more than usual at night as well, sometimes for 2 hours when she is not hungry, but wants to be awake, held or running around her crib talking/babbling to herself.  Of course, we are required to be there and she screams until that happens.  Sometimes she tries to fall asleep in our arms, but generally can't do that.  The moment we put her back in her crib to sleep she screams a piercing scream.  We generally have found letting her cry for a bit will let her fall asleep, but lately it is all scream or be held, a very strong attachment need happening.  How can we get past this and resume naps?  Why might she be doing this now? "
256,"Is the ""Happy Xmas (War Is Over)"" by John Lennon song and video suitable for a child?","Is John Lennon's song and video ""Happy Xmas (War Is Over)"" suitable for a child? My daughter has almost 9 years. She will understand the message (which I will also explain to her), and it is a very good message. But the images are of the most brutal and violent reality.  I won't show it for now, but at the same time i just love the song and the message, I want so much to share this with my child. It is better to wait, right? Maybe 3 years? Or 7 years?! "
257,What is the best time for a mom to go back to work after giving birth from the psychological and healthy attachment point of view?,"Given money is not a matter of concern, and the mother cares more about the health and future of her child rather than her career development/future, when is a good time for a mother to go back to work after giving birth?   I have read this article that talks about the attachment theory and I wonder if it is best for the child to be with her mom for at least 2 years?   On the other hand, I hear some parents talk about how their kids learn a lot of useful things at child care and how it is beneficial for kids to spend their time at child care. So, it makes me think that maybe it is in the interest of the child to be taken care of at a child care center rather than be with her mom all the time (before the age of 2 I mean).  I am looking for other articles to understand whether it is best for my baby's mental health to be in childcare or to be with the mother. I am trying to understand what science says about what's best for the mental health of the baby. "
258,Is confusing red and blue at age 3 a possible indication of color-blindness?,"My son knows his colors pretty well, but still frequently seems to say ""blue"" for red items, and ""red"" for blue items (although it seems more common for him to call something red blue than the other way around).  We have a color matching game where a spinner points to a color, and you discard a card with a balloon matching that color.  I noticed that he had no problem matching the color on the spinner with the color of the card he was discarding, but he did call the red card blue.  When I correct him, he usually says ""oh, yeah,"" and then starts referring to it by the right color.  Similarly, he'll sometimes ask for his favorite car by saying the blue car, even though it is fire-engine red.  Are these signs that he might be color-blind?  I know that this is a fairly common thing, especially in males (I believe somewhere around 10% of men have some degree of color-blindness), so I'm not going to make a special trip to the doctor about it (although I'll mention it at our next scheduled wellness visit), but I'd like to know if I can find out on my own.  Is confusion between red and blue normal for color-blindness?  Is there a way that I can test this and eliminate the possibility that he's just getting the words confused? "
259,Want to be Fair / Equal but Still Realistic with Bedwetting Pre-Teens and Social Issues,"I have two step-kids. Boy age 11, girl age 10. They both have bladder issues where they still wet their beds almost every night. The boy is a fairly gregarious outgoing personality who doesn't really care. He makes friends that don't care if he pees the bed, in fact they sometimes do themselves. (clarification: He has friends who either do not care that he has to wear protective wear, or they have/had similar issues)  The girl, however, is horrified at friends finding out she wears diapers to bed, much less that she sometimes pees her bed even with diapers.  The boy goes to friends houses, has friends over, but the girl refuses because of this fear. I'm dealing with a distinct jealousy on the girls part at the fun the boy gets to have because friends invite him out to multiple events but the girl has literally never been to a friends house for the 3 years I've been a step father.  I know that I can't ""make friends for her"" but dear lord... I'm conflicted and my heart hurts for her.  My wife has a serious mental health issue and so I work two jobs in order to pay bills. Our social life (as a family) is fairly non-existent (excluding holidays) so the kids don't even really circulate except for home, and the when they hang out at their dads place of business (he works in the service industry and they get to hang out at his job and play and such, but only sometimes). We don't do church (atheists), we can't afford extra-curricular activities (soccer, karate, etc), and so I'm sitting here wondering...  Is it best to leave her be and hope she'll figure it out? Find a friend or become more independent? She is FIERCELY co-dependent on her brother, and as they have reached that age where they are now in separate bedrooms, and having separate lives, she is mortified and lonely while he is starting to come into his own.  I've thought about trying to find a support group for bladder problems (if such a thing exists) or something similar so she can meet kids dealing with the same issues... but I'm not even sure that is a thing.  How can / should I help her?  Notes:   Bedwetting Statistics : Only three percent of children with primary nocturnal enuresis have a physical or urological cause for it. Psychological problems as a cause of primary bedwetting are not common. Hereditary : My step-children have multiple family members who stopped bed-wetting before 16 years of age. Divorce : As I mentioned, they are my ""step-children,"" and from what I've gathered from both genetic-parents the divorce was rather lengthy, volatile, and stressful for all involved. Everyone is friendly now, but there is a good chance the divorce contributed to their stress and possibly their enuresis problems. Medical Professionals : Both their primary care professionals and family members who are also doctors have come to the conclusion that this is most likely a mixture of genetics and the messy divorce. Some medications have been tried but with no cure.  "

261,Best jigsaw puzzle's size for 5+ year old girl,"My five and a half year old daughter was very found of playing with jigsaw puzzle when she was three. Then she dropped that idea completely. So I don't have any ""growing"" references, for best sizes for her actual age.  She has just got (as Christmas gift) a 50-pieces jigsaw puzzle set. It is labelled ""4+ age"". Since, I don't have any reference for past two years, I thought this will be enough for her age. But, it turned out, that she needed less than five minutes to get done with this. And she didn't even needed to look at a picture or get the border first (a ""help"" that I use most often).  I don't know, what size would be best for her in this situation? I don't want to get her too big one, so she do not get overwhelmed and bored too soon or find it too difficult. But, on the other hand, I don't want to get here the one, which will be done in let's say ten or fifteen minutes.  What would be the best size here? 200 pieces? More? "
262,Should I let my son see his dad,"My son is 9 years old, and is very upset that he can't see his dad.  When he was 4 my ex (who was my husband at the time) adopted him. Soon after we divorced. At first he was very consistent in my son's life. As the time went by he slowed down and then came to a stop in seeing my son. He got into drugs went over a year without seeing him. Then I started letting him again. Now nothing; he's gone again. Recently my ex has been asking me to come see him. My son loves him more than anything and is always asking if he can see him and I just say no.  My question is: should I let him? Is it better for my son to see his father every now and then never knowing when or not at all?   Please help because seeing my son hurt is the worst thing I've ever felt in my life!! "
263,My 2-year-old-son is eating small black stones. How to stop this habit?,"My 2-year-old son is eating small black stones when he is playing outside. We were really shocked he considered those as ""chips"", and he tries to bite the stones and swallows them very often. Now we are not allowing him to play outside because we were really scared whether it will hurt his stomach.   Could any one please let us know how to stop this habit? How can we make him understand a ""stone"" is different from what he is thinking, and he's not allowed to eat it? "
264,"20 yo daughter left home to live with a ""bad"" girl - what should I do?","My daughter of 20 left home a week ago when I found out she had been seeing a friend I disapprove of completely. Countless arguments, violence, police, stealing, and lying are some of this girls better traits. My daughter has left home and come out on Facebook as being gay and in a relationship with this girl! I'm so heartbroken!  My daughter never wants to talk to me again because I won't accept this girl... Am I really wrong? I'm lost as to what to do! They now flaunt it all over Facebook and I'm so so upset that she's done this for the second time in three months! She won't speak to any family members, blocked us all... What do I do?

265,Should I let my baby play with oranges?,"I'm a father of a beautiful girl. She is 8 months old.   I started playing with an unpeeled orange, tossing it in the air and catching it. My little girl noticed it and wanted to examine the orange. Just when I was about to give it to her, my wife stopped me and said that I should not give the orange to the baby because the orange was dirty. I said, ""OK, let's wash it and it should be OK"". She washed the orange. Just when I was to give it to my little girl, my wife stopped me and said that I must not let my daughter lick the orange. I asked why. She said, ""because it contains pesticides"". I explained that we had just washed the orange thoroughly and that it was safe for playing. Then she said again that I must not let our daughter lick the orange and added that it can cause an allergic reaction. Of course my daughter wanted to put the big orange immediately in her mouth to examine it. I didn't want to argue with my wife so I put the orange away.  So, is it OK if an 8-month-old baby plays with an orange? Is it dangerous? "
266,"My 7-year-old is ""in love"" with a girl in his class. How should I deal with this?","He tells me regularly that she's so nice and kind to everyone, how beautiful she is, how pretty her hair is, and this, that and the other. Now he's asking me what he should say to her, and if he should tell her he loves her.  I told him I think it's a bad idea to say that to her because she might not understand, and that he should just appreciate being friends with her and talk to her about things they have in common.  I didn't tell him that I think that he shouldn't tell her because   she might tell him she doesn't like him and that could crush him. she could turn around and tell other people and suddenly he becomes a target for bullying. 7 years of age is too young to be getting involved in that kind of stuff.   I think I should take as much of a hands-off approach to his personal and relational development as I can. I don't mean to say I want him to figure it out all on his own, but I don't want to poison his innocence or experiences with my far more experienced, but biased views.  Is this the right way to deal with this? Should I handle it differently? Should I tell him the cold hard facts? Should I highlight the risks? What is the best way to handle this without negatively influencing him? "
267,Can crawling too early due to over-encouraging parents have detrimental effects?,"I see many posts around the Internet about ""How to encourage your baby to crawl"" but I've once heard that baby development should not be accelerated and that each phase is beneficial to develop certain muscles.  Is this true to crawling? Should babies be encouraged to crawl? At what ages/having reached what milestones? "
268,Bedtime vs amount of sleep?,"I am a single dad who has custody of my 11 year old daughter during the school year.  During the summer, however, she stays with her mother in another town. I have become concerned about the lack of bedtime regimen that she has while she's there - she's basically allowed to stay up as late as she wants (I regularly see Instagram posts etc. at 2 AM+ in the morning) on the grounds that ""it's summer; she can sleep as late as she wants in the morning.""  So - if she goes to bed at 4 AM and sleeps till noon, is there research on whether that's basically as good as 10 PM to 6 AM or whatever? Is an equivalent amount of sleep fine for a kid even if it's not at night? I'm not sure how much of my negative reaction is old-school ""early to bed, early to rise"" inherited-wisdom stuff vs there being an actual reason that's not good for her. What are the documented effects/pitfalls of ""bedtime anytime?""  I have other concerns - a lot of that time is unsupervised, since her mom has young ones they all go to bed early, and a lot of that time is using the Internet... But purely sleep-wise, any thoughts?

269,What kind of questions are asked on the Metropolitan Kindergarten Readiness Test?,"My child will begin school in a little over a year, and they will be administering the Metropolitan Kindergarten Readiness Test.  What kind of questions are asked on the Metropolitan Kindergarten Readiness Test? And how are the skills assessed? "
270,How do you respond to a toddler who insists on having you do their activities for them?,"We have a 3.5 year old and a 2.5 year old and they're both exhibiting this behavior:  They prefer to watch mommy and daddy play rather than do it themselves. I think it started with drawing, we'd show them shapes, and they'd say ask for more: ""More circles!"" or ""More clouds!"" and I thought we were doing pretty good demonstrating how to draw a shape, first with a few examples, then holding their hands, then letting them try followed by praise.  But it seemed to always follow a path where they'd ask again for more and we'd encourage ""okay, keep drawing"" or something like that, and then they'd say ""No.. you do it!"" and if we came back to help, it would repeat - as long as they were moving their hand and such, they'd be fine. So reasonably at some point we have to tell them that they can keep drawing, but we have to continue doing what we were doing.  This has spread in to other activities, where when we play, they want us to drive the cars on the playmat, etc. and it seems to be getting a little silly with respect to how often they insist we do the activity that is intended for them. They just watch. It's become so that if I want to play with them, I end up playing by myself while they watch.  On their own, they're great with respect to imagination and motivation, it's as soon as we attempt to 'join in' that they back off completely and just want to watch.  Is there a good way to respond to this? Should we stop playing until they rejoin the activity? At present if we refuse, they will continue to insist until they get bored and walk away and start something that isn't really structured or constructive.  Sometimes it is really basic things that they will stand and ask for help (such as picking something up off the ground in front of them) - I'm concerned this is learned helplessness? "
271,When should prenatal visits begin?,"My wife is currently pregnant with our second child. We haven't had a prenatal visit yet. With the first pregnancy we had the first prenatal visit long before now. Perhaps we're delaying because we didn't feel like the prenatal visits were very productive at the beginning. That causes me to ask, when should the first prenatal visit be? What is the latest recommended time to start? "
272,Is it ok to disagree in front of the kids?,"We have this little discussion here: Should I let my baby play with oranges?  I believe that it is always better for parents to avoid disagreeing, arguing, etc., in front of the kids, especially when they're young. I thought it was basic common sense, but it seems not everyone agrees to that statement. I'm interested in the different point of views on the matter.  "
273,What studies exist regarding computer usage and computer game playing that support limiting access?,"There is no shortage of questions here that relate to stopping or limiting computer time and game playing. What studies are motivating these concerns? I ask this as someone biased because I spent a lot of my youth on a computer and playing games and I am now a successful professional with a family and a good sense of balance (no 30-hour marathons anymore!) and while my parents were usually concerned, they never did anything to limit my use. I had a computer in my room.  I don't see why reading books is superior to playing on the computer personally, but I'd be interested to see some scientific, preferably long-term studies that establish facts about what constitutes abuse or addiction or otherwise unsafe levels of computer usage.  It seems a lot of people ask, ""All my child likes to do is [x], how do I get them to stop and find something else that they will like doing?"" When they really mean, ""something I like[d] doing"".  Note that monitoring/restricting what they do on the computer makes sense to me, e.g. white listing domains. "
274,CISV: should I trust?,"CISV is a seasoned organization which stages (among other activities) villages: 28 days-long exchanges for children aged 10 coming from all the world.  I am considering letting my child take part in an exchange. The exchange itself looks very promising. I took part to a couple of meetings with the local branch of the organization: a technical one about exchanges dates, destinations and so on, another meeting to let newcomers like me get acquainted with other parents and with the organization.  But while I am very supportive of exchanges, CISV looks strange to me because it is a not-for-profit organization, its aims are really too vague (peace, people's friendship) and from outside there are some similarities to a sect. Moreover CISV is very elitist (I met only upper class international-minded people very far from the working class).  So: CISV raised some suspicions in me. Can you please confirm for me it is not a sect? And about elitism? "
275,How can I get my 4 month old to sleep longer then 9-10 hours a day?,"My 4 month old has never been a great sleeper, in the hospital I expressed concern several times that he was not sleeping. When we got home he slept for 15-30 minute stretches due to poor latching (tongue-tie) until I started exclusively pumping. We started swaddling/white noise/bed time routine as well and he went to doing a 3 hour stretch in the early evening and then waking every 1.5-2 hours or so until the morning. At 3 months old he stopped doing the 3 hour stretch. Now at 4 months old, he'll do a 1.5-2 hour stretch and then he's up every 30-45 minutes until morning. His naps used to be okay but now he's completely regressed on those as well - doing only 2-3 naps the entire day for a total of 3-3.5 hours. Altogether he's not getting more than 9-10 hours max of sleep in a 24-hour period.   We suspected silent reflux so we got him a rock n play (he's never spit up), he sleeps in that and it doesn't make a difference. We've tried co-sleeping. We've tried the Mamaroo. We tried swaddling/not swaddling and do white noise. We've tried modified CIO (going in every 5 minutes). The only thing that gets him to sleep (or back to sleep) is milk. The past month though he only drinks when in the rock n play or in his car seat, he won't drink in my arms. He was 7 lbs 5 oz at birth and now he's 17+ lbs. At his peak he was drinking close to 45 oz of milk per day, but he's since tapered off to about 32 oz. Our pediatrician dismissed his sleeping patterns and told us he was at risk for being overweight (which sounds crazy to me because he only drinks breastmilk). People do regularly think he's around 8 months though. I'm at my wits end, I don't know why my son won't sleep. I can see he's tired and I know he needs a solid block of sleep. Has anyone else experienced this? Could it be allergies (he's got a bit of eczema on his eyebrows/forehead, I keep it at bay with Aveeno lotion)? I don't drink cow's milk and I don't eat anything soy/nut related because I'm allergic. All advice appreciated.   edit: just wanted to add, his tongue tie was fixed. and he was a very quick all-natural birth, we've been to a chiro to fix any alignment issues and it didn't help at all. "
276,Do pregnancy due dates accurately measure maturity (and over maturity)?,"Many doctors and midwives have strict restrictions on how far past the due date you can go before they'll induce labor. Some let you go 1 week, others 2 weeks. Many natural birth advocates claim that this is somewhat bogus because due date predictions are very rough estimates and are subject to a lot of change. I'm not educated on the methodology of predicting due dates to have an educated opinion, so I thought I'd put it to the community...  Are due dates an accurate measurement of babys maturity (or over-maturity)? Has their accuracy improved over time with new methods? Should they relied on any more than a rough guestimate of when the baby has become mature or over mature to the point of requiring induction?  (I'm not trying to incite a flamewar over natural child birth, I just want facts) "

278,How to get a 17 year old son to realize that laundry is not that hard to do and to do it on a regular basis?,"Our other kids that are now grown have pretty much always done their laundry since they were like 13 years old. This son is 17 and probably has only done his own laundry, all on his own, like 10 times in his life. He has a ton of clothes, probably doesn't wear most of them, but I think he tries on a lot of different clothes and if he decides not to wear this shirt or those pants, he just throws them on the floor and they likely just sit there for 2-5 weeks before he starts doing laundry again which usually ends up with him begging for us to help him finish it.  We've already tried explaining that laundry really isn't that hard to do, just throw it in the washer, if there's stains spray some stain cleaner on that part, etc. That it really doesn't take that much time to do it, since most the time it takes to do laundry is the time in which you don't need to do anything since it's in the washer/dryer.  Obviously he has other cleaning issues. I just don't understand how he can care so much about his appearance when he goes to school, but be so dirty in his room with more clothes as the floor instead of carpet. Does he have too many clothes? Should we give/sell a lot of his clothes, because maybe it's just too many choices on what to wear, in that it makes it harder for him to decide? With less clothes he would need to do laundry more, which could mean that maybe he could start forming a habit of actually taking care of his clothes on a regular basis? What can we do, really? "
279,How to deal with my son calling me on the telephone when he is in a fight with his mother?,"I am divorced and have an 8-year-old son. Our son lives half of the time with me, half of the time with his mother. Communication between us parents is good, there is no conflict of any kind, and we cooperate well in raising our son.  Sometimes (about once every two months), when our son is with his mother and they have some quarrel that upsets him, he calls me, and, overwhelmed with hurt and anger, says something angry to me and then hangs up the phone. These calls come completely out of the blue for me, and I'm usually unprepared for them and busy with something else (I often work on those weekends that our son is with his mother).  The problem for me, when I get one of these upset phone calls, is, that I don't know what is (truly) going on – so I don't know what the appropriate reaction would be –, feel that he needs me (or he wouldn't call me) – so I feel I need to help him –, but at his age constructive discussions on the phone are not yet possible (and not what he needs). What he usually needs in similar situations when he is with me is time to calm down and some sort of ""making up"" when he and I are ready for it. I cannot do that over the phone, and I'm also not the person he has been hurt by, so what I often do is call his mother, talk to her, get some (biased) explanation, try to get her to calm down (if she is angry or upset) or change her perspective (if she is, in my opinion, overly strict) and then hope that they can resolve their conflict. Often I call them again later to see how they are, and usually they are fine, but sometimes the conflict goes on for some time, and sometimes I get a few calls with increasing emotions which then unsettles me because I'm too far away to actually interfere in a meaningful way.  I don't want to turn my phone off, because I want to be available to my son, but at the same time these events stress me out and often leave me feeling down for the rest of the day and I don't want to be what I like to call the ""trash bin"" for my son's negative emotions, when I'm not the ""culprit"".  I understand that in a family that lives together, similar things happen, but the phone makes these situations especially difficult. When I'm there, and he's in a conflict with his mother, I can ask him to go out and play soccer with me, and thus get him out of the frustating situation and allow him to take his attention away from his hurt so it can calm over. But when I'm on the phone there is nothing I can do. I can only talk, and talk doesn't help him get out of being focussed on what angers and hurts him.  So basically my question is, how can I deal with these phone calls? I can't always drop what I'm doing and go over there and take care of stuff. I also can't (or don't want to) turn off my phone for the time our son stays with his mother, because being divorced does not free me from the responsibility of caring for our child.  Mostly, I guess, I lack the abilty to listen to him and be there, but not let his emotions affect my own. These phone calls wouldn't be so difficult for me, if I were more stable in my own emotions and didn't feel so over-responsible for the happiness (not well-being) of my child. I understand that it is normal for every person to be frustrated, even sad, from time to time, but I cannot well deal with my son feeling bad, and being unable to do do anything over the phone is torture.  Any ideas? "
280,What are the square cotton wipes that NICUs/nurseries use called?,"Discharge is soon and we're looking a few odds and ends for our little one, but I'm at a loss for vocabulary and I'm not finding what I need with google and amazon searches. Every time I search,  I get the usual branded/store-branded wet wipes which is not what I want.  I'm looking for the word(s) that describes the cotton, disposable cloths that NICUs/Nurseries use.   I feel like they are 4x4 6x6, but they are folded twice (so I guess they are 8x8 12x12 when unfolded).  We use them to wipe the bottom and wet them as necessary.  There's no lotion, no scents, etc.  We would like to use these at home too (we figure the less we change, the better the transition).  I've seen the packs the nurses bring out and they aren't labeled--I guess those come from a medical supplier?    Are those commercially available?  What are they called? "
281,How can I help a child stay motivated in learning to program?,"How could I help a smart preteen child (pre-teen) learn programming? He does well in school, and he has skipped 2 grades and is an introverted stereotypical nerd. He is very interested in web development and has mastered the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JS, which I don't know anything about (I'm not a programmer). He built a personal website from his knowledge. He's learned this from the internet on various tutorial sites and Stack Overflow.  How can I encourage him in developing these skills? Is there a way to help with his learning given that I don't know programming myself? I don't think I can learn all that he has learned, since he spends so much time on it and is so devoted.  I think the greatest danger is losing his motivation and quitting. Debugging can be frustrating sometimes, and I don't want him to stop because of it. In other subjects, I could help him work thru it, but with programming, I can't since I don't have any domain knowledge.  What should I do to keep his motivation to code so that he won't likely get discouraged when faced with difficulties given that I can't overcome those difficulties myself?  (not a parent myself) "
282,Should 18+ kids still have a tight schema for bed and PC-usage?,"I'm not a parent, or in any parenting position. I am however kind of worried because of some rules in the house. I've been 18 for a few months now. And I still have quite a tight schema for bed and PC-usage; to bed at 22.30 PM and PC until 20.30PM. Everyone else that I know, has no such rules.  Is this schema any good? If not, how do I convince or tell my parents that they should be more relaxed about these kind of things? "
283,Sex play in young children,"I have a 3 year old daughter who spends a bit of time playing with her male cousin who is 5 1/2.  I recently walked in to my daughter's room where they were playing to find my daughter completely naked and the pair of them in a sex-like position.  I understand kids being curious about their bodies and differences between boys and girls, but this was a bit out of my comfort zone.   This situation has brought up a few questions for me.  the older child is not a fiend and is clearly mimicking some behaviour that he probably shouldn't be witnessing. Is this normal roleplaying behaviour that some kids go through? Can it be harmful to my daughter?  I  am not in a situation where a can stop them playing together, how do I handle the situation with the other parent who is not as concerned as me? "
284,Should I replace the food my 18 month throws on the floor?,"My child drops her food.  Sometimes its an accident, but often she is rebelling or throwing a small fit.  Should I give into her tantrums and give her alternative choices?  I am considering not giving her food if she won't eat what is in front of her.  But, I am afraid she may be too young to understand cause and effect.  What should I do? "
285,Foster care for a friend's kids,"Back story.  We have a friend who is having troubles keeping her life together. I'm not aware of all the issues. However, they include an abusive husband (who has now been kicked out), financial troubles, and probably no shortage of poor life decisions on her part. We've heard through the grape-vine that her children may be removed from the house by the state.  At the same time (but until today entirely unrelated), my wife and I have been considering Adoption/Foster care. I've not been a fan of foster care (preferring adoption), but would be willing to make an exception in the case of helping out a friend. Losing your dad, and then your mom (even temporarily) is bad enough. At least staying with someone you know is better than with a complete stranger.  The question  Assuming the kids will be put in to foster care for some period of time, how would (or could) this work? Does the system consider a friend offering to take them in?  I'll try to answer any clarifying questions I can, but at the moment this is theoretical (rumor).  Clarifying facts: We are in the US. "
286,What can I do to help a red pimply rash on a newborn baby?,"My 7-week-old baby has a red pimply rash on her face and neck for the past week. It started out on the face, cheeks mainly, and now it is on the neck too. It does not cause any discomfort as far as I can tell. Any ideas as to what causes this? Is it heat or milk? I live in a cold climate. And is there anything I can do to treat it or should I leave it alone? "
287,Should my 3 daughters share 2 rooms?,"My daughter is almost 20 years old and goes to school away from home, so she has her room over 2 reading breaks, thanksgiving, Christmas break, and summer holidays. I brought up the idea of sharing a room with her 12 year old sister which she didn't like at all. Currently her 12 year old sister and her 11 year old sister are sharing a room.   Is it a good idea to put the 20 and 12 year old together so my 12 year old daughter can kind of have her own room? Or does my 20 year old daughter need her space, although it's not used all the time? We do have another room, so the three of them could have their own room, but we have lots of guests that the other room should be vacant for.   What should I do? "
288,How to be a step-mom to a troubled (or hurt) 5-year-old?,"A Bit About Myself  I am in my late 20's, and I am a fairly-new-mom.  I have been married to my daughter's father for about a year now, but I have been around kids my entire life. I have always had many children in my family, I'm a godparent and I'm involved in the lives of all my friends' kids. I began working with young-children when I was in my early teens (babysitting, tutoring, etc.) and still do so to this day; in fact, I've always been described as having a type of ""Snow White-effect"" - in reference to the mutual love I share with all children (and animals). However, I am just now realizing that all of the above means SQUAT when it comes to being a parent/mother! :-/  A little family history  My daughter's birth-mother had began using drugs approx. a year after she gave birth; which caused her and my husband to split. They were never married so there was only a custody battle, in which he won, and shortly after she left the state. Then, around the beginning of last year, she returned pregnant and sober. My husband had been allowing our daughter to remain in the lives of her mother's family, and because of how much they were helping while he was at work, he continued to do so knowing this now meant she would be in the picture. Unfortunately, soon after she gave birth to her second child, she sadly began using drugs again; so this time WE left the state!  The present issue(s)  It was only this past July that we moved, and so this has been a very big transition for my daughter; in addition to being in a new environment, home, just starting school/kindergarten and being away from the only people she knows, now she is missing her birth-mother! :(   The only time I work is some weekdays, after I drop my daughter at school and until I pick her up; so, minus that time my daughter and I spend almost all of our time together, and I feel as though I'm practically a stay-at-home-mother; since she doesn't go to aftercare. I felt this would be the most ideal situation so that I could work closely with her on school and implementing new structure, and an overall new lifestyle for my whole family.  However, just lately my daughter has become very defiant, distracted, and troubled! This is at both home and now school too, where she just doesn't seem to care about anything but other kids and doing every thing she knows she's not supposed to! I have read, researched and studied everything on everything [discipline, keys to successful and happy children, etc.] NO MATTER WHAT I try to do differently not the slightest bit of anything changes!  She talks about her mom as if they did everything together, and we know that they did not. Then admitted to me that she makes up a lot of things or refers them to her mother (such as ""oh, I have that at my moms"" or ""my mom told me that""), but she still does it. She has even destroyed property (things that cannot be fixed - like walls - while using things that she knows very well cause irreversible damage) and then admitted to her grandmother that she did it because she misses her mom!  Obviously we knew this would be a tough adjustment for her and she could probably benefit greatly from counseling, but I still can't help thinking and feeling like there's something I'M doing wrong or that she's missing and we can't provide! Like, I can implement all of the best things that the best books and research could possibly teach, tons of love, in addition to all that I've already known from my history with children her age (plus the fact that I am a woman), but still nothing will help!  Is it the ""child-mother"" factor that she's missing that's causing all of her behavioral issues? Am I not giving her the same kind of love/feeling/enough love? Will this pass without causing her long-term irreversible-damage? I feel so helpless and so much pain for her! "
289,"Is the ""cry it out"" approach harmful?","We have several questions on this site that deal with infants and toddlers who cry a lot, for various reasons.  Here is an example question and example answer, another answer. The topic was raised on the Skeptics site but no answer was provided. Perhaps we can find a good answer on our site here.  There are two basic approaches:   Leave the child completely alone until the crying stops. &lt;-- This is what I want to address. Leave the child for only a short moment and then return. Repeat with increasing absences.   Is it likely to harm an infant/a toddler to let him intensively cry until he stops on his own?  To elaborate, I have some additional questions:   At what lower age/development limit would the practice be acceptable, and why? What factors could help determine whether the practice would work on a specific child?   For the purpose of this topic, let me define ""crying"" as real, full-strength, all-out,  non-verbal mommy-daddy-come-help-me crying, not just whining or whimpering. Every parent knows his child and will recognize when the child really cries -- that is what I mean here.  Also, let me define ""harmful"" as not just transitory sadness but rather something where one could expect negative mid-to-long-term effects such as trauma, separation anxiety, lack/loss of trust in parents and others.  The crying could be related to bedtime/sleep but also during daytime when the parents aren't near. "
290,Is my stepson being exposed to something inappropriate?,"My step son is 5 years old and spends most of his time with his biological mom. We don't agree with a lot of the things she does but I have never though there was anything not good going on. However, a few weeks ago he was watching my hubby play a video game. He said he liked the girl characters boobs and that he wanted to put his wiener on them. More recently he told me that after his dad went to work he wanted me to pull my pants down and sit on his head. I feel like this is not normal for his age and I'm wondering if he is being exposed to something inappropriate at his mom's. Am I wrong? Is this normal for a 5 year old? "
291,How should I respond to my 5-year-old daughter kicking me?,"My daughter is 5 years old. She often ""plays"" rudely with me. For example, she'll kick me, and I cannot explain clearly to her that the behavior is impolite.  Sometimes I kick her (and as a result, she becomes angry or cries), and I have told her that when she kicks me it hurts me (in fact, my daughter understands what I mean, as sometimes she may say ""sorry"" to me).  Sometimes, I ignore her behavior and do something else by myself.  How should I respond when she behaves like this? How can I best educate my daughter? "
292,Cleaning bathtub toys that squirt water,"What is the best way to clean out bath toys that store water?  Specifically, we have quite a few toys that have a hole in the bottom and can suck in water and squirt it out when squeezed. A few of those toys are next to impossible to empty of water completely and hence have started growing some mildew.   We're considering squirting vinegar (or possibly a diluted vinegar solution) into the toys and leaving them to stew for a while, but is there a Good Way of doing this? Naturally, any solution ought to be child-safe. "
293,What's the best way to fix a toddler's mispronunciations?,"My friend's son loves dinosaurs.  He'll show me a toy or a picture of one, and say ""dinosaur-ous!""  My child is rapidly approaching speech, and I was wondering if it is better to point out errors like that? (""No, it's dinoSAUR."") Or should you simply agree with the child, but pronounce it correctly for them? (""Yes, I see the dinosaur!"") "
294,Why do babies fight sleep and how to calm them down?,My nice of 9 months is crying to fight sleep. Why does she do that? How can one calm her down?   It's absolutely silly to watch :). She sits there and everything is all right. As soon as she falls over cause the sleep is overwhelming she starts fervently to cry.  
295,How to approach of a child suffering from a potential sleep disorder?,"My son is 17 months old with a regular routine in a nuclear family.     0700 awake 0745 in nursery Full day of nursery 1730 pick up from nursery 1800 relaxing time with mum and dad 1830 bath time 1900 story / quiet time 1920 bottle of warm whole milk 1930 bedtime   As a family we have the usual toddler tears you would expect with bedtime and handle them accordingly but the real reason for this question occurs between the hours of 2300 and 0500.  Randomly, for 4 to 5 minutes, he will wake up in absolute hysterics screaming for his mother.  His eyes are closed and when picked up to be soothed he will not recognise us and continue the episode.  He is, as far as I can tell, still asleep during these periods but the screams are deafening.   I don't know if this qualifies as a night terror?  Sometimes the episode will manifest itself with him pushing himself away from us to the floor and running into other rooms (asleep).  Normally he will settle by the stair gate clutching it and shouting as if he has been abandoned and we (parents) are downstairs instead of next to him.  The only remedy we have found is to have one or two bottles of milk on hand to give to him which normally soothe his distress until he falls back asleep.  Context  His mother is a fairly normal sleeper but I am a hypnagogic sleeper; dreaming/hallucinating as soon as I close my eyes and not waking for any amount of noise or distraction.  Often my dreams are in full colour and my partner can have full, lucid conversations with me whilst I sleep which I cannot remember.  However, in 32 years I have never had a nightmare that I can recall so I don't know how to approach my son to help him deal with this sleeping problem.  I always found Hynagogic sleep a pleasant experience.       Do any parents or medical professionals on these forums have experience and/or advice on how to support my son?  "
296,Is my wife an over-protective parent and how does this influence my child?,"My daughter is 10 months old.    Since her birth, my wife has never even once left the baby with me alone. First it was breastfeeding, then other excuses. She's constantly around me. Constantly checking me. Constantly enforcing her rules. It's ""her way or no way"". Our relationship is suffering very much because of this.  Thy typical pattern is that I suggest an activity - benign and something I suppose my daughter would like - and she comes up with one obstacle after another why this is not possible. If I put my foot down she will follow me and my daughter literally every step of the way.  It is always centered around hygiene and vague ""dangers"". My hands aren't ""clean"", objects like leaves of trees are ""dirty"" and she insists that I wash and sanitize my hands and wet wipe whatever I hand to my daughter. It took me months to take my daughter outside because it was ""too cold"" or ""too dangerous"" at 23°C / 73°F and my wife clearly stated that she doesn't trust me with the baby. The first months the baby spent most of her time with my wife in the kitchen and my wife is still reluctant to leave the house with me.  On one outing to a nearby national park when I had to carry our daughter because the trail was unsuitable for the stroller, my wife was so nervous and upset, almost to the point of crying. I tried to calm her, but to no avail. At one point I tried to show my daughter a leaf from a nearby tree and my wife objected.  She insisted that a leaf from a tree could be first poisonous, then possibly causing an allergy and finally one from a non-allergenic tree had to be cleaned with a wet wipe first, I gave up and we went home.  Admittedly, with all the fussing I sometimes cave in and simply desist from playing ith my child.  My wife was afraid of everything from the time we met each other. She's like that with our baby too. I'm the total opposite - I'm not afraid of something that I see as ""safe"". She says ""everything will change when the baby gets older"", but I'm afraid she's just saying that to make me happy. I think nothing will change because that's how she behaves with herself and that's how you'll also behave with your child. Consequently our relationship will suffer and even my relationship with my daughter will suffer.  I love my child and would never put her in danger, but I want to play with her and show her the world. But I can't do that if I'm constantly restricted and basically forbidden to pick her up unless I wash my hands first.  I have confronted my wife various times and she always insisted that I was not to be trusted, that her behaviour was perfectly normal and that all mothers are as protective of their babies as she is. Is that true?  Is her very protective behaviour really good for our daughter or might she actually cause harm? What can I do to make sure my child really gets what she needs?   Or is my wife right and she is too young to go on excursions and the world is so full of germs that it is better to wipe down everything? Am I missing something? "
297,Are there studies on the effects of corporal punishment?,"   Possible Duplicate:   Are there any reputable studies on spanking?       Is there any serious research on whether kids who are punished through pain-infliction by parents learn how to properly act in a society better or worse than other kids?

299,Has W. Fowler's infancy reading method been replicated/improved?,"From J. Medina's Brain Rules for Babies:     Educational psychologist William Fowler trained a group of parents to talk to their children in a particular fashion, following some of the guidelines mentioned above. The children spoke their first words between 7 and 9 months of age, some even speaking sentences at 10 months. They had conquered most of the basic rules of grammar by age 2, while the controls achieved a similar mastery around age 4. Longer-term studies showed that the kids did very well in school, including in math and science. By the time they entered high school, 62 percent of them were enrolled in gifted or accelerated programs. Critical parts of Fowler’s training program need further study, but his work is terrific. It adds to the overwhelming evidence that a whole lot of talking is like fertilizer for neurons.   The references are:     Fowler, W. “Accelerating Language Acquisition.” Ciba Found Symp 178 (1993): 207-17. (PubMed)      Fowler, W. Talking from Infancy: How to Nurture and Cultivate Early Language Developmet. Cambridge, MA: Brookline Books, 1990. (Amazon)   The first one was probably a speech at a symposium, so only the abstract is available and it doesn't say anything about the method. The second one is Fowler's book. I haven't found any excerpts on the Internet. One of the reviews says:     This book was probably great a decade or so ago, but now the information in here is common knowledge. Essentially the book says to talk to your kid and play educational word games.   The most cited of Fowler's works is A developmental learning strategy for early reading in a laboratory nursery school, but this is a study in older children.  Teaching infants to speak first sentences before 1 year of age is quite a claim to make. Is this method really ""common knowledge"" now, as the Amazon review suggests? Has this study been replicated or are there similar methods that have been proven to work? "
300,Caught mum in my room reading one of my letters,"Searched the forum and couldn't find anything similar.   I'm 25 and had a letter on my bed that I was reading from the morning. Mum has come in to talk to me, then I go to the toilet. When I come out of the toilet, she then asks me a question about a financial matter on the letter. I responded fairly sharply ""what are you doing reading my letters for?""  She seems angry now, but a bit confused as to next steps etc? How should I approach this?  EDIT: Caught her doing this before and said that it would be ideal for her not to do it and she apologised, if that helps with context regarding my reaction. "
301,What's an appropriate age for a Swiss Army Knife?,"My 11-year-old son watched a documentary on the Swiss Army Knife and is enamored with getting one for Christmas. We are in the UK regulatory sphere.    He proposes to use the knife on camping expeditions either with family or with the Sea Cadets. Additionally, I am pretty sure that having such a tool bestows status among his peers in the neighbourhood, so there is also a 'non-utilitarian' motive.  He is somewhat advanced in terms of maturity and is good-natured and he is generally not exposed to criminal influences, gangs, and the like.  I know there is a knife for first-timers, I cannot see the value in it and contemplate a somewhat more versatile model shown on this page.    I am OK with deferring this until another year if needs be. I wonder if there are regulatory aspects to consider and if so, which.  What age is appropriate for such a gift? Parents with similar experiences may be able to offer valuable insights.  Note:  There is a related question regarding kitchen skills here: When should a child begin to learn knife skills for use in the Kitchen?  I do not think it's a duplicate because it's more appliance based and a kitchen would not have the same regulatory implications as a pocket knife. "
302,How should a child be prepared for adulthood?,"How can parents best prepare their children for the difficult task of choosing a profession, and dealing with all of the (frequently tedious) steps involved in making that career happen?  The typical jobs most children will wind up having will set them up for a lifetime of a fixed schedule, with limited recreation time and opportunities.  Discovering this can be quite a shock to people, as introduction to professional life can be disorientating, and can cause some people to falter and fail due to not being adequately prepared for the commitment and discipline required.  Even worse, choosing poorly, or inadequate preparation, can result in winding up in a career that they do not enjoy, and will therefore spend the majority of their waking hours unhappily working in jobs that are performed only out of necessity.  How do you help your children prepare? "
303,Is it safe for a 2.5 year old toddler to be allowed to plug in the light cord into the wall plug,I have a 2.5 year old grandson I moved across the country to take care of and my daughter and I collide with what is safe to allow for him to do and not do..... For instance he likes to plug his light in and I tell him to ask for help and he does when he's with me but as soon as mama comes home he's plugging in the cord by him self..... She says it's one less thing for her to have to do?? Maybe I'm in the Stone Age and things have changed my daughter and son in law just laugh at me and say he will only get zapped once then he will know better...... Should I just let it go or is there anything to be concerned about? From a concerned grandma  
304,How much stool and urine production per day should be considered normal at what age?,"The baby (25 days old) produces wet/semi solid yellow stools once after 3 days. Is this considered constipation? Also, how many wet diapers (urination) should I expect from her per day on an average?  To keep this question generic please include age specific answers with references. "
305,How should I deal with a 6.5 year-old misbehaving boy?,"My son is six years old, quite intelligent,grasps things easily, is really sharp at school really, good with teachers, and often very nice with friends. But he is showing opposite behavior to me; he is misbehaving, very aggressive, doesn't listen to me, says ""NO"", uses bad language, shouts a lot, cries on the top of his lungs and doesn't listen to me even if I uses harsh words, slap him, or beat him. He also doesn't listen to his father, throws heavy things on others, especially on his 5 year old sister. He also beats his sister a lot, snatches everything from her, kicks her and says he doesn't like her.  When he was 3 years old I was harsh with him. To discipline him I would slap him often and used to leave him at a relative's home (as i have to take my daughter to hospital for admission) and he feels bad about this. I think I can't reverse things now. But now harsh behavior is not working any more. Harsh behavior worked when he was 4-5 yrs old but now its just hopeless. i don't want to beat him or be harsh with him, but he forced me so much that I can't control myself.  Why he is bad at home? What can I do? "
306,My friend opened up to me about depression,"So I'm 13 years old and in 7th grade. I have this friend that I met this year. She's been a really good friend to me but I wouldn't describe her a best friend. There has recently been some drama over someone liking her and she lashed out at that person in a group text I was in, using extreme expletives. I texted her about it and asked what was up, and she said this:     The reason I yell and lash out all the time is because I am constantly sad. I'm lonely. Even when surrounded by a lot of friends I still feel alone all the time.      I'm sorry I shouldn't have told you all of that. I'm going to go, bye.      And dont think about it. I'm fine don't worry I won't do anything.      I'm sorry.      Sorry.   I've been as supportive as possible but as she opens up to me more and more it seems more like she needs to tell someone who can help her about it. From what she's told me, I have a suspicion she is bipolar. I've encouraged her to go to a doctor or to our guidance counselor, but she says that she 'can't trust them' and that the doctor would recommend pills which would 'screw her up even more'. She has told me she doesn't want me to tell anyone about it, and I said that I would only tell an adult who can help if I think she needs it, but I if I did she would never forgive me.   What can I do about this? What can I say, and should I tell her parents? I want to help her, but this is scary to me. If any more info is needed, feel free to ask in the comments.  Sorry if this is off topic, as it isn't a question directly about parenting, but it seems to be on topic from what I have read on meta. "
307,Which is the best option electric or a manual breast pump and how to choose the best one,"There is a huge number of pumps, as assorted varieties are coming up in the market. How to choose an ideal breast pump, which minimizes wastage, maximizes ease of use, portability and safety? Should one even consider electric pumps or manual pumps?   Motivation:  Our baby was born three days ago and we have planned to breast feed the baby for 2 full years. But the baby takes a lot of time to breast feed (more than 1 hour).  This is also painful to the mother's nipples, hence going for the breast pump. "
308,21 month old v/s a floor-to-ceiling window,"I know, we should have thought about this when moving in, but we were dumb(er) then. We have 3 floor-to-ceiling windows in our living room - only one of them is easily accessible to our 21 month toddler. While it's a double-tempered glass, looks pretty sturdy, is a common set up in our highrise, and my wife is a stay-home mom, I just get nervous when he gets close to the window, and especially today, when I saw him leaning against the window.   I am thinking of getting a wide baby gate to cover the whole window up to 3.5 feet. Although, the wife now feels that will draw the toddler's attention to the glass window, and perhaps even facilitate climbing the gate and fall over/against the window?   What have folks in this situation done to keep their kids safe? "
309,Five year old successfully built a Lego set meant for 6-12 year olds. Does this mean anything?,"Five year old son successfully built a Lego set meant for 6-12 year olds over 3 to 4 days.

310,How to introduce foods to my 4-month-old girl?,"Our doctor recommended us to start giving fruits to our little (4 months and some days) little girl, since the mother will return to work and won't be able to breastfeed so freely.  Ok, yesterday we started with apple, today with papaya. A very small quantity, in a very small (metallic) spoon, at room temperature.  Of course, she hated everything. We know that we should continue, very tiny little portions every day. But... does someone have a better procedure to introduce those new flavors and tastes? Any special recommendation about temperature, which fruits to give, or any other suggestion ?  Just to clarify, the food will be smashed, like smashed potatoes, not in small pieces... and will be just one of the meals, with the other 5 or 6 of the day being breastmilk. "
311,"Child wearing glasses, does he need them?","I have a 3-year-old son, who has a developmental delay. He isn't yet talking, and he is just beginning to walk. We have taken him to 2 top eye doctors, who have basically said the same thing: That he definitely needs glasses, and life for him without them is very blurry.  This is the perscription (same for both eyes) Sph. +6.5. Cyl -3.5  He has been wearing glasses since about 1 and a half years old.  My problem is, he takes off his glasses all the time. He isn't interested in wearing them at all. If he's distracted he can leave them on, but if bored he takes them off. I haven't seen any difference in his vision if he wears them or not. I mean, he sees a toy from a distance away, even without his glasses. And even from near, when playing with small objects I see no difference if he wears them or not. I feel that it's a loosing battle to keep telling him off to put them on.  However the doctors say he needs them... It's hard for me to go by my judgement that he may not need them, against the doctors.  Does anyone have any advice? How could we get him to keep on his glasses? We have tried with a strap behind them, but this didn't help. He still is at the developmental stage of putting things in his mouth, so he likes to chew the arms of the glasses. "
312,Helping teenage son to get over his crush,"Our teenage son (17) likes this girl, but he allegedly doesn't have chances with her (*). While we do think that this is something he has to deal with himself, it did affect his mood visibly over the past few days. He's less happy and optimistic than he normally is, and it's rather sad to see this. We haven't really said much to him about it because we are not sure what to say/do: saying the wrong things isn't going to make it better.  So what should we do? Should we do anything, or let him deal with this himself?  (*) Based on some answer comments, I think I phrased this a bit confusing (non-native speaker here!). While the girl didn't flat-out reject him (i.e. saying ""no""), he did approach her but her reaction wasn't the most 'open' one, if that makes sense. Basically she tried to avoid him most of the time and didn't feel much like conversation with him. So the problem isn't that our son doesn't know how to approach her.  To answer the ""where do you live?"" question: West-Europe. "
313,"13 y/o step-son wants to be a ""furry""","My 13 year old step-son told his mother yesterday that he wants to be a ""furry.""   A couple days ago he decided he wanted to make a cat costume. I just shake my head most of the time when he comes up with these ideas and try to remind him he's 13 now and that might not be the priority at the moment (like saving for a car and other teen boy interests). He has ADHD, so his personality is that of a very sensitive and slightly immature nature.  He ended up making his costume and wearing it to school. I didn't know this until after the fact. But his mother (my wife) said that while no one laughed or made fun of him in front of him there was probably some talk behind his back. It is a very small school in a very rural part of the US.  This prompted my wife to have him Google what a ""furry"" is and after doing so discussing it a bit further on his feelings about that topic. I'm sure the whole concept was introduced to him from spending too much time on YouTube and coming across things which may seem innocent but have longer term effects or other connotations attached to them.  He said he wanted to do this ""because he can be who he is."" I think the whole thing was pretty innocent but a bit off for a 13 y/o. After the later discussion he expressed that the costuming and what-not would just be a hobby for him, that its not some kind of lifestyle change or related to fetishism.   I'm concerned for a number of reasons. While I struggle with the idea, I worry more for him dealing with it all. I don't see his bio-father taking it well nor his maternal grandfather. Maybe that won't be a big deal if its only a costume making hobby. Should it be a regular thing to wear to school, etc., I see problems. Being in a small town, yet big enough for weirdos as it is, people are very judgmental.   My Question is this:   What should I do? How can we be supportive of him in his choices without him being bullied? Do we help him embrace this or try to deter him away from it? Are we over-thinking this at this point in time?  "
314,How to positively teach a toddler dishonest actions are bad,"While on vacation my family and I were at a store and my 4 year old daughter had picked up a toy and placed it on the checkout belt.  At this time we did not notice the toy and proceeded to checkout and leave the store.  While driving down the road my daughter had requested such toy, a stuffed animal.  When my wife and I were discussing with my daughter that we did not buy such toy she proceeded to say we did.  When we searched the bags we noticed the toy and said where did this come from?  My daughter said she placed it on the conveyor belt.  When we asked her why not ask us she said she knew we would say no and she wanted it.     How do I teach her in this situation that this is bad? Is this considered stealing in a way and she we teach my daughter? What is an acceptable form of punishment? Should we keep the toy and allow her to receive it when she is good or does that have any bad effect with the incident involved?  "
315,What's the effectiveness of alternative uses of breast milk?,"I have read  various articles that promote breast milk as a cure for many infant problems like diaper rash, red eye, sores and mother problems like sore nipples, injuries etc.  What is the scientific evidence for such use of breast milk? Wouldn't it become a breeding ground for bacteria if applied to skin for a diaper rash? Have any parents used it in that way and what are their experiences? Does it work? "
316,Is it ok to play with a 10 months old baby in nature?,"I have a  very curious 10 month old daughter who and touches and examines everything.  I'd like to take her to a small national park and show her trees, bark, and pieces of wood and rocks on the beach. I'd like to let her sit on the grass, play in the small forest, play on the beach (rocks about palm/hand sized), etc.  My baby puts things in her mouth.   Is it ok if the baby picks up a rock, a leaf, or a piece of wood and examines it with her mouth (of course I'd make sure the item is big enough so she can't ingest it and that the item does not show any signs of containing or being covered with harmful substances.)  What are the benefits this kind of mouthing of objects? What are the disadvantages? Are there any dangers for the baby in doing what I described? "
317,How to behave with 10 months old baby around staircases?,I understand staircases are very dangerous for babies.  We have only one staircase at our home. The staircase is 20 cm high.  Our baby is very curious and wants to go down that one staircase (20 cm high) and into the other room to explore it.  I'd like to safely introduce the staircase to my baby. How should I do this? How should I approach teaching a 10 months old baby about the staircase? 
318,Why do my parents start ridiculing me in front of my friends?,"I am 27 years old and I live with my fiance. Every time I happen to meet my friends and my parents are around, or whenever my fiance meets my parents, my parents start ridiculing me. They start telling stories of when I was still a child and twisting tales to make me look stupid and like an imbecile.  Whenever I confront them they become verbally abusive and they spend days on end not talking to me just because I stand up for my rights.  Why is that? Why do they act the way they do? "
319,Are children harmed by the awareness of their parent's sexuality and sexual activity?,"My wife and I are having our first child this July and a conversation that we have now and then is the prospect of having sex with our baby in the room.  I've read other questions related to this topic but I have found all answers to be inadequate...  Here is my position:  Children of ANY age are unharmed by the awareness of their parent's sexuality and sexual activity if the parents age-appropriately explain how intimacy goes along with their lovingly committed relationship.  Here is my rationale:   I am of the opinion that parents are best positioned to talk to their children about sexuality because the children trust their parents. In the context of trust, talking about how two people who are committed to each other also physically enjoy each other will make sense of the parent's affection and sexuality. If the parents are concerned that the child may be misinterpreting the sounds coming from the bedroom as violence, the parents can easily clear up the confusion by explaining it as the noise they make when experiencing the pleasure of love making - which leads to my second point. The earlier parents communicate with their children about sexuality, the less likely the child is going to explore their curiosity on their own. There are a ton of YouTube resources* to demonstrate how sex leads to childbirth that are very academic. Guiding your child through how sexuality functions will deter your child from ""playing doctor/mommy-daddy/other euphemisms for sex"" games with their peers. If the consequences of sex is appropriately explained, children will be less likely to ""play with fire."" Children who grow up knowing that sex is natural, pleasurable, and good in a committed relationship will be much more prepared to protect themselves from being taken advantage of AND they will be more equipped to deal with their emotions if they tragically are taken advantage of. Children who are aware of their parent's sexuality and its expression will be able to develop a framework for how they will personally experience their own sexuality.   What I'm not saying:  I'm not saying that you should flaunt your sexuality in front of your children or invite them into the intimacy you share with your spouse. The framework should be one that establishes that sexuality (as well as bathroom nudity) is something that happens in private; that sexuality shared in an intimate relationship strengthens bonds and affections; that sexuality has powerful consequences both chemically as a couple and physiologically if a life is conceived.  I'm not saying that there is no risk of harm. If you fail to navigate the issue well, I would not be surprised if the child grows up and has strange sexual proclivities, is unable to ""unsee"" what is seen, and needs therapy sessions to talk things through with a professional.  *Here's a YouTube video which beautifully explains how conception works with graphics appropriate for children: [website]To restate for StackExchange purposes: What's the harm?

320,"How to encourage our 3-year-old, who has 100% ""miss"" at home, to use the toilet?","We started to potty train our 3-year-old daughter about a week ago, after she showed the initial signs by asking to wear underwear ""like mom and dad"". We explained to her it means she must use the potty or toilet for pee and poo and she appeared to understand.  Potty turned out to be ""too boring"" and she refused to sit on it, so we showed her the toilet seat for kids we also bought and she was all happy and cheerful, sitting on it without a problem and feeling really adult for using mom's and dad's toilet.  However, ever since then she just holds both pee and poo, and crying when it's finally arriving and causing either a puddle (usually on the floor) or a mess in her underwear. It happened many times by now. Things we tried, to no avail:   Telling her constantly ""you have pee? please go to the toilet to check"". Most of the times she just says ""no"" and doesn't go, sometimes she will go, sit for a few minutes, say ""I'm done"" without doing anything and go away. Taking her to the toilet every 10 minutes or so even if she says she doesn't need to. Most of the time, she refuses to sit and when she agrees to sit, see #1 above. After every ""miss"" explain to her kindly that next time she has to tell us before it happens and go to the toilet. She just nods her head and says yes but... nothing really changing.   She goes to day care, where most of the other kids are already potty trained and while there she does reach the toilet in time (they also have toilet seats for kids) though not always, but it means she can tell when it's coming.  What else can we do at home to encourage her to use the toilet? Why the different behavior between home and day care?  Worth to mention that during the night she still wears diapers, we prefer to wait until she's trained during the day before starting the nights. "
321,Is it safe for one-year old baby to sleep in her car seat for long hours?,I am planning for a long road trip (about 17 hours of drive).  Is it safe for my one-year old baby to sleep in her car seat for such long hours?  How often should I stop to take a rest and how long should each rest be before continuing? 
322,How long does breast milk last after taken from the fridge?,"There's a lot of information available about how long pumped breast milk can be kept for, generally citing different temperature ranges.  From the CDC (though the same reference is also cited by the Canadian Pediatric Society):     It's cited that milk thawed from the freezer should be used within 24 hours in the fridge, or 1 hour at room temperature.  The Mayo Clinic has an article saying ""Other studies have shown that refrigeration beyond two days might reduce the bacteria-killing properties of breast milk"", but no references to where this comes from or any further information.  My wife is exclusively pumping, and so there is a lot of milk cycling in and out of the fridge. She is always concerned about using milk taken out of the fridge (generally +/- 1 day old) within an hour or two. We often talk milk out (and let it warm up to room temperature), only to have baby fall back asleep. Is there a basis to how long fridge-temperature milk (stored at 3 degrees C for a day or two) can be out of the fridge for before it has to be used/tossed? "
323,"Our infant was sleeping through the night, but at 5 months old started waking up in the middle of the night; is this from starting to dream?","My little girl started sleeping all night long when she was 3mo. She was sleeping from 11:00PM to 7:00AM, without waking up.  Shortly after she turned 4mo, she woke up during 2 days, screaming and crying, and we thought she was beginning to dream.  Now, 5mo old, she has begun to wake up twice every night. Not at the same time, though; there is a 1 hour variation. Her diapers are a bit wet, but just as they were previously. She begins to make noises, the she begins to cry a little, and I wake up, change her diapers, she breastfeeds for some 15 minutes, and we put her in her cradle again. After about 5 minutes she falls back to sleep  Is this normal? I read somewhere that after 4mo she would do this, since she would begin to dream, but I can't find the source anymore.   And how long does this take? :) "
324,I don't want to be an involved grandparent. How do I let my son know?,"I know I'm in a small minority when I say I'm NOT excited to be a grandparent. I've never really liked children, and used to be determined against having any of my own. But mainly because my husband wanted, we did have a child. He was very involved and together we managed to raise a well balanced son. Looking back, I feel my main goal was to have a balanced life even with a child, and to raise him to be independent (of me, basically). This worked out well as a parenting philosophy, although I suspect my interests and freedom were really in the forefront.  When our son didn't live with us anymore, we continued to have a meaningful relationship with him - with the proverbial good fences. My husband and I retired early and went back to travelling, which we love. Our son is now 27 and married with a child on its way. He's already talking about what a wonderful grandmother I'll be, how much I can play with the child, and how they're thinking of moving closer to our house so we get more time with each other during the weekends. From the looks of it, he's counting on me to be really hands on in helping them raise the child. His wife's parents are not in the picture anymore, so that leaves us to be the only grandparents. (I don't believe that not having a constant presence of grandparents will affect kids in anyway. I grew up without any - they'd all passed or lived 100s of miles away - and never felt like I missed out on anything. But that's a debate for another day.)  I don't want to break his heart, or his wife's, but it worries me that yet again I have to help raise a baby. It is exhausting! I'm still not a fan of kids, and even when I find them adorable, they quickly wear me out. Only this time, I'll have responsibilities without the ""power"" to discipline them - I'm not even sure I want that disciplinarian role. I do not look forward to spending all my weekends with the baby, which is what I fear will happen if they move closer to our place. I don't know what this would end up doing to our travelling plans. I just feel like once again, I'm getting into taking care of babies when I'd rather not.  What I can do is play with the baby for some time, babysit for some time, and if asked, advise or help in any other way. ""Some time"" is key word here, because like I said, babies wear me out soon and I'm not even young anymore. I'm more comfortable with kids over 5 or 6, when I can actually have a conversation with them. I understand that if I'm not in my grandchild's life now, I may not be when they're older. I guess I'm ok with that...  I don't know if this makes me horribly selfish, but that is not what my question is about. Its about:   How do I convey my feelings to my son (and his wife)? And when? Should I set expectations early on, or wait till it starts to get on my nerves and then tell them exactly what it is that I can't handle?   My husband is ambivalent - he doesn't want to give up on our personal time and space either, but at the same isn't worried about having to take care of the baby. We've talked about it, he doesn't seem to think one will be affected by the other and generally thinks that we'll just cross the bridge when we come to it. Im 57 and my husband is 58, if its relevant. "
325,Building a better relationship between half siblings for a more unified home?,"My step son is 5. He's still struggling with the seperation of his parents. We have all been trying to reassure him in this home that he is loved. His father takes him for outings, sometimes, due to supervised visits his father takes his ex wife along too so she can can time in with him.  This is not getting any better, for anyone here. His father and I have a fourteen month old daughter. Who is not getting the same attention from her father. His spare time is dedicated to issues pertaining to his ex wife, work, or just making time to do things with his son.  I get it, she is so very young. She can't do legos with the boys. She can't play board games with them. Or cheer for a sports team with them while they cuddle up and watch a game together.   And with this divide, I feel that his son is being shown that my daughter and I are not as valuable. He makes choices. We revolve her naps/ dinner around his schedule at times. He gets to leave with daddy and go places while we sit home and I prepare dinner.  He has no interest in playing with his sister. None. He will play around her, or play aggressively. I make play dates now, outside of the home during his school time for her. And I see a difference in other older siblings with their younger ones. No child is perfect, and I know we are all responsible for how they learn. I am just growing confused.   We finally had a family outing- all four of us- for the first time in a long while. When we came home, my daughter was by herself playing while he and his father were joking at the dinner table. I was doing dishes. All laughs, but then he came out with it again: He wants his sister and me to leave. He says this probably about once a day at least. Even in passing thought.  He had gotten a bit violent with her before - choking her, kicking her off the couch causing a bad bruise under her eye. He has expressed violent behavior towards the family dog. To be honest, I'm not sure what else to do, and no one seems to think he needs help. Or is doing anything about it. I am not married to his father, I have no rights. I can't do it.  I want my daughter to have her father and brother in her life. I just don't know how to get him to not see her as an enemy?   How to show him that we are family too?  "
326,The teacher erased 3 pages of my 5 year old's completed homework,"I have a 5-year-old smart child. He does his homework as neat as he can. Yesterday, he stayed up for an hour doing 3 pages of homework as good as he can and today when checking his copy-book, I found that his teacher had erased all the 3 pages and wrote a note on each page (do your homework neatly).   Is this the right way of checking a small kid's homework, and if not, how am I supposed to act?   I attached one of the pages.    In response to comments: The teacher replied that he has to write on the lines not off lines. I went to the school and tried to meet her, but they said it's not allowed during school time, so I had a meeting with the coordinator and the school principal who both insisted that this is the right way of correcting the homework and said that it is better than marking all the homework with red and crossing it out for him. I certainly believe that erasing a kid's homework will cause a negative impact which already happened, he cried when he found it erased and asked ""why do I have to do it all again?"" "
327,"My husband is likely the father of a child, but the child doesn't know. Is it too late with the child being 12 years old?","This happened before my husband and I were together! My husband was told 11 years ago that he fathered a little boy. The mother told him it was his then the very next day she told him she was just lying to him. She showed my husband a Birth certificate that her husband signed. (Basically to try and prove it wasn't really his). My husband's name is NOT on the Birth certificate. The mother got pregnant and went and got married (her husband's name is on the Birth certificate) before the child was born. Then she came to him (my husband) and told him he was the father of her child, then she changed her mind a day or 2 later and said ""never mind I was drunk when I told you that"". Her and her husband were going through a rough patch when my husband was told.  We have 2 young kids together and the child in question is now 12 years old and looks identical to my husband and our boys. There has never been a DNA test done but he is really starting to look just like my husband. I believe the guy who is raising him knows (or assumes) that the 12-year-old isn't his biological child.  My question is will it cause more pain for this boy to learn the truth about who is real father is? Should this come out now at 12 or wait for the child to find out when he is older from friends or an adult around town? I have no question that this young boy will find out eventually. It has been out and about with people in town talking about it lately. My husband is concerned that it could do more harm than good if we press the issue now. We are at a loss of what to do now that the mother has lied about who the young boy's father is. Should my husband press the issue or should we just let it go and if the boy finds out down the road just explain to him that (my husband) was told it wasn't his? We live in the same exact town!  We believe our 4 children we have now will be fine either way if they find out the news now or in years down the road. There is one more twist... My husband family has colon cancer that runs in the family. My husband's grandfather died at 32 and his own father died in his 50's. My husband is followed closely by doctors along with my boys who are starting to be followed at 6 and 8 years old. My husband is concerned how the news will affect the young boy being a 12-year-old. "
328,16 months old and no signs of communication. Should we be concerned?,"Our son is now 16 months old and does not know any words yet. He doesn't seem to understand anything we say either.  He makes plenty of talking sounds, he looks at you and babbles but no words.   We keep hearing about plenty other babies younger then him that are already communicating, saying at least 5 words and understanding more than that. This is making us worried there is something wrong.  He does a lot of physical mimicking though, for example, if we pick up a toy and touch it to our nose, then give it to him, he will touch it to our nose as well. And similar things like that.  Are we just being paranoid? Are there any exercises we could do to help stimulate his development in communicating?  This is both of ours first kid so we are pretty inexperienced. "
329,How to deal with my 12 year old's rebellious behavior?,"My son just turned 12 a few months ago, and boy is he a handful!   He does not obey anything I say, curses at me, calls me names, throws tantrums, and hesitates to go to school every single day.   I have no clue what to do at this point. Is it boot camp? Or am I just giving up to easily? Any suggestions?  "
330,Should we indulge this unusual request from our daughter?,"I recently watched a movie with my husband and daughter entitled Cherish. It's about a woman who's been sentenced to house arrest for a crime she didn't commit. She has to wear an ankle monitor as a condition of her house arrest, which leaves her in a tricky situation, as she has to find a way to get out of her house in order to clear her name, which she eventually does, in case anyone's wondering.   My daughter was intrigued by the ankle monitor and decided to do some research. She went online and found that there are companies that deal in GPS devices that actually lease them to private citizens. A couple of them even promote them as a way of monitoring wayward teens.  She has asked her father and I to lease an ankle monitor for her to wear. I know how crazy this request sounds, so let me explain her reasons for wanting it. First, she's interested in a career in the justice system, possibly as a parole or probation officer, and is curious as to how accurate they truly are, how people react to those who wear them, etc. Second, she confessed to us that she ditched school several times last year without us ever knowing and was tardy on several other occasions. She says she really wants to be more focused on school this year and is afraid she'll give in to temptation and skip. She would like us to use the device's geo-fencing features so we'll receive alerts if she's ever late for school or tries to play hookie. That way, she'll have to be on time each day and won't be able to leave without us knowing.   We told her we'd need some time to think on this one. Maybe I'm crazy, but part of me wants to grant her request. I know it's weird that a teenager would actually request being put on a leash like this, but I understand and admire her reasons as well. She's said she'd be willing to wear the device for the remainder of the school year and possibly for her senior year as well. What do you all think? Is indulging this request a bad idea or should we go for it? "
331,At what point should we introduce water (or other liquids) to our infant's diet?,We've just started feeding our infant solids and there are lots of resources to figure what when and what to introduce but I haven't yet figured out when we should introduce water along with it. It seems like a waste to give him something that doesn't include calories or nutrients but he's also taking in a lot more solids at a time and the solids are a lot less liquidy than the breast milk he drinks most of the time.  Should I be giving him a glass of water now? How much?  
332,Securing books from toddler,"We have several bookcases filled with books in our apartment. Our little Tasmanian Devil is not even walking yet, but everytime we put her on the floor, she starts crawling towards a random bookcase and tries to pull out one of the books on the lowest shelf; on occasion she pulls herself up and tries to pull out a book from the second lowest shelf. This will only get worse once she starts walking. We are trying to find a solution for this. As a first step, we have put all of our non-essential books in boxes in a separate storage space. We've also put all the valuable books in the higher shelves, and packed the ones in the lower shelves as tight as they can go, so that they are not so easy to pull out. However, we are aware that this is only a short-term solution: as she gets bigger, she'll become strong enough to pull those books out and start chewing on them, or rip pages out, or go at them with a crayon.   Is there a way to keep her from pulling out our books until she's learned to handle them properly? A friend suggested installing doors on the bookcases, but that would be a last-resort solution (for one, we would have to have the doors custom-fitted to our bookcases, and at that point, we might as well go to Ikea and buy a brand new set of closed bookcases). I'm thinking more like a security gate that stretches the full width of the bookcase. Does this type of product exist, and if so, where can we purchase it from? "
333,How to prepare children for impending death of a parent?,"My mother is expected to die within coming days/weaks/months (final phase of cancer).  I have an 11 year old sister - how can I help her? What would be a good idea to suggest to my father and older sister to do in that situation?  My 11 year old sister knows about situation (she was told as illness progressed about general situation, including that mother will likely die in the near future), she also recently was in the hospital.  How to prepare children for impending death of a parent? is a similar question and I used it as a base, but it is about pre schooler, with death expected within years. "
334,Do parents get punishment too?,"Just because we are parents does not mean we are infallible. We are definitely capable of bad behavior and sometimes our children see or are affected by it. If we do something wrong that we would otherwise punish our children for, should we give some sort of notice to our children that we will receive some sort of punishment also? If so, who decides said punishment? If not, how do we teach our children from the mistake that we made and still be able to stand our ground if they do the same thing and need some form of a consequence.  Edited to add from comments:  It's a conversation that came up between my wife and me so I'd thought I'd post it here. For the sake of the question, let's assume there is no law breaking occurring. For an example of willfully naughty, what if a parent did something from spite and anger like ripped up a drawing the child made during the child's tantrum or said something hurtful. For a mistake, a parent promises to wash a pair of pants but forgot to or accidentally spilled a drink on the child.  [What do you do when your child is willfully naughty vs made a mistake?]  Willfully naughty usually equals loss of privileges like TV/games and most recently being sent to their room for a period of time. Made a mistake usually equals spot correction with a redo. Making mistakes is not a cause for punishment. "
335,Tips for school bus driver at private schools?,"How typical is it for parents to give an end-of-school-year tip or gift to the bus driver at a private school (for a kindergarden student, 5 days a week)?  If it is usual or frequent, cash or gift? And what is a resonable amount to give or spend? "
336,"How accurate are the ""Suggested Age Ranges"" of toys?","Most toys manufactured today include a suggested age range, supposedly identifying the ages of children who will (safely) appreciate the toy.  How accurate are these ranges?  How do the manufacturers determine the ranges?  I know part of the determination is due to obvious safety issues (e.g. small parts that could present choking hazards for toddlers and infants, movable parts that require more strength or manual dexterity than young fingers might manage, etc.), but how do they determine the upward bound?  Or the lower bound when safety issues aren't the only determining factor?  My son has enjoyed playing with a number of toys that were ""too old for him"" (toy trucks and cars that do not present choking hazards, for example), and there are a number that peg him squarely in the proper age range that seem ""too young for him"" (this ball popper, for example, lists a range of 9 months to 3 years, but my son started playing with it at 6 months and lost interest before 12 months; I can't imagine many 2-3 year olds finding it entertaining for more than a few minutes).  Is there a standard by which these age ranges are determined?  Is there a way to determine which age ranges are influenced by safety issues, rather than the manufacturer's best guess as to how old my son should be before he'd enjoy it? "
337,How to handle my 8-year-old sister's nightmares?,"I am not a parent myself, but I have been responsible for a big part in the rising of my sister. We have an age gap of 13 years, which creates a fun but complicated relationship between us. She knows that I am not her dad, and that I am her brother, but she listens when I tell her to do something and we are best friends.  Since a couple of weeks, I am less at home. I'm going back to school while having a full-time job. This causes me to only sleep at home for 2 nights every week. Since last week, my mom told me that she is having nightmares. As I am her best friend, she came to me last night, while silently crying, saying she had a nightmare about skeletons and mummies. I know this is absurd, but I also know that a kid's imagination is far more powerful than mine. That's why I tried to listen to what happened in her dream, I asked why she was afraid of them, and if there was anything I could do for her.  After she stopped crying, I said that she was getting cold (my window is open when I'm working late). I asked her if she wanted to go to bed again, and refilled her water bottle. I stayed with her until she fell asleep, and then went on to my room again to work some more.  My question is: did I handle this correctly? This is the first time she actually came to me in the night. I am not sure if there is more to the story than her just having a bad dream? "
338,Stop a 14 month old from hurting the dog,"I am the father to a 14 month old son, an only child, and he is pretty much how I would expect a toddler to be.  He has an unquenchable curiosity, a need for play, occasional cuddles, intense desires to perform strange focused tasks, and a spectacular display of dramatics when he is throwing a tantrum.  Lately I am wondering if this one behavior is normal and how to get him to stop.  He occasionally will just kind of wander around looking for something to do, and when he sees the dog he runs over and just starts to hurt him.  He will smack the dog, grab his droopy lips or long Bassett Hound ears and pull on them, sometimes he even tries to step on him when he is laying on the floor.  What makes this even more concerning is that he is enormous for his age so his size and strength don't match up with his emotional or mental maturity just yet.  He registers 99% percentile in height and 90% in weight according to the pediatrician.  My dog is thankfully incredibly easy-going and extremely patient through all of this.  He will sometimes squeal in pain but he never snaps or displays any aggressive behavior.  He is starting to become scared of the toddler however and it breaks my heart.  Of course when I see it happen I physically prevent him and try to give him a firm NO!  I don't think he mentally grasps the concept of NO just yet or if he does, he doesn't seem to have the impulse control to stop himself.  When I stop him and tell him No he more or less seems annoyed.  I have also tried positive reinforcement by teaching him how to pet and hug the dog.  He will pet nicely and then give a nice big hug and he responds well to praise. He seems pleased with himself when I praise him for being nice, but then I can see his body start shaking like he is about to do something he has no control over and then he starts getting hyper and violent with the dog again.  He is a sweet boy but I am wondering if this random violent hitting behavior is normal in 14 month old boys?  Is this a phase?  Is this a sign that he might grow up to be a violent person?  Also what techniques can I try to help teach him NO and to stop hurting the dog? "
339,Is using a potty described in this video for 1 month++ old baby safe?,"Is using a potty described in this video for 1 month++ old baby safe?  I'm referring to supporting the child on the potty as he poops. My wife is strongly against it as there is no support for the baby's back. but I find her way of pooping too messy.  She rest the baby on the changing table and induce him to poop by saying ""umm umm umm"".  The baby poop all over the place and need to periodically clean his poop for new poop to come out.

340,"How important is passing on our ""heritage"" to our child who is born and raised in a different country?","To avoid offending any country and going off topic, I'll call my native country ""N""(for native) and the current country ""C""(for current).  My husband and I were born and raised in N, but we've disliked living there since we were young adults. It had become more so in our mid 20s, with its ignorance, casual and criminal discriminations, the callousness of both the people and the government, and the absurdity of the very ""culture"" that we're supposed to be teaching our kids. (Yes I know every country has its problems, but we've travelled extensively and from what we've seen, the place that hurts our sensibilities the most is N)  We decided we will not have a child in the toxicity of N, and moved to C. We do look different from the majority of people in C, which may prompt the questions ""where are you from? where are you really from?"" Once our child is old enough to see that she looks different, she'll surely wonder where she's really from, and all about that place.  I don't know what approach we should take here. Personally, I'm unable to see anything positive in the current state (or the recent past) of N. If it were upto me, i'd drop every part of N from our lives. But I'm wondering if it's healthy for our child. Yes, there's a lot of history of N that is fascinating, but that's about it. We could tell her about N's history, but we could also tell her about the history of many countries and teach her to appreciate them all equally.   Should there be a special place for N in her life?  Is it essential to a child's development or sense of belonging to learn the culture and traditions of the place her parents happened to be born in?  I'd like to reiterate here : N's culture and traditions seem very arbitrary, authoritarian and absurd to us*. It's a big part of why we left.   *I'd be happy to give some examples if it'd help. "
341,Baby Bjorn and heat rashes,"Has anybody else had any trouble using the baby bjorn in regards to heat rashes? Both myself and my little one are appropriately dressed for the weather, but when I put him into the carrier facing me, he always gets red bumps on his belly. I'm not sure if dressing him less is the answer. For people with baby bjorns out there, do you dress your little one less in anticipation of body heat? "
342,"4s in winding down time, what is sitting?","This question goes to the people who have read the ""Baby whisperer"" where the author talks about the 4s of winding down. The 3rd S is ""sitting"". It's not clear what that means. ""Sit with him quietly for around five minutes with him in the vertical position."" what does that mean? Is that the same thing as picking him up and you are sitting a vertical position? Or is he sitting on the cot in a vertical position with him? Who is sitting? Is the baby sitting or is the parent sitting? "
343,My child witnessed a toddler being taught to cuss by older kids. How to deal with rude language at social gatherings?,"I took my 9 year old son to a little social gathering with some kids from different sporting activities. Some of the families attending this gathering come from a very ""rough"" background.  One of the boys about the age of my son was teaching his baby brother (around 3 years old) to say really rude words, like insults and cussing. The boys would then laugh and encourage him. I approached the toddler and tried to tell him he could learn better words, but he just replied with F... off.  The parents of the kids seem to not care about that situation, but I don't think it is a good example for my son.  How should I deal with rude cussing boys like that? Is the answer just to leave?  I don't want to show my son that the way to deal with rude people is just to ignore them and move away, but to learn a way to give him a higher thought reference. "
344,"As a father, how to improve my relationship with our 2-month-old baby?","My son is coming to 2 month+.  I have been doing the housework (pooping, bathing, wet cloth cleaning, feeding and etc, laundry).  I still fail at putting the baby to sleep after feeding and can't seems to improve my interaction with the baby.  My wife for some reason can sing him to sleep, I guess my voice sux and I feel she has better interaction with the baby.  She monopolize the child by having confinement at her place for first month and now I'm playing catching up.  May I know as a dad what can I do? is there a book to recommend me please?  Not very sure which tag to use. "
345,5 Year Old - Separation Anxiety and Preparing for a Death in the Family,"My 5 year old son recently started school and, his separation anxiety pre-dates school, but it has really highlighted to me just how bad it is. He gets upset when he gets dropped off at school, when his dad leaves for work, when family members visit and have to leave, when going to activities where we are in sight (e.g. gymnastics class where he could see s through the window). He starts with crying and saying he doesn't want to go to [insert place here], then he starts to breathe heavily and hugs you and then he starts to cling to the point where he physically has to be prised off, then when you've got him into school or his dad is going through the door etc it all starts again. I also have a 2 year old who copies everything he does so I am worried it will create an issue in her.   Thinking back, my husband and I feel like it started when his great grandmother passed away at the beginning of the year (we also lost our dog last year), at the time we explained it in very simple words - ""Granny Anne has died because she was very old and sick and we won't be able to see her anymore. It's okay to miss her and be sad."" We have also reassured him that we aren't going to die and just because someone gets sick does not mean they are going to die but he does still (9 months later) ask a lot of questions about death. He also talks - and sometimes cries - about our dog and his great grandmother which we encourage as we feel he is still processing it.  Unfortunately, we have just found out that his grandmother has been diagnosed with terminal cancer and its very aggressive so she could pass away fairly soon. We have not told him yet and while he has seen my husband and I upset, I don't believe his anxiety level has changed since we found out. I have contacted the school nurses and informed the school but they are taking a while to get back to me and as it is a time sensitive issue I decided to also seek advice elsewhere.   Mainly, how do we prepare him for the death of his grandma without making his separation anxiety worse? Should we take him and his 2 year old sister to visit their grandma when she is very sick? They last saw her nearly 2 weeks ago and she has rapidly declined. How should I broach the subject with my 2 year old?   Thank-you for reading through this very long explanation and for any advice you may give. "
346,My 2 year 8 month old son is not interested in hearing stories,"How to make child get interested in stories? He colors the book but by seeing somewhere. He just shows interest in only very limited food. He is suffering from constipation. He is able to say rhymes, alphabets, number, shapes... But is not able to answer simple questions. For example: Have you completed your lunch? What did you eat? What did you learn in your school? Just started his preschool from June 2018. Little worried why he is not able to understand what we are speaking and not answering to us. How can I improve him? He is completing 3 by December. "
347,Should I discourage my son from talking so much?,"My 5 year old son is very extroverted, and loves to talk to anyone and everyone.   Sometimes, this feels problematic.   For example, he engages waiters and waitresses in conversation, which frequently lean more towards lectures.  A waitress recently came by to clear an empty plate from our table.  He launched into a detailed explanation of everything he did this morning, right down to the details such as walking from his bedroom to the kitchen, pulling our his chair, etc..  Most people seem okay with this, and politely listen, but I feel awkward in these situations because they're working, and he's monopolizing their time.  Indeed, some people do show frustration, and even cut him off or walk away mid-sentence  (which hurts his feelings).  My wife and are both introverts, and talking to people too much is not something we have much experience with.   How do we handle these situations? How do we address the difference between chatting, and ""talking someone's ear off"", without discouraging him from being friendly? Can we do this now, or should we wait until he's older? "
348,"Do kids outgrow distractability? If not, what to do?","I write about a happy, bright 8 yo boy who enjoys reading and learning but sometimes has difficulty focusing on the task at hand.  In school, it can take him a long time to complete his work because he is easily distracted by friends and material objects, such as math manipulatives.  During class, he often moves around talking to others or humming to himself.  Once distracted, teachers find it difficult to redirected to join in the class activities.  Some similar distractibility is seen at home from time to time, but at other times he can concentrate for long periods of time (30+ minutes) reading or following detailed printed instructions to assemble Lego sets.  He greatly enjoys physical tasks and can stick with them (e.g., he can do pogo stick or stilts more than 500 jumps or steps).  His teachers are not happy with his lack of attention.  My question is, do kids out grow this?  (For example, what percent of kids show this type of distractability and what percent of adults?)  If distractable kids become distractable adults, is there a recommended method to help address the problem. "
349,How to help a 3 year old to speak?,"My child is 2 year 10 months. He is not speaking by his own. If I ask him ""What do you want apple or banana?"" he answers me: ""apple banana"". He is not able to understand me. Some kids call him: ""come let us play"" and he is not able to understand it. Is this normal?. But he is able to say rhymes, number, shapes, colors, etc. But he doesn't or rarely understand what I and others are speaking. If a person calls his name and says hello, he is telling his own name and hello. Is it normal? Can I have some tips to improve his language development? "
350,My 3 year old daughter sometimes out of control!,"My wife and I have 3 year old daughter Olivia. She is lovely and very sweet at normal times. She goes to daycare everyday and am happy in the daycare with her friends. However, here comes with her problem. Her personality seems very different from others in my opinion. She is very demanding. Sometimes she insisted something very consistently. If my wife and I don't satisfy her, she will cry and crash for very long time. We don't know how to distract her.  For example, this just happened this morning. She finished her breakfast in the morning and my wife wanted to take her to the daycare. She insisted that she wanted to play for another two minutes and then go. OK, my wife agreed. But after 2 minutes she asked for another 7 minutes. My wife knew her personality and again agreed. After 7 minutes she still requested more time and said she didn't want to go to daycare today again and again. Of course my wife can't convince her. When my wife was trying to force her to get dressed, she became out of control. She cried, fell on the ground, took off the pants and socks, and became like totally out of control. Eventually my wife used her strength and carried her to the car and sent her to the daycare. You can imagine the process was really out of control and my daughter cried with sharp scream. Finally when my daughter got to the daycare and saw her friends and teachers, she became a little calmed down. I would guess she will have a good day in daycare. But these types of stuff has happened several times a week and now becomes a routine for her life. I want to check your opinion. When she is happy and normal, she can be very lovely and adorable. But when she can't get what she wants and we can't distract her, things become out of control and drive us crazy. Is it common or a little bit uncommon to a 3 year old girl? Or I should make appoint with mental health care professional for help?  Thank you very much for your advice. "
351,Why does my toddler want to take her clothes off?,"Our 1 1/2 year old daughter keeps wanting us to take her clothes off. She'll keep wailing until someone does. She'll try to take them off herself. I'm worried that she'll just want to be naked all the time - even when we're outside or company is over.  Why does she want to be naked? Is this a behavior I should accept, encourage, or discourage? Is this something I should be worried about?  "
352,Is it ok to take a 2-month-old baby out on fresh air?,"Is it OK to take a two-month-old baby out in fresh air and cool weather (14 C, 57 F) if properly warmed by adequate clothing? How long can the baby be outside? "
353,What are some techniques to avoid wet pants in a 2.5-year-old?,Our 2.5-year-old son is often wetting his pants. He wears diapers during noon-sleep and night-sleep but none when awake. He knows how to call for the potty. Nearly never does the big thing in his pants but the small thing often passes through.  Shall we push forward and avoid diapers in bed too? Or let him wet for some time so he feels more the annoyance? (I suspect he likes us to change his pants) Or just wait for this issue to go away by itself? 
354,4 year old daughter starved for Dad's attention,"My 4 year old daugther always wants my attention, and I try my best to give it to her. Either by telling stories, playing with stuffed animals, reading books, or anything else she likes to do. I have heard of too many dads who neglect their daugthers and I don't want to be one of them.  But at the same time I think now that I have given her too much. Whenever I am at home (evenings and weekends), she always follows me around and says ""Daddy what can we do now?"". If I say that I want to be by myself and that she should play by herself for a while she often turns on the waterworks and goes crying to mommy.  What can I do? How can I wean her off my attention? Do I even need to? I want to be a good dad but I also want to have a life of my own.  Thanks. "
355,What to do if a breastfeeding toddler vomits?,"My daughter has thrown up a lot 2 days ago from 6pm-3am,     6am she was fed 9oz at once (not my choice), she threw all of it up. fed her less pedialite at a time, around 10am she threw up again, a lot, including yellowish stuff took her to doc, doc said it's stomach virus but should be ok soon she didnt eat anything for 3 hours, then we started giving her 1 tablespoon, then 2 tablespoons, then 1oz every 5-10 mins. She also had a few naps and was feeling better. to sleep easier she was breastfed at 5am today she threw up again.   She has tears and her lips are fine so she is hydrated well enough. She's not peeing much but has liquid diarrhea. Also temperature has been normal throughout.   Should we continue to breastfeed? Are we doing anything wrong?   I am a little scared since this is 2nd day and she threw up (first time since yesterday 10am). "
356,What to say to a child whose pet just died,"My 24-year-old daughter's cat just died.  I've never met her cat, and I am currently only in contact with her over Facebook. I also don't know her address so I can't send her anything.  It really has to just be something that I can message her.  She also hasn't seen her cat in a long time as she is always travelling for work in case that's relevant. Also I have no photos. I'll only accept written responses as an accepted answer.  I only found out her cat had died after sending her a message that I was holding my cat.  Daughter: ""my cat died, oh, please don't i'm sorry"" Me: ""I'm sorry"" Daughter: ""I can't, I don't, want"" Me: ""How are you? Are you ok? Your cat was lucky to have you"" Daughter: ""perhaps, let's just stop, thanks, i appreciate"" Me: ""ok sorry, I feel really sad now"" Daughter: ""stop"" Me: ""Yes ok""   As you can see her typing seems erratic, and she asked me to stop talking about it multiple times, but she is also clearly very upset and I want to console her. "
357,Preparing quality bedtime stories,"When I was a child I enjoyed my mom's bedtime stories so much, and even now I can still remember some of them. Now it's my turn to pass such a wonderful experience down to my daughter. However I am having a hard time looking for quality bedtime stories and every night I have to spend almost half of an hour googling.  How much time do you spend a day on bedtime stories? Can you recommend any place that I can find good materials? "
358,How to teach a pre-schooler to wear clothes?,"My nephew is 3 years old, and like most boys, loves to run around naked.  Sometimes we can't go somewhere we were planning to go because he refuses to get dressed again (although candy usually will do the trick).  How do parents usually deal with this? Or will he just grow out of it? "
359,At what age should I expect a child to turn to the direction of the sound?,My child is 1.5 months old.  I have noticed that if sometimes there is a sudden and quite loud bang then she does sometimes startle. BUT We also shake the rattler near her sides but she never reacts to the sound by turning her head towards it.   Is this normal? At what age should I expect a child to turn to the direction of the sound? 
360,Do newborns have dreams when they sleep?,"Have noticed the 1.5 month old smiling when asleep.  Do newborns have dreams when they sleep? If yes, then what kind? If no, then what could be the reason of their sleep smiles? "
361,Is my two year old gifted? what should we do about preschool?,"My son turned two in October. He's known all his letter since about fourteen-fifteen months. Also learned small numbers around then. He knew a bunch of sight words before he could speak. He used signs before then.   Now, at around 27 months he has started to sound out words. He can read a little bit, but most of his struggle is with telling where words end and begin. He can subtract one from any number under five, and add one or two to any number under ten. He can count by tens, and count up to 100 objects. He can count backwards from ten. He is obsessed with science. Particularly astronomy and physics. He listened to me read a hard fact book about Jupiter for a half hour today. He told me almost 100 times today that all 8 planets circle the sun, and that they are all very far away, very far distance.  He knows them all, even a few of Jupiter's moon's. Yesterday I told him a moon was a body that revolved around a planet, asteroid, or a dwarf planet, and he yelled, ""dwarf planets like Pluto, charon!""  He watches some dry lectures on space, and math and he freaks out while he watches them. Like he does flips and stands on his head and jumps around, like my friends two year old when she watches yo gabba gabba. He just can't hold still while he's learning, the kid is pure energy.   I try hard to get him to do stuff that isn't learning, like pretend play. He loves to make everything talk to each other, and tell stories. He pretty much talks non stop.   So going at this rate, what would preschool be like for him? I want him to go for the social skills it provides, but there are no play based preschools here. He doesn't see other kids much, but he does play well with others. Although he tends to get overexcited and can't contain himself. That usually leads to trouble without a break from the activity.   Should I keep him home for another year and just start him in kindergarten? Or try preschool? Do I tell them about him first? Has anyone had experienced with this? We are also considering homeschooling. Could he get enough from homeschooling?  I'm just doing whatever he asks typically now. He picked out the Jupiter book from the library. He rarely reads fiction anymore. "
362,Good shower gel and shampoo for children to use,"I've had a look not just on here, but Google too, and there's nothing in particular recommending any shower gel or shampoo for younger children. Can most children just use adult shower products? Or should they be using something different?  Our daughter is 5 years old, nearly 6, and we're now transitioning her from the bath to the shower. She's doing fine with it, but she's using Johnson's bedtime baby bath and baby shampoo, and we think it might be time for something a bit stronger. There doesn't seem to be anything for children past being babies, and we don't want to irritate her skin.   Does anyone have any good recommendations? Even if it's just 'use adult products' that would be helpful. "
363,What is the appropriate age for a kid to read and/or understand the books related to self confidence?,At what age does it help and is possible to be able to read and understand the books like The power of your subconcious mind and The magic of thinking big?  How should these kind of books be introduced such that the child starts believing and implementing what's written there? 
364,Possible problems in a family without a car,"So, I realize I am personally very early asking this question, but it is an interesting one that I know I will have to deal with in the future.  Neither me or my girlfriend can drive, and neither of us wants to. Therefore, we also don't (won't) own a car.  The car being, to a degree, a status marker of modern households - and the eventuality that children should choose for themselves whether to drive - makes me wonder whether this will have any social or educational impact on the child? I've heard of children being bullied and being called 'poor' for less, but is there any generic research to show the influence of the presence or absence of a car on the development of a child? "
365,Should we tell our children that we 'spy' on them? When should we stop 'spying' on them?,"We use a DIY motioning system (built with Raspberry Pi) to monitor our 2-year-old child while he plays in his own room, so we can have a dinner in the kitchen, study in the living room, and do other works with peace of mind.  We didn't directly tell him (yet) he is being monitored, but we sometimes make remote conversations (from other rooms) like: ""Bravo! You've made a nice rainbow tower, do it again!"" and ""Don't put this in your mouth"", and he responds nearly as if we were in the same room.  I guess he learns something about our ability to see what he is doing without us being physically existing in the same room or even being visible to him (e.g. on a screen). But ideally, in the future, we hope he learns not to do harmful or ""bad things"" without monitoring.   Questions:   What is the potential negative impact on toddlers/children behaviour and characters in later childhood if they know they are monitored by parents 'all the time' even when alone? Should children be explicitly told they are monitored by parents (""Look, we watch you through that camera""), or just let them discover that? At which age it becomes 'more harmful than useful' to monitor a child?  "
366,What to do when 18 month old doesn't want her dinner?,"It's becoming more frequent that my 18 month old daughter has started refusing the dinner we give her without trying it. Our best guess at why, is because it contains green things.   We always check the food and it is damn tasty, and she does like it if she tries it, but obviously explaining this to an 18 month old is difficult.  We know she is hungry, because in the past we have given her a replacement of something like toast and she'll gobble that down.  What is the best way to handle this? We don't want her to think that she can always swap her healthy dinner for toast, so the method we have currently been using is, if after 15 minutes she is still not eating, we'll get her down and say something like ""You haven't eaten your dinner, you must not be hungry"". If, later she decides she does want the food, we'll put here back on her chair and let her eat.  Is this a good way to handle it? Would there be a better method? We don't want her to grow up having ""food issues"" "
367,At what age can a child be responsible for deciding whether to wear warm clothes?,"My son is about to turn 2 and is getting to the stage where he has strong feelings over what he does and doesn't want to do.   One of the issues we have is with clothing. I'm happy to give him some limited choice about what he wears but sometimes he doesn't want to wear a sweater when I or his Dad feel he should or he doesn't want to wear a hat or gloves on a cold day. He understands that if he's cold, wearing warm clothes will make him feel better.  I'm keen to encourage him to learn from his own experience as much as possible but he's still very small and I'm not sure at what age he should be able to make some reasonable decisions about how much warm clothing he needs to wear.  I'm not going to do anything extreme like let him out in a T-shirt when it's freezing outside but for more minor situations, when should I start to let him take some responsibility for this kind of thing? For example, the other day, he didn't want to wear his gloves so I didn't force him to but then I felt his hands and they were cold. He knows that gloves would have made his hands warmer so I can only assume that he didn't mind having cold hands. Also, he often doesn't want to wear a sweater in the house on a cold morning. Should we be allowing him to make decisions on this kind of thing, within reason, or should we still be deciding what's best? "
368,When should a toddler stop having problems with personal pronouns?,"My son (35 months old) speaks fairly well, but is consistently confusing his personal pronouns.  Examples: ""Her is eating her food,"" ""me is going to my room"", etc..  Sometimes he gets them right, but it's about 50/50 at best.  I'm assuming this is normal, because it seems like this would be a harder concept to pick up than simple association of a single word with a concept (a duck is always a duck, but keeping track of whether it is her/him/he/she, based upon the context of usage, is more complex).  Is there anything I should (or should not) do to help him?  How long does it usually take for a toddler to master pronouns? "
369,How do we address other adults telling my son to ask us to bring him to their house?,"My sister-in-law has developed a habit both my wife and I find annoying: in order to try and get us to come to their house more often, she constantly pulls my son aside when they're leaving from a visit, and tells him to ""tell mommy and daddy to bring you to our house so you can see x"" (where x has been, variously, ""our Christmas lights"", ""my new car"", ""our new puppy"", etc.).  We both find this behavior manipulative, and it puts our son in the middle, since we then wind up having to tell him ""no"" more frequently than not.  As for why we say ""no""... well, the full details aren't relevant, but their apartment is small, there's little for him to do aside from sit there and watch their TV (which is always on), and we want my mother-in-law to get out of the house as much as possible, since she's essentially a shut-in ever since she broke her arm, and was told she can't drive.  My sister-in-law drives her over to our house for visits frequently, and we also meet them at local restaurants for dinner regularly.  In fact, we average seeing them at least once a week.  By contrast, we only see my own mother, who lives only 5 minutes further away by car, maybe once a month or so.  My son actually gets particularly excited to see my mother because, according to what he's said repeatedly, he doesn't get to see her very often (he's explicitly compared the frequency to his frequency of visits to my MIL, e.g. ""I get excited seeing Grandma and Grandpa, because I don't see them as often as I see Grandma and Aunt"").  My son, for reference, is 5.  How, if at all, should we handle this?  Should we say something to my SIL (who will, incidentally, burst into tears at virtually any criticism)?  Should we say something to my son?  Or should we just let it go? "
370,15 month old - developmental activities? Dealing with night terrors?,"My daughter is almost 15 months old. Are there things i could work on her with? Cleaning? Talking? Potty training? Anything else along these lines that I could start working on with her? And any suggestions on night terrors? She is up 3-6 times a night, not necessarily awake, just crying in her sleep.  "
371,Weight and Height for a 2 year old girl,My 2 year niece weighs 30kgs (66.13 lbs) and tall for her age (3 feet/91cm tall). Despite her weight she does not really eat much.. we we're advised that it's growth spurt. Is there a cause for concern? Is this normal? 
372,Delayed speech for 3 year old,"My 3 year old still doesn't speak in sentences. He can convey things in 1-2 words but cannot form sentences.   Even if he knows a simple sentence like ""I want water"" but he will never remember to say it and will always say ""mummy water"". If asked to say it completely then he will say ""I want water"".   Is this normal?   How can I encourage him to speak in sentences?   I read a lot of posts saying their kid is also not talking yet. But really want to know is did they start talking a little late and what did they do to help them start talking.  Please help and guide.  Thanks. "
373,How to encourage my 7 year old to move on from her preschool friend?,"My daughter, we'll call Beth, had a close friend, we'll call Alice, who was in the same daycare/preschool from ages 6 months through just before 5 years old. Alice lives in the next town over, so once they both finished preschool, they went to different schools in different districts for kindergarten.  Even though it's been two years, Beth still considers Alice her best friend. Beth has made new friends at her school but won't consider anyone else for the position of ""best friend"" (not that one and only one person has to be assigned that honorific).   Beth has seen Alice a few times per year since then: at Beth's birthday party, at Alice's birthday party (an invitation to which always seems to appear a day or two after Beth's party), and maybe a play date or two. Even when they were in the same school, Alice's parents were never very responsive about setting up playdates.  How can I help my daughter move on from this relationship? Should I? Specifically, should we continue to set up the few visits per year we've managed? Or should we stop setting them up - Out of sight, out of mind?  I've found some advice on the internet about helping a child after their friend moved away. But in this case, Alice didn't move away, she just went to a different school. So it seems to me that the ""intermittent feedback"" of seeing Alice a few times a year is just reinforcing the relationship Beth may have forgotten about or moved on from otherwise. As far as I know Alice has moved on, but I don't have any confirmation or denial of that from Alice's parents. "
374,How to stop grandparents from acting overprotective?,"I have been living with my wife's family for a while both before and after the birth of my kid, and my mother-in-law feels like she is right about everything.  My wife is also a way of nagging what she thinks is right and I think it's very annoying when you they keep proving you wrong. Her grandma just pops in room in middle of night or early morning if baby start crying, which again in my opinion is very foolish and invading privacy.   Same issue is with her brothers too, they just keep on talking like my wife isn't taking care of the baby. Is the environment toxic or do they want to own the baby's life?  I feel I don't have control of being the baby's dad and I am losing control. Hence the question, how to stop grandparents from being overprotective? "
375,What harm is porn?,"It is generally accepted that porn shouldn't be seen by children, and we even sometimes punish parents who fail to stop their children from finding porn.  What is the justification? The only ""damage"" I've seen caused by porn is other adults' outrage. Like, the child gets suspended from school because a teacher found lewd pictures on his Nintendo DS or something.  Is it okay to let a kid view porn provided you warn him not to share knowledge of it with other people? Why?  Note that I also posted this question on cogsci.se. "
376,Reducing TV time for toddler?,"There are similar Questions around Like this and this  But they dont entirely help me.. I'm pursuing Post graduation and my exams are around. My little one is a three year old restless girl who shows little/no interest in any activity except tv and running around.  Its monsoon here in India, so outdoor activities are a total no-no.  Pity we have no neighbour kids to keep her company, and she is the only child at home. (I live with my parents so as to complete my PG and her dad is away!)  That leaves plenty of time in front of the tv.   I have bought her plenty of books, she dos not like more than 1 story read to her. She shows little interest in colouring. her favorite toy is the ""kitchen set""(not more than 15 minutes)and her favorite activies are the physical ones, running-jumping-somersaulting-climbing windows/furniture and whatever she can think of! She can go on for hours like that!!  Her only playmate is me and I barely have time after coming from college (and with a mountain of books to study).  She wants me to join her in anything that she does, (I know that's her age and the physical activities she is interested in, tires me out compeletely), and is tugging at my skirt the moment i come home till she goes to sleep. so in order to buy some time i would send her to watch tv n she's slowly getting addicted(feeling guilty all over).  She watches around four hours of tv currently(i am a bad mom, sigh !). My momma (looks after her while I'm gone) is all softy-softy with her, catering to all my daughters whims, letting her watch tv when she is busy in the kitchen(and we have no household help).  My question is how can i get her to play alone(I'm bad momma???) and reduce tv/computer time? (at least till my term exams are over ie in 3 weeks). Help !!  "
377,My 11-month-old child is shaking arms and legs when excited. Should I be worried?,"I kind of feel like this is ""normal"" but I am also worried that while I am in awww over her preciousness and loving her cute little moments that I may actually be watching her having some kind of neurological problem.  I have asked the doctor and they said she is ""fine"" but my experience with doctors tells me that they don't always know everything.  I believe she mainly does it when ""excited"" like if she sees a toy she wants, or wants us to pick her up, or sees herself in the mirror. Her arms and legs begin to tremor as if she has so much excitement built up and doesn't know how to exert it.  Could this be a sign of baby anxiety or some kind of neurological issue? Does your baby do this? How old? How long? Did you get it checked out? What did they say?  I love my little baby sooooooooooo much and I just want to make sure she is as her best. "
378,Is watching a moving fan equally harmful to an infant's mental development as is a TV?,"From: [website]  The recommendation against watching TV is not, as I understand it, because it shortens the attention span, but because it overloads the mind. A small child is not mentally capable of processing so much visual input and will be overwhelmed.    We have ceiling fans in all our rooms. Our 2 months old baby keeps on staring at the fan when lying on her back.  Considering the above quote is watching a moving fan equally harmful to an infant's mental development as is a TV?  If yes, what could be the preventive measures? "
379,Is the mother a better primary caregiver than the father?,"The traditional parenting approach has been to identify the mother as the primary caregiver for kids, giving the father a more authoritative and rolemodeling status. This is also supported by scholarly evidence (eg Unemura et al, Do toddlers prefer the primary caregiver or the parent with whom they feel more secure? The role of toddler emotion).  While in united families this emphasis on the mother is less formal, after divorce there is an explicit identification of who is the primary caregiver (even if there are cases of joint custody).  My question is simply: is there any evidence that the mother is better as primary caregiver after the kids have finished the nursing phase? "
380,Long-term preparations for becoming a parent?,"I don’t have any immediate plans for a child. At the earliest (probably), I’ll become father in 3 years.   I can imagine that the time will become stressful as soon as the child is on the way, not to mention the time when the child is finally born. I guess there are so many things to consider/decide/plan that you’ll hardly have enough time for all that.  I like to be prepared. Is there anything useful I could do now? Parents, in retrospective, is there anything you would have liked to do (or learn, or think about, …) beforehand?  So far I read about picture-books and add good/valuable ones to a list. Not sure how useful this is, but anyway, there has to be more. "
381,How to single handedly bathe a newborn?,Age: 1.5 months. The newborn can't be seated on her back for sure.   Is there any special kind of vessel available for seating and bathing newborns? How do you bathe a newborn in a stressfree way when you don't have anyone to help you?  
382,The toddler is being frightened of ghosts at daycare. How should I deal with the child before the fear sets in completely?,"I can't make out who said this to her at daycare, and it doesn't matter since I don't have any control over the daycare people.  Toddler is 2.6 years old.  3 days back the toddler told me that there is a ""ghost"" behind you. Other room was dark, and she said, ""there is a ghost in that room too because it is dark"".  I took the child to the dark room, took the lead and explored every point of that room to show her that there isn't any ghost.  She agreed to me that day, but yesterday again she started mentioning that the ghost is in the dark room. Again, I took the child to the dark room, took the lead and explored every point of that room to show her that there isn't any ghost.  Still she kept on repeating the same.  I am not worried about the fear of dark. She had that fear before too. I am worried about the ghost part.  The fear hasn't yet set in. This is the time to act. It has been just 3 days. How should I deal with the child before the fear sets in completely?  P.S. I think the answers of How do I help a child overcome fear of ghosts? do not apply here since it has been just 3 days that she was told about ghosts at daycare. The fear hasn't ""set in"" completely yet, I think. "
383,My 13 yo son has drug and alcohol issues. What should I do?,"My 13 year old son has been smoking and selling weed for at least a year now, drinks whenever he can get any alcohol, and has been black-out drunk. He also smokes cigarettes and vapes. (He's also done acid once.)   This is just what I know; he's most likely done much more than I don't know about.   He has shown signs of memory loss, is becoming increasingly forgetful, and is often very hostile and angry at home. I'm at my wit's end; I don't know what to do.   Any advice? Should I send him to a rehab of some sort?  "
384,Helping a child who's still developing language skills to understand she's being given a chance to make a decision,"I'm asking about interacting with my 1.5 year old goddaughter.  I'll start off by saying I believe it's good for kids to make decisions and feel empowered to do so when possible.  I want to give a kid as much decision making power as I can on small stuff so she knows she can express herself, even if some decisions she's not allowed to make on her own.  She's already independent and self-confident, but it's a trait I want to further encourage.  As such I do what I do with slightly older children, and try to offer decisions often.  For example while babysitting her last night in a mall I would offer her the choice of where she wanted to go in the mall by suggesting she could point where she wanted to go (she loves riding on my shoulders so she can't always just walk that way on her own).  I also gave her choices like to play or go eat.  I try to phrase them in ways shes capable of understands and make it clear how she can express her answer (like saying one option is eat because that's one of the words she can say and uses to express hunger so I know she will know how to express that choice, or suggesting she points since she does that all the time to express desires).  Sometimes I get very clear answers and that's great when it happens!  Other times I don't get a clear answer from her.  That's not always wrong, she may not be up to parsing some of the questions I'm asking yet and sometimes she may not have a strong opinion either way.  However, even when I think she is capable of understanding the question and likely would want to make a choice she doesn't always respond.    I think part of my problem is that I try to talk to her always when were together, to help her develop her language skills and generally allow more interaction with her, especially when were doing something otherwise 'boring' like walking places.  With me talking soo much to her though I don't know how much she is listening to me, and I suspect sometimes she just drones my words out.  When I try to ask her a question I'm not always certain if she has heard and bothered to understand the question, or if she stopped listening to my constant talking to pay attention to something else.  That's particularly hard to tell when she's riding on my shoulders as she is prone to do since I can't tell where she is looking or if she is paying attention.  Any tips on how I can better express decisions to her?.  That could be ways to make it obvious that she's being asked a questions and may want to pay more attention, or ways to make it easier for her to understand her options and/or help her to understand how to communicate her preferences back to me?    I also sometimes feel a little odd deciding what to do when I don't get an understandable response from her when the options are just complex enough to challenge her cognitive understanding.  I know there is a good chance she may not understand me, but there is also the chance she did but didn't know how to express her decision (not every question can be answered by pointing).  If she did have a preference she couldn't express and then I pick the opposite decision because I couldn't understand her choice I know it would be frustrating for her, she imagine her sitting on my shoulders wondering why I bother to ask a question if I'm just going to ignoring her.  I don't think there is much of a way to avoid that happening on occasion, that's just part of the frustration any kid has during that period of language development where they can understand but not always respond back, but I wonder if there is a good way of explaining ""were doing x because I couldn't understand your answer"" that still makes it clear she has the right to make a decision if she expresses it and I'm not intentionally ignoring her answer?  edit:  An update from a year later.  My goddaughter ended up needing tubes in her ear due to fluid buildup and ear infections.  The fluid build up was muffling sound making her somewhat hard of hearing,  After her surgery her vocabulary improved rapidly, as did her ability/willingness to discuss things with me and respond to my comments to her.  So it's likely the extra difficulty I had with getting her to express herself, relative to other kids her age, is that she honestly couldn't hear me, or at least was hearing my voice muffled enough to make it hard for her to understand.

385,9 Month old vomiting for the first time when waking up in morning then acts normal,"I have a 9 month old who woke up at 4:30 AM, hiccuped, then vomited.  The vomit was breastmilk white, with some remnants of solids from dinner the previous evening.  She is breastfed with the introduction of solids with each meal.  She did not have anything new to eat the evening before.  As is typical for her, she woke around 2:30 AM for a breastmilk feeding.  The weird part is that there seems to be nothing strange or different about her aside from that episode of vomiting.  She has never vomited or even spit up in her life up till now.  Temperature feels normal, and she is acting her normal happy self, and was her normal happy self before bedtime the night before.  To the question: What could be the causes of vomiting in an otherwise normally acting pre-toddler? Is there anything to look out for that may help to determine if she is coming down with something?  I'm not very concerned at all - just curious. "
386,Is our toddler ready for potty training - potty training regression,"Our daughter became potty trained almost two months ago. She was pretty good with very few accidents (maybe one every week or two). Two weeks ago she had some massive regression. She wets her pants now more times then not, probably about 85% of the time. She will now only go to the potty when we coax her to with candy as a reward. She will not go with candy as a reward of her own incentive, only with coaxing. When we ask her why she keeps doing this, she says she's having to much fun to go to the potty.  Is she ready? Anyone have similar experiences? What solutions are there to encourage her to go on her own? "
387,How to motivate my extremely lazy 12-year-old?,"My 12-year-old son is a good kid, but he is extremely unmotivated to do literally anything unless I or his mother are constantly riding him the whole time.  As a young child, he was ""easy"" to raise because he could always entertain himself.  There was no fussing on long car rides, no running around grocery stores uncontrollably, and very little rambunctiousness or getting into trouble when he got bored.  He was always a pretty compliant child and has always been an introvert more or less.  The problem with that though, is that when discipline was necessary, time-outs and loss of privileges were never really an effective tool, because he'd just sit there in the corner perfectly content with getting lost in his own imagination.  Motivating him has always been a problem, but things have just gotten out of hand in the past year (I know, welcome to the teenage years, right?)  Here are some examples of his behavior:   He takes a very long time to complete even simple chores.  30 minutes to clean the cat box, 45 minutes to empty the dishwasher, 1 or 2 hours to clean his room, etc.  He seems to examine every little thing before putting it away, or in the case of the cat box, he sits there stirring the sand around like it's some kind of zen garden.  When getting dressed, he moves move like a sloth, sometimes sitting on the edge of his bed with one sock on, looking around aimlessly like ""where's my other sock?"" He uses often ridiculous excuses when we call him out on taking so long to do things.  When getting dressed, for example, he'll say he can't find his pants or something (which are in his drawer where they always are), or when doing homework, he will say his pencil ran out of lead (he knows where the extra leads are).  He will also pretend to not know how to do things he clearly knows how to do.  With the dishwasher, he will pile half of it on the counter and claim he doesn't know where they go.  Or that he forgot how to do simple multiplication when doing one of the steps to his math problems. He puts more energy into stalling than it would take to just do whatever he's supposed to do.  This last winter we had an unusually heavy snowfall and I needed his help shoveling the driveway.  I told him that if he kept moving his body he wouldn't be cold, and the two of us could get it done quickly.  But after a few minutes he decided that shoveling snow was hard so he just stopped.  I said he wasn't allowed to go inside until the driveway was clear.  I got tired of barking at him to move, so he just stood there shivering his butt off in the frigid cold for an hour while I did it.  Earlier this month while the whole family was outside doing yard work, he spent the whole time pulling on a sapling that had taken root by the foundation of the house. I told him there was no way he'd get it out with his bare hands, but he clearly preferred working up a sweat on that one stupid tree than the easy job of pulling weeds in the back yard (which is the job his mother asked him to do). He has started lying about things.  This is entirely new behavior in the last year.  He never used to lie about stuff.  Now he lies all the time.  Lies about his chores.  Lies about having done his school work.  When it comes time to do school work, he'll say he has to poop and then he'll lock himself in the bathroom for an hour.  We've had to confiscate his phone a few times because he will lie about being on it when he's not supposed to.  He got an F on a book report because he lied about reading it and just wrote a nonsense essay about the picture on the cover.  He even lies about stuff that there's no reason to lie about.  Like what video game he was playing during his screen time.  There's nothing inappropriate to play, and it was his time to do with whatever he wanted, so why lie about it?   What I have done to try and correct this:  We found a neat little free app called Chore Monster for his phone.  We load it up with chores he's supposed to do and assign a point value to them.  When he completes a chore, he marks it done on his phone and then we get an alert on the parent app so we (usually his mom) can verify and award the points.  You can set up prizes in the app that he can win by accumulating enough points.  We set up a point system for almost everything he's expected to do; brushing his teeth, doing his school work, showering, and (obviously) chores.  For a while this worked great.  He won a couple of things he really wanted and was even asking for extra things to do so he could get more points!  That only lasted for a few months until he started half-@$$ing things.  Like he would just run the water for a couple minutes without actually brushing his teeth.  For the cat box, he'd just scoop out the obvious turds and then pour a bit of fresh litter over the top so it looked clean.  When we stopped approving those chores, he just kind of gave up.  Now when he does actually complete a chore we have to remind him to log it so he can get the points.  He barely cares anymore.  What do I do to motivate him?  This is only going to get worse as he gets older.  My wife and I feel horrible because we're basically yelling at him all the time now.  I think the lying is a result of him getting into trouble so much.  He just will not do anything at all unless we're cracking the whip so to speak.  So far he hasn't gotten into back-talking yet, but I fear that will come soon enough.  Later this year there is a big retro video game convention in a city about 4 hours from here that he wants to go to.  I'm going to make it a weekend just for us.  I decided not to carrot-and-stick this one because I think he needs some man-to-man time with his dad and I'm hoping he'll open up a bit on the trip.  But I worry because he has started to display a lack of interest even in that and it's still 4 months away. "
388,Should I start teaching my 2.4-year-old mathematics?,"My son is 29 months old. He has shown me that he has good memory, so far he knows all the shapes, all the letters A-Z (he can pin point and name them), can solve a 8-9 puzzle (car, farm etc.).   And I'm running out of ideas on what to do with him. He has so far perfected this and I was thinking of starting math but am wondering is it too early? And would this make him lose interest later? "
389,Is my child's cooperativity a trait or a choice?,"My wife and I are about to have a child. We wanted to know, through experience or studies, if we can influence how cooperative our child can be. She believes that it is something he can learn through playing with others, while I believe it something that is passed on based on my stubbornness. Anything can help, so the overall questions are (if they are within scope):   Is this a nature vs. nurture argument (nature loads the gun, nurture pulls the the trigger). Is there a way to change my child's cooperativeness?  Different way of saying it: Is it a trait or choice?    Thank you! :)  "
390,3 year old won't get out of bed without assistance?,"I seem to have the opposite problem to what everyone else has.  My kid sleeps well. He stays in bed well.. too well. In the morning he can hear activity and everyone talking yet he will not get out of bed himself until he hears his name called. Instead he will stay rooted to his bed and moan. If he needs the toilet he will start shouting ""I need a wee"" yet will not get up without being called.  We keep reassuring him that it is fine to get out of bed. I understand why he may not want to get out bed if it is dark or quiet but in the mornings when there is light and activity it would be nice for him to be a bit emboldened and come and say hello.  Note: when we call him he gets out of bed, opens the door himself and comes and find us. Why doesn't he do it without the call?  Has anyone come across this? Any ideas? "
391,"How to handle separation from former classmates at the start of a new term, when your child was the only one in a different class?","My 6 year old just started first grade, but to our surprise he was assigned to a different class from his former (from last year) classmates.   The ones that did not transfer schools at least, but he is all alone (aka knows no one yet) in the new classroom, while all of his friends are in the next room.  I am negotiating with the school to switch him into the other class, but the chances are slim.  In the scenario where the school do not switch him, what steps can I take to handle this split?  What are the pros and cons of being split from former classmates, and what can be done to maximize the first and minimize the second? "
392,3 year old gets bullied all the time,"My 3 year old daughter is a very shy and laid back girl. She loves playing by herself and will not really care if she has got someone to play with her or not. I usually look around for playdates for her since she's an only child and I want her to get used to playing with other kids. My problem is that because of her passive personality, she does not try to defend herself at all when some other child hits her or takes her toys. She will simply ask me to step in or cry if they hurt her. I usually step in and figure out a way but I am afraid she will always depend on me to solve such issues and I cannot be around all the time.   Recently we went to a party and she was playing in the other room with all the kids. There was another 3-year-old who was continuously hitting her for no reason at all. My daughter simply cried and did not do anything at all although the other girl was half her size. After that, my daughter refused to play with anyone at all and spent the entire evening on my lap.  I have never felt so helpless and heartbroken as I did on that day. How do I help her? The bully's mother and I are in the same social group which meets once a month. Should I avoid taking my daughter along, or continue so that she gets used to such situations? Please help.    BTW I just found out that that girl's elder brother, who is 6 years old, is also a big bully. I have tried to communicate with their mother but the woman could be least interested. She says that kids will be kids and they have to learn these things on their own and if adults get involved in such ""minor"" things, it's just silly. Wonder how she would feel if her kids were at the receiving end? "
393,Why do humans require assistance in childbirth so frequently?,"I have always found this fascinating. We are the most intelligent beings on the earth. Still, a rat can give birth to its offspring all by itself, but why is that not happening with humans? Is it just for psychological reasons? Or have humans become weak? If there is a young girl who doesn't know anything about giving birth, what are the chances that the baby and the mom will make it?  "
394,How to foster t-ball enthusiasm in a five year old,"Background facts:  My son is almost five. This is his first season playing t-ball. I am an assistant coach on the team, first time too. I'm not really athletic, but am a baseball fan. I know all of the rules and basic techniques, at least to teach t-ball. I'm a middle school teacher, but feel comfortable handling five year olds. Sometimes we practice/play at home with wiffle balls. He has fun.    At actual t-ball games:  Doesn't try to hit the ball very hard. Just goes through the motions. Has a dopey smile on his face while doing so. Doesn't really focus on anything going on around him. Fools around when playing field. (to be fair, most kids do too) His level of effort/care/concern is usually the worst out of both teams. Whenever the ball is hit to him, he shows no hustle.  His thoughts, as best as I can relate to a five year old:  He has fun being on a team. He loves wearing a uniform and playing with the fancy baseball equipment. He has fun with his team in the dugout when someone else is hitting. He like running the bases.  My concerns:  He might be enjoying the extra attention for not trying hard when hitting. Obviously everyone wants their kids to do well. It's fine if he isn't that good, but for me, I get upset when he doesn't even try. I worry when I get too mad he won't have fun and it will ruin it for him. I worry if I don't do anything about it he will continue to embarrass himself, for both of our sakes.    I understand the bottom line is for him to have fun, and enjoy the physical and social benefits of playing a team sport. I want him to try his best. I want him to want to try his best. I want him to experience all of the benefits of working hard at something. How do I help motivate him?  Thoughts?  "
395,My 6-month-old falls asleep late and wakes up several times. How to make him sleep through the night?,"My 6-month-old son will take 2 naps a day, but when it comes to be around 10 or 11 o'clock he is wide awake. He usually doesn't go to sleep until 2 in the morning and wakes up 3 to 4 times a night. I have tried the cereal in the bottle and all of the suggestions people have told me to. Can I please get some help? Is there anything I can do?  "
396,When and how to teach a 2 year old how to walk properly,"I have a 2 year old daughter who doesn't walk quietly or softly. She stomps. I can't tell whether she likes the noise she makes on our wood floor or she doesn't know any better. Her walking/running looks the same outside though.  I/we have been making attempts at educating her for weeks.   telling her to move silently, pointing out how much more silent her mom can enter the room,  taking her by her hands and walk with her around the room while encouragin her to avoid noice making walking slowly and siliently some sort of ""fun"" game making funny faces while tiptoeing around ... about everything we can think of that is fun/good/better/preferable when moving silently.   While she does seem to enjoy herself a lot, it has absolutely not affected her stomping. She is only 2 and definetly still discovering her body and the degrees of freedom it posesses, so I don't want to push hard. She has enough to learn and discover already. I'd just like for her to shift her priorities a little ...  So my actual questions are: How long does it take children learn to walk ""normal""? Can I expect her to stop stomping soon, within the coming year, shortly after kindergarden, right before puberty? When and how can I actually start teaching her? I have absolutely no clue what is ok, expected or considered normal progress for learning how to walk. Other children look about the same when they move, but they move much more silently. "

398,Our baby is a climber. How to deal with it?,"Me and my wife have a one year old baby.  We have a staircase with a fence - something like this [website]One day, while I was holding our baby, the baby got curious about the fence, so I got him closer and he grabbed the fence with both his hands. I gently tried to pull the baby away from the fence, but he wouldn't let it go. He was firmly holding onto it and smiling. He wouldn't let go. So I gently let the baby's body closer to the fence, to ease the force of me pulling on the baby, and again tried to gently pull the baby away from the fence, but he wouldn't let go and was smiling even more.  I didn't want to pull on the baby to make him let go of the fence, so I moved the baby's body closer to the fence, and gradually bent my knees so that the baby was holding like 50 % of his own body weight. After 5-7 seconds the baby let go of the fence. All the time the baby was smiling and was very entertained.  I'm pretty sure that if I completely bent my knees, the baby could easily hold his entire weight.  I'm a sports climber and I know that if I can't hold onto something, I just let go and nothing bad would happen to my hands, wrists, arms. What if a one year old baby wants to hold himself onto something? Can this cause any injuries to his fragile hands or wrists? "
399,Potty training my 22-month-old son,"We are currently on day 3 of potty training, my son who is 22 months old is showing all the signs, our accidents seem to happen when playing, he only let's out a small amount and the does the rest on the potty! (Rain drop)   Should we continue? Or shelve it for a few weeks? "
400,My wife wants a homosexual child,"We are planning to have our first child in about a year. My wife is very much into raising them genderless (or ""post-gender"" style) while my take on it is that we should raise them in a non-stereotypical manner, keeping an open mind for all there is. I even have problems defining how raising a child ""genderless"" should look.  However, my wife has many homosexual friends (men and women alike) and really wants at least one of our kids to also be homosexual, which is the real issue.  We live in a modern city and I really don't have any problems with our kids becoming homosexual, but not on purpose! I mean, if we somehow force it, it could go horribly wrong (effects on psyche etc.).  How can I deal with this situation? Is my wife overreacting or am I wrong here? How can I approach that topic with my wife?  It seems to me that this is some kind of extreme take on raising a child genderless (by essentially willingly flipping its sexuality around)... "
401,Feeding my baby milk that I stored from when he was 3 days old and on,"I am strictly breastfeeding and have been pumping and storing milk since my baby was 3 days old. When he turns a month old, I want to introduce bottles with breastmilk so anyone else can feed him if I am not home. Is it okay to give him the milk from those first days of pumping? I understand those first couple of bags are mainly the colostrum. Does this matter once he's a month old, or is milk milk? "
402,What can I do to help an 8.5 month old become more outgoing,"When she's at home with family members, she's fine and happy - crawls on the mat , plays with toys, smiles, etc. When we take her to a Gymboree class, where kids are free to climb and play with all the ramps/mat/stairs/toys, she just watches and won't play. She cried the first time we took her there, but now she's no longer crying. Yet while all 20 other kids her age are climbing/clapping/playing happily, she just sits there and watches. When we try to put her belly down on a matt to get her to crawl (which she does happily at home), she would moan nervously and resist. She's literally the quietest and most nervous kid out there, even compared to many who are younger than she is.  Is she just extra sensitive and shy in nature? What can we do to help her be come outgoing? "
403,"Are ""pull-ups"" worthwhile?","My son will be 3 shortly.  We've introduced him to the potty, and he happily sits on it (he even has a ""sittin' on the potty"" song he sings)... with his pants on.  On occasion, he will sit on the potty sans pants and diaper, especially at daycare, and one time his daycare provider even got him to pee in the toilet.  We recently started wondering if we should transition him to ""pull-ups"" to facilitate potty training.  However, they're pretty expensive, and I don't want to make the transition if it won't make a positive impact.  Are they worthwhile?  Is there a ""right"" time to make the transition? "
404,How much crying is OK for a newborn child?,"My child is just a week old and I've noticed that he is crying all the time when he is awake and we are not holding him.  If we hold him he usually calms down but the longer we don't hold him the harder it is to calm him down. He also behaves rather nervously and seems to have some kind of anxiety. When he is crying he usually scrambles to put his fingers in his mouth but sometimes the only thing which calms him down is breastfeeding.  If I put him down while he is awake he immediately resumes crying. If he falls asleep and we put him down he either stays asleep or wakes up and starts crying.  Is this kind of behavior normal, or is he having colic or some other ailment? What worries me is that there are only 20-30 mins a day when he is awake and calm while not being subject to breastfeeding, holding, or some other kind of interaction. Should I take him to a medical professional? "
405,"Wife agrees with parenting, but is intentionally less strict","The situation is this: My wife and I are married and happy together, with one single child, who is still pretty young (5).  It is a little boy, but the question would work regardless of gender.  We both usually agree on parenting topics, for example what punishment or suspension of privilege is right for specific situations, and what reward or added privilege is right for specific good deeds.  The thing is, I am always the one dealing with the negative stuff. I take away a toy for an hour, deal with time-outs, etc. While we both take equal parts in giving rewards, there is a serious unbalance in who deals with punishments.  My wife's reasoning goes like this: Yes, discipline is very important, but since you'll do it anyway, then I won't risk being the one he gets angry at.  No matter how I try to convince her, it just makes sense to her that if she can avoid looking like the bad guy and the discipline still takes place, then why not do it?  Now if I were to completely stop doing discipline, that means there would be a unknown duration of time during which nobody would be disciplining, and I feel like this would be a problem if our kid was to figure it out during this time, and start misbehaving because he can.  I don't want to play a good cop/bad cop routine with my wife for years. I'm actually scared that, even if my wife agrees with the punishment, if she never gives them herself, the kid will think she disagrees with them and actually start talking more to his mother about problems and life in general by thinking I'm the bad guy or something. Maybe out of some sort of spite.  What should I do to balance things out? If things go on for much longer, will things turn out like I fear, or am I just paranoid? "
406,How to cope with my guilt about the way I punished my child?,"My 9-year-old child is afraid of swimming, although he is good at parts of it. In just 6-7 days, he is now able to float and can swim a half of the length of the pool. But he doesn't go into the pool to do these things willingly.   I got angry one day, and punished him in a way I now feel terrible for. I told him I was leaving for home and he could come home alone. I left him behind. He walked for about 8-10 min thinking he was alone, not knowing I was following him. The road was not lonely, it was a busy road and he knew the path home, but home was far away from the swimming pool.   I am still feeling very guilty about how I could have been so rude to him. I asked him later, ""Were you afraid of being alone?"" He said ""Yes, I was afraid.""   Apparently he had called out for me 2-3 times after I left the pool, but I couldn't hear that, and then when he thought I went home, he started walking towards home.   I feel very guilty about what I've done. He is such a good kid. I spoke with him about this, and he said, ""Mom, forget that. That is past.""   I know that is past and now I can't change it, but how can I deal with my guilt I still feel over this terrible behavior? "
407,1yo cries almost non-stop when her mother is present - driving my wife to a breakdown,"We have a fairly high energy toddler and a 3yo son. Our daughter is usually friendly and high-energy, but could rarely self-entertain. We've slowly gotten to a place where she will fuss or cry 80% of the time when her mother is caring for her. When others care for her, she is much calmer. However, if her mom is even present, the fussiness factor goes way up.  The lead up: For the past several months she would often fuss until one of us picked her up. My wife would cater to her more than I would. I'd say I'd carry her around for 20 minutes out of an hour and my wife would carry our daughter 40 minutes in an hour. Her fussiness slowly grew until it got to this ""crisis"" point over the past two weeks.  My biggest concerns: It is really starting to affect our son. Whenever my wife watches both kids, our daughter gobbles up all the attention with her fussing/crying. My wife is also extremely stressed out and calls me crying from the stress. Our son is not getting the attention he needs.  Solutions? I keep coaching my wife to try to start weaning our child from carrying and let her cry a bit. (Update: Don't do the following) I believe we just need to teach her that crying is not the way to get the attention she wants. Unfortunately, when my wife starts to try this our daughter just cries her head off and clings to our feet. I think we just need to let her cry in an isolated place, but return to keep reassuring her. Or something like that.... ???     I'm very eager for other ideas or validation that this might be a good approach. "
408,How should I act during conflict between my child and my spouse if I dispraise the child's behaviour?,"We have a lot of conflicts with our son (now 7 years old, but this was not different the years before). One common situation is: there is a conflict between him and my wife (and I'm not involved or only partially involved), e. g.    he behaved very unfriendly / short-temperedly he insulted or yelled at one of us he hit one of us   This is especially problematic if the second parent is present or near, as he knows if he is in conflict with one of us there is still the second parent to go to. This also happens very easily if grandparents are present, as he knows that they are usually more patient and less consequent with his ""bad"" behavior. He then tries to play someone off against the other, and with the grandparents that works quite well often and then leads to a conflict between them and us parents.  Such situations are difficult and I wonder how to handle them properly.  Example:  Our son was in a very bad mood. We assumed that he might be overtired and/or hungry and tried to calmly and friendly remind him to be polite to us and to find out what he wants to help him get out of this situation. Unfortunately, he often (mostly?) does not take advantage of the situation when we try to smooth the way for him to get back to normal and appropriate behavior and we get into a downward spiral. We always offer him to hug him in such situations asking ""do you need a hug?"", but he refuses in most cases. Very often he is then sent to his room to calm down and come back if he can behave appropriately.  In this particular case, he got very angry and yelled at my wife, he did not want to stay in his room. He then also yelled at me, I don't remember how it went on but some time later he was quiet again in the kitchen and prepared his meal.  He then finally had accepted a hugging from me and was ok with me again. But he did not try to make up with my wife and my mother (who had left the room crying during this (for her) unnecessary conflict out of nothing.  I proposed to him several times to make up with the two others. He ignored that completely, sat down and ate his meal. My wife was really really upset about that.  I wonder: How can I act appropriately in such a situation?  I see 3 ways:   On the one hand I know that I could force him to apologize if I stop my interaction with him as long as he has not apologized to the other(s). But this apology is quite worthless as he only does it to get back my attention/time. On the other hand I could - as he has made up with me - treat him completely ""normally"" and interact with him as if nothing else had happened. This would feel very strange to me, as he has hurt people who are very important to me (my wife, my mother) and I don't want them to be hurt and don't want to play /spend time with the one who did that and does not regret it. In consequence of his behavior I refuse e. g. to don't read a bedtime story to him (which is quite hard for him). However, this should not be coupled to the fact if he has apologized to the others or not, but it should just be the consequence of his behavior, so it is still is free decision if he apologizes or not.   How do you deal with such situations? What could I do better? "
409,Why does our 7 month old wake up every 2 hours at night?,"... and what can we do about it?  We breastfeed, so it’s normal that she feeds regularly at night, but two out of three times, this kid wakes up just to be held and rocked for thirty seconds and then falls asleep immediately.  We tried comforting her in bed, singing to her, and many other options, but she is so impatient that her cries escalate and then it’s only harder to get her to go back to sleep. Cosleeping also is problematic. She arches her back and squirms, she just wants to be held and nothing else.   I see many other parents of seven month olds on various forums, even those who also breast feed, can sleep in four hour increments. Wow, that’s an unimaginable luxury.   How can we get there? Your advice, tips, input would be great! "
410,How to discourage my 3-year-old from intentionally squishing bugs?,"I have a just under 3-year-old girl. We spend a lot of time outside exploring nature. Often I'll pick up a bug and after she agrees to be gentle with it, I'll give it to her. She'll play with it for awhile and then with a grimace she'll intentionally squish it. Then she'll look guilty. I'll ask her if she's good and she says yes; then I'll ask her if squishing the bug was good and she'll say no.  Should I be worried about this behavior? She is otherwise very empathetic. What can I do to discourage it? "
411,"My 8 year old daughter tries to ""guess"" the words while she tries to read. Any tip to address this?","My 8 year old daughter tries to ""guess"" the words while she tries to read. Any tip?  Sounds like she is anxious to read fast.   I would like to help to help her pointing where it is wrong, but i feel it is a tiring process for her and maybe she is not learning by herself.   What approach do you suggest? "
412,Can you and should you teach pre school children to understand perspective of the past,"My three year old son. Has a pretty good memory. (Sometimes better than mine). And will happily talk about and answer questions about things that we have done. But he just places it all 'last year'. Even if I explain the concepts of yesterday, last week, etc. When asked when something was it always seems to be last year.  He also seems to have difficulty remembering events in order. Nit being sure if something yesterday and last year happened more recently.  If this is just a concept that will come in time then I don't mind letting him work it out.   However if nor is there anything I can do to help him understand the concepts? A game or something? "
413,Research request on marriage for out-of-wedlock pregnancy,"I read this statement and wanted to know more.     ... studies show that pregnant teens who marry before giving birth   generally have more stable marriages, do better financially, and have   healthier babies than those who do not marry or who marry after the   birth of the child. 9 This data provides very strong support for the   idea that if marriage is feasible, marriage should be considered well   before the birth of the child. Unfortunately, if marriage occurs after   the birth of an out-of-wedlock child, the probability of the   marriage’s failure is very high 10   9 ""Unmarried Parents Today,” Battelle Human Research Center Study, NCFA, March 1988.  10 L. K. White, “Determinants of Divorce: A Review of Research in the Eighties,” Journal of Marriage and the Family, 52 (1990):904–12.  Where are more articles that weigh in on the decision to marry, in the event of unwed parents? Especially, has this same study been done on adults rather than teens? "
414,What age to stop son from sleeping in same bed as Mother?,"A 5 year old boy has been sleeping at night in the same bed as his single mother for basically his whole life, although he has his own bedroom and his own bed.  They go to sleep together at the boy's bedtime and the mom gets up after the child is asleep (sometimes).  Is a boy this age sleeping with his mom common?  At what age should it stop? (Yes, this is a relative.) "
415,What are the options when the mother of a 7 year old is imprisoned?,"What are the options for explaining a (divorced) mother's absence to a 7 year old?  Should the child be told the truth? (Assume the crime is non-violent and financial.  Also assume the child has had a loving relationship with both parents, separately for the past several years.  The parenting plan has the child staying with the mother every other weekend; other times with the father.)  Are visitations by a 7 year old to an imprisoned mother generally considered by experts to be the best approach or are there other approaches that child experts suggest?  (The topic of telling children about a parent in prison was discussed here but without consideration of the age of the child: Should children of incarcerated parents be told the truth?) "
416,How to balance teaching that hard work pays vs chores for free,"We made a conscious decision not to give our kids much pocket money: it seemed a bad life lesson to teach that lots of free cash gets handed out on demand. So far that's been okay, and they've learned to save up if they want something expensive.  Now our eldest is a tweenager, and she's growing in independence. Along with this, her spending has gone up. It's nothing extravagant - she's not making unreasonable demands for the latest fashion or gadgets. It's just that now she's able to go out with her friends by themselves, she spends all her money with them on things like the cinema, thrift stores, drinks in cafes.   This all seems perfectly fine, but her pocket money doesn't cover it anymore and she quite reasonably wants extra.   Now we could increase pocket money but as stated, we'd prefer not to do that. So instead it seems a good idea to pay her for doing chores. It teaches a good life lesson that you have to work to earn money. But here there's a problem.  Most household chores that she's capable of doing are ""things that must be done"". They're not ""work"" per se, but the kind of everyday tasks that are part of living independently. Washing up, hoovering, cleaning the bathroom, that kind of thing.  When, in the fullness of time, she moves out, she needs to learn that other people she might live with will expect her to do these things for free. We do them for free. We'd like her to learn that they simply need to be done to maintain a good, orderly and pleasant house.   What can we do to offer her a way to earn money, and still balance these two important lessons?  (Note I have read this relevant question - Is rewarding hard work for chores with money necessarily a bad idea? - but I feel this is more specific and different enough to warrant its own entry) "
417,My 14 year old daughter is overly resistant when I advise something,"When I'm trying to explain something to my 14 year old daughter, she becomes very resistant to what I say or advise. I do understand that she has a hard time due to her age, both physically and psychologically. In addition to this, she does not see her father, as we are divorced.   I'm trying for her to develop mathematical thinking and math skills - which she finds boring.    We live in war zone in Eastern Europe and sometimes can't leave the city, so for her it's hard to not go for holidays and relax. We have internet, she can watch films, listen to music or acquire information, but I understand that it's not enough.   So from said above:   How can I make this transitional period easier for her, which I guess will still continue for some years, and how to overcome her resistance or what would be the  right approach to it for me?   Is there anything I can do to spark an interest in her for math and numbers?         How can I diversify her life here at home and when we can go to the capital for her age to ensure her well-being?  Update:   No,they teach math in school,but she finds it boring and I try to instigate in her the interest to the math,also the program in school is old,no new approaches. She is not homeschooled,she goes to the public school. Education she gets there is not the one I would wish for her.                    Transitional period - I meant puberty.             I want develop math skills so she can have a good career in future and stable position in life. I care more about practical appliance of math to life. About well being I wanted to diversify her life with age relevant entertainment (we go to the theater,cinema when in the capital) What else we can try when we have time together?                                      I worry about the fact she is resistant, I know it's somewhat normal for her age. I wanted to know what is the best approach I can have to it? Do I need to insist her to be not resistant or I need to take it easy and patiently wait when understanding will come?                                                             Yes,I realized that it would be better if I'd have broke this into two questions,but it's done now.                                                                           "
418,Is it normal for some toddlers to be scared of strangers?,"Neither me nor most of my friends have children, so I do not really have anyone I can ask about this.  I am new to the childcare industry and some of the toddlers seem scared of me. I am not used to this, because many of the children I meet in public are drawn to me. I have not let it bother me that some of the toddlers are scared of me. I have been very caring, friendly and responsive with them. I assumed that it was most likely normal for some toddlers to be scared of strangers and that it might take time for them to feel safe with a new person.   However, I am scared that there might be something about me that is scaring them. Perhaps something about my appearance? I have noticed that I am one of the only women at the daycare/preschool with short hair. I am the only woman at the center who styles her hair, does her nails, wears makeup and dresses in business casual/professional attire. I do not over-do it. I do not look like a clown, merely, chic and sophisticated.   I am also the only person besides the director who wears glasses. In fact, the only person whose overall appearance is more similar to mine, is the director. Everyone else, puts their hair up in messy buns. They wear faded tank tops, short shorts and sneakers. I am in no way judging their appearance, it is just that my appearance differs from theirs drastically and their appearance is what the toddlers are accustomed to at the center.  So, is it normal for some toddlers to be scared of strangers or is a fear of strangers a stage that most toddlers experience? Am I possibly doing something with my appearance that is scaring them? "
419,Teaching kiddo to swallow semi-solids,"Kiddo is a little over seven-months old. We've been trying to get him on semi-solid foods for about a month now, trying once a day or every couple of days. We've tried the standard stuff: baby oatmeal, rice cereal and packaged pureed fruits. It's not too hard to get the stuff in his mouth, but then he'll just sit with it in his mouth indefinitely, a little agitated with us. Our response is then to give him his bottle, at which point he washes down whatever the semi-solid may be. All of this is to say that he is consuming the semi-solid, but basically only because he's washing it down with the bottle. So, two questions:   Is there a way to teach kiddo to swallow these semi-solids? Just leaving it in his mouth for a while gets him pretty angry without inducing any swallowing. Supposing he won't swallow for us, are we doing more harm than good in letting him learn to wash down the semi-solids with formula?   Or, more broadly, how do you recommend we proceed? "
420,Minimum age required for jacuzzi bath,"I went with my nearly six years old daughter to the public pool &amp; SPA and to my surprise, I found a label saying, that children under age of 7 should avoid the jacuzzi bath. Is that true, and why is the minimum age set so high?  My wife suggests, that this is because the jacuzzi bath at that public pool is meant for aromatherapy and salt based. And that our simple, pure water home jacuzzi should cause no harm at all, neither for our older (nearly 6 years old) nor our younger (nearly 3 years old) daughter. Is that true? Can this be somehow verified?  EDIT: I'm talking about home jacuzzi bath, entirely under supervision (mine or wife's). So, arguments like chance of falling asleep are not my concern here. I'm looking only for health-like arguments. "
421,How to discipline teens for littering?,"We have a chore system for our two tweenagers, where we all clean up at the end of the day and they help out. So far it's been pretty good with less and less oversight needed over time, and relatively few arguments.  Recently I found out that when taking out rubbish, one or both of them have been just slinging it over the fence rather than putting it in the compost heap or the bin (small bags not big black bags). This doesn't seem to be every time, but it was at least 6 separate times from the amount I've just cleaned up, inside the last few weeks. Two times it was a nappy bag from our youngest which is particularly irksome.  The odd thing is, they actually walked out to where the compost heap is, then rather than lifting the lid and putting the bag in, just threw it from there. The bin for non-compost waste is in the opposite direction, about the same distance - so throwing nappy bags that way seems malicious. One was up a tree.  The trouble is, I don't know how to find out who did it and I'm not sure on an appropriate response. I'm pretty angry that they've fouled the nest, so to speak, and that they've acted so irresponsibly or maliciously.   Some background  One is sometimes prone to dishonest and sneaky behaviour, 12-year-old boy. The other is prone to burying her head in the sand and coming up with terrible solutions to problems (e.g. hiding rotten food rather than throwing it out until bad smells cause issues) and has a defiant streak a mile wide, 13-year-old girl.  I'd like to nip this in the bud, with a big focus on the responsibility to deal with rubbish appropriately and keep our house and neighbourhood clean. I want to raise the kind of kids that would pick up rubbish rather than drop it.   Question  How should I discipline them (both, or try to find out who?), making my anger and disappointment clear without garnering resentment or further littering? "
422,When do I tell my child that her dad is not her biological father,"My daughter is 11 years old and my husband adopted her when she was three. He has been in her life since she was 14 months old so he is the only father that she knows. I don't think that she has put two and two together about her name being changed.  The sperm donor was a very bad person, a drug addict and a drunk. He was abusive mentally, emotionally and physically. And decided to leave town when I was four months along and told him that I was having a girl. I just found out recently that he died two years ago from a drug overdose.   So my question is, when should I tell her the truth? I know that I should have told her sooner but I felt like I was protecting her from an evil man. I would like to hear from people that have done the same thing. I want to know if I should wait longer or tell her now. If others have done this, how did your child handle it? I want to hear the good, bad and the ugly. Please I really need help with this. "
423,Using pornography in sex education,"My son, who is eight and a half years old, has begun asking about sex more frequently in recent months. His questions are less about the reproductive aspect of human sexuality (which he understands, because it is explained in verbal and visual detail in many children's books and documentary films, both on human reproduction and animal life) and more about the basic procedure of human intercourse as well as about what adults would call lust and eroticism.  Being familiar with his own penis and the flaccid penis of his father as well as the outward form of female genitalia, my son seems to find it hard to imagine that a penis can be inserted in a vagina and what needs to be done to produce those enigmatic spermiums that he as yet has never seen and probably cannot conceive of ejaculating from his own member.  He also does not yet have any romantic, much less sexual, feelings about girls (or boys), and the only difference he sees between the genders are differences in the media they prefer. Otherwise girls are just as much fun to play with, and he does not quite understand why any person might want to kiss or caress someone except for familial affection.  In other words, he is still (sexually) an ""innocent"" child, but he recognizes signs of romantic and sexual activity in the adults, teens and other children around him (and in the media), and he is curious about what it all means (and, possibly, what is coming up for him).  I have begun to go through the books that are advertised as explaining the topic of human sexuality to children, but I have found them to almost completely omit the reproductive act itself as well as everything that has to do with sexual lust. They do mention love (albeit usually between married parents), but they do not help a child prepare for a teens feelings of horniness. They do explain (often in boring detail) the development of the fetus and the hormones of the female cycle, but they do not even mention wet dreams or intercourse.  When my son asks me, I try to answer as truthfully as possible, but I often find it hard to explain some aspects without visual reference.  When a child asks you about how something is done or what a certain thing looks like, you will find it easiest to give a comprehensive answer by showing him the activity yourself or a movie that shows it. For example, when you try to teach your child to swim, you wouldn't expect him or her to understand what you are talking about without ever having seen another person in the water. In fact you will perform the movements and ask your child to mimick your behavior.  For that reason, I have wondered wether or not my son might find it helpful, if I allowed him to view some (carefully preselected) pornographic images or (preferably) a pornographic movie. There are a few videos and photos on the web that to me show what I think of as tender, loving sex and that include only what I perceive to be normal, healthy sexual behavior.  But apart from worrying about my son telling his friends, and them telling their parents, I also wonder if this (one time!) exposure would either shock him or influence his own sexual development unfavourably. I think, neither, but what do you think? Or what alternative do you recommend?    Some general comments to the comments and answers:   I have seen some pornographic movies that portray realistic, loving sex. I don't want to link it, but please believe me, that it exists. The book Show me! by Will McBride features explicit photographs of people (including children) being sexually active. It was published in Germany (where I live), won prices (incuding prices by church organisations) and withstood several court cases here and in the US. You can find some of the images through Google. I would have bought the book, but it is quite expensive today. I own a teen sex ed book, Make Love, also published in Germany, which features explicit photographs of adults having sex. It has been highly praised in the media here, and is legally available in book stores. Some of the images can be seen in this review in censored versions.

424,2.5 year old tantrums one step behind what we're doing,"My 2.5 year old daughter tantrums quite strongly.  We will try to find things she wants to do to break the tantrum (other than the thing she's asking for, of course).  One of the things she loves doing is morning rituals like making coffee.  She loves helping daddy make his coffee.  During a tantrum in the morning, I'll suggest that we should make coffee.  She'll scream ""no,"" but her body language makes it clear she wants to.  However, there's a problem.  Whatever step in the process we are on, she wants to do the previous step, and only that.  Unfortunately, this is quite often an irreversible process, such as grinding coffee beans.  Thus a session goes something like this:     (Step 1: heat the filter by putting some water through it)   Me: Do you want to flip the switch?   Daughter: NO! I DON""T WANT TO FLIP THE SWITCH!   Me: We're making coffee, right?  The next step is to flip the switch.  Want to flip the switch with me?   Daughter: NO! I DON""T WANT TO FLIP THE SWITCH!   Me: Okay. *flips the switch to start the water*      Daughter: NOOOOOOO!  I WANTED TO FLIP THE SWITCH!      Me: Are you ready to grind the coffee?  You can press the button to grind the coffee   Daughter: NO! I DON""T WANT TO GRIND THE COFFEE!   Me: Are you sure?  You like grinding the coffee.  Do you want to grind the coffee?   Daughter: NO! I DON""T WANT TO GRIND THE COFFEE!   Me: Okay. *Presses the button and starts the grinder*      Daughter: NOOOOOOOOO!  I WANTED TO GRIND THE COFFEE!   This process repeats about 10 times, once at each step where there's an irreversible action like grinding beans or running water through them.  Whatever step we just did is the one she wants to do.  Things I've tried:   Repeating the step.  If I throw the coffee grinds out and restart the step, she goes back to not wanting to do that step.  The instant I repeat the step myself, she screams about how she wanted to do it. Trying to wait for her mind to catch up doesn't seem to work.  I feel like I get the same response whether I give her 1 chance to behave before turning the switch, or work with her for 5 minutes before turning it. Repeating the process.  This is hit or miss.  Sometimes she pulls it together enough to repeat the whole thing (I end up with an extra cup of coffee), sometimes she goes back to ""I DON""T WANT TO MAKE COFFEE!"" I can ignore her, and make my coffee, but this pattern seems to happen with any task with multiple steps in it, so it seems like something about how her brain is learning.  It feels really awkward to ""just ignore her,"" which is advice I see on many site regarding tantrums.   Is this a common pattern that kids grow through?  Are there recognized tricks for how to help her through these? "
425,Playing with legos with a toddler around,"I need your advice on how to get my 4-year old son to play less with legos (or to play in a more controlled fashion) when his toddler brother is around.  Currently my son goes through a period where legos are his only toy. He takes them apart, builds something new, plays with it for a while and repeat the whole process all day long. This is fine and I encourage him to do it for now, but in a few months his toddler (6 month old) brother will begin to move around the house and will encounter the lego blocks. I am worried he might swallow them and I'm looking for a way around the problem. We can't keep them separated because we live in a small apartment.  Should I ban legos completely for the ~ 1year period when the toddler is prone to swallow small things? Should I introduce other types of toys (if yes, which types?) for my 4 year old to get him to play less with legos?  If you've had this problem, how did you manage it?  Thanks for the advice! "
426,34 month old refuses to swallow or spit out food,"He refuses to swallow or spit out his food. We are at a loss on how to combat this issue as he won't just hold it in his mouth for half n hour. We are talking 3 HOURS + HERE! The only reason he spat it out after 3 hours is because we ended up telling him to swallow it sternly and he got upset and spat it out involuntarily because he started crying.  And it isn't towards the end of the meal either. It's become the first bite he will do it. Our rule is that when he starts pocketing food, we don't make him eat anymore. We take the food away but he is not allowed to leave the table until he swallows what is in his mouth. He also refuses to spit it out or even open his mouth. I have had to try and scoop it out of his mouth before because he can't go to bed with food in his mouth as it's a choking hazard and he will just bite down on my finger. And it is also all sorts of food. Not just food he doesn't like. We can tell it is for attention and stubborness but has anyone had their child do this for 3 hrs at a time?? We are starting to wonder if there could be possible psychological issues going on as we know he can chew and swallow fine.  "
427,Staying focused getting ready for school,"We have three kids (a 9, 4 and 3 year old) and our middle child is severely disabled.  My wife has some commuting challenges in the morning and thus has limited availability at the critical time and there's not much we can do about that.  As such, I have a pretty tight timeline on getting everyone ready and out the door in the morning and my attention is quite divided to boot.    The short of it is that I need to find some way to train the 9-year-old to focus on things like eating his breakfast, brushing teeth, etc. on his own.  I can remind him every five to ten minutes, but it seems I have to do it every one or two before he absent-mindedly disengages and begins playing with a toy or staring off into space, etc.  It's hard for me to sustain this and nearly every morning we find ourselves rushing out the door in a blind panic no matter how prepared I am the night before or how early we start.  The time is simply taken up by idle activity.  How does one teach focus to this age group?  Are there some fair incentives to keep him on track and what's the appropriate behavior as this keeps reoccurring?  I've been getting upset (which of course makes matters worse), but I'm really at a loss here.  Would love some suggestions.  EDIT:  I failed to mention in the original post that I have a limited window of time myself due to time syncing with our European and Australian offices (I'm in EST).  There are excellent suggestions about starting earlier and baking incentives into the morning routine that won't work for my particular situation but may be helpful for others. "
428,Exclusive breastfeeding - how to deal with complaints from baby?,"Is exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of the child's life possible,  in general? I have heard a lot about that and heard about people doing that. But I did not get a chance to interact with those people who had breastfed exclusively.   My second baby is 2 months old. When I breastfeed him, sometimes he cries when the let-down is less, by shaking his legs, and trying to get more from the nipples by pulling it vigorously.  What do I need to do in this situation? Anyway, I feel guilty and give him formula after the situation.  I pump after every nursing session to increase my milk production.  "
429,Ten year old is lying and seems to believe her own lies,"My ten-year-old stepdaughter has recently developed a habit of telling bold-faced lies to avoid getting in trouble/having to do something she does not want to. How do we respond to this?  Some background  The child’s parents have been separated since she was three, and for the past five years she has primarily lived with parent A and myself. She is supposed to see parent B on alternating weekends and twice during the week. B often cancels these scheduled placement times with just a few hours’ notice. Recently this has started to greatly upset the child (previously she acted indifferent or just a little disappointed). The child has always had some behavior problems, primarily ignoring people when they talk to her, arguing when asked to do something, and not following directions. She has been screened for hearing problems and her hearing is normal. She has also been screened for learning disabilities and ADHD and at that time (two years ago) she did not meet the criteria for those conditions.   The current situation  In the last few weeks, my stepdaughter has started telling lies to avoid getting in trouble, and she doubles-down on the lies even when confronted with evidence to the contrary.   The lies can be very small, for example saying that she brushed her teeth, to pretty substantial, for example saying that she did not get in trouble at school even after we received an email from her teacher explaining how she misbehaved and what the consequences were.  The part that is very concerning is that she digs in and doubles down on the lie when confronted with evidence that her lie is not true. She truly seems to believe that her lie is reality. Example:     Parent: You need to brush your teeth.      Child: I already brushed my teeth.      Parent: You did not brush your teeth. I watched you walk into the bathroom, play at the sink, and walk back out without brushing.      Child: I did brush my teeth!      Parent: I am telling you to brush your teeth now.      Child: (crying and/or yelling) I told you I already brushed my teeth!   She has also started yelling and crying when she is doubling-down on the lie. In the past she would usually accept that she had been caught in a lie and accept the consequences/do what she was asked to do. She was not one to easily cry.   We have received reports from her teachers at school confirming that the same behavior occurs there.   The next steps we will take are meeting with her teachers and school counselor, and we have made an appointment for her to meet with a counselor outside of school. Parent B is kept informed of the events occurring and is encouraged to participate in the process but so far has chosen minimal to no involvement.   As an aside, I strongly suspect that something happening when the child is with Parent B is fueling this, and/or Parent B’s lack of interest and involvement in the child’s life is fueling this behavior, but that is not something Parent A or I have the power to change.   My Question  Until we can meet with the counselors and get more information about what the underlying problem is and how to address it, how do we respond when she is doubling-down on her lies? We are left feeling like sputtering idiots when she is denying things that we saw happen with our own eyes, and questioning our own grip on reality. And we are not sure how to respond when she tells us something that seems implausible but which we can't prove or disprove.  For the big lies she has told about her behavior at school, she lost TV/electronics for one week, and after the latest set of lies a few days ago she was grounded from those things indefinitely. When she raises her voice or starts crying as in the example above, she is sent to her room and told we do not talk to each other that way. Is there a better way to deal with this? Is it important to get her to admit that she is lying, or should we just stop engaging with the lie and move directly to issuing consequences?   In the last few days it has become unpleasant to spend time with her or engage in conversation because it might devolve into an argument about the nature of reality. Even small things could trigger an argument. Our patience is worn so thin and we have no idea how to address this. If she was an adult I would say she is gaslighting us.  This question is very similar in nature, but the answer doesn't seem likely to help and doesn't address some of my other concerns. "
430,How can I help the Bitten?,"In her creche, my 2-year-old daughtergot severely bitten by three different children now with a couple of months between each incident-cluster. The first biter moved to a different creche soon after, the second one became her friend after parents and teachers worked closely together, but the third continues to be a problem. The parents are quite aggressive and from what the teachers say I have the impression they refuse working with them but get defensive.  My daughter is clearly affected by the incidents as even weeks later she reenacts the biting with her doll and from within unrelated situations we have dialogues as »I cried.« »Why did you cry?« »X bit me.«.  It is my first child so my questions are:   I am beginning to fear there is a pattern as other children do not get bitten as often. Might there be behaviour that encourages other toddlers (all under 3) to seek her out? Which would that be? How can I help her both dealing with it and avioding it in the future without suggesting to her it's her fault? I don't really want to tell her to avoid the biter or push her, but don't really know what else I can do.  "
431,"What to do about step children who don't listen to us, don't do their chores but are being spoiled by their grand mother?","My husband has two lovely boys, age 8 and 9. Boys are staying over in  in-laws' house to finish their school. Boys are coming over for weekends and I take them to school on Mondays.  We are having issues with   following directions/listening showing respect asking politely behavior greetings and ignoring.   I have step up House rules, so boys know how they need to behave. They have simple rules. For example ""Say please"", ""thank you"", ""excuses me"", ""yes""/""no"" ""sir""/""ma'am"". We want them to be polite, boys are smart, and I know they know these words.  Here is a problem, their grand mom (she is doing a great job ) lets them treat her as 'no one'. She serves them with everything. Last time I was picking them up, one of the boys asked for French toast      I want French toast       grandma does the toast - 5 minutes later      When my toast will be ready?   I step in and I explained that such behavior is not accepted and it is rude. And I told him how it need to be done     Grand mom, I would like a toast?    or      Grand mom can I please have a French toast?   And wait until it's finished.   Grandmother lets them do it everytime.   When adults are talking at the table, they cut in and interrupt, they talk back, they do not do what we asked for, or they ask why they have to do it, or ""I don't want to do it"". When we talk to them, and we explain why their behavior is unacceptable, the older one is making faces, he is laughing like he is ignoring.  They treat us like peers, they do not say hello or goodbye. They do not say thank you, or if they can be excused from the table - we remind them everytime, but it is getting sick, for past seven months I am doing the same thing every weekend.  They do not want to clean their room (the share room and restroom ). For example, if one thing is left the excuse is - it's not mine it's mark and via versa. We are trying to teach them how to share, how to talk properly, how to be polite, show respect, explain why they need to listen. All this stuff is on the house rules.   When boys go back to gradmom's house, our progress goes backwards. She lets them get away with everything, then they are coming over to us and same issues all over again. I copied the house rules and gave it to mother-in-law. It is hanging in the kitchen, still boys are ignoring it.   They are not absent minded, they have A's and B's in school- one of them is in gifted program. I believe if they know how to pray before the dinner, they can learn how to behave and how to be polite. They know how to behave at my mother's house, by the time we get into the car, everything is getting back to ""their"" normal behavior.   We tried time out, the older one stands there and keeps asking ""how much longer"", or he is screaming so loud that I can't stand it. We tried taking toys away. The younger one is little different - he doesn't want to disappoint you. But when we put them together, it's crime after crime. It is just making me tired of the repeating the same thing, when I know that grandmother will do it her way.   Also, let me add that my husband and I do things with boys - color, puzzles, learning languages, gardening. We spend time together. But their behavior it's turning us off. Last weekend, we were invited to a birthday party and we did not go because boys could not behave. Last weekend, we got late to dinner because boys waited to do their things (clean their room, take shower, vacuum their room) for 4 hours. I told them why they have to do it, that they have 2 hours etc. still nothing...  Any suggestions or comments would help. "
432,Teen secretly playing video games when should be doing homework,"If a son of about 14 years old, using his laptop to do schoolwork, secretly plays video games instead, should it be the parent's responsibility to find this out and stop him?

433,USG fetal age is 2 weeks behind LMP for 33 wk Pregnency. Is it a concern?,My wife is 33w 5 days pregnent as per LMP. All her USG done till far except the last one which was done couple of days backed the USG fetal age was 1 week ahead of LMP. The last USG she wen't through showed the fetal age to be 2 weeks behind the LMP. Our doctor mentioned that this is not a good sign as this is indicating that the baby is not growing properly. So he was suggesting an early delivery within 37-38 wk. As far as I have researched I found that   USG dating is more reliable in early pregnency when the proportional growth of all babies are consistent. At later pregency the USG dating is +- 2 weeks. Baby growth at later pregnency is not uniform.   So my question is   Is it really a concern if USG fetal age is 2 weeks behind LMP fetal age? Is it enough reason to go for early delivery? Can the USG dating be wrong considering a 3 weeks prior scan showed the USG age to be 1 week ahead of LMP age. The weight of baby was estimated to be 1.7033 kg. Is it normal for 33 wk?   We are really worried and concerned. Even the doctor we are visiting is the best Gynacologist in our city. 
434,When is it appropriate to start explaining the religious components of the various holidays?,"When should we teach our kids about other cultures and holidays? We are Jewish which makes it a bit complicated this season.  We are often wished Merry Christmas in stores (seems natural as most people in America celebrate Christmas in some form). We are surrounded by Christmas lights (one of my favorite parts of the season).  My kids know that different people celebrate different holidays and that is great and we need to respect everyone's holidays.  My kids are 7, 4, 3, and almost 2.    When is it appropriate to start explaining other peoples religions in terms of things like what Christmas means? What Channukah means?  What Kwanza means(Which every religions are not your own)? "
435,Maintaining contact with a one year old in a long distance situation,"My wife and our two children (a five year old daughter and a one year old son) are about to move away to a different city, for a mix of reasons.  This is likely to lead to a long distance relationship for an indefinite period of time.  I'm going to be trying to spend weekends with them every week.    My daughter and I are very close and I have made plans to keep things going  between us, or at least as well as possible in these circumstances.  But my son is just one.  He and I have bonded, but his mother is definitely the primary caregiver.  If I'm only going to be around for a day or two in a week, what kind of activities can I engage in with him at this age that will be useful?  Just the normal playing, or should I try for something specific to this situation? "
436,How do I help my 3 month old sleep better through the night?,"My 3mo daughter was sleeping pretty well through the night (from 11 PM to 7 AM) for about a week, and now she wakes up every 30 mins to 1 hour wanting her pacifier.  I've been running in at the first sign of crying and giving her her pacifier. As of 2 days ago, the behavior started spreading to her day time routine.  We have a routine set up where she wakes up, eats (wife breastfeeds), has her ""awake time"", and then we put her down awake for her nap when she shows signs of being tired (lather, rinse, repeat).  She normally didn't wake up more than once or twice a night or during her naps, where as now it's anywhere from 4-7 times a night and 2-3 times during a nap.  We've asked a few people what they've done and people have suggested:   ""gradual extinction"" to remove pacifier dependency all together just deal with it till she can self soothe remove pacifier during day and deal with her, and then let her have it at night. add a midnight feeding at 2-3 AM and remove pacifier during day   This is our first child and so we are still new with this whole parenting thing.  What is safe for the baby?  Will the baby go through ""withdrawals"" if we deny her something she has grown attached too?  How can we help her get better sleep during the night? "
437,When can children understand the concept of lying?,How old does a child have to be to be lying on purpose?  How old are they before they can understand the concept of a lie vs the truth?  What about not the truth vs the truth? 
438,Balancing toy interest and value with noise,"We got the Poppin' Park Elefun Busy Ball Poppers toy. Our daughter loves the toy and it is really encouraging her to crawl and even to work on getting from her tummy to sitting to put the balls back in. I think it is a great toy, however it is VERY loud. I am not talking about the music, that does not bother me, the fan to blow the balls out is so loud that it quickly annoys me and drowns out that there even is music. I find myself wanting to take the toy away but she really has not been interested enough in anything else to try to get back to sitting once she goes to her tummy. Any suggestions for how to balance what seem to be some developmental benefits with the annoyance of the toy? Are there ways to encourage her to play with the toy and work on getting back to sitting without the noise of the fan? "
439,My child is being a help vampire,"As stated, my 7-year-old son is turning into a help vampire, especially when it comes to a game we are playing.   We started playing a 3DS game together but separately. There are two versions but with the same story line that is followed. I play one version, he plays the other. We both got through a good portion of the game but at one point, he got stuck on how to continue. It was a spot I had trouble with also, so I pointed him in the right direction and he was able to continue.  Fast-forward to a week or so later and now, almost at every hinge-point in the story line, he comes and asks me ""Where do I go next?"" I watched him as he plays and discovered that the root cause of his inability to follow the story line is that he reads little to none of the dialogue.   If you ask ""well, what did this character tell you to do next?""  He responds with ""I don't remember.""  ""Because you didn't read the dialogue?""  ""...No""  So now, what's a dad to do? Do I continue to aid him in the game or do I let him squirm to try and figure it out even at a point where I know none of the key dialogue that needs to be read to understand where to go next won't be repeated by the character giving the direction?  Do I let my son continue to be a help vampire? "
440,How do you balance time for playdates vs family time?,"Both playdates and family time are extremely important to the growth, maturity, and well being of children.  That being said how do you balance playdates and family time given the limited time we have for either once our kids are in school?  Are there any studies that speak to this? "
441,"During and after a separation - explaining to children who their ""family"" is","My wife and I are in a kind of quasi-separation that is likely to lead to divorce.  She has been and is emotionally abusive (the silent treatment, projection and gaslighting being what she does most), as I've detailed  of other posts.  She and the children live in a different city from me and I visit for two days of every week. For the last year I've been staying in a small separate place nearby when coming to their city, and the children have been coming to me. We were supposed to be working on the marriage but for the last four months my wife has gone back to full blown abusive behaviour and we're most likely going to end in a divorce.  My wife always used to use ""my"" to refer to everything that was ours (my children, my house, my money, etc.) but in the last few months has shifted ot using ""our"" - but excluding me.  ""Our"" here refers to only herself and the kids.  The kids have picked up on this language, so now her house is ""our house"", her parents (who live nearby) and relatives are ""our family"", her possessions are ""ours"" etc. The aim here seems to have been a passive aggressive method to get the kids to see my place as not theirs, and in that she has partly succeeded.    But it's also had the knock on effect of increasing leaving me out of any sense of family.  How should I respond to this?  A few times I've gently corrected my daughter when she referred to ""our family"" by saying, I'm also your family, you know, and she's then corrected by talking about ""mom's family.""  But I don't want to keep correcting her.  What else can I do?  NB: We have two kids, a daughter who is nine and a son who is about to turn five.   NB(squared): Just for clarity, I'm not asking for suggestions on how to handle my wife, but suggestions on what to tell my children.  "
442,Is this considered child abuse,"First, my mom never hits me; I want to be clear on that.  My brother 13, and I, 15 got into a fight at McDonalds. We threw ketchup at each other and I accidentally got some on on a nearby woman. My mother had to reimburse the woman for the damage. My mother freaked out and humiliated us in McDonalds by calling my brother and myself immature babies. While leaving McDonalds, she commented on how she should get us pacifiers, pampers, and a playpen. People were staring at us as if she was correct. On the car ride home, she continued to comment on how when she goes to Wal-mart, she will buy us a crib and stuff. She keeps telling me how we made her look like a bad mother. She is being a total b** to me.   Now she has taken away my X-box, iPod, and Cell Phone. She has grounded me and I can't go out on weekends now.   Can I turn her into CPS for abuse for saying those things to me? Isn't it slander or something about saying lies about someone? Saying I need pampers makes me look bad in public.   For the record, my brother started this fight, not me. It is not fair that she is doing this. She took away my games, my iPod, my cell phone and I can't go out now because of that b**. Now she won't let me take Driver's Ed. She says I am too immature to drive.   Can't CPS make her a better mom or tell her to chill out? "
443,16 year old boy with existential crisis,"I am a single working parent of a 16 year old boy. He is highly intellingent, well read and a social person - has good friends and hobbies. He also studies at the uni (currently doing a BA in math and CoS) so he is under a lot of stress. Ours is a democratic household, so he pretty much does what he wants (he had chosen what to study and where, and it'd be fine with me if he instead of studying would have chosen working on a farm or whatever.)  Puberty hit him pretty hard and he became:   antisocial, has mood swings, depression, can lock himself in his room for days, claims that his teachers at high school are incopentent and they aren't worth his attention, that he hates it there, saying that he only lectures worth his time are at the uni, and missed quite a lot of lessons at high school (and some at the uni.) had completely stopped working out, and while he participates in weekend activities with his friends (no drugs and almost no alcohol, we checked) his lifestye is pretty unhealthy, displays the classical Holden Caulfield behaviour, disillusioned with society, conformity etc.  not very thrilled to spend time with family, prefers his friends (which is fine, the family members are understanding and they're ok to wait out this period)   What should i do with this almost banal and textbook case of identity crisis? I want to support him, but while in the past he shared his worries with me and if needed asked for help/advice, lately he doesn't confide in me much.  I made him promise me that he will discuss his problems with his friends, and not keep it all inside, and he agreed, but maybe he needs more than his friends' advice.  My impression is that he sometimes is almost scared by the intensity of his feelins and mood swings/depression. It seems he is also feels that he is now messed up, because he set his goals years ago to finish his B.A. at the age of 18-19, but at this time he is too distracted to study as usual and his grades arent A+ anymore. I told him that it's fine to leave the university and live as any 16 year old, and to have more free time if it's too hard on him or if he decides to continue, i can help him with the material he missed, and if he prefers someone else, we can hire a tutor...  but as for now, he is now not sure what he wants except for me to leave him alone to wallow in his depression. Which I pretty much did and try not to crowd him.  But maybe let things sort out themselves is not the best idea. Sould I at this stage try to convince him to see a psychologist (he doesn't overly excited about the discipline of psychology though, thinks it's useless, and that neuroscience is the way to go to achieve real results) or just let him 'grow out of it'? He probably needs advice to sort out what he should do, but for now he is not very thrilled about trying to discuss his problems with adults. "
444,How should I handle academic disagreement with a teacher?,"A second grade teacher of a friend of my daughter taught her class that Columbus was not a nice man, and explained why.  My daughter was not affected by this teaching. However, it brought up the question of what should I do when/if this happens to my daughter?  Whether or not Columbus was a nice man, second grade is not the time to teach this and therefore I disagree with the teacher.  What should I do should this happen in a class my child is in? "
445,I don't like my child's teacher's teaching style,"My daughter is in second grade and is learning spelling.  The teacher puts a lot of emphasis on alphabetizing words.  I don't see the academic value in this, especially now that people, for the most part, don't use dictionaries but use the internet instead.  How should I handle the work I think is a waste when my daughter brings it home for homework? How should I speak to the teacher about this? "
446,What age do children understand what it means to hide?,"My 4-year-old niece doesn't understand yet the difference between not seeing and not being seen: when she wants to hide from someone, she simply closes her eyes, and that's it.  For example, when somebody comes home she likes playing the ""Let's pretend I'm not here"" game, and then... Sometimes she hides properly, for example under a table, but other times she simply covers her eyes with her hands, or buries her face into the couch, and just stays there, in plain sight. Clearly, she is following the rule ""If I can't see you, you can't see me"". When will she realize what it really means to hide? Given her ability to speak, play, draw, and do everything, I'd expect her to know better. Clearly, I'm wrong, and I'm not worried by this, but I'm still curious about how long this will continue.  I've found an article explaining that this is done by pre-schoolers, but it doesn't clarify how long it lasts, and ""when they go to school"" seems way too late (but of course I might be wrong!)  So, what age do children realize that covering their eyes does not mean to hide? "
447,Using a visual device to indicate good/bad behavior status for toddlers,"My 3 year old has a habit of not eating her dinner. It's been our policy to tell her if she's not going to eat, she can just go to bed. Sometimes she's happy to do that, so we wanted to further discourage the no-eating behavior by saying if you don't eat your dinner, you can't have a snack the next day.  So, we ended up making a little fridge magnet with a red side and a green side (since she knows colors and what red/green mean) and if she eats her dinner, we will turn it to the green side so that the next day she can look at it, know she can have a snack that day, and associate it to having eaten the night before. and of course, the opposite for not eating. She's picked up on the concept very quickly.  Is this a good technique? Part of me feels there's something about this that is going to backfire, or end up contributing to some negative behavior. Anybody tried this before? Anything in child psychology studies?? If it works for dinner time, could the same technique be used for other things like taking naps, cleaning room, etc? "
448,At what age can children understand and respond well to discipline?,"When my daughter was 6 months old, she liked to crawl over to our floor lamp and play with it (which is dangerous).  Instead of trying to correct her behavior, we simply moved the lamp behind a child gate.  Now she is 10 months old, and she likes playing with our flashy, blinky internet router.  We can't really move it, so we spent a week constantly correcting her when she went to play with it.  She seems to have learned not to touch it.  My question is, what age is average for kids to relate cause and effect, and to be able to learn from discipline?  Could she have learned not to touch the lamp as a 6 month old? "
449,Disagreeing with a teacher,"   Possible Duplicate:   Disagreement, academically, with a teacher       I voted to close my last to, similar questions, as they seemed to not explain themselves well enough to get the answers I was looking for. Please vote to close them so that they will close out.  My question is, how do I deal with my child and her teacher when I disagree with the teacher?  What do I say to my child?  What do I say to the teacher?  When should I go to an administrator? "
450,Should I stop teaching my toddler a second language if his exposure to it will be limited?,"I have stared to talk exclusively in English to my son when he was less than 6 months old. However, we have decided not to move to an English speaking country, so I ended up practically alone.  It's been two years since then (he's 2y7m old now) and he clearly understands (my) English (he does know colors in English, cars, can count in both languages to ten...), although he answers in Slovak. He's also able to translate what I tell to people who don't understand English. After two years, I have to admit that I'm still far from native speaker and seriously consider I cease from speaking English with him, so I don't teach him my broken English.   I have read answers on questions like Would it be bad to only speak to a child  in a language in which you are not completely fluent? and referenced studies, but there is no answer on what happens if I stop teaching the second language, or possibly, at what age it is desirable.   Will the advantages (cognitive or developed executive functions) we earned persist? Would these disappear if I cease from speaking English? Are there any negative effects on my son if I continue speaking English (beside the fact I may teach him broken English)?  "
451,"When does an adoption ""sink in"" for a child?","We adopted our six year-old son at age one.  When he asks questions or makes comments about the first year of his life, or when he was ""in momma's tummy,"" we have never lied to him.  We tell him we didn't know him yet because he used to live with a different family when he was a baby.  However, this information always goes straight over his head, and he shows no further curiosity.  It's like the idea seems completely absurd to him, so he ignores it.  I had a friend who found out when he was 18 that he was adopted, and the sudden revelation really shattered his sense of identity.  I had hoped to spare my son much of the same difficulty by being open about it from the start, but it seems he is headed toward it suddenly ""hitting him"" one day anyway.  Should I sit my son down with this express purpose and hammer the idea until he understands?  He has very strong ADHD-like behavior, so we occasionally have to do this for other concepts.  Or should we continue answering him truthfully but not pressing the matter?  Is there a certain age or stage at which he will be more receptive to the information and we can expect natural curiosity to prompt him to ask us more questions? "
452,My 4-year old son - in preschool full time - only wants to stay home without kids in his free time. Should we be concerned?,"My son is 4 1/2.  He's been in daycare and preschool since he was 6 months old.  As such, he has been surrounded by other kids every weekday for his whole life.  As an introvert, I totally feel empathy for his situation.  He sometimes complains to me and my husband that when at school, he wants to be left alone or have quiet/alone time. However, when we talk to his teachers about this, they act surprised and say that he's as active, social and talkative as all the other kids.   On the weekend, he wants nothing more than to enjoy his ""stay home day."" He wants to stay home and play with his cars and trucks, and it's hard to get him to go out.  I sometimes let him stay home...but I start to get cabin fever and feel like we both get bored and start getting frustrated with the situation.  So, I struggle with this -- is it good to give him that experience of just enjoying being at home?  Is this a sign that his environment is not right for him and he's out of balance?  Or, should we schedule activities and outings and recognize that he's just never going to want to shift gears, regardless of what he's doing?  My inclination is to give him one solid day at home and then schedule something fun for us to do on the other.   "
453,How can I encourage my 4.5 year old daughter to eat without needing tons of time along with play?,"It seems that our daughter is not so fond of most foods.  She is fond of milk though - any kind of milk, cow, goat, even soy. While eating I get the feeling she is bored. She eats very slowly and not all the foods. Actually very few. So, in order to eat, we got into the bad habit of playing at the same time. This started at a very young age. When I say ""playing"" I mean ""playing together"". This slows eating a lot. Yesterday it took her 1.5 hours to finish her food and at the same time we finished a nice Lego construction with a semi-complicated story in between bites.  The story included castles, dragons, knights, and a princess. Maybe I am bit over the edge, but you see my point.  In other words, if there is no playing she doesn't want to eat (thus, she doesn't eat at school). Strange is that she can eat by herself when in company of her cousins and eat all together (safe space?).   So my question is, how can I make my daughter eat by herself without us being there playing with her? "
454,How can I help my parents?,"Hope this is the right place to ask this question because it's upside down: I'm the child and don't know how to help my parents, so I need an advice.  My parents have always had a lots of arguments since I have memory. They have really different kinds of personality and hobbys so they don't do a lot of activities together. I can remeber a lots of arguments where my mom ended telling me ""I don't leave your father because I want you and your brother to grow up with a family"". I have always believed this to be true. The situation between them has never really improved but I'm not sure how things have been lately. At 19 I started university and since then I've not been frequently at home, and after I moved with my girlfriend. Since more than a year I came back to my parent's house (love is gone...) but in a different flat with my brother, where I still live even if it's temporary. I don't spend a lot of time with them because I don't have much time: work, friends, my actual girlfriend who works abroad and our project to move together... A lots of stuffs absorb all my time.  This morning my mother came to me crying and saying she can't really stay with my father anymore. I know (because she told me) there was a lots of family related reasons to ""not break the family"" even in recent past. Her mom was sick, my brother had personal problems... But now all these are gone and she has already started a new life. She stopped staying always at home and she is now involved in community related activities with new friends. She seems happy. She says yesterday she was arguing again with my father and she is scared because he doesn't accept the fact she wants to break up and he seems to be somehow violet. Not physically(until now) but she is scared. I remember in my childhood my father being excessively aggressive with my mother during some arguments. I think he has never really beaten her but sometime he has been verbally rude, screaming and advancing at her so that she had to step back. And a couple of time she came to my bedroom crying because she said she was ""scared as hell"" by my father during an argue.  What can I do? I really think my father is way too aggressive, but probably he has never really beaten my mother (can't be sure, she wouldn't tell me) and would never really do it. I believe my father is just a bit desperate in this situation because he has not a lots of friends, he's not (at all) an open-minded person and he doesn't want to be left alone and/or somehow forced to change his life. I really hope to provide them help so that things can resolve without external intervention, also because my brother (despite older than me) is really attached to my parents and a ""hostile/legally"" separation will strongly impact him. But what can I do to really help them? Should I prioritize my mother fears even if I think they are a bit exaggerate? Should I talk to my father even if I don't think he will listen to me because he's too stubborn? "
455,Teaching a child 2 languages that are not part of their environment,"I've seen a few question regarding language, but none that fight my current situation. I live in Ukraine and my wife has a 2 year old child that almost exclusively heard Russian so far. I, on the other hand, am a French native, and speak English fluently. I speak with my wife in English exclusively.  I want to teach her daughter both English and French, while my wife and the environment will teach the child Russian and Ukrainian. I'm just wondering how to go about teaching 2 languages myself, given that I'll be the only foreign stimuli in the child's life (aside from TV/Youtube). Would a 1 week/1 language schedule work? Is it already too late to teach the child 2 languages at once? Won't that delay language development?  On a side note, she heard me speaking to the child exclusively in English for about 4 months, and it seems that the child understands me for most simple dialogues/""commands"". But, her child started speaking some bits of Russian, it's unintelligible for the most part, but we kind of understand what's being said. "
456,My 2 1/2 year old won't talk on his own And stares into the distance,"He does say things like ""mommy"" ""daddy"" ""ewww"" ""Mickey"" ""owww"" and ""drink"". They're slurred and you have to know what he's saying to understand them. But he won't say anything else on his own. We can get him to say ""please"" ""thank you"" ""I you""(his version of I love you) and other small words or phrases if we say ""luke say..."" but most of the time he's a silent child. He just stares off into the distance and is mute like.  I have 3 older kids And 2 never did anything close to this. The 3rd didn't speak at all until she was 3.(she will be 4 next month and now can't be quiet to save her life lol).  Is this normal? Or should I see a Dr for him or What? Thanks "
457,How to stop my 4-year-old from having tantrums at preschool?,"My 4-, soon to be 5-, year-old daughter has temper tantrums at preschool. She does  not have them for me and has not had them for me for the past couple of years. I never fed her temper tantrums. It took my husband longer to get the point, but thankfully she has quit having them for him as well.    The problem I have is that she is doing great academically. She can read, write some, color, spell, and some very basic math. Her preschool teacher insists she thinks she is on the autism spectrum due to her ""behavior problems"". They treat her temper tantrums like she can not control them. But she can and she does. My daughter does not like to do certain things. She does not like to color, but loves to play with crayons. Don't get me wrong, she can color and stay in the lines...but it is not her favorite activity. So, if she is required to color for an activity at school, she will throw a fit knowing full well she will get put in time out and get what she wants...she doesn't have to color.    My problem is that most people (teacher and other support staff) speak to me as though they feel the temper tantrums are my issue. I strongly disagree. She does not behave that way for me and I don't allow it. If she throws a fit for me I either speak very sternly to her and make clear the consequences (and I follow through every time) or I simply ignore her depending on the situation. The result is that she behaves for me.    What am I supposed to do about her throwing temper tantrums for others when I am not there? These are definitely temper tantrums and not meltdowns as she calms as soon as she gets what she wants...per teacher. Even when she did have them for me I could quickly get it to end.  I agree that temper tantrums in toddlers are often an indication of bad parenting...but what about bad teaching? I feel they are attributing her temper tantrums to something she can't control, when clearly she can.  "
458,How to preserve the daily extracted breast milk in freezer for a long time?,"Baby won't be with me for around 15 days.  Is it is safe to add fresh breast milk to already frozen breast milk? If not, then how to preserve the daily extracted breast milk in freezer for a long time assuming I don't wish to use 8 different vessels (8 times extraction) per day multiplied by 15 (number of days)? "
459,Are the probiotic bacteria from formula the same bacteria present in breast milk?,"Nestlé's infant formula contains probiotic bacteria. This formula is expensive, so I was wondering whether these bacteria are the same bacteria (which prevent infections and diseases) present in the breast milk?   Does my infant *need* these bacteria?  What is the required type of bacteria not present in the formula but present in breast milk? "

461,When can a toddler be taught that dropping unwanted food on the floor is unacceptable?,"Teaching a young toddler to eat solids can be challenging, particularly when they reach the stage where they want to control the feeding, and insist on feeding themselves.    It is also messy.  Lots of food ends up on my son, on me, on my wife, and on the floor.  Much of that is accidental.  At 15 months, my son does fairly well now putting food into his mouth (unless it is particularly slippery).  However, if he decides he no longer wants something that he has in his hand, his typical response is to drop it on the floor (it is almost never dropped on the table).  If he is walking with a snack, and decides he doesn't want it anymore (whether he's just tired of it, or sees something else he wants more, like his bottle), he will pause, and then carefully and deliberately drop it behind him.  If he has multiple pieces of food available to him, and decides he doesn't want them, he insists on pushing every single piece out of his immediate reach, usually by sweeping his arm across them or brushing vigorously with his hand.  He doesn't throw food, and there doesn't seem to be any element of defiance to his actions.  It is simply ""I'm done with this, so I'll drop it/move it away from me"".  Is he old enough to be taught that food should not be dropped on the floor?  We've tried telling him to put it on the table, and the few times he does put food down on the table, or on the plate, we've encouraged him with words, smiles, and clapping, but he doesn't seem to be showing any decrease in the ""drop on the floor"" behavior.  If he is old enough to be taught, what are some good techniques for teaching him? "
462,How long are sterilised bottles sterile for? And is there a way to keep them sterile for longer?,"I plan to go to an all day event 10am - 8pm and won't be able to sterilise bottles during the day. If I sterilise them in the morning, how long will I be able to use them for? If I put them in the fridge at the event, will they be considered sterile for longer? My baby will be 4 weeks old for this, if that makes a difference.  edit: to clarify, I am planning on taking empty bottles and filling them up from cartons when I am there. So I am talking about just the bottles, the milk is not a problem. "
463,Email and social media for pre-teens,"My daughter is 11 and I discovered that she had a Facebook account and a personal email account. These were two things my wife and I had told her she wasn't allowed to have. I felt she was still too young. When she was caught, she obviously offered up a bunch of lies and denials, and for this I have to ground her. My question is what happens after the grounding?  I work in IT, so I am not new to this kind of media or unaware of the dangers and issues it presents. I have full knowledge in how to lock down her devices and put content filtering in place or a whitelist of allowed services, but let's be honest, I can no more stop her than I could stop a tidal wave. I can restrict her access, lock down the computers, search her devices periodically, but there are still friends' houses and a multitude of other ways she could and will access this stuff. I would like to believe otherwise but it's just too prevalent in our society, and everyone she knows is doing the same.  I have to ask myself not what I would feel better about, but what is better for her personal development? Truth be told, the only thing I can really do is try and educate her on the dangers and allow the services. This seems to be the only real solution. Other solutions would only force her to be more secretive, and for us to be more draconian, and for what? How would that help her develop into a better person/adult?  Looking for some insight or suggestions on how to approach this issue from. How should I go about this? Again she will be grounded, harshly for lying and sneaking behind our backs, and it's not going to be enjoyable for her. However after the punishment I need a plan on what's best moving forward. "
464,"My toddler has started ""lying""","Recently, my almost two year old has started lying. It has taken us by a surprise; we are not sure if she means to lie, or if she doesn't understand what she is talking about. I'll give some examples...  The other day she was in a room by herself and I was just outside the room. No one else was around. All of a sudden I hear a thud followed by a cry. I checked on her; she had just fallen off a ball while trying to sit on it. Anyway, she wailed, ""[her older sister] pushed me."" Holding my laughter back, I calmly corrected her, ""No, [daughter], you just fell off.""   Then again, today, after her father gave her a bath and was trying to dry her, she came wailing to me, ""Dada hit me. [her older sister] hit me."" Nothing of the sort happened, she just wanted to run around wet instead of be dried. We both corrected her that no one hit her, that we just dried her.  I imagine that she is ""lying"" because well, at least in the first instance, she is used to only falling down because of her elder sister pushing her. So perhaps she thinks that she only falls when she is being pushed. No clue about the second one; maybe she feel that she needs a reason to cry? Not sure.  Has anyone run into this, if so, how did you deal with it? "
465,6 Year old son behavior problems at school and now at home,"My son is 6, 7 next month. He's having a lot of problems at school.   At the beginning of the year he was getting tallies and notes sent home because he was hitting, pushing, kicking other kids at school. When asked ""why"" it's always in response to something they had done. He has an excuse for everything, it's always someone else's fault.   Since then his teacher recommended the star chart and it worked so well that we started to use it for other problems he was having. We've used it for getting up out of his seat, blurting out, and more recently following directions.   Since returning to school after Christmas break his behavior has plummeted. He loses multiple stars everyday for things like, ""getting mad his pencil broke and threw the lead tip and hit another student"" to ""disrespectful to teachers"". His teacher called me the other day to tell me that he was so mad he had to pull a tally and lose a star that he started yelling that he hates school, he hates his family, everybody hates me etc. and wants him to speak to a counselor about his anger. He came home that day with a bruised forehead because he was so mad he tried to hurt himself.   His behavior at home is so up and down. One minute he's in a great mood, nice to his siblings, happy and playing. One thing will happen and he just goes off, screaming at his sister, hitting the dog, yelling that nobody likes him. Tonight we were playing a family game and after giving him multiple chances to play the right way we sent him to bed and he screamed and cried in his room for a good 20 minutes.   We explain to him and explain to him until we're blue in the face that we love him but he cannot act this way. We've made charts at home for rewards based his behavior and he still can't seem to make good decisions, and just get's mad all over again when he hasn't earned a reward. He's extremely intelligent and get's good grades at school, but he's also extremely emotional and once he get's set off it seems to ruin the rest of his day.   Could it be ADHD? Does he have emotional problems? I don't want to put him on medicine but I just don't know what to do. "
466,Does a heavy diet increase milk production quantity?,"I mean if I keep on eating food every two hours, will I produce more milk? OR If I eat less food will the milk supply decrease?  Actually, I am a thin girlie with very low appetite (height: 5 feet 5 cm' weight: 52 KG), so I was wondering if my quantity of food intake might be one of the reasons of low milk production? "
467,How to prepare a two year old for international relocation,"We are going to relocate to a different country in summer with our daughter who is going to be 2.5 then.   I found this question but our situation is different and the answer does not apply.   Ours is going to be an international move. Language is not going to be an issue but the accent will be a lot different. My daughter is going to a creche here and she loves her teachers and has good friends among the other children. I know »friendship« might be a bit strong a word at that age, but during closure last summer, when she was only 1.5, she kept talking about four or five of her friends for the entire four weeks. My wife and I are used to (international) relocations, so while it still is going to be stressful, we at least know what we're in for – However, it is the first move with a child.  How can we help our daughter to cope?    How can we prepare her before the move? How can we help her during the move when everything is away in boxes? How can we make settling in easy?   I would also be interested in »lessons learned« in case someone has done this before. "
468,What's the problem with potty humor?,"I have two sons, ages six and eight. They're both at an age where potty humor (jokes about bodily functions, to put it politely) are the funniest thing in the world.  I know that here in North America we generally discourage this kind of behavior in our kids. So that got me thinking: why do we do this?  The only reason I can come up with is that it will make some people who overhear it uncomfortable, which I can understand and which is not a bad reason for refraining from making jokes like this.  Are there other reasons for this that I'm overlooking?  EDIT In order to address the suggested closure reason (Off Topic) from @Becuzz, I offer the following explanation...  The question posed here is not     why does society frown on this type of humor?   The question intended is actually     Society tells me that I should parent in a certain way (ie. by discouraging potty humor). Please explain the reasons behind this social norm so that I can evaluate it and determine if I wish to follow it.   This is a rule that others (people around me in society) have told me I should be imposing on my children. I prefer not to blindly accept rules like this - I want to understand the reasons behind them in order to determine if they are acceptable to me and my family. "
469,Raising a tri-lingual child,"I can speak A, B and C, my wife B and C. We live in a B speaking country.  We want our daughter to learn all 3 languages, so we've decided that :   I speak to her in A my wife speaks to her in C My wife and I communicate in B   My daughter also goes to daycare every other day, where they speak B.  Does this strategy have any big flaw ? Will that be enough for her to learn B ?  Also, what should I do if she doesn't answer in the language she is supposed to (ie I speak to her in A, and she answers me in C) ? Should I correct her ? "
470,How can we convince our son to take his pants off to sit on the potty?,"My son (who is turning 3) has his own potty, and is quite content to sit on it, sing his ""potty song"", stand up, and ""flush"" (it's a plastic training potty that plays a sound when you pull the lever).    However, he will generally only sit on the potty fully clothed.  If we ask him if he'd like to take his pants off to sit on the potty, he'll politely say ""no thank you"".  He has allowed us to take his pants off for the potty a handful of times, and he apparently takes his pants off to sit on the potty at daycare (he's actually urinated in the potty properly once at daycare).    We offer him treats (M&amp;M's candy), and have told him that he can have a pet fish once he's fully potty trained.  We explain to him that he can only have the treats if he actually pees or poops in the potty, and that he has to take his pants and diaper off to do that.  He also understands that the fish is a long-term goal, and won't happen until he stops wearing diapers altogether.  This has been going on for 3-4 months now, with no apparent progress (aside from the single successful use of the potty at daycare, about a month ago).  We've taken the approach of using treats as incentive to be consistent with what happens at daycare, because quite frankly his daycare provider has had more success than we have had.  Is there anything we should be doing differently, or that we can add to our approach, to help our son be willing to move forward?  Or should we just wait until he's ready? "

473,Should I be concerned about my 1-year-old and her mother moving in with a man I've never met?,"About 8 months ago, I and the mother of my 1-year-old child separated. Everything was mutual and amicable and we have a reasonably good relationship now - if a bit awkward.  This weekend, when I returned my daughter to her mother, she told me that she's moving in with her boyfriend (of 3 months or so). I have a couple of concerns about this however.   Her new boyfriend is (I'm told) a policeman, and so theoretically is safe to be around children. I don't know this man (even his name) and I feel like I ought to if my daughter is living with him and at least be able to verify his identity. Whilst I can't dictate how quickly their relationship moves along, I'm concerned that my child's mother has moved in with her new boyfriend so quickly so that she can leave her mother's house. I'm concerned about my child being exposed to someone that she gets used to only for them to break up.   Are my concerns valid? Should and how should I address them? "
474,"When a baby cries, should we speak to it?","My&nbsp;baby girl is 30 days old; she can not talk or comprehend language yet.  When she cries, does it help to comfort her by talking to her? Or might our voices irritate her even more?    Update: I and my wife keep talking to my baby girl when she cries, it comforts her in some way. "
475,How do I get my 4 month old to nap longer than 15 mins,"I can't seem to get my 4 month old boy to settle in his cot for naps. I have had to feed him to sleep, hold him for a while and then transistion him to his cot - in which he would just wake up 15 mins later screaming. Most of the time it's because he needs to burp (I do try to burp him and also feed him in an upright position to minimise burps).   Note: Night times are ok. I do feed to sleep and he wakes a couple of times (before I go to bed) to burp but at some point he just goes to sleep on my breast and I put him in his cot and he wakes either twice, once or not until morning for a feed.   I have ended up for months just holding him while he sleeps because id prefer him to nap and get quality sleep than to just have a total of 45 mins to 1.5hrs a day across his 3 naps.   I tried CIO today without a feed before hand - following the eat, play, sleep routine. First nap he cried for 2 hours and I really wanted to follow my sleep schedule so I got him out of his cot at the time he's supposed to be up - fed and played with him. He seemed happy but I knew he was tired.   Second nap was the same. Screamed when I put him down (rocking doesn't work with this kid) and he cried for 1hr 10 mins before I needed to pick him up because my 2 year old son was also trying to nap. I ended up feeding him and he napped for 30mins before needing a burp. Putting him back in this cot resulted in more screaming.   Third nap he was rubbing his eyes so I put him down in his cot straight away and he screamed until it was bath time. 1.5 hrs later.   Without feeding him, how do I get him to settle himself even when he's hysterical? I have picked him up and soothed him a couple of times but he just smiles at me. I've tried patting but he just cries, I've tried white noise and he doesn't care. Should I just continue the CIO even though he's taking hours and still not remotely close to falling asleep? i know I've only done it for one day but it just seems like he's not going to give in.   Any help would be fantastic.   Sarah.  "
476,How to teach the importance of being considerate?,I am having difficulty showing and explaining how to be considerate and thoughtful of other's feelings.  How can I teach a child to be consciously thoughtful and observant of other people?  Or   What are the problems of being inconsiderate to others? 
477,I need a Bi-lingual strategy for my 3yr old,"I'm a native english-speaker. My wife is bi-lingual.  She speaks only Spanish to our son, and only english with me.  I made the mistake to choose to speak spanish to him only because it sounded 'warmer' and he understood it more.   Next month he will start kindergarten only in english.  He also watches a ton of youtube videos all in english.  Should i just start speaking 100% english to him right now? what else can i do to bring him up to speed so he is equally strong in both.. lets say 1 year from now?  thanks!  I forgot to mention that we live in Argentina! "
478,Am I wrong in what I did? Locking a door on a screaming toddler at bed time!,"Our first son would cry every night for my wife to come lay with him to go to sleep.  At 3 years old, it continued.....every night.  My son would be put to bed and he would start his whine - ""Mommy, come lay with me....Mommy, come lay with me.... "" (this was after we spent the time reading a good night story to him)  It was now at the point (a 1.5 years of EVERY NIGHT) where I had to get up and go to his room and tell him he needed to go to sleep and mommy was not going to come lay with him.   I told him if he did not stop his crying, I was going to close the door.  He did not stop his crying - so I closed the door.  He then got up and opened the door and started the whole ""good night crying program"" once again.  I of course went back and closed the door - he got up and started again.     So, I did what I could to lock the door (a friend of mine told me that he had to lock his son in his room in order to break this bad bedtime crying habit).  I did not have a door on his room that was lockable from the outside - so I tied a series of neckties from the doorknob over to another doorknob. My plan was not to leave him locked in the room all night long - but to get him into an understanding of what sleep-time is supposed to be....Sleep Training - right?  Well, my 3 year old son went out of his mind throwing books and everything he could get his hands on around the room.   My wife felt that this was very cruel and eventually gave in. She continued to get beckoned to his room every night so my son could twiddle her hair in one hand while he had his other hand's thumb in his mouth.  I did not think that this was cruel; however, my wife, 14 years later, is still bothered my this. Can someone kindly offer their thoughts?  "
479,How to deal with a preteen's sudden unhealthy obsession?,"Say a preteen girl is going through an unhealthy obsession. I know many people go through a phase of extreme obsession with something at some point, whether it's with a celebrity, a school crush, a band, etc, but it almost always subsides eventually. Picture a little girl obsessed with Justin Bieber, to the point that she is neglecting other parts of her life, such schoolwork and spending time with friends, because all she does is listen to his music and read about him.  What's the best way to deal with something like this? If I discourage it, that might just make it cooler, ""forbidden fruit"", or at least drive the two of us apart. Is it better to encourage it, and just try to make the obsession run its course as quickly as possible? Is it true that ""the only way out is through""? "
480,Are there any dangers or downsides to white noise as a calming tool,"We find white nose to be extremely effective for soothing our 5-week old son. Loud white noise (60 decibels or so) will help soothe him when he is overtired and crying, and if we play soft white noise (40-50 db) near him as he sleeps he is much less likely to fully wake himself up when he stirs.  But I have a few concerns:   Will hours of white noise a day cause hearing damage? We make sure that sustained volumes are always less than 60db which is below any level for hearing damage, but the temptation is to have it going whenever he is asleep and I can't find any data if long term, low volume of a constant sound can be detrimental to an infant's hearing. Will this become a crutch he will need to get to sleep even when he's much older? On one level that wouldn't be so bad since it is extremely easy to provide (just flip on an iPhone app). But I'd hate to make things more difficult for us down the line.   Anyone with experience or knowledge on this? The only study I could find exposed rats to 24/7 noise and predictably it delays their ability to recognize other sounds. But we obviously don't use it even close to constantly. "
481,How do I teach patience to my 7 year old son?,"I want to teach patience to my son. How do I teach him?  He always wants things done NOW. If I tell him that we will go to a restaurant at night, as soon as I am back from office in the evening, he will keep on demanding that we go to the restaurant. Even when I tell him there's still 2 hours remaining, he will keep on asking me every 10 min whether we can go there.  Even when we go to a places in car, which let's say is 3-4 hours drive, he will not have patience to sit and wait. Every now and then he will keep on asking when ""are we there?""  So, I think he needs learn being patient.   Anyone who can help in this regards is much appreciated. "
482,Can a toddler spend too much time with books?,"Back when we were still expecting our son to be born, we were told all about how important it was to read to our son, even before he was born.  Being avid readers ourselves, my wife and I felt this was a good idea.  We read to him daily, both before he was born and after.  Now, at 16 months, it is firmly a part of his daily routine.  However, I'm starting to wonder if it is perhaps too much of a part of his routine.    The first thing he does in the morning after eating is to ask for a book.  He wants us to read to him constantly.  While he does play with his other toys, books are his clear favorite.  Its not uncommon for him to ask that the same book be read to him 7 or 8 times in a row.  He gets plenty of physical exercise, and I don't believe he spends too much time reading during daycare on the weekdays, but it seems like as much as 50% of our direct interaction with him may involve reading to him.    Beyond our own patience and tolerance, is there a point at which we should say ""no more books; go and play with your other toys""?  Can too much focus on books interfere with his development of other skills?  If so, how do you tell when you are reaching that point? "
483,How do I get my one year old to stop grinding her teeth?,"My daughter is thirteen months old and has four teeth on top and two on the bottom. She is constantly grinding them against each other, which is not only bad for her, but also makes a sound that makes my skin crawl.   I've tried grasping her firmly and saying NO very sternly, but she only giggles and keeps on. I also tried flicking her on the nose once, which made her cry for about 5 minutes before she started again.  Does anyone have any tricks or ideas?? "
484,"How do I handle a 10 year old girl ""in love""?",I just found out that my daughter wrote in her diary that she loves a boy - and she is only 10 years old.   How do I deal with the situation? How do I discipline her? 
485,What is an ideal age duration for a permanent bonding to happen between parents and child?,"My brother (age: 37) is least attached to our parents. At the time of his birth, our parents had left him with our grandmother. He saw our parents, for the first time, at the age of 3 years. He has lived with them after that till his high school.  Could that be one of the reasons for detachment? What is an ideal age duration for a permanent bonding to happen between the parents and their children? "
486,How do I prepare my preschooler for a move?,I am a parent of a 3 year old. We have a second child due at the end of April. In order to make room for then new baby we are moving at the end of this month.   How do I prepare my preschooler for the transition? We have already started talking to him about it and took him past the new house yesterday.   We have a few days between our close date and our move date so one of the things we are going to do is show him his new room and the rest of the house so he is more comfortable with the surroundings we are going to be living in.  What are some things to keep in mind when moving a preschooler for the first time and what kinds of things should we do to help him prepare better for an easy transition? 
487,How do I find out who the bully is?,"So my kindergartner came home with some scratches that I'm 99% sure could not have been self inflicted.   They are at the wrong angle and too deep - I tried to do it to myself and I couldn't and I'd hurt too much to continue. They are also staggered in a half moon at the start and the end of the the scratches. The half moon is the right size for one of her classmates so I'm not worried about an adult being the cause.  When queried about this last night she initially identified someone who has been a social bullying problem in the recent past. Part way though our discussion, she changed her story and said it was self inflicted. And then she flipped back again.   Today we talked to the caregivers. The accused denies it.  None of the adults in her care noticed it happen, but there was an argument with the accused yesterday.  Now this evening she's recanted again, but has also indicated she is afraid of getting someone in trouble.  If the accused didn't it do it, someone else must have. Any suggestions on how to get the info out of her? Or is the well poisoned? "
488,How do we prepare for a long car journey with a 2-month-old?,"Is there anything specific to think about when planning a long car journey (12 hours with an overnight stop) with a 2-month-old? I guess one of the issues is whether one of the adults stays in the back with the baby, or whether both being up front is ok? We would make sure we stop regularly of course.  "
489,Should we roll our baby back onto his back so he can sleep?,"Our baby's new trick is rolling onto his tummy. Unfortunately, he hasn't quite figured out how to get back to his back. He remains beached until we flip him.  The problem is, he doesn't nap because he's too busy getting stuck.  Any ideas? Do we let him cry it out until he learns to sleep on his tummy? Or do we keep flipping him until he figures it out? "
490,"Allowing freedom of choice to toddler/preschooler isn't working, what next?","I've read a lot about giving children the freedom to choose between acceptable choices, to make them feel like they have some control over things and hence reduce tantrums. And I was pretty convinced by its effectiveness.   Until my 3.5 years old nephew was offered a choice between A, B and C, and he immediately chose D. Cue tantrum, because his mother couldn't/wouldn't allow for it. Here are all the variables in the scene:   He'd been coughing for a long time, so his mum decided it was time to use the inhaler mask. He resisted like he always does, so she offered him the choice : ""who gets to hold the mask to your face - you can choose between me, dad, and aunt"". He immediately says nobody. Mom offers, ""So do you mean to do it yourself?"" And he explains, ""NO!! I said nobody!"". (I may be imagining it, but he said it with a smirk so he knows this is a way out and is using it well) That wasn't an option, of course and it blew into a tantrum. Not using the inhaler mask ""to show him the consequences"" wasn't an option. He'll cough his throat dry, but still won't realize he needs it or ask for it himself. They've only recently started the choice system, somewhere after his 3rd birthday. Before that, they just used to tell him he's got to do {stuff}, he'd say no, they'd reiterate the same thing, he'd still say no and so on. His parents have always had to plead, distract, trick, and scold him into doing anything and almost always takes a LOT of time. He's generally a stubborn kid who has the toughest time transitioning from one activity to another.   There has been at least one other time where giving him a choice didn't work. It was about having to go out and getting to choose a shirt. Is he too old for the choice system? Did they start too late? Why isn't it working?   And what should the parent do when the child insists on an option that wasn't offered? We can say that's not allowed and all that, but how do we avoid a tantrum while we're denying the child his choice? "
491,How to choose a psychologist to do a psychoeducational assessment?,"I am trying to choose a psychologist to do a psychoeducational assessment of an 8 year old with no diagnosis but with attention issues.  I have received a dozen or so glowing recommendations from parents and a small number from the child's school, but I do not trust most of them because when I check out the clinicians I find some are not licensed, some are not members of the American Psychological Assn or the state psych association, and others have web pages that feature therapeutic approaches that are panned in published reviews of the literature.  Also, some are not on the list of approved vendors of my insurance.  In my search, I will focus on the few remaining names and the names on the approved list of providers.  I would like to get some information from the psychologists to help me choose one.  What questions might I reasonably ask a clinician to get relevant information to make a decision? What might I look for?  Or how else might I go about choosing such a psychologist?  Addendum: I am looking carefully at what I can find about the clinicians.  The dissertation abstract from one is available online.  It contains illogical phrases (or simply grammatical errors).  Carelessness in preparing a dissertation makes me worry about the level of professionalism of this clinician.  Addendum 2: I have researched the first 30 or Ph.D. psychologists listed in the approved providers booklet (out of a total of about 150).  So far 2 seem like they might be appropriate.  In addition to the reasons above, I found listings of the specialty areas or interests for some of the clinicians and their interests are not relevant. "
492,Is it required or advised to sterilize bottles?,So we've been sterilizing our bottles with a microwave steam bottle sterilizer. Is this at all required? What risks might exist if we don't bother? 
493,How can we prevent crying when a parent leaves for work?,"Sometimes a parent (usually Dad) spends time with the 2- to 4-year old child before leaving for work.  However, after leaving, sometimes, the child cries nonstop (1 to 2 hours).  Everything you offer during this period is refused, and there is a fixation on (whoever left).  What are some ways to handle this situation, knowing that favorite toys (even new, stocked up toys) etc. are refused?  Is it better for Daddy to leave in the morning without being seen? "
494,How do you teach a 1 year old to stop biting people?,"I have a friend with a one year old that bites people, maybe as a sign of affection, but doesn't know that it hurts others. How can his parents discipline him regarding this behavior? Do you try to show him that his actions actually hurt others? "
495,Do diapers have any effect on the shape of legs?,"we were advised by a friend to let my newborn daughter, sleep without any diaper at night, claiming it has a bad effect on the shape of her legs wearing them the whole time.   It seems plausible since with diapers she has to hold her legs apart all the time. I did some searches and could not find a valid source to assure me. If it indeed hurts the baby, how can I avoid the harm? and how long without diapers is enough? I already know about the diaper rash and let her have some minutes of free air every time I change her which seems to be working just fine.  "
496,How should we support 16 year old step sister who ran away from home,"We're in Canada, if that's relevant.  My partner and I live by ourselves (late 20's), and my partner's 16 year old step-sister has recently fled an emotionally abusive home life (no physical abuse so far as we can tell). Because there's no physical abuse, we're finding it much harder to determine how we should evaluate the situation - damage is much less tangible.   How can we, as outsiders, tell how much emotional abuse is ""too much"", to the point where it's beneficial for a teenager to be removed from their parents? Is it appropriate to react to this situation by offering to host her while she figures things out? Are there best practices or guidelines for what to do when on the receiving end of a runaway?  What factors should be considered when deciding whether we should support her independence, try and push her and her parents back together, or try to stay as neutral as possible in everything?  Edit: While previously on friendly terms with the parents, they've gone somewhat ""off the rails"" now and lashed out at anyone who has contact with their daughter. They follow her friends on social media (she's blocked them), hunting for untagged pictures, and wait outside her school to find out where she's staying etc. I would be hesitant to try and confront the parents about the situation and try and have a reasoned discussion, as they're unstable enough to fall into ""scary"" territory.  Update: For anyone who happens upon this, I figured it was worth updating how it played out. Roughly 2 years on:   Step sister was reasonably well prepared to run away, as much as a 16 year old could be. She stayed with her biological sister for a short time but the sister was not in a position to support the step-sister (same family, similar situation, also ran away when she was younger) We hosted the step sister for just over a year Her parents went a bit more crazy, abusing each other, threatening to show up at our house and take her back, nothing actually happened though (we got a heads up they were on their way over, so we left and locked all the doors, no idea if they actually showed up) Entire side of the family cut us off, which was difficult for my partner but easier when it was so obvious who the terrible people were Eventually it came out that there was some physical abuse, but ""not that bad"" (not downplaying physical abuse, just saying the step sister considered the emotional abuse to be more impactful, which says a lot...) My partner helped step-sister get settled, got all the needed ID (parents held it hostage), got a driver's license, etc. Step-sister did a few therapy sessions, but was not eager enough to continue on her own Step sister graduated high school (yay!) and did a year of university in a program that supports those who don't really have the skills or knowledge to be in university. This was a personal goal of step-sister. As you might imagine, university went terribly. No study skills, too much life to live out from under oppressive parents Now she's mostly living a mundane adult life - job, boyfriend, friends, etc.  "
497,Is early education for 2-3 year olds worth it?,"Background: My parents only put me (and all my 3 siblings) in a school when each of us were 5 years old. We turned out fine and I assumed it's the normal thing to do. Now I and my wife have a 2 years old, and see other families with children similar age already trying to find schools for their kids to go to. I'm confused, what's with the rush?  So my question is, what important benefits are there from sending your kids to a school in an early age? Are they worth the investment? (e.g. your and your kid's time &amp; effort, reduced flexibility due to the commitment and schedule). Can the benefits be obtained elsewhere or when the child is a little older?  "
498,When is the right time to tell my daughter she's not my biological child?,"To try to keep the story short... I got divorced almost 4 yrs ago and I have a 11, 12 &amp; 15 yr old.  Now I had my suspicions, but I guess I wanted to look the other way and not find out whether it was real or not.  Going through the divorce I found out that my 12 yr old (middle child) was not my biological child. That of course broke my heart, but I was more upset about what it was going to do to her when she found out. In a way I decided not to say anything. Every now and then my daughter asks ""you do that?"" and then says ""I must of have gotten that from you"". Recently she had a seizure and when the doctor asked about family history the ex-wife was quick to say no history of seizures. All of that got me thinking if I was doing the right thing, I'm trying to protect my 3 kids from the heart break, she just trying to protect herself.   What are your thoughts?  "
499,How do I explain to a 4 year old that our family pet is sick and needs to be put down?,"My son loves our 9 year old cat very much.  The cat was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer a couple of months ago, and has reached the point where we will soon need to make arrangements to put the cat down and end its suffering.  My son doesn't know that the cat is terminally ill, he just knows that the cat isn't feeling well.  How do I talk to him out what is going to happen?  Do I tell him before so he can say goodbye, or do I tell him after so he won't worry?  How do I do this without him worrying that anytime he (or anyone else) gets sick, he might die?  UPDATE:  The day came when we finally had to put our family pet down. My wife and I prepared our son by telling him about two days in advance that our cat was very sick (which he already knew), and that he could pass away very soon (which he didn't know).  I emphasized that he should spend some time saying goodbye to our cat and bringing him any comfort he can. My wife and I did not tell him that we were going to euthanize the cat.  We sent him to play at his grandparents house (who he frequently sees and spends time with anyway, so nothing would strike him as unusual about this) the day we euthanized our pet. When it was over, we called him and told him that he had to come home because our cat had died. We let him see and pet the body. We also let him see me bury the body in the backyard, where we all said a few nice words and shed some tears.  My son asked a few questions (will our cat be in heaven, etc.), but didn't seem to take the situation too hard.  All things considered, I think the way my wife and I handled the situation worked out fine. Thanks for all your help! "
500,How can I help my 14-year-old daughter be less angry?,"My daughter is 14. She is usually very good and not hard to cope with, but sometimes she gets very angry.  For example, when I take away her phone, or her sisters use her belongings, or she can't do her homework, or play the right notes on her piano song, she will get mad -- throwing things, shouting, crying, trying to break everything.  This happens every time she gets upset. She seems too old to be doing this. When she goes in these moods, how do I manage her and get her to calm down? Will she grow out of this? "

503,"Non-alcoholic treatment, medicines, or remedies for infant colic","Our baby is suffering from colic.  The doctor prescribed some medicines which contained alcohol along with the active volatile ingrediants like dill oil, cardamon oil, etc. Is there a proven and effective way (preferably a home remedy) to treat colic in a one month old infant?

504,How would a child view a move based on materialism?,"I am a husband who has been married for the last 9 years and have 3 daughters (7,3,1). Recently I told my wife that I want to move to another state because my new job lets me work remotely and the state we are in now has killer property taxes and cost of living (because it's so close to NYC, and I no longer need to be).   ""We can find a much nicer house with warmer weather and pay much less for it,"" I said to my wife.  She however is reluctant to move because her extended family is here. My first daughter is also siding with Mom because her friends and grandparents are here. And she grew up in this house.  Now suddenly I am the bad guy who is putting money and a bigger house over family and friends. So the parenting side of this dilemma is what impact will this move have on my daughter if I go through with it? What will it teach her about what are our priories in life?  Just the talk of moving right now brings tears to her eyes. Should I call it off for her (and for my wife of course)? "
505,Are these videos too instense for a baby (10 months),"I usually watch one or two videos a day with my 10 month old baby, they show someone playing the piano and the notes ""falling"" into the keyboard, guitar hero like, this is a sample (that one is the most vivid, other pieces are more quiet).  He seems to enjoy it (and gets a bit sleepy), but I'm concerned that it may be dangerous in some way (for his eyes, his brain, etc).

For example, if it is readily apparent that your child doesn't like her grandmother, even if the child doesn't verbalize it what should the parent do?  What if a relative (the same or another) doesn't like your child? How do you foster the idea that a child must not allow her feelings to create a lack of respect for the relative, for example when the relative is leaving the house the child must say goodbye in an appropriate way.

508,How to make a teen stop vaping?,"I have a 16-year-old daughter. She is vaping a nicotine product. I know that, because I found liquid nicotine and a vaping pipe in her room twice and smelled it in her room once. I don't believe she vapes regularly.  We talked about it after the first two times and she promised not to do it again. However, talking about health and so on is not working. She said vaping has helped her relax. She seems to be anxious and unhappy with school also.  How to approach the matter for the third time? What should the consequences of her behavior be? "
509,"What are some good games, books (or any suggestions) to teach my 10 year old more patience and persistence?","My 10 year old gets frustrated very easily. When I ask her if she'd like help or suggestions she says ""no!"". She'll often become angry and then give up. I have some of these tendencies (except being so hard on myself). I think it's  combination of :   She's actually quite talented at things an thus has not had to learn persistence. (Her twin sister has always had to work just a bit more at learning physical things and is quite tolerant of failure). (I think she gets that from her mom, who, as a child only pursued things she was talented at.) Is intolerant of failure, feels that it's an indictment of her. Very focused on the outcome not the process even if it's something she enjoys. (""Am I done yet?"")    I've tried:   Asking if she wants hints, suggestions, help, or me to do it for her. I try very hard to take her lead and stand back (even letting her fail) if she so desires. That would be fine except that she gets made (not very adaptive behavior) Telling her to take a break (starting by asking, but demanding a break if she starts breaking things or gets abusive toward someone helping her) letting her know she deserves a rest. Asking her to write down (or video taping) her feelings about the frustration and subsequent solving of the problem so she can develop the confidence that she will be able to accomplish the task.  Pointing out the few problems (worth solving) are solved with the first attempt. I've shown her the various editions of the company catalog I create every year or two, showing her the first one (from 1997) and how awful it is but that it got better each year. Got her the Lego Mindstorms she's wanted for over a year (for xmas) (after letting her test it out @ a friend's house, where she was remarkably patient). She hasn't played with it much. (I'm going to help her (as much as she wants) this weekend again).   I'm thinking that some fun game to teach her patience would be a good option.  Any suggestions? "
510,At what age or developmental milestones is it safe to leave children unattended?,"I'm curious what kind of criteria others are using to decide when a child can be left at home unattended for a period of time.  I realize that the answer is going to depend on a few factors: The child's safety awareness and knowledge of what to do in a particular situation; their age; their maturity level; how long you intend to be gone; how far you're going; etc.  For a more concrete example: My daughter is 7-1/2, knows right from wrong, how to use a phone, our phone numbers, 911 (US emergency services number), not to answer the door unless we ask her to, not to mess with the stove, etc.  Is it conceivable that she's old enough to stay home alone for relatively short intervals?  We'd have to start with very short (5-10 minutes) intervals until both our and her confidence were built up, but I think she should be able to gain the confidence to be left home for longer than that.  I don't think she's old (or mature) enough to be left in charge of her younger siblings yet, but she could entertain herself and stay out of trouble.  Edit:  This is about children taking early steps towards independence at home.  I know that when I was a teenager, my parents left me at home alone while they went shopping (which can be an all-day event with my mother :-) ) or even spent a weekend away.  They trusted that both the house and I would be in one piece when they came home.  But those weren't my first times being left at home alone -- this question is about the first steps one takes towards that level of independence.  When is the right time to start?  What are you looking for in your children that makes you think: ""They're ready to begin this particular journey?"" "
511,Does my toddler have night terrors or anything else?,"My daughter is 2 years and 7 months old. Sometimes at night, she starts crying badly during sleep and wakes up, but does not stop crying. She calls me mama mama and when I hold her she never stops crying as if she had severe pain in her body. Then she wants to go to her father, but doesn't stop crying.   We offer many things, but she does not want to take anything at that time. We ask about pain, but she doesn't reply, just cries badly. We ask her if she was scared? But she doesn't respond. After 15 to 30 mins or more she stops by herself and sleeps. It happens almost every month. I am worried about her.   Is this normal or not? "
512,What are risks and benefits of using a helmet to mold our baby's head?,"We took our healthy daughter for her 4-month checkup and half-jokingly asked the doctor whether we should be concerned about the fact her head is a bit misshapen.  It is fairly round in the back left but the back right is noticeably flatter.  To our surprise, she referred us to a cranial plastic surgeon for their opinion and so that we can ""be presented with our options while its still early enough to do something""... with the most likely option being a special helmet that helps her skull to grow evenly.  We have the follow-up appointment next week where I'm hoping to get answers to these and other questions, but we'd love to hear answers from anyone else that has heard of this:   Any risks to be aware of? How common is this sort of thing? Is there any reason to use the helmet other than cosmetic reasons? Will my daughter resent us for not getting the helmet for her if she has a misshapen head later in life?  "
513,How do I decide if a particular program online is a good and safe place for kids and whether or not to pay for membership to programs that require it?,"My nephew (10yo) has approached us about playing AnimalJam and while I see it's sponsored by National Geographic Kids, I'm curious what the safety content of the game is. By that I mean both predatory users (we are talking about online worlds) and child-interactivity (so that would be bullying, aggressive game-play, etc). Is the play world moderated and under surveillance (so to speak) on a regular basis?   What are the positive values that would encourage me to pay for a membership? I know that there is something of ""accumulating things, unlocking new characters for play"" and the like, it's gamification, we use that here, plus DLC. I'm fine with those things, I just want to make sure that it seems a reasonable investment. He has only been playing this game for a few days, but apparently several of the girls in his class have been playing it too.  As for parental monitoring, I .. was merely asked to vet the game, and do not know if he will be playing this in the vicinity of parents or not.  I'd like to know about animal jam in particular, but knowing how to figure these things out in general might also be helpful. "
514,Our baby prefers to turn to one side over the other - should we be concerned about symmetry?,"Our baby is now close to 6 weeks old and likes to turn the head to the left - while being held in a carrier, sleeping on my chest, or while lying on the back and looking around.  A friend said that this habit could potentially cause the development of an asymmetric posture / skeleton / muscles therefore we should encourage turning to the right to be even.   Is this a valid concern? How could we encourage turning to the other side? "
515,Teenagers Ogling my Daughter. What to do?,"As summer has arrived, my teenage daughter begins to wear shorts of reasonable length.  What should I do when teenage boys around her age ogles at her?  Should I ask them to stop or let them be?  I must admit I did ogle at other girls when I was their age "
516,Formal curriculum for infants first few years?,"In the context of independent behavioral, developmental and psychology fields (regarding people of any age), there appears  common revelation about the first few years of life... and their impact on the rest of it.  For example, in the context of speech pathology:     The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders   has estimated that about 6 to 8 million people—children and   adults—have some form of language impairment. It is believed that the   first 6 months of life are most crucial to a child’s development of language skills prior to school age [1].   or in the context of learning abilities:     The emotional, social and physical development of young children has a   direct effect on their overall development and on the adult they will   become. That is why understanding the need to invest in very young   children is so important, so as to maximize their future   well-being [2].   What arises over and over is a deep call to action for parents/communities - to deliberately shape these years.   Questions:   Is this call to action happening? Besides reading articles at random as they become available (for example: [website]Is there any type of formal or worked out curriculum based on age, for daily activities that could be practiced by infants? (For example, at 6 moths exposure to music, then at age 1.5 begin story telling, etc?) Is there any type of formal setting (i.e. pre ""pre-school"") that addresses this time period and it's needs?  "
517,Autistic child constantly mobbed by other children - what can be done?,"The autistic child (Asperger Syndrome, age: 12) is constantly mobbed by other children, both in school and on the way home. It includes calling him names, mocking, showing faces, pushing, threatening, taking off his things (such as a cap or gloves in winter), planting feet etc. It seems that the children have developed even a custom code of mobbing, with nuanced behaviors that are not considered offensive by others, such as using special faces or special words, so the poor boy is bullied even in front of adults (teachers). Bullying usually causes in him outbursts of aggression, which include cursing and throwing things (he has once thrown a chair out of a window at school). The teachers are already prejudiced against him, considering him to be aggressive and harsh-languaged.   What measures can be taken in that case to teach this child to control the aggression? It is quite obvious that the other kids are bullying him not for the sake of bullying, but because of his outbursts of aggression, which are very funny for them.   However, such repetitive mobbing has made very deep behavioral changes, and Asperger's makes things worse, because the answers from How to respond if my child is picked on by other children? are virtually useless in that case, for example building self-confidence relying on social background (friends) or trying to understand other people's motives.  "
518,Toddler scared since last night,"Our son suddenly started to panic last night and saying there is a owl on the wall. He turned 3 yesterday. What he was pointing to was shadow of wall by the light coming from outside. He was too scared and we have to turn him around to make him fall asleep but I could see him sleeping scared in morning.  Now he is crying after seeing floodlight outside of house turn auto on when someone crosses.  What is happening and how can we help him?  (side note: I have phobia of bathroom which haven't gone away, can it can be that he got it as well but in other form?) "
519,Air in the stomach,"We got premature twins that have a tube connected to their stomach. We use the tube to control the digestion and sometimes to feed them. When we suck the food from the stomach to see how much did they digest often a lot of air is coming out. Should we put the air to the stomach together with the food?  In other words, is air in the stomach a right thing? "
520,"Too many variables at play -- troubled ""son""","So, here's the story.  My ex-girlfriend, whom I have an 11 year old son with, had a son before ours with a man who has never seen his son past the age of one. He's now 16. He grew up a generally happy kid (ADHD, but still very bright). But, circumstances that I'm not privy to knowing in the past year, had it so that he stopped taking his medication, he got into some trouble with police, and generally his mother absolutely hates him, doesn't trust him, had the police arrest him, and had a police-assigned psychiatrist come to the conclusion, in a couple hours, that he was also a sociopath. Apparently, he shot his brother, from a distance, with a BB gun.  So, he went to stay with his 85 year old grandma for about 3 months. As you can well imagine, grandma wasn't equipped to raise a child in today's day and age. He stopped going to school, and was very angry all the time. Grandma had had enough.  So my wife and I offered to take him. So that he would at least pass high school, and generally aimed toward his career choice.  That was since January 2013. Now, September, he's doing pretty alright. However, I still have some concerns:   I'm not able to get him to consistently call us to tell us where he is, even though I provided him the cell phone (but, he does respond 95% of the time when we txt him to ask where he is) He frequently stays out late... 10:00pm~11:00pm on a school night, is that still late? He is seldom home for dinner, and when he does get home (late), he eats quite a bit often skips a class or two at school, never the whole day, just a class. And not really the whole class... he goes on time, but tends to leave in the middle of class. Teachers mark him absent for this.   He is most definitely NOT a sociopath, he feels bad for things he does, apologizes for things,  does things to help around the house sometimes without being asked, and doesn't feel sour when he doesn't get what he wants. He had smoked a lot of marijuana, until I convinced him the consequences of letting this drug become a lifestyle. In absence of his ADHD medication (which he fears, because mom had over-medicated him), he says the pot helps calm his nerves. So, I permit it... never in the house, and again, don't let it become a lifestyle. Once in a while, on the weekend, sure. But Don't let it become a lifestyle.  I used to tell myself, ""we just need him to graduate. once that happens, he can be on his own, do what he wants, and it's not under my jurisdiction."" So I've been providing him a safe and clean place to stay, dinner and breakfast and such, and basically to live with us so he doesn't have to live with his grandma, or try to reconcile with his mother (who, by the way, won't give me guardianship because she fears it will hurt her claim on back-pay of child support from his birth father, who hadn't paid a cent since his son was born). I hadn't tried to replace any parental figure he has, but really, he has none he can trust or confide in, but us.  Specifically, my question is two-fold:  - do I just keep on, not trying to be ""dad,"" but just give him a safe place to live until he graduates (with any guidance that you guys could offer?)  - or, do I need to convince him that I'm as good as Dad as he's going to get, to start treating me like one, or else there will be consequences?  I'm not very good at all at setting a structured home system. I have generally taken things as they come, and if I at least have forewarning of an opportunity for him to make the right choice, I tell him the consequence for making a wrong choice. But, I have no consistency, and certainly no structure. I know this is likely the problem. But, how do I approach this?  Thanks for reading. It's a long description, which was required, because really, I don't know what my question really is. "
521,Does pulling kids out of class for special help negatively influence them?,"Are students who are pulled out of class for either remedial or advanced work negatively influenced either in their self esteem or in their social circles?  How does a parent evaluate which is more important, being pulled out for academics or the social and self esteem issues? "
522,8-month old terrified of new caretakers,"My 8-month old will hardly let anybody ""new"" pick him up, or spend time with him if his mother or I aren't present. His current nanny and one set of grandparents (which have spent a lot of time with him) are OK, but his other grandparents, uncles, aunts, and pretty much anybody else send him into a frantic bout of terrified bawling.  My mother wants to be able to babysit, and we're moving to a new daycare in a few weeks. I've tried giving my parents ""alone-time"" with him, so they can get used to each other; he calms down to a certain degree, but remains upset, clingy, and quick to cry, and he lunges at me desperately as soon as I return. He isn't any more welcoming after several days of a family vacation all together, or after this ""alone-time"". I'm worried that our attempts to get him used to someone else being with him are doing more for his anxiety than for his comfort.  Is this normal? Is there something we can do to help him adjust to new people? Is there anything we can do to smooth the transition to a new daycare? "
523,What kind of frame for prescription glasses for a 3 year old?,"I have looked at questions on this site and most of them are trying to get their kids to learn to wear glasses. My question is a pre-cursor of sorts. Just today my 3 and a half year old was diagnosed with astigmatism and the doctor wants him on prescription lens. My question is what kind of frame should I begin searching for ?   History with Sunglasses : Every single time he was bought a sunnies, the first thing he did was to hold the temples (piece that goes over the ear) and pull them apart. After wasting a few sunnies we found the rubber framed ones and there has been no problem. The issue is, none of the optometrists in the city I live in (Australia) stock rubber based frames (most hadn't even heard of such a thing).   Since a frame and lens really cost an arm and leg in Australia, my question is, what kind of a frame should I get for a destructive 3.5 year old for prescription lens ?  "
524,How do we raise our child with three languages?,"My wife is Italian, I am Swedish. Between us we speak English, neither one of us knows the other language. We are currently living in Sweden and will do so for a while. The baby will be born in May.  My wife is actually half-Japanese and while not mother-tongue she speaks it well enough for conversational use.  I have seen Raising a bilingual child when one parent knows both languages while the other doesn&#39;t and What are some strategies for raising a bilingual child?  Our thought so far is to speak English when we are all together, Swedish between me and the baby, Italian between my wife and the baby. And then at some point, my wife's mother may introduce Japanese.  Does anyone have similar experiences of having three languages from start?  What worked? What didn't?   Does anyone have any advice on whether to (and when and how) introduce Japanese?  Are there any recommended references on the subject of... raising children with three languages? "
525,Should a precocious child be prevented from devoting too much time to their primary interest?,"I know a couple of children in their early or pre-teen years who have already accomplished more than many adults accomplish in their entire careers.  These accomplishments seem to be a combination of natural talent, hard work, and an intense focus on their chosen area of interest.  The last characteristic doesn't describe every child prodigy, but it describes some, and its that concept that concerns me.  Specifically, is there a downside to missing being exposed to a wide variety of interests, particularly before the teenage years?    I believe it is important for a parent to encourage interests, but is it appropriate for a parent to also impose limits to those interests?  If a child is advanced enough to be collaborating on developing the next big development framework, is it ok for a parent to say ""you've been sitting at that computer for three hours straight. Go outside and play!""?  Note that this isn't specific to computer use.  It is just as applicable to a child who plays a musical instrument, builds, creates art, etc.. "
526,Is 15 years old too old to ground for bad grades?,"I have a 15 year old that has been grounded 60% of the time the past two years.  Most of the groundings are around his grades or forgetting to do homework.    When he is grounded at first he buckles down, gets his homework done and seem mature.  Then a couple of weeks later he goes back...  There is really no reason for not getting stuff done.  He is playing games, he just forgets, he didn't know, he takes notes on homework wrong in class so does wrong things, whatever.    He is in the school's gifted program and is in the 99th percentile on the standardized tests.  Obviously this does not help him study or do his homework.    When he is grounded he is usually ""electronically grounded"" too where he can't use a device unless in family room and for homework.  Is he too old to ground?  Should I try something else?  I have had talks with him 20 times on this stuff.  He is a good kid but is immature and has no ability to prioritize anything.  At the same time he can't take responsibility for anything - he makes excuses or lies about why he gets bad grades every time...  so? "
527,What are ways to stay calm when dealing with an argumentative teen as a step parent?,"How do you deal with becoming short-tempered when dealing with a teenage step-daughter that's running her mouth? How do you cope with feeling overwhelmed, and how do you stay cool when hurtful things are being said?   I got in my teen's face when I put my hands on her suddenly, on her head covering her ears, and told her to shut up. I just want to learn to stay cool. "
528,What to do when 3.5-year-old still asks for pacifier 6 months after weaning?,"Our 3.5-year-old girl has no pacifier since her 3. birthday. Before that, she was really addicted to it, asking all the time if she could have it (although we had clear rules, only during sleep time etc.). She did not want to give away her pacifier voluntarily, so we decided to take it way when she turned 3. We communicated that several month before and spoke about it on a regular basis (and she more or less ""agreed"" with that). We explained to her that it's not good for her teeth, speech etc. We were really afraid that it would be very difficult for her without pacifier, especially during the night (she never slept without for the last 2.5 years), but to our astonishment, it ways not a big deal for her and after a couple of days, we all thought it's over.   But after some months, and especially after her (several months old) sibling got her own pacifiers, she startet again to ask if she could have again a pacifier. For the last 3 months now, she spoke about it several times a week, sometimes several times a day. Often, she takes the pacifier of her baby-doll in her mouth (just a hard plastic stick). For us, it is really hard to see her like this, she seems to suffer a lot, she wants one sooo badly.  After 6 months now I'm now very confused and uncertain what to do. Probably it was too early (or too late?) for her to give away her pacifier (apparently, she was not ready for it). I'm actually thinking of giving her again a pacifier to give her another chance to give it away when she is really ready for it. But I'm unsure if this is a really bad idea. So far, I forbid her to take the pacifier of her sibling. But more and more, I have lost the hope the situation will calm down by itself.   Any advice what to do? "
529,"Will it confuse my son if I try to teach him 3 languages, two of which are very close to each other (Russian and Ukrainian)?","I know Russian, Ukrainian and English, my husband knows only English. We are going to teach our son Russian besides English (English is a dominant language where we live). But I wonder would it be worth the effort to try to teach him Ukrainian as well?  I have read articles on multilingual kids, but all the languages that they are learning are not similar. Where Russian and Ukrainian are different languages, but are closely related to each other. I am afraid that my son (9 months old now) will confuse these two languages. I understand that there may be some confusion with either languages. But I would not like him to eventually be speaking neither proper Russian or Ukrainian but Russian-Ukrainian dialect.  Theoretically it should not be difficult for him to pick up Ukrainian when he knows Russian.  Are there any parents that are raising trilingual kids with two similar languages? And if there are, what are you doing to teach them both languages.  I was thinking of using one parent - one language method (or in my case mom - two languages and dad - one language). But I was going to switch languages (Russian and Ukrainian) every other day. It will also be more effort from my side to create Ukrainian environment around him. As there are no Ukrainian speaking playgroups where we live and I do not know anyone who speaks Ukrainian. "
530,To celebrate my kid's birthday or not?,"My question may sound weird to many but we are unsure that should we celebrate our kid's birthday or not?   My Son will turn 2 years old on 15th December and we have started feeling the social pressure of having a birthday party for him.  I would elaborate a bit about our situation :  We live in a foreign country and we don't have any family or relatives around here so just some friend's families and colleagues we know. People usually give really big birthday parties here for their child and we have attended many of them in last few year.  So last year when our kid turned one we also got excited and planned a big party and invited many people, but unfortunately My kid got sick and we need to cancel it and did a small cake cutting at home instead .   Me and my wife got really sad watching our kid sick and crying while cutting his first birthday cake. Looking him like that we though what's the point in having a birthday party if he himself couldn't enjoy it.  But now here comes his second birthday and people are expecting an invitation.  We really want to celebrate his birthday to make him feel special but still think that it will be more of party for adults rather kids doing fun.  What should we do?  Will it have a psychological impact on my son going forward when he will know that we didn't celebrated his birthdays like other parents did.       "
531,Respectful parenting and discipline,"Been reading a bit about Respectful Parenting and mutual respect as a parenting style and it appeals to us. We have four kids so keeping track of reward charts and various other trackers is complex and time consuming, we'd much rather work toward mutual respect and a willingness to do the right thing ""most"" of the time.   One thing that I'm not quite clear on is how to discipline within that framework without it looking like punishment, which then blurs the lines into a more controlling and coercive framework.   For example, we have two 11 year olds who are obsessed with their phones, and would happily wander around with them glued to their faces 24*7. Previously we have given them jobs to do to earn credits towards phone use, but we'd much rather they do jobs because it's the right thing to do in a family and then self-regulate their phone use. How do we encourage that, without the threat of taking them away? It's not just phones, that's just an example.  How do we ""punish"" a lack of respect and cooperation without it being a punishment? "
532,Homework in schools in England,"Our 4 year old daughter recently started school in London, and started getting homework for the Weekends. We are not really happy with both the type and the quantity of work that she is supposed to do: the tasks (e.g. writing letters and drawing pictures of things that start with that letter) seem to be inadequate for her age. Continuing with this example, she can't really write the letters properly, as if she was not explained the direction, etc. She can't really name things starting with a letter either. Hence in effect the homework is more for the parents, who are supposed to do the schools job and teach their child to write letters. We don't think that kids should spend so much time learning to write at this age, because there are so many different things (also in the curriculum) to learn, like arts or social skills.  Moreover, we often go away for the weekends and she is supposed to hand in her homework on Mondays. Hence a couple of questions:   What would be the consequences if we just ignored (part of) her homework regularly? How would you deal with this situation?  "
533,How to help children cope with a parent's suicide?,"I've asked another question here: How to handle disclosing a parent&#39;s suicide to friends and their parents    I've noticed that this question here: What are some strategies for helping children cope with divorce?  It seems many children can be badly affected by the perceived or real abandonment of a parent/s.    When my children were 1, 3 and 9, their father committed suicide. It was sudden, one day he left home for work, then he never returned.  My youngest was pre-verbal and my second child was also unable to have discussions like I could with my oldest child.  As children can have a tendency to feel blame for being abandoned, as can been seen in divorce, there is the added issue of my children feeling inadequate, at fault of somehow intrinsically unlovable as a result of their father taking his own life.  Aside from professional help does anybody have some sound advice or strategies to deal with children with such abandonment issues?  "
534,Is it okay for an infant to sit in a regular stroller? Does position matter?,"I have a 4 month old. She has pretty good head/neck control. She just barely fits into our stroller. Is there a general guideline of when an infant can sit in a regular stroller based on certain developmental requirements for the spine?  The only reason why I ask is that the instructions for our other gear, our baby carrier, says this...(sorry for the long quote)     Before the XYZ Carrier attained the popularity it now enjoys, it was thought that slings were a better alternative to the outward facing carrier, in the sense that there was no pressure put on the developing spine.      This is due to the fact that the baby is in more of a horizontal position in the sling,    rather than suspended by the crotch with legs dangling and pressure put on the developing sacrum at the base of the spine.  At birth the spine is shaped like the letter C, as it was in the womb.  As the spine develops it acquires secondary curves in the base of the spine and the neck.  These secondary curves begin developing from birth.  According to Rochelle Casses in her paper entitled “Infants and Spinal Stress”:       “A baby's spine is placed in a compromising position in many of today's popular carriers. If the carrier positions the infant upright, with the legs hanging down and the bodyweight supported at the base of the baby's spine (i.e. at the crotch), it puts undue stress on the spine which can adversely affect the development of the spinal curves and, in some cases, cause spondylolisthesis.”      The XYZ Carrier used with the infant insert  address these very issues.  In the XYZ    Carrier the baby faces towards the babywearer with the back, sacrum and legs supported in an upright position.  The infant insert  has a bottom support cushion that is designed to support the natural curvature of a baby’s spine by encouraging a slight forward-leaning position with the pelvis tilted forward.  There is also padding to support the back along the length of the spine.  The position of the infant in the infant insert is exactly the position that a baby would be in if carried with its bottom supported by both hands and the head resting in the chest with legs tucked-up and, if the infant is old enough, straddling the waist.  An update from the editor of a new edition of the above quoted paper validates XYZ's new design:      UPDATE: This article was written in the 1990s when the all of the popular upright baby carrier designs had the harmful characteristics described below. Today, several new and improved upright carrier designs are available. The gold standard for carrying your baby should be your own arms. In other words, an upright carrier should hold your baby the way your arms would, e.g., facing you with legs in a frog-like, spread-squat position with the baby's weight supported across the buttocks and thighs.   Her position in the stroller is not as reclined as when she sits in her car seat. One thing that I can do is to recline the stroller back to match the recline position of the car seat.  I guess a similar question goes for the car seat...is the position ok for the development of the baby? "
535,Washing Cloth diapers,"My boyfriend and I live in an apartment building and have shared washer and dryers. We are expecting a baby girl and have been leaning heavily towards cloth diapers. He is concerned if it is worth the cost of 1.50 a load as well as sanitation.  While I recently read that it isn't all that unsanitary. I'm concerned about the prewash/ presoak part of the procedure. The machines don't have that option. My thought was to presoak for an hour before using the machine in a plastic container and potentially doing 2 hot washes. One solo wash and another with whatever clothing I could fit. Though it seems that most people just do one hot wash. But then to save on drying cost to just get a towel rack to air dry. If I were to just wash them solo.  I guess my overall ""question"" is. Would doing the procedure of soaking the rinsed of diapers in cold or hot water in a bin, doing a solo hot tide detergent wash, then letting them sit on a towel rack to dry work out? or should I reconsider this procedure or just go for disposable diapers? "
536,How can I get my toddler to exit discreetly when threatening-looking people are around?,"I was having lunch with my 3 y.o. daughter today, and some threatening-looking types start having lunch there also (one looked like he was on drugs).  This is solely based on their appearance; they never bothered us in any way, and for all I know, they could be lovely people once you get to know them.  Nevertheless, I felt a strong desire to leave, without drawing attention to us in any way (i.e. I didn't want to make it seem like I was uncomfortable with them around my daughter).  However, I know that if I would have attempted to leave prematurely, my daughter would likely have protested, which would have drawn attention to us (she was enjoying her meal, and was completely oblivious to any of my perceived threats).     Question: How can I explain to my toddler about these situations?  How can I ensure that we can quickly and quietly leave in these situations?  "
537,"How do you teach children ""Humility""?","I feel that my kids, after some persuasion, are capable when it comes to schoolwork, homework and other such skills.  We have always identified good behaviour and let our son know when he has done something goood or bad. I have seen that he responds this and it improves his behaviour.  I worry that these days schools focus on technical skills, advanced courses, and general good behaviour. However, they tend to pay less attention to being humble. How do children learn humility? Or is this something that can only be taught through experience?  "
538,Our 6-year-old son complains of stomach pain only when going to school - and refuses to go,"Our 6-year-old son is crying almost every day when we try to leave him at school. He will start to cry and complain of stomach pain. This stomach pain only shows up in the morning when we are about to go to school or on the way to school. He does not have stomach pain at home, nor during after-school activities nor on week-ends.  To be sure, we have been to the doctors to have him checked. They could not find anything. He has some intolerance to gluten, and he had a period last year when he complained about stomach pain but then it wasn't ""only when going to school"".  He is very social and has generally had an easy time to make friends and adapt to new environments. We moved to a new country 1.5 years ago, and the first week he cried when we left him at kindergarten - but he picked up the new language and made friends and it took about a month and he was genuinely  happy to go to kindergarten. This year he was looking forward to start at a new school.   The first weeks went fine. Unfortunately, there were three (maybe four) incidents between him and some older children at the playground where he had been hit by them. All these incidents occurred at the time when several grades are waiting to enter the canteen. We have of course taken this up with the school and the director. We believe this has been resolved and there hasn't been any more incidents since then. He is now eating at home instead of at school (as do many other kids).   We have met with his teacher and we have seen him during a break at school. I trust his teacher and he seems to get along fine with his classmates. On the way to school and home from school several kids want to talk to him - he seems to do well socially. The teacher says that she can see those mornings when he has been crying, but that he is happy in class and does well in school.  However, he is crying and is complaining of stomach pain in the mornings, often just at the time when one says ""OK now it is time to put on the shoes and go"". We have asked for a meeting with the school psychologist.   We are not sure exactly how to handle this. Initially, when we were not sure what was going on, we would have him stay home instead of going to school. He would play with his toys as normal at home (but no screen time!).  Once it was clear it was not a physical health issue and after meeting with the teacher and it felt that school should be safe - we said he has to go to school - even if he feels he has stomach pain.  We have tried to ask him about his stomach pain but I'm not sure he knows himself what exactly he feels or why he feels he has pain.  He has complained that school feels long. He might be bored. It may not be what he expected school to be like (it is different from kindergarten). He might also not feel safe (yet) due to the incidents.  To complicate matters, where we live (Barcelona), the school is in Catalan, while most social interactions on playgrounds etc., are in Spanish. In kindergarten it was more relaxed (teachers would speak English/Spanish and Catalan), while at school all teaching is in Catalan (although his teacher is fine if he replies in any language he wants). And the teacher does not think he needs support in Catalan as of now - (he has less of a vocabulary than some other kids, but there are also many kids like him who know only Spanish. Our son also speaks English and Italian well).    How can we help him with this?  Should we bring him to school even if he breaks down and starts to cry on the way complaining about stomach pain?  I'm not sure, but I think his sense of pain is real, but I think it may be due a lot of factors that he is not himself aware of. I think he is not as aware of his feelings as she is. I think one of the factors is that he simply thinks school is not fun and he prefers to be home - but I also think that this is not the only factor.  Today, my wife brought him to school and it ended up with him laying down on the street refusing to go. So she took him home. I spoke with him and told him that he has to go to school - even if he has some stomach pain - that he will do fine and that school is important. I said eventually that he will go to school even if that means I will carry him to school. And so I did, I carried him to school. He cried for most of the way but once he had accepted it he stopped crying. Just when leaving him at school he wanted to hug a lot and he was sad but he did go to his classroom.   I think I did the right thing, but I'm not sure. Thoughts and suggestions are very welcome. "
539,At what age does a child's moral compass form?,"I've been reading many things about educating morality into a child.   This question is great but does not deal with the age issue.  My question is, at what age are children generally most active in developing their moral compass? I'm sure helping your child develop in the right way is something that starts at birth and continues every day that you are both alive. However, I suspect that there is some age at which moral development is more pronounced.  Does anyone know what that magical age is? "
540,How structured does a child's life need to be?,"At home, our kids' lives (3 and 7 months) are fairly well-defined, in terms of when events happen. Waking up, meals, naps, bath, bedtime - except for a little slacking on the mornings on weekends (only for the 3yo! the infant still gets her milk on time), the times at which these things happen don't change much.  When I take the kids to visit my family, I find it hard to keep a consistent schedule - there's always something that we want to do, or someplace to go, that gets in the way. I also get the impression that they think I'm being overprotective, or anal-retentive, or something, because I try to keep to some sort of schedule.  So, my question is: does anybody know of any studies that examine how much ""structure"" (for lack of a better term) a child needs in its life in order to be healthy? And what are the effects of not keeping their lives on a pretty stable rhythm? "
541,"Are ""cheap"" shoes bad for your young childs feet?","Disclaimer: I don't have kids myself so this is a general question. Many of my friends do have children and I sometimes buy things for them. (Location Germany)  I wonder if ""cheap"" shoes you can buy on amazon or in cheaper stores (like H&amp;M) are bad for the development of the feet of children.   Two examples:  I remember having cheap boots when I was around 10, and I started walking weird, so my parents started buying more expensive fitted shoes for me.    My best friends daughter (4years) started playing soccer, and we were worried about her ankle support, so I gifted expensive soccer shoes for her birthday. (which she already grew out of, ofcourse)   Do you have experience on how to keep the feet of your children safe during sports, and day-to-day wear? When buying shoes, how can I make sure that they are save to use? "
542,How do you prepare a pre-schooler for potentially permanent separation from a close friend?,"My three-year-old son attends a small, in-home daycare.  The other kids in the daycare range from about 1 year to 5.  There is one other boy my son's age, and the two of them are very good friends.  My son looks forward to going explicitly to play with the other boy, and when we ask him what he did at daycare on any given day, the answer is invariably a description of how the two of them played together, and what toys they played with.  My son frequently tells us that the other boy is his best friend, and the two of them apparently tell each other that throughout the day on a regular basis.  Unfortunately... we recently found out that the other boy will be leaving daycare next week.  We've made attempts to arrange for the two of them to get together outside of daycare in the past, and the boy's mother (a single mother who is apparently having a hard time right now) has been generally unresponsive.  It seems unlikely that we'd be able to maintain any sort of contact once he leaves daycare.  My son isn't yet aware that the other boy will be leaving, but when he does, I know my son will be very upset.  What can I do to help him through this?  Is there anything I should/can do to prepare him?  Should I tell him ahead of time, or wait until the other boy's last day?  Apparently the other boy is currently on a trip, and will return some time early next week, but then Friday is his last day.  They'll only have 3-4 days together before the other boy is gone for good. "
543,How do I explain racial slurs to a 10-year-old?,"I've got a 10-year-old daughter. She gets very good grades in school (sometimes even A+, rarely Bs). She already has quite a healthy knowledge of sexual education (the Birds and The Bees).  She came back from school the other day and asked ""Dad, what does n***** mean? I heard someone at school say it"". Now, I'm very relaxed on bad language and she doesn't swear in the house or at her elders. Her vocabulary for swearing is quite basic and doesn't contain racial slurs.  Now, how do I explain racial slurs with her? It's very historic and quite a complex subject IMHO. Should I explain to her about slavery of African-Americans? I have very little concern about her age for it. Should I just discuss the meaning that it means a black person and that it's very (extremely) bad and discriminating?  I will never get mad over what she knows. "
544,Is my toddler's sleep pattern normal or does he sleep too much?,"My 2.5-year-old son's sleep pattern has drastically changed the last couple of weeks. Now he generally goes to sleep about 10pm, sleeps through until 9am or a bit later. He is only awake for about 4 hours, then sleeps again for 4-5 hours, then is awake again for another 4 hours, then bed for night .... He will not wake easily. Once asleep, it's very hard to rouse him....   I'm quite concerned he sleeping way to much... He is my 4th child, never had one slept this much... Any thoughts on the amount he is sleeping? Is it normal or should I be worried? "
545,How to help my 8-year-old who can't sleep because she fears she doesn't get enough sleep?,"My 8-year-old is so stressed out about not getting enough sleep that she can't sleep. When school started, the teacher explained to them that is is important to get 10 hours of sleep a night because studies show people who sleep well live longer. Since then she has been waking up every night several times in tears because she's scared she's not getting enough sleep.  Several family members and the teacher have tried to explain to her that she's not going to die if she doesn't get 10 hours a night but she still wakes up in the middle of the night. I've tried letting her sleep in my room. I tried taking the clock out of her room but she just gets up and looks at the time in the kitchen. She used to sleep around 8-10 hours at a time and rarely woke up in the middle of the night. During the day she's cranky and emotional and will cry at the drop of a hat because she's so tired. Nothing I or anyone else says seems to help.  Any thoughts on how I can can help her through this? Should I take her to a counsellor? "
546,How much ipad time do most kids get?,"I'm a mother of 2, ages 3 and 10. I am worried that my youngest child is spending as much time, sometimes more time, on the iPad than my eldest.  The iPad seems ideal when I am busy and the kids are content when using it, however I don't want to over do their computer time especially for my youngest.  Am I right to be concerned? I'm wondering what time periods parents are seeing their kids using iPads for? "
547,How should screen time be treated to balance the pro of education resources on the internet and con of decreased involvement in other activities?,"Screen time is a tricky subject. Around middle school age there are very good uses of technology that emerge where can child can develop healthy hobbies fueled by self-motivation (which may later turn into a profession). Obviously, there is a risk of distraction and a minimum level of maturity needed to successfully use a computer or the internet as a tool.  For every child there are different benefits and challenges that must be addressed when using a computer. What attitude should I have toward ""screen time"" and what can I do to make sure a child is utilizing computers correctly? What role do limits and restrictions have with regards to computer use? Can communication with the child help? "
548,"How do I get my 4yo to stop repeating himself all the time, and to respect a quiet time?","My 4 yo has been showing a rather annoying and obsessive behavior for the past 6 months or so, in that:   he repeats himself all the time, and won't take no for an answer in some circumstances.   Maybe I should ask 2 different questions for this, but the 2 problems seem to go hand in hand.  Quick examples...  Say we're having lunch and talk together, and at some point he might say something and for some reason start repeating it (e.g. ""It's mommy who bought that salad, OK?""). He'll keep repeating for a while (it can really go on and on for 10-15 iterations), and he's starting to take too long to eat. If it's a question, like in this example, we can acknowledge it and agree with him, and it'll usually end there. However, if it's something where it's not correct (say, grand-ma bought the salad so we just tell him ""no, actually, grand-ma bought it for us"") or where he wasn't asking a question (""tomorrow we go to the school"" or ""baby is sleeping""), then we can't always find a way to make him accept the ""correction"" or to understand that we understand what he's saying and to stop repeating.  So we might at some point tell him ""Sorry, but now you have to stop talking and playing. Finish your plate and then we can talk."" He usually gets it, and knows he should go back to it and will do it to some extent, but will irremediably start saying the same thing again a bit later. Or, if at that time there's something he wants to say, he absolutely won't give up.  In another situation, if we happen to be near the door of his baby-sister's room when she takes a nap and he wants to tell us something, we'll ask him to be quiet and to wait to tell us something until we're out of ear-shot, and we start walking away from the door (he's quite loud and has that piercing voice - a 4 yo kid, basically). He won't respect that and will keep talking.  Even if very explicitly forbidden to (a clear ""Shhh, you need to be quiet now!"") for instance for one of the above scenarios and he keeps talking, or if he's in a time-out or a quiet relaxation time, he'll just keep trying to talk. Usually we reach a point where we just can't get out of it and just tell him we'll talk later and walk away, or that he can't talk right now, and he'll either get upset (which I can understand) or start pulling on my arm to ask the permission to talk right away (actually rather strange, as we don't really have a ""ask permission to talk"" thing going on, but maybe that's mimicking classroom behavior).  Another example would be when we go shopping. He may start saying in the supermarket ""I like these cookies"", or something like this, and you won't be able to make him stop.  I understand that at 4 yo, it's hard for him to know when it's appropriate to talk, and why silence is required under some circumstances. But there are situations he's familiar with (like his sister sleeping, being quite in time-outs, talking quietly in public places, etc...), and also it's really the one thing where we can't get him to snap out of it. It either ends with:   we give up and tell him ""ok, what do you want to say?"" and he'll say it (usually quite a few times), but it's troublesome that we can't make him accept a rule; or he'll get very upset and possibly cry, let himself fall on the floor and refuse to do anything.   Of course at first I thought we might be doing it wrong (well, we probably do), and he might feel like we don't listen to him, or don't give him enough importance, or it's an indirect/hidden message he's trying to send us. But not really. In the case of the ""salad"" scenario, it doesn't look like he wants anything but won't hear that the corrected fact is right; in the case of waking up his sister it's often about something trivial; and in the case of the supermarket, you could buy him the cookies and assure him they're his and his only and it wouldn't make a difference in the world. So it doesn't look like it's really linked to the content of what he says.  I thought it might be due about just wanting to be listened to, but acknowledging him and agreeing doesn't even always make him stop.  And then it could be more about the situation than about the discussion itself (it does happen often at lunch/dinner and when going out), but then I don't know why he'd feel attached to having to repeat things that don't even seem to matter to him that much at the time. And in general I'm perfectly OK with taking a deep breath and letting him go through it for as long as he wants, and I just say ""ok"" and agree with him or try to steer the conversation and ask follow-ups (and it goes on a while!), but when we do need to make him snap out it it's really hard.  This is a bit confused and I hope someone can make sense of it and has a similar experience. I know young kids repeat things a lot, but it really looks like a strong fixation or obsession, and it's been driving us a bit nuts, but also his grand-parents, his uncle, our friends, and some care-takers at school (I don't think it happens with the teacher that often). "
549,Cause and cure of silly behavior in children,"What can be some of the causes/reasons that a child (in the 7-year-old range) to speak in a silly voice and in a silly way, more than an average child? I don't know how to be more specific by silly voice and in a silly way, but I mean that the child speaks with a different voice, usually mimicking a spoiled 2-year-old in a way that is not the natural way that he usually speaks and it is pretty annoying and not very likable. It happens very often when the child communicates with grown ups. I am guessing it can be an attempt to draw attention or be liked more but I'm not a psychologist so I thought I'd ask.   What are some of the causes of this type of behavior in children, and what are some of the cures for it? "
550,4 yr old has become very negative since starting school,"My 4 (and 4 months) year old son (i'm going to call him John here) started school in september, a couple of months ago.  (he's in what is called 'Reception' in England - it might be called pre-school in the USA).  In the last few weeks he has started showing some very troubling behaviour, characterised by:   ""doom and gloom"" - ""Nobody loves me""/""Nobody likes me"" etc.   sadness about friends:  ""I'm going to be my own best friend"", ""I don't want any friends"" insulting me and my wife: ""You're not good at anything, are you"", ""None of your jokes are funny."" insulting his 2 yr old sister: telling her she is stupid etc.  arguing with anything - ""Ooh look at that huge crane, isn't that cool."" ""No it isn't!  Shut up!"" saying really dark stuff like ""When someone says they love you, that means that they hate you"" and ""If you say you hate me, that will make me happy."".  This is perhaps the most troubling.      I think that this might stem from him not having any good friends at school.   He kind of makes things hard for himself in this regard - I've seen other kids say hello to him and he just ignores them.  He's lacking in social skills really.  At a cinema screening at the school a couple of weeks ago he kept on turning to the other kids and shouting ""Did you see that!"" at them.  They ended up moving away from him, and I don't really blame them, even though it made me want to cry.      I think he has an idea that he needs to have a ""best friend"", and he feels like he doesn't have one.  He sees other kids playing and sort of stands on the sidelines vicariously playing with them, but not really with them if you know what I mean.    It's very difficult for me and my wife to deal with, because when we try to talk to him about it he gets really angry, leading to conversations like  ""Nobody loves me"" ""John, me and mummy love you very very much."" ""NO YOU DON'T!! SHUT UP! You're just an idiot.""  My wife has spoken to his teacher and she says she hasn't really seen anything worrying happening in the classroom, but obviously she can't be everywhere at once.    If he was 13 and behaving like this I might write it off as moody teenager behaviour, and not worry so much.  But to have a four year old say ""When someone says they love you, that means that they hate you"" is quite frankly terrifying me and my wife.    Can anyone advise?  Is this normal?  Should we speak to a child psychologist? "
551,Effect of homeschool on college chances?,"I am the child not the parent - but it is still extremely relevant to my parents. My parents want to really think through what's the best option for my future. Me and my parents are considering home-school as an option and I think this decision is very dependant on the circumstances. The key reason for me taking home-school classes would be that I can't find any other options that allow the pace or level of learning that I'm at. I'm a senior and have a very low GPA (although I consistently get 4s on end of year tests) because I've tended to slack off at high-school since it felt so menial so I think that home-school could be advantageous because my GPA would not carry over.   I'm currently working my way through The Handbook of Mathematical Logic by John Barwise, a textbook in abstract algebra and category theory, and a graduate level textbook in theoretical physics. However my school is starting soon and I feel that in my case school is actually a massive detriment to my learning because it takes time away that I would be spending learning at a much more advanced level. I've also presented at one academic conference so far but I think without public school in the way it would give me time to do more.  In my case what are my chances of getting into college with a home-school degree, and in what ways can I improve my chances? How will it increase chances if I get high ACT or SAT scores and how will it increase my chances if I use the extra time to submit a few papers at academic conferences? "
552,Do a parent's big expectations become a burden on the child?,"Recently, Haruki Murakami started an advice column on his personal website. One of the questions was about motivating kids. Here is what Murakami replied:     When a parent's expectations for children are large, it becomes a burden for children.      -- link for those who know Japanese and for those who don't.   Is this true? Can a parent's (good willed) expectations for their child burden the latter? "
553,Advantages and disadvantages of learning sight words (English),"Our 5 year old received a gift of a game that helps learning sight words.  Our (the parent's) first language is not English, and I have never heard this term before.  Wikipedia states that:     Sight words, often also called high frequency sight words, are commonly used words that young children are encouraged to memorize as a whole by sight, so that they can automatically recognize these words in print without having to use any strategies to decode.   The Wikipedia article lists a couple of reasons to teach children sight words, but it doesn't say if there is any differing opinions, other methods of beginning reading, or any drawbacks.   Are there any drawbacks? Is this the de-facto way of teaching reading?   As additional information, we live in the US, and he is attending a Montessori pre-school/elementary and we plan to have him move to public school after kindergarten (he is kindergarten age for next school year).  I am actually not sure if ournative language is taught like that or not,  but I had never heard a special term for those words before.  "

555,Should I allow my child to participate in dangerous sports?,"When should a child be allowed to take part in ""dangerous"" sports or activities?  I'm thinking of letting my son try motocross when he's ""old enough"" - but when is that, when is a child old enough to understand the risks involved? I've seen parents with children as young as 3-4 years old on small (50cc - circa 5-10mph) bikes, some with stabilisers some without. By the time they're in their teens, they typically ride much larger and faster bikes at potentially lethal speeds.  Ignoring the motor-sport context, whilst it's rare, I'm conscious that simply breaking bones can result in death (usually either from compound bleeding or infection etc.) so I'm very aware of the potential consequences - but my child may not be.  My main motivation is that I want my child to learn some life-skills that many less ""harmful"" activities often lack - elements of bravery, commitment, physical fitness and large components of risk (assessment) and ""face your fears"" experience that I want my son to learn, to make a mensch out of him. I want to instil a sense of grit and determination and the ability to keep pushing when things get tough. IMHO, too many parents avoid exposing their children to life's difficulties (risk, losing, physical effort etc.).  Additionally, from my own perspective, I'd very much enjoy being able to spend time riding with my son - but I don't feel very comfortable exposing him to danger (especially when he's too young to understand the consequences). By the same token, I'm conscious that if he isn't exposed to the sport young enough, he'll be unlikely to reach a professional standard, if that were to be something he chose to pursue.  Does anyone allow their child to participate in a dangerous (or contact) sport? When did they start and how did you mitigate against the risks?  You can assume they'll be wearing all the best protective equipment and only riding in appropriate places (closed circuits, with riders of the same age) - never on public roads without a helmet etc... "
556,Is it inappropriate for young teens to cuddle and sleep together if there is no sign of it being sexual?,"I'm trying to decide if I should intervene and would very much appreciate some feedback. I am Japanese btw and my English may not be perfect, sorry.  My son and his best friend are both 13 years of age. They have been best friends since a very young age of around 4. They have a good group of friends, but the two of them have been almost unseperatble for years. She is a very good influence on my son and he tends to do better in school, clean his room, etc, when she is around. So I want to be very careful about not hurting their relationship. Especially since he has been self reliant since a young age, like many Japanese children learn to be my our culture. They have always been lightly physical, wrestling, leaning on each other (I think normal healthy friend ways). But recently I went into his room one night because the light was on, and they were sleeping together (with clothes on) in a very intimate way. Very much like picture I have posted. They looked very cute and peaceful like this, but I was little scared as it reminded me of lovers.  I have been watching them closely, and they are very comfortable together, and will cuddle on couch when watching tv, things like that, but I have seen no kissing and nothing sexual. My son gets embarrassed though if I get too nosy. I do not know if they are developing love or if they are just comfortable like siblings. I want to find what is best for them, and do not want to force them to stop if it will hurt their relationship.  Is this bad? Should I tell them to stop? Should I inform her mother that they are doing these things? Or should I tell them to be careful, or leave them alone? I plan to have a sex talk with my son, but I do not know if good enough. "

558,Possible and adequate parental attitudes to a 10 yrs old playing a horror video game on smartphone possibly under group pressure,"My 10 yrs old son has recently a copy of horror game (haunting scenes with ghosts/monsters having appearance of toys like teddies etc) app allowed from 16 years and his arguments are:   his friends in the class even girls would play this game on their smartphones as well while he does feel a little bit distrubed by it that would be not that bad   I must admit myself and his mother are a little bit puzzled how to react and what the best for the child should be. I mean can you substite here ""really bad things"" smoking etc.  equally? Here would be a clear no but normally kids do not present this information to parents like ""well actually this is not allowed but what will you do""?

560,How to handle a mother who is becoming unkind to the adult child?,"I am in the low 30s and my mother used to be very kind and caring but in the last decade she turned out almost the total opposite. She has a much better wealth then she used to but her attitude changed so much that I almost want to avoid her as much as I can.  For example, she accused me and my girlfriend of having stolen 150$. It is not so much the amount but just the fact that she accused us meaning her confidence in us is totally null. This would have NEVER happened in the good old days. I am trying to figure if we have done something that might have changed that and cannot come up with anything. This accusation was made because we took care of her house while they were on vacation, which leads to we will never do it again.  She also writes some weird things now like ""Thanks for your love for me"" (maybe bad translation but you get the point I'm sure) and every sentences she writes to us seems like we are indebted to her. She also is unable to spend one dinner without talking about money or how good she is or what exploit she has done.  Also my girlfriend is pregnant and my mother offered to help us (money wise) and we both agreed that we would not accept anything from her.  Now I will soon sit down with her and explain how we feel but when I will do that our relation will take a huge setback for many months. I really want to do that before new baby is born (few more months to go) to take some pressure of my girlfriends shoulders because she finds this situation much more difficult than I do.  So my questions are:      How would you handle this kind of situation if it happened to you?    How can I make her realized she has changed that much?   I thought about writing a small book about this story and give her by the intermediary of someone else but I do not think I do have the patience to finish it. "
561,"Techniques for handling teenagers ""playing dumb"" about things","It is hard to phrase this question, as it is an psychologically oblique problem.  My teenage son will often ask questions or make glib observations about things, he already knows the answer to, or understand at a deeper level. He does this to get attention and to get a reaction from me.  Now the attention part is easier to address. Obviously, he needs more of my undivided attention.  It's the getting a reaction from me that's not so easy. As a parent, a human being, I get worn down and my reserves of patience can become emptied, and so I snap or react. In this case I react, because I know he is intelligent and provoking me.  The essence of this question is not so much, how to change my behaviour (which is always a must), but   It's a more sophisticated version of  knowing a small child is lying about eating the chocolate cake and their face is covered in chocolate cake, but in this case the evidence is intangible, it is the knowledge I have of his knowledge ! (that sounds wrong ! lol)       Does anybody have some good techniques for handling teenagers ""playing dumb"" about things? How can I get the best from my son, in terms of communicating intelligently and insightfully, rather than in a potentially destructive way of asking and making inane observations? "
562,What should we do when our 15 year old wants sex with his 13 year old girlfriend?,"So the other day I walked in on our teenager and caught his girlfriend with her pants down. It is quite clear what they were intending to do.   Now he claims he had no intention of having sex with her, he was just ""taking a look"". However, we all know where such behaviour inevitably leads.  I am really not sure where how to proceed.   He is 15, she is 13. It is against the law to have sex at that age. In 9 months time he will be 16 and she will still be 13. It will be even more against the law then.  Also it is quite clear to me that this girl is quite vulnerable. She comes from a broken and quite possibly violent home. Our son is adamant he loves her and only wants the best for her.  Everything about the situation is just bad in my book. However, I don't really see that there is much I can do to prevent it. I can tell him he isn't allowed to see her anymore. But that will truly ruin the relationship I have with him and they will see each other at school. Right now he says he has gone over to a friends house, but I am sure he is probably with her. I can't stop this from happening.  Do I provide him with contraceptives? Thus sending him the message that it is ok to have sex. At least it avoids pregnancy, but it isn't going to prevent the possible emotional turmoil that can come with hugely underaged sex.  Should I let her come round to our house again? Do I let them up into his room with the door closed? Trying to prevent the inevitable would just mean they will find other places to do it. Is that any better? At least it would reduce the number of times they could have sex.. Is that preferable?  What do I need to explain to him / talk to him about to help him act as responsibly as possible in this situation?  Thanks "
563,12 year-old son doesn't want to move to a new city,"I was recently offered a job in another city on the other side of the country. I was attracted to it because it represents a new adventure for the family and my wife is excited by the prospect. Additionally, my current company is in some financial trouble and is currently in negotiations to be acquired by another company, so the future of my position here is a bit uncertain right now.  My son, however, is not happy about the idea of moving. Normally I'd say that kids can always make new friends, but my son has always had a hard time making new friends. He has one relationship in particular that I'd hesitate to take from him. Not only are they close, but he's a good influence on him and we're good friends with the family too.  Realistically speaking, the job itself is not much of an advancement career-wise. The pay is only marginally better and the responsibilities are largely the same. The excitement is mostly because we've lived in this area for 20 years and a change of scenery would be exciting and new. I can honestly say that I wouldn't be so interested in this new position if it were local.  So my question is, how much weight should I give to my son's objections? I'm not normally one to let a 12 year-old decide what's best for the family, but this would represent a huge change for him right at a time in his life where big changes are scary and confusing.  Everyone in our families and most of our frieds say we should go for it. Is my concern for how my son feels about it overblown? "
564,Explaining sexual attraction,"So, my prepubescent daughters have pretty much got an idea about 'where babies come from', though their curiosity so far has only got them as far as how the baby gets out, not how 'Paolo' gets 'in'.  But explaining the mechanics is the easy bit. And we can do the 'when Daddy loves Mummy' stuff too. What worries me is reality. How do you answer - or preferably prepare your daughter in advance for:     ""Daddy, why is that man staring at my breasts?""   'Cos sex (in our western culture/media anyway) is not just about babies, nor just about love. It is also about pure unadulterated lust; money; advertising; sustained-bad-self-image-for-corporate-profit and a whole lot of other not-so-pretty-but-ultimately-unavoidable stuff.  Or am I over-thinking things? "
565,Balancing children's needs with a parent's own needs,"For me, as a new parent I found it difficult to find a balance between meeting the needs of my son and my own needs. I was inclined to view my own needs as being selfish and an inadequacy within me that equated to selfishness.  In my case, I grew up perceiving my mother to be very selfish, and as an older adult, I conclude that this was an accurate observation. This caused me to have a psychological dilemma when I felt the need to have activities or time for myself while caring for a young child. This was later exacerbated by the death of my husband, leaving me as the, truly, sole carer of three young children.  This was many years ago and I have since found such a balance, but I felt it would be a good question to help new parents struggling with this issue.  How can a parent realistically find a healthy balance between meeting the needs of their child/ren and their own needs? How does one evaluate their own desires as being reasonable or whether it crosses over into selfishness? "
566,How to stop my preschooler from constantly running away,"We have a very active 4-year-old.  She has a will of her own though with what she wants to do, and there's one thing in particular that I find I don't know what to do: she's constantly running away.  It's not that she's being mistreated or wants to ""get away"", she just wants to do her own thing.  We can be out for a walk, and we try letting her walk by herself instead of holding our hands, she's off running where she wants and won't listen to us to come back. Sometimes when doing this she'll find somewhere to hide, and think it's a game.  The new behavior (as of about a week ago): She can be playing in our fully fenced backyard, and on a whim, she'll climb over the fence and run over (and right into) a neighbor's house to play. So far it's consistently been one neighbor house that has children of a similar age, and they've started texting us when it happens.  When we catch her and ask her why, it's always ""because I wanted to"". We ask her ""are you allowed to run away / climb the fence / etc"", she always answers ""No, I get in trouble!"". We've tried explaining what the punishment will be next time (we ask her afterwards and she remembers) - it's ranged from no TV to no treats/desserts to favorite toys being taken away.  All have had no effect on her behavior.  She hears what we're saying and can paraphrase it back to us, but either she doesn't care, or constantly forgets when she's ""in the moment"", and then remembers when the punishment comes.  Short of constantly holding onto her and watching her like a hawk (to which she often ends up in a screaming fit), we are at our wits end.  What can we do? Has anyone else had children go through a phase like this and have possible options for addressing this problem?  (More context - she has an older brother (6) who did not go through this kind of phase; at 3 he understood he could go up ahead a bit, and on walks would always wait at the curb/lights. This is not our first child, but is our first time dealing with this problem.) "
567,Improving verbal learning,"We recently withdrew my six year-old son from public school and began educating him at home.  There are several reasons, both for him and his sister, but a big one is that he has a lot of difficulty with verbal learning, and teachers give a lot of verbal instructions.  We've read about different learning styles and incorporate them as much as possible, but everything we've read about learning styles talks about playing to the child's strengths, and nothing about developing their weaknesses.  In order for our son to succeed in college and/or a job he's going to need to get a lot better at following verbal instructions.  What techniques can we use to help our son improve at verbal learning?  How much time should we spend on that versus playing to his strengths? "
568,Should I invite non-parent friends to a 1-year old birthday party?,"I know the first birthday is something special for a child, but is not something that a kid will remember, so it's more of a party of the adults in his/her life to celebrate that they made it through the first year. Several of my friends have not had babies yet, or might not be planning to.    Should I restrict the guest list to other parents of babies/toddlers because it might be boring or not-fun for those who aren't immersed in our world of diapers and sippy cups? Or should I open it up and let people choose for themselves if they want to come? I'm not talking a ton of people, maybe inviting couples 6 with kids, 3 without...  2nd part of the question, is it snooty to say in the e-vite ""no gifts please, but you can make a donation to UNICEF in her name by clicking here""? "
569,"2 weeks old, sleeping, crying, eating","My baby is 2 weeks old (tomorrow) and I have a few questions:   He eats every 2 hours (not all the time, sometimes after 3, 3 and half hours), he eats 50ml, sometimes 60ml (most of the time it is a mother milk, but at the night he eats formula), is this ok ? He cries a lot when he is naked :) and he wants to sleep but instead of that he cries, need to worry about this ? Is it normal for baby to breath fast (not all the time, just after he eats and I put him in the bed)? He sleeps much more better in transporter and on my chest then in his own bed, is something I need to change?   Thanks for your help and I appreciate your advice. "
570,What is the proper way to praise the hardwork and patience of a child when she deserves it?,"The kid is 4 years old.   Since I have been on this site before she was born, I applied all the proper ways of talking and behaving with the child which are often advised here.  Now, the result is that this 4 year old is a very patient, quite hard working kid - when she's with me. She doesn't pay too much attention to her father's words many times because he doesn't act, just talks, doesn't follow up regularly.  Nearly zero tantrums. I have to tell her only once that she needs to keep all the blocks and toys that she threw around back in the box. She tells me to help which I do. She does her share of work very properly. She has empathy, says sorry when she needs to, helps to clean around the house when required, and has a great attention span too.  Goes to washroom herself, never has had accidents. We use diapers on her at night only because we don't want to bother ourselves.   Now, on such occasions, I say, ""You cleaned the room properly by putting all the toys in the box. You worked hard. Thanks for that! You indeed have a great patience"".   Problem is that she mostly always behaves properly. Punishing her is rarely required. No bribes have been given till date. I am feeling that I am praising her too much because of the great amount of proper behavior from her side.  I think she ""deserves"" the praise because as I have seen on this site, almost all the parents have been complaining of improper behavior and several types of problems with their own children of the same age. She's different.    Questions:   Will there be negative side effects of praising her hard work and patience every time she deserves it? What is the proper way to praise the hard work and patience of a child such that she doesn't start depending on my praises?  "
571,Time lapse between potty-training and poop-training?,"My three year old has been potty trained for about three months -he still wears pull-ups at night, but they are often dry, and during the day he wears underwear. However he will not yet poop in the potty. We have a good system where he lets me know he needs to poop and we switch out the underwear for a diaper and then he goes off by himself somewhere to do it, but he strongly resists trying first to go on the potty. He will come and sit if I ask, but he won't try to poop, he basically just sits there and fidgets for a couple of minutes and then says it isn't working and he needs a diaper. So a few questions, really: 1) about how long is the typical lapse between peeing in the potty and pooping in the potty? 2) is this a step that I can expect he will eventually choose to take on his own, or do I need to insist at some point that he do it? 3) what are ways in which I can encourage him to poop on the potty/what have others tried that has worked? We did stickers for peeing and that seemed to work really well, but the ""poop"" part of the chart has remained stubbornly blank.  I would greatly appreciate any insights! Thanks "
572,Should I reach out to my 5-year-old's absent father?,"My 5-year-old son is starting to ask questions and comment on the fact that he ""doesn't have a dad"". His biological father and I have not spoken in years, he last saw my son when he was 6/7 months old and has not made any attempt to reach out to me since.  I have allowed my son to ask questions and explained that ""some families have only moms, some only dads and some families have grandmas and grandpas. All families are different, all families are special."" I have also explained that my fiancé would like to be my son's dad and when he is ready, all he has to do is say so.  I am satisfied with this explanation and have left the door open for any more questions my son may ask and have explained to family he spends time with often what we have discussed so everyone is on the same page. However, one family member in particular feels the need to push me to reach out again to my son's bio in an attempt to get him involved. I feel like this is a bad idea and waste of time, if he wanted to be involved he would be right? Should I take the step of attempting to contact him (I have no idea where he is or how at this point) or do I leave it the way it is? "
573,Evidence that kids from big families are happier and better-functioning,"I have for a long time believed that kids with many siblings are happier and better-adjusted personally and socially, and that these outcomes increase with the number of siblings. Are there indeed any studies or other evidence indicating either correlation or causation between these factors?   Related: Is having a sibling better for a child? "
574,"My eldest is aware of ""an f-word"" but doesn't know what it is, should I tell him?","My eldest son is 6 years old. He's mentioned a few times that there are boys in the playground who ""know what the f-word is"" (his words). He knows it's a bad word and not to be said, but doesn't know the actual word itself. I'm concerned that by adding a layer of mystique and playground one-upmanship around the infamous f-word he's more likely to want to use it as and when he inevitably hears it, or hold those who use it in high esteem.  In the spirit of keeping an open dialogue about anything with my kids, I'm keen to talk to him about it, and tell him what the word is (perhaps not what it means), why it's not very nice and that it's no big deal whether someone knows it or not, because ultimately it's not a word that should be used in every day life (avoiding the ""it's a grown up word"" thing for fear of further adding weight to it).  Obviously this approach carries risks (he tells other kids, joins the ""i know the word"" club, or even starts using it).  I should add that he has a very strong sense of right and wrong, and I think it's important to trust him with this kind of thing (if I don't show that trust his judgement, how will he ever learn to?), but is it too much too soon? "
575,At what age should a child be able to differentiate basic homonyms in writing?,"This may be similar to At what age does the child start understanding the difference between the spoken words which have different meanings but sound same? but from a slightly different angle.  At what age should a child be able to use correctly in their written form the homonyms ""there"", ""their"" and ""they're""?  That is, at what age ought a child of normal ability, in a 'native, first language' English school, be able to differentiate terms such as these in their writing, and how to recognise if they're 'late' in learning this? "
576,How do I deal with rude or uncooperative siblings?,"This is a bit of a tricky one but here goes:  I'm in my mid-twenties and (for various reasons) currently live at home with both parents, my 15 year old sister, and my 17 year old brother. I regularly help out with family stuff - morning/afternoon school runs and other ""taxi services"" in particular - and, especially as there is a bit of an age gap, feel like I'm in an 'authoritative' position a lot of the time.  My problem is that both siblings can be very uncooperative, unpleasant and (in my sister's case) even rude or abusive at times, and there's a lot of friction whenever they need to do something they don't enjoy.  I completely understand that they're not my children, I'm not their parent and it's not my job to discipline them. However, I do still feel responsible for them in some ways and I do try to act as a role model for them.  I also don't want to insult the effort my parents have put into their (and my) upbringing but I sometimes feel as though they get away with whatever they like and there are few to no repercussions for bad behaviour. This has been going on for as long as I can remember and it's really starting to cause me a lot of stress and upset. I cannot wait until I can leave home but financially I have no idea when that's going to be possible.  I'm often late for work in the mornings because they simply don't get ready for school in time (they're late regardless of who takes them in the mornings) and being the messenger for requests like ""come down for dinner"" or even ""it's time to wake up"" is usually met with aggressive arguments and sometimes swearing and vocal abuse from my sister.  A few examples of their typical behaviour:   My sister rarely eats with the family at mealtimes and hasn't for several years now. If forced to she will be surly and uncommunicative, sometimes throwing tantrums, demanding to leave the table early, or simply storming off at some perceived insult. Usually she eats in her room or the sitting room and we put up with it because ""it's easier than having the argument"". My brother seems incapable of getting up in the morning. I have found a half-way solution in that I go into his room and keep pestering him until he gets out of bed and starts getting ready. This isn't fool-proof though as he has been known to get back into bed and fall asleep again when dressed. Am I wrong in imagining a 17 year old should be responsible enough to get themselves up in the morning? Both siblings are frequently unhappy, tired or feeling unwell. Unsurprisingly, when they feel like this they're more likely to snap or become aggressively argumentative. After having read some of the questions on the site, it almost seems like my sister is displaying many signs of Oppositional Defiant Disorder. She hates school and her other brother, she's angry most of the time, is usually generally argumentative and can take offence at almost anything.   Both siblings can be absolutely wonderful if they're in the right mood, but that is rare. I'm becoming increasingly concerned they have learned behaviours and attitudes that mean they will struggle in later life.  I would love to talk to my parents about this but I just don't know what to say or what suggestions to make. Especially without hurting their feelings or implying they're bad parents. Both of my parents are under a lot of pressure and stress at the moment and neither of them deal well with confrontational discussions about these sorts of things which makes things doubly difficult.  Hopefully this all makes sense!? I feel as though my siblings need to learn some self-discipline and become much more responsible for their actions and behaviours towards myself and others. However, I have no idea how to get them to cooperate and see this and getting my parents' help with this seems impossible. HELP! What can I do as a sibling to make everyone's life easier? "
577,Morning sickness symptoms,"I'm pregnant for the first time, and I've never really had morning sickness until recently.  What are the normal signs and symptoms of morning sickness?  What are some signs and symptoms I should look out for that would indicate that I should call my doctor?  Are there any foods that can affect the severity of morning sickness? "
578,At what age should my child sleep in his or her own room to greatest decrease the risk of SIDS?,"At what age should my child sleep in his or her own room to greatest decrease the risk of SIDS?   It sounds like the risk for SIDS is greatest at age 2-3 months or 2-4 months,  and that it is no longer classified as SIDS if the baby is 1 year old. So would the answer be after the first birthday, or second best, at 5 months or any later time?   The child is not known to be at greater risk for SIDS.   Please note that the parents do have a video baby monitor.   EDIT: I see why my question was ambiguous. I realize that moving the child to his/her own room does not seem to decrease the risk of SIDS. But if the chance of SIDS is reduced by having the child in the same room as the parents, when can I most safely move my child to his/her own room? I realize that this is likely a statistical probability question. "
579,How should my 8 year old son deal with a girl who hits him?,"My kid is 8 yrs old. This morning he asked me, ""Mummy, you told me if a girl hits you don't strike her back. Should I continue to get hittings from her just because she's a girl?""   I was unable to answer his question, but still I managed to tell him that when any girl does that just hold her hand tightly and then he asked, ""If she strikes from behind and bullies me then what should I do?""  Is there a recommended solution or set of actions? "
580,Which models / techniques could help me accelerate my child's intellectual development?,"this is my first question here, thanks for having me :) Apologies if this question seems to be a little bit subjective, let me try and more clearly define what I'm asking.  My first child (daughter) is due March 2019. Like all parents I want to ensure I'm doing everything I can to create an environment wherein she can psychologically and intellectually (and physically in terms of motor function) flourish to the maximum of her ability. My issue is, I know very little about developmental psychology and even less about pedagogy.  Particularly in reference to early years (but right up to UK secondary school age would be interesting to hear about), what are the popular models, frameworks or techniques that I should be reading about and trying to put into practice as a parent?  I am a fast reader and can handle in-depth explanations, but I'm aware that there is no absolute best way of doing things. I've read a LITTLE about John Piaget's work, which has led me to believe I should try and provide play activities that will encourage my daughter to investigate the properties of a range of objects and materials, but I guess I'm looking for guidance on any other leading theories with some practical advice on application.  I don't want to just keep buying meaningless 'toys' for my daughter, I want to know I'm doing my best to keep her ahead of (or at least not behind) the developmental curve. Obviously, I also realize that having general fun is part of being a child but I guess I want to make sure that fun is playing a part in her development as far as possible.  What should I be reading?  Thank you all so much and I look forward to your input. "
581,Toddler injured nose while playing,"My question is very similar to this one - My baby fell from the bed. Is there any problem?  My 18 months old son today injured his nose while playing, he was jumping up and down, lost balance, hit his nose. There was a small amount nose bleeding, and after that 10-20 seconds he was ok. He is actively playing again, and eating normally..  Now, I don't want to be that ""parent"" who takes their child to doctor for even small things, but this has me worried..He has done this before, but previously, he got injured on hand , lips etc., and not blood, just scrapes / minor cuts. I can clearly see what the problem is during those previous instances, but since it is nose this time, I am bit worried. Should I take him to doctor? "
582,Why does my 4 month old playful infant suddenly start screaming at the top of her voice?,"This is not a normal cry.   This cry indicates extreme sudden pain.     For example: If you were sitting peacefully somewhere and someone threw burning coals on your body, how would you scream?  She is swaddled and fed, then she goes to sleep, peacefully for an hour or so. Then all of a sudden she starts screaming like I described above. This has started happening frequently now.   Yesterday she was awake, happy, and gurgling merrily, and then the incident happened.  Though after some minutes she does calm down, but I am worried. What could be the cause? "
583,What should I do when my parents drain all my energy?,"I'm 18, almost 19 and I've been dealing with my parents' negativity as far as I remember myself. I'm currently a game programmer, something that isn't from the easiest. Still I manage perfectly to cope with it.  (Long story short) of the power of infinity, my parents always moan about me not communcating enough with them and not contancting them very often. I completely understand them but here comes the funny part. Every time we talk, we loop over same things all over and over again, like how hard life is, they not having enough time to do the things they want(a note, my mam is all day long in front of the tv, washing her brains out every single second more and more). If you have heard about back pain or joints pain in general in your life, trust me it's not enough! You have to hear how my parents are talking! They have everything actually... pretty much enough money, free time, everything that a person needs to live perfectly. Still this isn't noticed. Only the negative, which sometimes isn't actually that negative, just the way they present it....  I know I shoudn't try to change people at all but what if these people are my family and I want to get the best of life? I guess you would say smth like ""well then don't pay so much attention to it"". Okay that simple. But what about the emotions I get from them, being so negative, after all they are my family I don't want them to feel bad at all. But like I mentioned above I'm in a very competitive industry, where you cannot afford to waste time on useless talks, especially negative ones, which not only don't have any pros but also have many cons.  Every time I talk with them I leave with my head down, tired and disguisted of all the negativity they've got or I get away very angry, thinking about the scandals for days after. I am so lucky to have an amazing gf, who supports me in everything I do, especially in these hard times I have with my parents but still sometimes I feel that I disassemble her with my problems. I.e. one day she wakes up, I've woken up before her, have talked with my parents and in order to avoid having arguments with her I share everything that happened with me and them. This way, despite the advantages of doing this, she gets part of the negative energy that flows in our family and I HATE THIS! The worst thing of all I hate is their ""useful"" advices, even when I don't ask them for any. How I should be cautios about my diplomas and so on. How many cheaters in life there are, which is the reason why they haven't succeeded in life. haha because of the cheaters, this is so funny! They have excuses for every single failure of theirs. Still they manage to criticise me for doing the ""wrong"" thing every time my opinion doesn't match with theirs.  Another thing is GUILT. Many times I've tried just to ignore the things they tell me to do but then the next time we talk the following answers come along: Did you do this, did you do that? Why didn't you do it? Why did you do this? Why didn't you listen to us, don't you think we're right. They have smth like a desease for being the right people always... The problem is they never learn. I don't want to be offensive or rude or smth but they really have stopped growing since the age of 15 or so. They are almost 50 now. Or when I just don't call them because I don't want to get irritated and influenced with another bucnh of negative news, they are like ""hey you don't even think about us anymore"". Okkayyyy seriously totally understand them, but howwwww am I supposed to communcate with them??? I don't want to become like them. (Just a note I've been trying to listen to them, be patient and so on. This was the worst time in my life. I became exactly like them. Negative. Totally negative) So I ain't trying this no more....  Please help me out with this, I've never been feeling so confused in my life and drained! The problem, at least the main one, is that they have the attitude of knowing everything or enough to get the best out of their lives and do not try to improve at all. Also wanting me to change, to be like them, to live their lives, the way they would like to have lived them Long story short my family has always had everything needed to live happily but never have had! What should I do now?  P.S there are many more details that need to be written in order for you to at least partly understand my situation but I think this is completely enough for now. Please dear community help me! Also if anybody thinks that could really help me but need more info there is my email- v.marinov96@gmail.com  UPDATE1: [website]"

585,1 year refuses new food and throws a fit if we don't give him what he wants,"My son, who is 1, is having a hard time making progress with his eating.  There are a limited amount of things that he eats (e.g. bread, cereal, crackers, baby food) and he doesn't like to try new food.  Generally, our dinner routine goes like this:   We give him the food that we think he should be eating He refuses to try the new food He cries because he wants the food he is comfortable with We try to encourage him, give him different options, let him play with his utensils, etc He keeps crying Eventually, we give him the food that he wants to eat   Is it better to give him the food that he wants to eat or to hold firm and only offer him the food that he should be eating? We are currently caving and giving him bread / baby food. Are we encouraging bad habits? I'm a little concerned that he knows if he throws a big enough fit that he'll get the food he wants and can therefore get away with not eating the other food. If we were to hold firm, he would still get a bottle so he wouldn't go hungry...  Note that we will be switching from the bottle to cow's milk in a couple of weeks, we are following a schedule made by his pediatrician in that regard. "
586,Is it okay for two 6- and 9-year-olds to share a bedroom with their 18-year-old step-brother?,I have two 6- and a 9-year-old sons. They live with their father. I have found out that they share a bedroom with their 18-year-old step-brother there. The 18-year-old plays videogames rated 16+ and 18+. Their father allows our boys to watch him play these games. And their father messaged me that he isn't stopping his 18-year-old playing this sort of games. We are going through courts to get my boys with me. At my house we have my boys staying over for the weekend and we don't allow them to play or watch such videogames.  Is it okay for an 18-year-old to share a bedroom with 6- and 9-year-olds? Is this allowed in the UK? 
587,Just found out pregnant and smoked marijuana,"I just found out I am pregnant and I am 11 weeks. I am embarrassed to admit I smoked marijuana (casually, not everyday) until I found out a few days ago. Aside from the health risks for my child, I am hearing that even though it's early on, the child could test positive for THC come time for labor. Is this true? I will not touch the stuff now and won't for the duration of my pregnancy. Is it possible they will find THC and is it mandatory for the baby to be drug tested in Florida? "
588,Night time potty training for four years old,"Our 4 years old son is very good at using toilet during the day, but he still wets his nappy more often than not (he wears nappies only for the night). He doesn't seem to be bothered about this at all. What is the best way to train him not to use the nappy during the night? And when is the best time to do it? "
589,How do we discourage reliance on technology while allowing children to become accustomed to digital tools?,"this is a question I struggle assessing myself as a programmer.   It's already key to understand computer science. It is and will continue to be even more increasingly important that our children are at ease with computer interfaces as society continues to provide information and services online.   I'll be honest, as a programmer I view skills like coding or even computer use in general, for research for example, to be really important moving forward, but we all know the child who destroyed their life playing games to no end.  Can anybody suggest an approach to teaching the utility of digital technology ( I do feel it is learn early and a cultural thing, I recognise a circle as a power button, my mother does not) without developing more social media dependant sheep??   I hear about children under ten demanding smart phones for Xmas, to me it just seems that nature is now forgotten, but on the other hand using computers is a skill as valuable as arithmetic.   How have you reconciled this in your parent child relationships? Thanks all for your input! "
590,How and when should I tell my son that his amazing father isn't his biological father?,"My son is going on 5 and starting to learn a lot about how we're created. I've been with my husband for 10 years, but nearly 6 years ago I had no other choice but to move 1000 miles away and after trying the long distance thing it didn't work so we split up.   I ended up going through a rough patch and started dating an abusive jerk. After a year I was pregnant. He threatened me trying to force me to have an abortion and I refused. His grandmother was chief of police and he scared me into moving back to Florida.  Eventually, when I was 4 months along in my pregnancy my husband and I picked up right where we left off. He loved me so much and accepted our son as if he was his own and has done an amazing job at raising him.   He enrolled in college while I was pregnant, got us a house and went above and beyond to care for us both (as after giving birth I became very ill due to rare brain and spine conditions). I've always tried to do right by my son. Since day one, even while with my husband, I tried to keep the sperm donor involved. But he wanted no part of his son.  My husband stepped up when the biological father refused. The biological father would pretend that he cared, only to tell me he never cared about him anyway and was just trying to manipulate me into stopping child support (which I did anyway after the first year: I felt it wasn't right to take his money when my son had a dad who loved, supported and wanted him from the beginning).  This is a very long story so I'll try and make it not so much of a novel. The sperm donor has made it very clear he wants nothing ever to do with my son. My husband has been Dad since the moment my son entered this world. I've always planned to tell my son as early as possible. I think now, or in a few years, it won't be as hard on him compared to us telling him when he's a teen and who knows how he'd handle it.   I just don't know what to do. We have an extremely happy loving family. My son adores his dad. We never argue, we have a very happy non-dysfunctional marriage. I just feel we have a very special family. But I refuse to lie to my son. What if we wait and someone else maliciously tells him? Or if, when he's older and finds out, he spirals out of control?  I'm so confused, I just want to do the right thing and desperately need advice. Especially from others who have been through similar circumstances. We're planning on meeting with therapists and I guess child development specialists, if someone could also point me in the right direction for what type of doctor is best suited in this situation.   Also my son is very happy. He has a wonderful life and I feel as if he would do fine, knowing how much he loves his dad and just beginning to really grasp the concept of life. I don't think it would change anything for him, if that makes sense. I've been worrying over this for 5 years and really need some answers! "
591,Strong Grandmother Attachment,"I have a 2-year-old granddaughter who is so attached to me she will resist her mother, sometimes very strongly. My concern is my daughter's feelings. She already feels guilty enough for working. I kept this grandchild at home for the first 6 months of her life to avoid early daycare. At first I thought it would be a passing thing but it seems to be getting stronger. I don't live close so I visit about every 2-3 weeks for a couple of days. When I'm not there, things are fine. Is this normal? Could it be that I am more relaxed and have the time to play with her that is driving this? This really seems more intense than I remember with my own kids. "
592,Is it okay to reuse disposable bottle nipples?,"We were sent home from the hospital with some small botttles and (regular sized?) nipple tops that came individually wrapped in sterile packaging that says ""use once"".  We got a few bottles at the shower but all are wide mouth and way too large for our new born.  Is it okay to reuse these nipples by washing them and throw these nipples in a pot of boiling water with the bottles?  Is there a reason I should not do this? "
593,How to deal with a teenager who wants his parents to buy him everything his friends have?,"How do I teach my son the value of money and to differentiate between a need and a want?  The problem I am facing is that he is 19 years old, not 5 years old. He is my youngest son and to be honest I do not get along well with him due to personality differences and his stubborness.  Whenever he sees his friends have something, he wants it also -- ranging from clothes, latest smartphones etc. Due to his exposure to friends from high school and university that come from high income families, he always tries to fit in and dress nicely like them, buying expensive clothing and accessories when my family is just a middle class family; we can occasionally pamper him a bit but his spending is just outrageous. He always pesters my wife for more money, her being too loving of a mother she always gives in to him and gives him additional pocket money.  Recently I had another arguement with him. He is in university now and he sees some people in his university driving cars to class (he takes public transport). He calls me up and asks me to buy him a car. His thinking is: If other families can buy their children cars to drive to university, if my parents can afford to get me a car, why can't I have a car?  I do not think that a car is necessary in a city that has a good public transport system and it is only a short ride from where he is staying to the university. I explained it to him, telling him it is spending money unnecessarily and what I have written above. He refuses to listen (showing his stubborness), getting angry on the phone and we will not be talking to each other for a few days.  This kind of situations have happened frequently whenever he does not get what he want. All the times I have denied him what he wants, is because it is for his own good and it is a want and not a need. And additionally, we are not rich as his friends are so we can't be splashing cash so freely. It fustrates me because his thinking and mindset is too ""straightforward"", he refuses to look at things in life from another angle.  How do I deal with him? Because I am always trying to talk some sense into him, but it seems like I am hitting a brick wall whenever I speak to him. I have four other kids and none of them caused me these problems before! I never really needed to educate them and they all know the value of money! "
594,"What does it mean to ""teach a child as teaching an adult...""?","In this video (Alan Watts - On Education and Disney Land), Alan Watts says ""teach a child as teaching an adult rather than let the child learn Mickey Mouse"" but he doesn't say the reason why.  What does Alan Watts mean when he says, ""teach a child as teaching an adult rather than let the child learn Mickey Mouse""? "
595,Why is it important to support a newborn's neck?,"Newborns have such floppy necks that they need support while being held. The question I have about this is, what are we trying to protect in supporting the head/neck ? My wife and I have a few possible ideas about this but aren't sure which (if any) are accurate.   You want to support the neck/head to prevent the head from moving in an uncontrolled way, which could damage the brain. Neck support could prevent the neck from being injured somehow. For example, if the neck is tilted to one side and a sudden muscle spasm pulls the head in the other direction, the baby could pull a muscle or something like that. Head/neck support might just be a way of stabilizing baby to make him easier to hold, and less prone to ""jumping"" out of one's arms.   Or perhaps there is another reason entirely ? "
596,How harmful is a kid's habit of crossing the toes?,"Our 3-year-old son has developed a habit to cross his second toe underneath the big toe. He does it all the time and claims that it feels more comfortable like that. We worry that, in the long run, this habit might deform his feet.   How can we convince a young kid to stop such a habit? Is it even something to worry about? Maybe it just makes his toes more flexible without causing any harm?  "
597,Should I allow or forbid my son to visit the education of a religion that I do not share?,"I'm an Agnostic. When the topic comes to religion, I try to explain to my seven-year-old son what religious persons believe and why I don't share that belief. Until recently, he shared my scepticism.  Where we live (Germany), pupils in elementary school must visit two hours per week of either religious education (""Religion""), offered by the churches, or an alternative. For older children, the alternative is usually ethics, for elementary school children it is often a supervised quiet work time, where pupils are given more or less boring extra exercises that will keep them busy for the time the other kids are in their religious class. Common offerings for religious education are Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, and Muslim.  Since most of my son's friends visit the Catholic class, and since the quiet work time is uninspiring, my son decided (without consulting his parents) to visit the Catholic class instead. The Catholic teacher allowed this, and I learned of my son's decision when he told me of it a week or two after this change had been implemented.  My son loves this class. The children sing a lot, and my son loves to sing these songs at home (""God loves all children..."" is his favourite). If they don't sing, the teacher tells wonderful stories that impress my son who is generally very enamored of fantastic stories: he loves The Hobbit, Star Wars and LEGO Chima, and somehow the Biblical tales seem like fantasy come real to him.  My son has given himself a broad education (his teachers and parents are only the facilitators that help him gain the knowledge he seeks, e.g. by reading to him what he cannot or by answering his questions). He is very interested in everything from the natural sciences to history. One of his favourite topics are the Romans (a context, in which I explained to him the formation and development of Christianity), another are the Vikings, Celts and Germanic tribes.  He has been visiting the Catholic class for about half a year now, and last week, after we had watched a documentary on how the Christian faith spread to the Viking north and I said something about how ""God does not exist"", he told me that their teacher had explained how ""during Roman times people understood that the other gods do not exist, but that only God does"". A short exchange ensuing from this statement gave me the impression that my son is slowly acquiring a Christian faith.  As I stated initially, I am an Agnostic. I do not know whether God exists. And I liked to believe that I was open to my son finding his own answers to this question. But this development bothers be. Not because my son might find faith. But because his immaturity and gullibility are exploited by an institution (the Catholic church in the person of my son's religion teacher) to indoctrinate my son. Studies have shown that belief is most prevalent and most strong in persons who have been taught that belief as children. A clear indication that what most people see as their ""belief"" is mostly unquestioned habituation.  I am open to my son educating himself and coming to a different conclusion that I did. But I actually feel violated by my son being ""made"" to believe by singing songs and listening to charming tales. What I feel is similar to a parent worrying about what watching pornography will do to their children's adult sexuality. Or what playing violent videogames will do to their anger management:  I feel that the freedom to decide is taken away from my son.  But at the same time it was my son who decided to go to that class. And he loves it. So who am I to take that freedom and joy away from him?  I certainly don't think that believing in God would in any way harm my son. I even know from numerous studies that religious faith is a strong factor in finding a happy life. So there seems to be nothing that I need to protect my son from. On the other hand, believing that the Earth is flat wouldn't harm my son either – but is that a reason to let him believe such nonsense? To me, religion is on the same level with any other superstition, from not stepping on the cracks between flagstones to Santa Claus. I cannot quite understand why any adult would believe in something so clearly made up as a god.  So what do you think I should do? I would greatly appreciate your feedback on this.  If you are a religious person, it might help you with finding an answer to my question if you would imagine your child visiting the religious education of another, fundamentally different religion, or avoiding religious education altogether and visiting an atheist or agnostic class instead. Would you let them, if they wanted to and enjoyed it? Or would you want to enforce your own faith or at least protect them from the indoctrination until they are old enough to separate the singing from the believing? And how would you argue for it (apart from your belief that you know the truth)?    In response to some of the comments and answers, I'd like to add:  Intellectually, I'm an agnostic. Emotionally, I'm a torn atheist. Just like many religious people are filled with a painful doubt, or doubters with a secret belief, I don't know whether God exists, but believe, he doesn't. I'm only human, and it is difficult to refrain from believing anything. My stance is with Stanislaw Lem in this matter, who was open to be convinced, but hadn't yet encountered a convincing clue, and in the absence of evidence, chose not to believe. Also, despite my worried question, religion plays no role whatsoever in my day-to-day life. I don't usually think, much less worry, about the existence of God at all.  Reading your thought inspiring feedback has helped me become a bit more clear about what worries me.  What worries me is not that my son might come to believe in God. What worries me is that he is made to believe by habituation. But even that is not what I'm most afraid of. What worries me most is that my son will be taught those aspects of Christian morality that I find unwholesome (such as the concept of sin and the views on sexuality).    This question is not about how or whether to teach my son about Christian or any other faith. It is about how to deal with a situation where my son wants to partake in schooling that he enjoys for social reasons (his friends are there) but that conflicts with my values.    Update [March 2015]  From the large number of views, comments and answers this question has attracted, it is evident that many people share my concerns. This confirms my feeling that I should make a conscious decision and not just laissez faire.  After careful consideration of all the wonderful answers and comments you were so generous to share with me, and a lot of soul-searching to become clearer about what bothers me and what I would ideally wish, I have come to the following insights:   Religion does not play any role at all in my day to day life. My son is in this class not because he is interested in religion, but because of his friends.  Or in other words, he did not currently ask about religion, and there is not need to force that explanation on him now. A person can learn about anything at any time in life. There is no need to learn about religion at the age of seven.   ergo  I would prefer for my son to not encounter religion at all, unless he becomes curious by himself.  Since he so enjoys this class, I will let him visit it until the end of this school year, as corsiKa suggested in her answer. During these months I will complement his Catholic education in the manner suggested by Steve Jessop in his answer.  Next year I will tell his teachers that I do not want him to visit the religion class and find something interesting for him to do during quiet work time, as suggested by user3791372.    There were many other answers (e.g. by anongoodnurse, Kyle Strand, Joe, Guntram Blohm, CreationEdge, Marianne013, anonymous, and Cort Ammon) and comments that I found helpful and I have upvoted them all. I choose Steve Jessop's answer, because it addresses the aspect I am most concerned about.  Thank you all!    Second Update [August 2016]  My son has visited Catholic religious class for two years now. Contrary to my intention I let him continue to visit this class, because he so loves to be with his friends, and the alternative is just too boring.  I did pick up a couple of books on ancient and world religions as well as philosophy for kids from the library, and I read to him from them for a few weeks and discussed what we read, until stuff began to repeat and we both got bored by it.  I will let my son continue to visit the religious class next year, but I plan to make him visit Ethics when it is offered in high school the year after that.  My impression is that visiting the religious education did not turn my son into a believer. There was a phase when all the singing and tales of a kind, loving God got to him, but he has grown and developed and I think that his basic curiosity and scepticism are keeping the upper hand in the long run.  Certainly some ideas will have taken root in him, but it is still too early to know how they will influence his life in the long run. "
598,Should I tell my son about his bio dad / sperm donor?,"I have been a single mom to my one and only son who is now 8 years old. He has never met his biological father/ sperm donor.   My question is should I tell my son about him?   Up to this point he has never missed him nor asked me about him. I met my fiancé about a year ago who has no children nor has ever been married. He loves my son very much, and my son calls him daddy. But his youngest sibling told my son he was not his dad.   I don't know whether or not I should tell my son about sperm donor? He willingly signed his rights over a month after my son was born without ever meeting him. He moved in with his mother's next door neighbor and never paid for our divorce or nothing concerning my child.   What should I do? The last thing I want is to hurt my son by telling him the sperm donor did not care to ever meet him, but I also don't want to lie to  him and make him want to meet him.  "
599,Ways to automatically swing or rock a baby,"An idea that comes to my mind to swing a baby swing automatically is using a CD drive eject - close function , I have several such Drives I dont use and I dont want to use a computer to  do the periodic control eject \ close. Can it be done without a controller or just a simple circuit?  Also, are there any other ways to make the swing automatic , what I need is just a back and forth motion to couple it with the swing?  Here is the typical swing:    Also we have a  rocker like one below can it also be automatized?   Note: Some babies wont just sleep unless they are swinged\rocked continuously hence the question. And I know automated stuff is available but we already have these non automatic stuff.  Update:  I had asked a similar question here "
600,How should parents handle disagreement over medicine?,"I don't believe in homeopathy1), but my wife does. Regardless of your personal stance on this, I'd like to know what are good ways to resolve a disagreement on homeopathy?  I know the underlying science is discussed over at Skeptics.SE but I am not asking about the science -- I am asking how resolving the conflict between the parents.  My wife takes after her mother and gives our 2yo son homeopathic stuff when he's ill. I have two problems with that:   Homeopathy is not medicine. It has no active ingredients. If my son is not really ill but in slight discomfort (e.g. mild coughing), then I let my wife do her thing to avoid unnecessary conflict and let any potential placebo effect work. But if he's ill enough to need actual medicine, then I make sure he gets it. I don't trust placebo to cure actual illnesses. I see that my son cannot tell the difference between homeopathy and real medicine. I fear this might cause him to ingest real medicine at some point when we're not looking, because he hasn't understood that it might be dangerous. If I allow him to beg for homeopathy (essentially small sugar pills) and mommy gives in to the begging, then what's to stop him from doing the same with real medicine?   I am particularly worried because our pediatrician prefers homeopathic treatments as a first step (which inexplicably seems to be legal where we live) and will only ramp up to ""real"" medicine if the condition gets worse. That kind of thinking is what killed Steve Jobs. I feel that Austria is kind of the Dark Ages of medicine and I'm the only one who's discovered modern science.    1) I know there are million arguments for and against homeopathy. One very public opponent is James Randi, but to me he's just a useful figurehead for the general science-based notion that it's a hoax. "
601,frustrated and confused- my 5 yr. old is acting out and nothing we do at home seems to help,"My daughter is 5 yrs old. She is a very sweet little girl who normally is very much a people pleaser- she likes to do things that make you happy. However recently she has has issues in school- she told a little boy that her daddy was going to come to school and shoot him (which from my understanding was completely out of the blue as they were not even talking or playing near each other) and today a few weeks later she went up and punched the same boy in the nose.   According to her teacher she is fine with all the other kids and her ""behavior in class has improved greatly over the last month or so (meaning following the rules, not talking, staying on task, etc...). My first thought was that there had to be something more to what happened the fist time because that is just not like my daughter to go up and threaten someone, she is a very sweet and loving little girl but now she has punched this kid in the nose for no reason and when I asked her about it she said ""I didn't want too, I just did""  I am 14 weeks pregnant and now freaking out that one of two things is going on, neither of which is acceptable- either I'm doing something wrong as a parent- too strict, not strict enough, too much freedom for not enough, not enough ""I love you""s or something or I am raising a bad egg and that I refuse to believe but I'm scared   ""I didn't want too , I just did"".... is it because I'm pregnant? Is she not getting enough attention? Is it because she actually really likes this boy?  She is 5 years old and fixing to get herself kicked out of school....   I swear she is not a malicious person and she knew right away that she messed up because she told the kid sorry immediately..... but she is doing things she knows are wrong and I am doing everything I can and trying to take every opportunity to point out good and bad/ right and wrong  but apparently it is not doing any good..... and I am at my wit's end on what to do or how to help this from happening again.

602,How to handle post traumatic stress with my 6yr old daughter?,"4 weeks ago some weirdo shot at my balcony (probably for fun) with a gun used for practice. Anyway, the glass of my balcony door broke. At the same time my daughter of 6 was sitting just next to it, having her dinner. Of course that scared her a lot. My wife was at home at that time and took care of her immediately.   Since then my daughter is generally scared to be alone. She wasn't before. Almost every night (she sleeps at 9pm), she wakes up at 3 or 4am (sometimes earlier) and comes to our bed and continues her sleep. She wasn't doing this before. Whenever something is suddenly heard (like the beep sound of the oven) in the house, she is startled. In general since then she is startled very easily.  I must mention that her social interactions haven't been affected that much (for example at school, her friends or her teachers see no difference in her behaviour whatsoever).   Should we be worried? We don't know how to handle a situation like this. Any advice? "
603,How much should a caretaker push for mannered greetings and farewells from a pre-schooler?,"I care for a three-year-old child that is generally very well mannered and a joy to care for.  He takes after his dad in his morning attitude though (both of them need a little time to ""wake-up"" even after they are awake.  Of course, his Dad still has good manners, but is self- admitting that his son takes after him in this realm).   I'm okay with giving the three-year-old a little time (after-all, he is three) before he has to greet me politely - I know he will once that little brain switches on and then it is go go go with all kinds of love and good manners until about half an hour before nap-time.  However, the boy's parents are (rightfully and I am thankful for this) very concerned that he exhibit good manners toward me as well as themselves even right at the time of waking.  Should he get 20-30 minutes grace period while transitioning from sleep to wake-fullness AND transitioning from mom and dad to me all at the same time?  All he does for this first thirty minutes after waking up is watch a cartoon and hug mommy and daddy good-bye (and on some mornings - though not consistently, argue with mom and dad about whether he should say good morning to any of us yet).    I think it is important to understand - I get this kid, I set my alarm half an hour earlier than everyone else in the house, so I can have a little time to wake without having to talk to anyone as an adult (of course if someone is up, I can say good morning and still function politely, but I am also not a three-year-old boy).  Once it is time to have breakfast and get dressed, then of course it is down to business and I fully expect manners - I guess I see this cartoon 30 minutes as a sort of extension of his sleep and don't mind if he pretends I'm not there until the TV goes off and he is saying good-bye to mom and dad.  I have not contradicted the parents, but I also am choosing not to join in at this point either.  I feel like it is a losing battle, and it starts the morning with a bunch of stress for everyone.  I wind up awkwardly being there waiting for the ""good morning""  he just isn't ready to give.  Thoughts? "
604,Bed gets wet nearly each night although diaper is worn,"Our 5 (nearly 6) year old son has had problems with potty training for a long time now.  When he sleeps at night, he wears diapers, as he is not aware of peeing during the night yet and does not wake up in time. So far that's ok, we've contacted a specialised doctor and it seems to be normal that some children take longer until they learn how to control that.  The practical problem:  Even though he wears diapers (slip type, which he can put on by himself) in the night, it happens very often (sometimes daily) that the bed is really wet when he awakes in the morning.  My question:   might it be the wrong diapers? can anything be wrong with how he puts on the diapers? (We've tought him to make sure that the penis does not point upwards and that seems not to be the case.) did anyone else have a similar problem and has a solution that worked for them?     Remarks:   we already try to reduce the amount of drinking during the evening meal  we already send him to the toilet directly after the evening meal and a second time later before he really goes to bed. He sleeps about 11 hours. sure we use water-proof layers to protect the mattress, but exchanging and washing this layer and the fitted sheet nearly each day is quite a lot of work.  waking him up in the night for going to the toilet is quite difficult. He normally sleeps very soundly and when I try to wake him up for going to toilet he is kind of confused and mostly angry/grumpy. he is sleeping in a loft bed which makes both waking him up or replacing sheets quite difficult     Important addendum: Toilet training for the night and medical aspects  In case you're having the same problem, one more remark might be important:  For our problems with encopresis and enuresis, which do last for years already, we consulted a doctor, specialized in this topic and still are in regular contact with her.   Concerning bed wetting in the night (and not at all waking up before to go to the toilet) she said:  Children do have to develop the hormonal processes which make them wake up if they need to urinate during their sleep. Some do earlier, some do later, but you definitely can not ""teach"" them to wake up in the night! That's why a solution with a sensor in his pants which gives an alarm to wake him up will most probably not make sense yet.  Hormone therapy  The only working solution here at this stage would be a hormone therapy, which suppresses the production of urine during the night (if I am not mistaken) and therefore reduces the urge to urinate.     That would be working instantly  and could apparently also be used punctually, e. g. if the child is sleeping at a friend's house or at a school camp)  but she would not recommend to use it permanently at this age (6) without urgent reasons (!)    and we also do prefer washing bed sheets over feeding our child hormones to avoid that.    (So for the given reasons we did not try that medicament yet.)    (EDIT) 2 years later  the situation has not changed. He is about 8.5 years now and still needs a diaper each night. To avoid an ""overload"" of the diaper, we wake him up and send him to the toilet once per night between midnight and 2 AM. That way, we can avoid the bed getting wet regularly and reduces the laundry dramatically. It is still difficult to wake him up, but he has become used to it and is cooperative most times (and only rarely reacts angrily).  And for sure he still goes to the bathroom again, directly before going to bed around 8 PM.   We could not find a fixed scheme, at which time in the night he urinates. Mostly, the diaper is still dry when we wake him up, but sometimes it is not. And mostly the diaper will then still be dry in the morning, but sometimes it isn't. I think the composition of diner and what/how much he has drunk in the evening has a major effect. "
605,Can contact with cat feces be harmful for pregnant women?,"Is it true that coming into contact with cat feces can harm the unborn baby of pregnant women, whether by a mishap handling kitty litter or gardening in an area where cats may have relieved themselves?

How to approach a child differently in order to get their interest?,My mom and I are having a lot of struggle with my little sister. She is 12 years old and all of her life we have had a lot of trouble to try and get her into any activity at all. Currently she is in swimming and guitar. We are trying to expand the activities to karate and perhaps even a summer camp. She is throwing fits about not wanting to join anything else. She doesn't enjoy swimming all that much so we are trying to find something new. We got her to do a practice karate session and afterwards she cried and screamed about not wanting to join even though she had a good time. Any other sport or activity we suggest she immediately refuses and throws a temper tantrum. What can we do to help her want to join activities in a more positive manner? We don't want to argue with her every time for any activity anymore. Can anyone please help us? 
607,Framework for letting 9yo get access without hard time limits,"My 9-year-old is in this situation concerning media:   She has limited access to a family PC (restricted account with a time limit of X minutes per day). She uses that for Youtube and Minecraft. She has a Nintendo Switch (again, with a daily time limit and parental controls in place). She sometimes gets games as present, and has to buy further games from her pocket money. No trouble here - she does not have that many games, and does not really want anymore either. Minecraft+Mario more or less do it for her. She plays appropriate co-op games together with me on the PC (e.g., Humans Fall Flat, Trine etc.), which does not count against her time limit. Games are not per se a bad thing in our family and there is no ""bad taste"" about them. She has no online identity of any kind (i.e., no account with which she can chat etc., anywhere). There is no TV (sure BlueRay/DVD, but no classical TV/Netflix/etc. except for Youtube); and she's not missing that - never experienced it.   But right now, she's hitting that age where everybody else has ""everything"" (laptops, tablets, smartphones, YouTube accounts, ...) and she has ""nothing"". It is in fact true that she sees those devices all around her - her (almost adult) sibling obviously has an unlimited smartphone; I do; and most of her friends have some kind of device (usually consoles/tablets, and occasionally smartphones).  The issue is not so much the technology or even prices (yesterdays devices are cheap enough on ebay and would be more than sufficient), but about her getting very much frustrated by the fact that there are these limitations imposed upon her (time limits, parental controls...). It is also not about wanting to have longer time limits at all; it is about owning stuff (devices, accounts, the power to decide when and what to do).  The reason why I employ those controls are:   I do trust her completely that she would not knowingly do something ""bad"". I.e., she has earned this trust over and over again in the past in everything she does in the digital and analog world. But I also do know fully well that she still has the normal children naivete/gullibility and is not ready yet for, for example, social media; i.e., if she gets a friend request in some online game, she is exceedingly happy about having a friend; she cannot yet distinguish what that word means in an online setting from what a real friend is. I am not trusting her not to divulge sensitive information quite yet; and also I am just a bit loath to devalue the concept of friendship in any way - she is not having an easy time building friendship with same-old real-world acquaintances (she has one actual friend, but it's labour to keep it that way...).  I know from experience that when I do relinquish the time limits (e.g., during holidays), she will more or less be online full-time, and do nothing else anymore; with all associated effects (being irritable, ""down"" etc.). The pull of that medium is all to irresistible, and again, I know from own experience how that works. Frankly, I want to protect her from that as long as humanly possible. Aside from being creative and tinkering around with all kinds of stuff (cardboard, ""slime"" etc.), she has no other hobbies (sports, instrument etc.). I want to give her some ""downtime"" from the stuff that would consumer her complete time so that there is some chance for her to develop an interest in a real-world skill, which, as we know, are easiest to obtain in the age bracket she is entering now. I would not force some hobby on her; I did and do offer her things regularly (i.e., encourage her to test out hobbies; go to trial days together with her etc.) and so far there was nothing which really sparked her interest. But I'm pretty sure from what I am seeing around me in other families that if her time is consumed by devices, there is little to no chance that something will develop.   With her older sister, we were very happy with waiting until 13 years until she had her first PC (restricted), and 15 until the first unrestricted smartphone; and having all limits be mostly technical instead of constant ""manual"" fighting over time removed all cause of day-to-day conflict. That one was hardly interested in anything though, so there was really no problem to solve, at all.  But this time around, the world has moved on, and continuing like this for 4 more years seems counterproductive - she is getting the feeling right now that she is being suppressed compared to others, that we are intentionally ""mean"" to her etc. Yes, I do know that kids know how to ""play"" their parents, but there certainly is something more going on in her mind currently, and there would be a good point in time to grow, right now.  I would love her to have complete ownership and accountability/responsibility for her stuff, and it would be great for her development, I think. I'm more or less just looking for a kind of ""framework"" to get this up and running smoothly, without falling into the obvious parental traps...  How do you do that with your children? Did you have a good solution? Did it work? Do you just give them free access and manage all the issues that may or may not crop up in the old-fashioned way? "
608,How do you address the bullying at the daycare your child tells you about?,"My wife and I put our child through daycare. There's a child with issues, who has only been there for a few months. Lately, our daughter has been telling us what that other child has been doing.   We know this is a child that may have an issue and we try to teach our child how to play well with others, but today my child tells me she heard that other child threatening the teacher (telling her, he was going to cut her). This isn't the first time and that other child has gotten in trouble for hitting and throwing tempers but I think a line needs to be drawn.  So my question is how do I address this issue?     How do I approach the daycare? Should I give the daycare and ultimatum? My child has been at the daycare awhile. Should I look into another daycare if the issue is not resolved?  "
609,How do you investigate what's going on in the pre-kindergarten classroom?,"For some, seeing the kindergarten teacher have such remarkable control over 20 children seems astonishing.  But she doesn't get that without doing something.  And the children don't always tell you what injustices have occurred during the day, even if you ask them.  Now a child is not wanting to go to school.  1-2 hours of crying in the morning.  When you ask him, he says things like ""it goes on for a long, long, long time.""  So it's boring.  But it seems like it's more than that.  We suspected bullying, but answers to questions like ""who do you like to play with, and why?"" and ""who do you not like to play with, and why??"" have answers like ""Lloyd"", they don't seem to point to bullying.  So we kept assuming it had to do with the other children.  But the children don't seem to be bullying each other.  One time one of us observed an Science activity put on by the teacher, we observed very obedient, well behaved kids, who went and sat on the carpet when told, and put their hands on their head when told, and ate their lunches when told, and didn't talk or interact with each other much at all.  Like little robots.  What if you suspect the teacher's tactic for getting control is harsh, and hurting your child psychologically?  How do you investigate what's going on? "
610,How to improve the introduction of solid food?,"My wife and I have six month old twin daughters whom we have just begun to feed solid foods. Per our doctor's instructions we have begun feeding the girls Beech-Nut Rice Cereal. In an effort to control acid-reflux one of the twins has had this rice cereal in her bottle for many months. This twin is doing excellent with spoon feeding, the other is not. Each spoon feeding session quickly causes her to break down into a fit of hysterics. We aren't sure if this is because she does not like the taste or if she isn't ready for spoon feeding.  Other than working with her do we have other options for limiting her fit? Should we wait a few weeks and try again? Should we try adding rice cereal to her bottle to get her used to the taste? "
611,How to simultaneously spoon feed twins?,"My wife and I are on different schedules which during the week leaves one parent alone with the twins. Feeding the twins bottles at the same time has proven to be relatively easy. We are now in the process of introducing solid foods. This has proven challenging for one of the twins and is proving challenging for us. Spoon feeding is obviously not as simple as holding onto two bottles, but requires interaction for each bite.  We see our options as:   alternating between each bite feeding one and then the other spoon feeding at totally different times   Is there an option we are missing? Is there a better way? "
612,How do you help a seven year old navigate life and friendships in a region where your beliefs vastly differ from the beliefs of the larger community,"A Little Background  I was raised Christian, and still believe in God and Christ's message of love, but am estranged from most Christian Churches because I don't find them to be truly loving places (members are often quite judgmental - particularly in our area and certain platitudes are passed on in Sunday School Classes as well.  As a result, none of us attends church with any regularity).  My husband is agnostic.   My daughter is seven, home schooled, and living in a heavily conservative region both politically and religiously in the US. Yet, I have friends with Jewish as well as Christian backgrounds. One set of grandparents is vehemently Atheist while the other is loosely Christian. I am Christian but like my parents very liberally so (many Christians in our area would not consider me Christian at all). We have some gay and lesbian friends as well, so our household is what I would describe as one of love and acceptance for most (KKK members, nazis and the like not allowed).  Unfortunately, for her to have friends, it seems many of them are Christians, that in my opinion would fall into that crowd of people that are unknowingly rubbing elbows with the KKK and the Nazis in their level of judgement toward others thankfully, they are no where near as violent.    My daughter wants to consider herself Christian despite the fact that I have told her time and again, she can't really make that choice until she understands a lot more about the faith as well as other belief systems.  Many of her friends are Christian and so is half her family and at seven, life is all about fitting in.  The Problem   However, because we had a pumpkin carving party, she had a couple of ""friends"" at school turn her down and claim she isn't really a Christian because she celebrates a pagan holiday (Little do they know that most of what we do at ""Christmas"" and ""Easter"" are also quite ""pagan"")  My daughter is feeling horrible.  I explained that in their view we aren't true Christians because we don't believe what they think we are supposed to believe to be Christians. I talked to her about how Jesus taught us about love and forgiveness, so I don't believe their actions and words were Christian under my definition of the word either. I also told her I don't believe any of them are really old enough to truly have chosen a faith yet anyway. I reassured her that it was wonderful to be who she is with or without a faith-label and that there are plenty of good people that are not Christian (her Dad being one of them) as well as plenty of good people who are.  We also talked a lot about friendship and what it means to be a good friend and what kinds of friends we want in our lives anyway.  Of course, she is still feeling horrible, left out and judged harshly.  Any ideas about how to talk to her about this one?    Also, any ideas about how to guide her in speaking with others about faith and belief when it comes up in a way that allows for her to ""save face"" with others while also standing true to ""the journey?""

613,What exercises should be done post-op for a tongue tied 2 week old?,"   Possible Duplicate:   Are there things to watch out for after a tongue-tie operation?       My 2 week old daughter got the clipping procedure to fix her tongue-tie. What exercises need to be done by me on her?  Just to add that the paediatrician recommended me to find the exercises on the internet! I see a link to ""Are there things to watch out for after a tongue-tie operation?"" but the exercises there are for 6 year olds who can do the exercises themselves.

614,Three year old gags when he tries new foods,"I spend a lot of time caring for a three-year-old that is a pretty picky eater.  However, the stuff he does eat is generally fairly healthy stuff.  Lately he has started gagging on food he isn't sure about before he tries them.  Normally, I'd just continue with the ""you need to try it"" thing (as would his mother - her parenting style is actually quite similar to mine which is REALLY nice!)  However, the thing about this one is that they are honest gags followed by coughing and sometimes even a little throw-up.  I think he just gets himself so worked up in his head about how it will be awful that then when he tries the thing it really is that awful.    One example is at a party he gagged on peanut butter and ritz cracker sandwiches (one of his absolute favorites) because they were made to look like spiders with two raisin eyes (he loves raisins) and eight crunchy chow mien noodles (which his mom had picked off already).  That example alone isn't a big deal, but it definitely shows how it is really in his head and not about actual taste or texture.  Has anyone else experienced this?  what did you do? "
615,"How do I tell my daughter the only dad she's ever known, isn't her biological dad?","I had my oldest daughter very young,  with a man that chose to not be involved at the time (Who now has two more children by two different woman)  we split up when my oldest daughter was about 1. Not to long after,  I met my current spouse who I have been with for years now.  He has been by my side,  and being a dad to her since as long as she can remember. ( she is now four and has become very curious) We have since had my second daughter (who is now 2). Since she was born she ofcourse called him dad,  and although I never suggested it my oldest begun to call him dad as well.  He is the only dad she's ever known.    Anyways,  recently her biological dad has been trying to reach out,  (he has never called or made an effort since the break up) and I don't know how to bring it up to her.  She's four,  and is an amazing,  happy kid,  and although she's smart I don't want to hurt her.  But I also don't want to keep her from her real dad and later in life have her spiral out if control because if it.  How do I bring this up and explain it?  Should I at all?  Has anyone else ever had experiences with it?  I am totally lost,  and just want to save my daughter from dissapointment.   "
616,Intentional infection with Toxoplasmosis before getting pregnant?,"Toxoplasmosis is a disease which seems to be, most of the time, not serious for humans (according to Wikipedia, up to a third of the world’s human population is estimated to be infected).  After being infected for the first time, humans produce antibodies which prevent further infections.  But Toxoplasmosis can be very serious for unborn childs if the woman gets infected while being pregnant.  At the question Can contact with cat feces be harmful for pregnant women? Hilmar answered:     If you have not been infected and planning to get pregnant consider getting yourself infected on purpose. The infection has mild symptoms, if any, and afterwards you and your baby will be completely safe. Discuss with your doctor (if you can find one that knows about this).   What do you know about this? Do (some) physicians recommend this?  If so, it could be a long-term preparation for becoming a parent. "
617,"Family stress due to unemployment, ways to help my family?","TL;DR  Dad's unemployment causing a lot of stress on my mum, who works a few part-time jobs and also manages the household. I want to offer help, but now sure how to. I want to know ways to alleviate my mum's stress, ways to make sure my sisters are not affected by the situation, and ways of persuading my dad to start looking for a job.  Details  My dad has been unemployed for almost 7 years. My mum has several small jobs so her income isn't very steady, and she is extremely busy, as she also takes care of family finances and she tries to do the housework - she's very worn out, and I'm worried about her health. Me and my sisters try to help out but we're students and we prioritise our studies. My dad helps too, but he housework isn't really his thing. He doesn't really do much. He doesn't mean to do this, I think, but he doesn't prioritise and doesn't notice that the housework needs to be done, and will only do tasks if we ask him a few times.  When I was still in school, my mum frequently vented to me how frustrated she was with my dad's unemployment, until I asked her not to, as it was hard for me to listen to her talk about my dad like this. I still don't like talking about it, but I feel like I should, as I want to understand how our family's finance is doing, and how I can help. Whenever I bring up fiances or my dad's unemployment or my mum working too much, though, she gets touchy and upset (and this makes me upset as well). My mum told me a couple of times that she's worried about their retirement, and this worries me too, since I'm not sure if I'll have a good enough job to support my parents as well as my sisters.  I plan on supporting my family as much as I can once I get a full-time job, but that won't be for another five, six years, as I'm studying for an undergrad part-time. At the moment, I only have a part time job, and I don't contribute to the family's financial needs. My mum doesn't like it when I offer to contribute to groceries, pay rent etc. My sisters are still in school and do not have jobs, and I know it costs an arm and a leg to raise kids. I want to help my mum, but I don't know what to do. I thought at least talking about it and trying to listen to her would help, but I'm not able to do this calmly, as my dad's unemployment is still a touchy subject and we always end up fighting.  How can I alleviate some of the stress my mum is under, how can I offer her help, and how do I ensure my sisters don't have to worry about this? How can I convince my dad to find a job, when my mum had not been able to do so for so long?  What can I do right now, and what can I think about doing in the future that will help my family?  Sorry about the length of this post, hoping someone has some wisdom.  -Anne, 20 "
618,Frequent night wakings - what can be done to help a mobile poor sleeper,"I am a sleep deprived mum of a 9 1/2 month old boy. He's otherwise a smiley, healthy and seems to be on the top percentile for both weight and height for his age. So he doesn't seem to be sleep deprived, grumpy and starving or obese.  He is also completely breastfed- fresh from the tap, not through choice but he simply refuses the bottle (which is another issue) but my plan is to wean him in 3-4 months. He also doesn't take the pacifier... he objects to anything artificial in his mouth and we have tried many things (except for starving him until he takes the bottle) and now we have simply given up. He's eating solid alright and basically enjoy eating, he has also cut his day feeds drastically.   Nighttime however is becoming more and more of a nightmare. He was never a good sleeper and I made the rookie mistake of letting him sleep on the breast. I never managed the put him down awake thing that everyone else seems to be able to do. We also co-sleep so that I wouldn't die from all the multiple wakings.   Recently things have gotten from bad to worse. He goes to sleep fairly easily but wakes up every hour up to midnight or 1 am, then he wakes up every 2 hours until he wakes up for the day between 0600 to 0630. He goes to bad between 1830 to 1930 depending on when he wakes up from his last nap but typically he is out by 1900. Then the hourly waking starts.   I have searched the Internet and it seems the sleep association is to blame, as he falls asleep on the breast he needs it to get back to sleep again. He can't connect the sleep cycles himself. These sounds most likely the most plausible reason, but what can I do about it save cry-it-out?? I think he also have a second sleep association- which is being close to me. Sometimes (but rarely) he does get off the breast and wiggles himself to sleep but usually stuck against me.  The reason why I would like to leave CIO until there are no options left are because:   He wails and get more upset the longer he cries. He doesn't calm down easily once he starts. He started crawling and few days later crusing and now he can go from furniture to furniture and climb down from the sofa, things actually started to worsen a month ago when he started turning in his sleep and got on all fours at night and started crying but he wasn't mobile until 2 weeks ago.  He is teething. His 3 teeth broke through in a week and one more on the way. I started giving him ibuprofen yesterday and he seemed to have slept better; will do it again tonight. His separation anxiety seems to be getting worse. He was always clingy but now he wails when I leave the room and crawls to chase after me. He also clutches to be tightly after every feed.   So with so much going on, I really don't want to make it harder for him.. but at the same time things are getting worse on the home front as dear husband is blaming me for fostering his bad habits, inhibiting his ability to be independent and basically being the reason why he can smooth himself to sleep.  What can I do to improve the situation? Should I wait it out, cry it out? "
619,How can I begin exposing my children to world news?,"I have an 8-year old and a 4-year old.  My 8-year-old recently asked me ""Are wars are real?""  At 8 years old, my elders watched TV news so I got little inklings of politics, wars, crime, etc.  But we don't want today's TV news in our house.  Both my children have tablets and limited internet access.  Is there a good source of good curated age-appropriate news?  Preferably something streamable.  In a related question from 2011 PBS newshour and BBC newsround were recommended.  PBS newshour is sometimes heavy, but maybe we should try it as a family.  BBC Newsround focuses a bit too much on British pop culture and sports but it is certainly safe and digestable.  Update I am really having trouble accepting any answer here.  Many people posted insightful comments giving good parenting advice.  I appreciate that.  Some provided other alternatives to news.  But most seem to say there is no good source, while I have found too many to research them all!  It seems like many people wanted to give parenting advice rather than answer the question.  Perhaps it was poor of me to ask the community to do my research for me.  Since I posted this, I found DogoNews and Time For Kids to be my good candidates.  Both are on the Common Sense Media's list of news for kids.  Youngzine seems to vary: one day it was celebrity news, but today it looks earth sciencey which seems quite good. "
620,Should we leave our daughter at home with her uncle if she then cries?,"My daughter is 4+ years old. We used to take her with us wherever we went until recently when we had a doctor's appointment around 10PM. We wanted her to stay home with her uncle because taking her out at that time didn't seem good for her. She usually goes to bed around 10 to 11 PM. Her uncle leaves with us and loves/cares her a lot. But surprisingly she was extemely reluctant to let us go without her. We offered her all those things she usually craves for, like unlimited cartoons, games and what not, but all this stuff got completely worthless compared to our companionship. (My daughter complains less when my mom comes to visit us.)  On that day we eventually managed to leave without her. But later we got to know that she cried a lot, also vomited. But after like half an hour she stopped crying and started watching cartoons. Today we again have a doctor's appointment around the same time and we have already informed her about this. She again seems so sad and is crying from time to time.  What I am confused about is,    Should I really listen to her and take with us wherever we go? Isn't she old enough to stay without us for a couple of hours? Am I doing any harm to her by forcing her to stay back at home? Or is it good for her because she is learning how to handle such sadness?   It's really hard for us to see her in this state, so unless we are really doing a favor to her, I don't want to let her cry. So please suggest. "
621,What to do with a 7-year-old who just started stealing?,"My 7-year-old daughter is currently on vacation from school until this Monday.  Yesterday, she was in ""camp"" - a full-day version of the after-care program we usually send her to.  At some point, she went into the backpack of one of her friends, took out the friend's slime that they had both been playing with, and put it into her own backpack.  The friend told a counselor that our daughter had taken it.  The counselor called my wife who searched the backpack and found the missing items.  Our daughter at first vociferously denied taking them but finally owned up to it.  My wife made her apologize to the counselor for lying, and my wife and the other kid's mom came up with a plan for our daughter to ""make it right"" with the other girl.    We had discussions with our daughter, about how stealing is bad, and that she was betraying her friend's trust.  The agreed-upon punishment was that my daughter would write a card to her friend, apologizing and telling her why she valued her as a friend.  I recommended that slime never be allowed in the house again, so that we'd know that if we saw it, it was stolen.  But, we made it clear that that was only something we were considering.  We asked her if we should mention this to all of the friends we'd see that night.  She really didn't like that idea (and neither did we, so we didn't do it).  I bring this up, because it implies to me that she knew that what she had done was wrong. My wife at some point that evening talked with her about trust and how important it is, and she seemed very contrite and sorry for her actions.  Today, we went to a store.  My daughter and her younger sister were not behaving perfectly, but not horribly.  They played with some toys in a small toy section with our permission.  I kept within earshot, but wasn't watching every minute of what they did.  At some point, my daughter found some slime she liked, that was apparently already removed from its outer packaging.  She put it under her shirt and successfully snuck out of the store with it.  We didn't find out until an hour or two later when my wife walked by her room and she tried hiding it.  When my wife saw what was in her hands, we recognized it from the store.  At first, we yelled a lot, about breaking trust, about how could she do something like that, especially after yesterday's events.  Then we called the store manager, brought our daughter in, had her apologize and do whatever the manager wanted.  The manager told her ""don't ever do it again.""  Then we had her pay for the product with her allowance money, and as soon as we left the store, we had her throw it out in a trash can.  We've also had someone we know who has worked retail loss prevention describe to our daughter what happened when she caught people stealing at her store.    I very seriously considered contacting some police friends we have and asking them to put my daughter in handcuffs for an hour or at the very least talk with her about her actions.  We haven't done that yet.  We're being as careful as possible to describe her actions as bad, and refer to it as theft and stealing, but not overly refer to her as a thief.  We want to be sure to say that the actions were bad, but that she isn't.  We definitely don't want her to identify as a thief, but have no problem rubbing in that she's someone who committed theft.  After repeatedly asking her why she did it, she eventually said, ""Because I wanted the slime.""  She does have more than enough allowance and gift money to be able to pay for this [tex]7.00 it said on it).  For a while she was not allowed to buy slime - she begged us to buy some for her in October and promised she wouldn't ask for any more for the rest of the year (her choice to do this, not us asking) but we did hold her to it.  She knew that her promise expired as of the first and we had even talked about her getting slime.    My wife and I both feel betrayed by our daughter doing something that we feel is abhorrent.  My wife has been asking me, ""Where did we go wrong?""  I told her, ""We haven't.  She knows what's right and wrong.  She's exploring boundaries.""  I would really like to believe this, but I don't think I do.  What can we do to make sure these two incidents of stealing are all she does? "
622,"How to get my 6 month old baby boy, to have a better night","I am exhausted...so I can't even imagine how the poor champ must be feeling, he wakes up every half hour to an hour EVERY night...he wasn't a good sleeper from day one, but I miss the nights where I only had to get up 3 times (sure this must sound sad to you, but I miss that) He is a very busy boy, he dreams a lot, I have tried sleep training, he can fall asleep on his own, the problem is that he wakes up between 6 and up times (the last few nights was more than 10 times so I just stay awake)...I feel sorry for him, he must be exhausted, he isn't difficult he smiles and have chats, so he is a very happy baby, he is growing well his milestones is ahead...he sleeps with us in our room, because there is so many farm attacks in South Africa I feel safer to keep him close and locked up with me, so moving him to his own room is not an option, he isn't a big fan of the dummy, but he does take it when going to bed, so I know that is a sleep association and I'm okay with that because it reduces the rist of cot death. I'm okay with the little sleep, I am worried about his sleep, I need him to be okay and have a better night rest...he had a horrible night rest the past two nights, his tummy is fine, I get him as comfortable as possible...he is also very curious...not sure if he is afraid of missing out? And I do not feel comfortable with the ""cry it out"" method as I want him to know that I will be there for him if he needs me...I am out of ideas on how to help him...is there anyone else with the same problem or past problem?

He enjoys characters like Winnie the Pooh, and she wants to create that ""magical"" experience of pure joy when he meets his favorite characters in person.  We want this to be a memory that lasts him for a very long time, but before he gets ""too old"" to have that sense of wonder.

Firstly is it okay that he hasn't yet spoken beyond these 2 words?  There are a few things which are making me confused. When we call him, he doesn't respond most of the time. Although if we switch on his favorite rhyme in the mobile he would immediately come running. Before he was even 1 years old he is to show his body parts like eyes, nose, head and stomach with gestures if asked, which he is no longer doing apart from doing high-fives with both his hands. Although he take lot of interest when I read out from his picture book. Six months down the line he used to ask ""what?"" on each picture which he no longer does. His play time is usually running here and there. Although he is good at stacking. There are many other activities which is making me sometime worry that maybe something is not okay but sometimes I feel many things he is doing is much more than a 2 yr old could do.  Please share your thoughts and experiences, as it would be really helpful. "
626,Is PediaSure okay for toddlers and if not how to get them off it?,"For several reasons my daughter had to be weaned off breast milk when she was around 14 months. At that point she was not eating well and lost a lot of weight. One pediatrician recommended we give her PediaSure, and that was the only food she drank consistently (she didn't even take regular milk). And by giving her 2-3 bottles of that a day we slowly brought her weight back up to almost normal for her age.  Now she is 20 months old and still drinks that amount, but recently I read some articles saying that stuff is full of sugar and chemicals and has been linked to food allergies (one of my younger brothers also has severe food allergies and drank that stuff at that age).  My wife and I are extremely busy and we have 2 other kids (one even younger than her). We try our best to feed her solids but she almost always refuses to eat, even when we let hours pass and leave her in hunger.  Should we stick to PediaSure since it's keeping her going or should we wean her off it? If it is the latter, what can we give her instead or how can we make her eat? Just as we are concerned about giving her too much PediaSure we are also concerned about her losing weight again.  I am sorry for asking two questions in one. If you can answer even one that would be greatly appreciated. Of course we will talk to our doctor but any additional guidance or tips will help. "
627,Should I be concerned that my infant holds her sneeze in?,"My ten-month-old daughter just got stick (seems like cold/flu). What's really strange for me is that she holds her sneezes in. In fact, sometimes she's almost shaking from the exertion of holding her sneezes in.  Granted that she has very mucousy sneezes, and that she doesn't like wiping her nose (which kid does?) -- but I'm a bit weirded out by her holding in the sneezes.  This doesn't seem like something common in that age either.   Is it simply amusing, or potentially problematic? "
628,Help for my friend's pre-schooler who eats too much,"I want to know if anyone has any kind of experience with this as it is foreign to me.  My best friend has two little girls (seriously, this is about my best friend.  Not me.).  Her oldest just turned five and, when it comes to eating, is a perfectly normal eater.  Actually, I consider her a very good eater.  She eats healthy foods, she doesn't over-eat, she eats a wide variety of foods, and she doesn't exhibit the normal eating issues I see with so many kids her age.  Her younger daughter will turn 3 at the beginning of April, and she has always been a BIG eater from the time she was a baby.  She was taking full 8-oz. bottles of formula by the time she was 3 months old every two hours, and this went on until she was almost a year old.  My best friend would have to carry around a can of formula wherever she went so she could always be prepared.  Rarely does she leave anything on her plate at mealtimes, and she will frequently finish off whatever is left on other's plates.  She's not necessarily overweight, though she's probably a little on the ""chunky"" side for her age.  We've all kind of just rolled our eyes in the past and said a little indulgently, ""Well, that's just Avery.""  Last week, however, my friend got a phone call from her baby-sitter about her daughter's eating habits while at daycare.  It seems that one morning, the babysitter was feeding another baby some oatmeal and Avery came over, plunged her hands into the bowl of oatmeal, and started shoveling handfuls of food into her mouth.  Later that afternoon, at lunchtime, another little boy left the table to visit the restroom, and while he was gone Avery ate the rest of the little boy's lunch before the babysitter could even jump in and stop her.  Needless to say, this has my friend worried.  She has worried about her daughter's eating habits since she was a baby.  My friend and I have both struggled with our weight most of our lives, so I sympathize with her and I understand her concern.  Anyone out there have any experience with this?  Any medical reasons anyone can think of that might be causing this?  I think we all assumed that this was something she would eventually grow out of, but this new behavior has us all thinking that there may be something more to it.  "
629,Torticollis: what should we expect?,"We have been instructed to take our 4 month old to a physical therapist to address torticollis and flat head.  In past visits to our pediatrician we were given stretches to do and have attempted to switch her head direction when sleeping, but apparently that wasn't effective enough.  I realize this is not a specific question, but if you have experience with this condition, I would really like to hear about it.  How did your child react to the therapy?  How long did the therapy go on for?  How did it affect your child's long-term physical development? "
630,What are questions to ask when interviewing a midwife?,We're leaning toward homebirth and we're interviewing midwives. What questions should we ask her? What factors matter? 
631,"From what age should one heed ""But I'm not cold!""?","I am regularly called on to arbitrate in the on-going dispute between 8-year-old daughter and her mother about how many layers to wear when going outside in the cold. Mum* says ""More"", daughter says ""I'm not cold"".  From what age should you just let them get on with it?  (Is there ever an age when you shouldn't?)  *As one particularly self-aware father once said: ""Put your coat on, I'm cold!"" "
632,What are some possible ways to deal with night-time tantrums,"My daughter, who is coming up for 3 years old has never been a good sleeper. She regularly wakes during the night, sometimes up to 3 or 4 times but more commonly once or twice.  More often than not she simply wants comforting from her mum, but all too often it turns into a full blown tantrum with the typical tantrum behaviour of:   Screaming / Crying Lashing out / Hitting Head banging / Hair pulling   During the day, tantrums are quite rare. She is a very well behaved child for the most part, with what I would consider to be a very good ability to communicate for her age (I mention this because most advice on tantrums says that the child is having trouble communicating). The problem is that at night she seems to be almost half asleep and totally unable to rationalise or communicate. I don't however think that this is a case of night-terror as she doesn't exhibit the typical behaviour of screaming whilst clearly still fully asleep.  I tend to deal with this by:   Switching her bedroom light on (I know this is bad, but the only way i've found to end the tantrum is to wake her up fully, and the light as we know stimulates her awake) Shut her door (She has a baby sister in the next room, I cant have her screaming in the hallway as it'll wake the baby) Sit with her in her room (I hate the idea of shutting her in there on her own. Although this leads to other problems as she then gets violent with me for blocking her way out. Bit of a catch 22, if I dont sit in front of the door she'll run into the hall and scream. If I do, she lashes out at me). Let the tantrum run its course (This sometimes takes up to 30 minutes, but typically 15. Once the tantrum is over she turns back into the well-behaved child I know. Has a cuddle, and goes straight back to bed without a fuss).   So does anyone have any insight how to deal with this? Am I doing it all wrong? I'm sure she will grow out of it - they almost always all do, but I would like to hear others POV. "
633,What are some effective strategies that I can take to get my first grade child in the highest quality teacher's classroom?,"My child is now in Kindergarten, and next year she will switch schools. I watched the movie Waiting for ""Superman"" and now I would like to know how  I can influence the selection of a teacher (e.g. so that she get a teacher who has been teaching there for a while and is experienced).   What are some strategies I could use to influence the decision about which teacher winds up teaching my child?  How are teachers normally assigned? What are tracks and in which grade are they typically introduced - at level, below level, above level? Do schools try to mix the students so they end up with balanced groups,  or do they purposefully put poor performers/best performers into one group?   "
634,Reading in second language for a bilingual kid - how to approach a phonetic language vs. English phonics?,"My kid goes to English public kindergarten and learns there to read and write in English. We live in USA.  At home we speak Czech and Czech words are read as written with different phonetics. How long should I wait (e.g., after she masters English reading) to introduce phonics rules of a second language?   Where can I read about reading in your second language - how's and when's? (or someone's experience?) "
635,What is effect of giving sugar to an infant?,"Instinctively I try to avoid giving our 1 year old sugar. However, I don't really understand why it is bad for her.  Often when she doesn't want to eat any more savoury food she is more than happy to have something sweet - fruit or yoghurt or sometimes even (I blame her mother!) a bit of cake. At this age she has not been influenced by advertising or other social factors and is acting out of instinct - some form of evolutionary impulse which has aided human development for a very long time. This leads me to think that maybe sugar may have some benefits for infants and is actually quite important for them to have some.  I realise there is a difference between natural fruit sugars and highly refined sugar. Also in ancient times sugar was no way nearly as available as it is today.  What research has been carried out on the effects of sugar, and the effects of different forms of sugar on infants? How harmful /  beneficial is it? It there a recommended daily amount? "
636,"Silicone bottle nipple, usually has a whitish film after washing and drying? Why is this the case?","I've notice that after we wash &amp; air dry our silicone nipples, frequently they will have a light whitish kind of film on the inside. This film survives boiling water sterilization too. I would then have to wash it again with a lot more soap to remove this.  Why does this happen? Is it from the milk fat?   "
637,What is the most gentle way to break an association in a 15 months old?,"We are doing a daycare transition currently. My LO is 15 months old next week. I spent all AM and lunch there with her yesterday and today. It's a family based homecare and I've only heard very positive things so I'm not worried about the family or that anything bad happened while I'm gone.   So this morning I brought my LO to the group and felt things were well, she was playing with toys and happy to be there, so I decided to try a short 30 minutes  separation. I went for a walk then hung in my car parked across the street. It was about 20 minutes or so when I started hearing her crying very loudly all the way outside. I waited a few minutes, hoping I could rejoin the group after she stops so she doesn't associate crying means mom comes back.  She seemed fairly distressed about the staircase. The teacher said her son came downstairs and forgot to close the gate. My LO is a climber and she wanted to go there when the teacher locked the gate. My thoughts are that when my LO saw the teachers' son, it was a new face and she probably noticed I was gone, then might have wanted to use the staircase to find me and was kept from it.   Her distress about the staircase went on and off for the remaining hour or so. It seemed to be better after lunch but I am wondering if we go back tomorrow, should I tend on avoiding the staircase a bit or having her face it but reassure her? What signs should I watch for? "
638,How to teach new parents to apply early childhood education to improve cognitive outcomes in their children?,"What are the most common ways for new parents to put in practice early childhood education?  I'm asking because it seems there is enough information available that one would expect to find trainers, facilitators or even groups of people applying or teaching programs of preschool education, by both either public or private institutions.  What follows is all the findings that makes me think that's the case:  I watched the documentary ""My Brilliant Brain: Born Genius"" where they refer to the Abecedarian Project, in that investigation, a group of children that were exposed to early childhood education observed long-term benefits, such as higher scores in intelligence tests than those children that weren't exposed to the program.  Due to the importance in the findings on the Abecedarian Project, I also asked for any peer-reviewed or follow-up studies on the subject, but the only studies I could find were those listed on the project's page.  Also searching for related information it seems that there are multiple programs available by the name of The Abecedarian Approach that offer similar results. Among them, I am aware of at least one of them that has some of the investigators in the original project (Craig T. Ramey and Joseph J. Sparling).  There is also a YouTube channel by the New America foundation with some videos on the subject. Like for instance Too Much Evidence to Ignore: New Findings on the Impact of Quality Preschool at Scale  Also looking for related books, it seems all the investigators in the original project have published some literature on the subject:  Craig T. Ramey,  Joseph Sparling,  Isabelle Lewis,  Margaret R. Burchinal,  Elizabeth Pungello,  Lynne Vernon-Feagans, and  Barbara Hanna Wasik.  Based on all that information, it seems there is enough material available for specialized training on early childhood education, that's why I'm asking in the first place. "
639,Relation of Multiple languages to (overall) development of child,"I have been to most questions related bilingual aspects where whether and how should one introduce more than one language to child. This helps.   I am trying to find a bit broader opinion as to what is the relationship between development of the kids with their earlier exposure to multiple languages.   For specific in our case as well with my child just turned 4. We are in India. We usually speak in Gujarati at home, but since we were migrated to Hindi and English has been common with other kids, play group as well. (Much less outside people spoke to him in Gujarati). He has been a very late speaker (started almost after 2 and half years). And he is more natural with Hindi than Gujarati (our family language); though he now does speak all three languages. So does it look like a case that multiple language confusion is the real reason for late language development?   What is wanted to know is that if the situation persists, what are the likely areas of development (language, intellectual, reasoning, social or any other area) he could be lacking due to situation like this? Will he continue to lag further behind in development compared to other kids or will this not be a longer term issue?  Are there any specific advise to ensure that multiple languages doesn't limit him?  "
640,What to do when a 6-year-old expresses suicidal thoughts?,"A mom at my daughter's school told me that her son told her that my 6-year-old daughter told him that she doesn't like herself and wants to kill herself.  I'm really not sure how to approach this with my daughter.  She definitely is the sort of person who will say things for attention, and of course the kindergarten gossip line is hardly reliable.  I suspect she wouldn't be saying something like that if she hadn't heard it somewhere before; I know she hasn't heard it from me.  Her mom and I are not together, and it's possible that she heard it at her mom's house, or on TV (again, not at my house.)  I have noticed that my daughter seems to be taking criticism very hard recently.  For instance, the other day I was showing her how to hold cheese so she could cut it with a cheese slicer without her fingers being in a position where they could get cut, and she burst into tears.  (I only let her slice cheese with a cheese slicer under supervision.)  It has occurred to me that she is at about the age when a real understanding of death can come, and that she may be processing that.  I'm afraid that if I bring up what she (supposedly) said to a kid a school, then she will feel like she's in trouble.  But I don't want to ignore the issue if she really needs help.  How should I respond to this?  How can I tell if she is depressed, and how can I help her if she is? "
641,How do I manage my toddler's fear to use the potty?,"My LO is almost 15 months. She just started walking and has been really good at climbing on chairs for a while so I figured we'd buy a potty, no pressure, just to get her used to the idea. I sat her on it a few times and she seemed to enjoy it, and peed in it twice. So I taught her the word ""pee"" as well as the sign and got a potty training storybook out and she seemed thrilled.   The third time she peed on the potty, she seemed to notice she was ""leaking"" and got really distressed and crying uncontrollably. She then stood up from the potty, pooped on the floor and sat back on the potty, and started crying again.   So we reassured her and congratulated her, even about the poop and everything. But ever since, although she still loves the potty book, still says the word/sign, still likes the potty object, she will cry whenever she sits on it (even when fully dressed) and look down to see what's going on. So I put the potty away for now.   I've read that some toddlers feel like they are losing a part of themselves when going potty but nothing about how to better handle it.  I am wondering, will this pass on its own? Is she just ""not ready""? Should I keep engaging her with the story/leave the potty out? Should I show her that I'm fine while using the potty? "
642,Family wants my 2.5 year old daugter to visit my declining grandmother,"My grandmother is currently sick and at hospital. Basically, she has Alzheimer's disease and she has not much time left. The last time I saw her, a few weeks ago, she was very thin and not able to recognize me. I hasn't felt strong enough to visit her again since.  Now my family asks me to visit her with my 2.5 year old daughter. I will visit her essentially because my father and my grandfather asked me and need support. But I don't want my daughter to come with me.  For my grandmother, my daughter has nearly been her reason to live, even if we have not visit her often (perhaps 3-6 times a year). I used to call her every week before she goes to the hospital and she was happy to listen to my daughter playing or anything. On the other side, honestly, my daughter probably remember her but doesn't care - she's someone far from her, nothing like her direct grandparents or aunts.  I just think a hospital for old, sick people, losing their minds, is not a place for children of her age. She won't understand what's happening and I don't know how she could react, or what the questions she could ask.  Should I bring her when I visit my grandmother? If not, how can I explain it to my family?    EDIT: I visited my grandmother without my daughter. I wasn't sure about my reactions rather than my daughter's reaction. My family was much understanding than I expected. "
643,What can cause colic on dairy formula and not on breastmilk?,"My 9 day old daughter is experiencing severe colic. The crying and leg stretching usually starts 20 minutes after the bottle with diary formula is finished. It takes around 2 hours after symptoms decrease and she falls asleep.   Beside dairy we also feed her with breast milk from a bottle. Unfortunately my daughter is not successful in drinking from the breast directly. Furthermore not enough mother milk is produced to feed her all day. Currently 30% of the bottles are mother milk.   No colic occurs when we give her mother milk. Furthermore she can sleep 4.5 hours without interruption after she finished the bottle of mother milk. Probably she compensates for sleep she missed while suffering colic.   I am able to soothe her by letting her suck on my pink while carrying her around and in that way the crying and leg muscle stretching stops.  Her body temperature, weight gain and diapers are all fine. Her skin is a bit scaly.   Could she already have developed a dairy allergy in such short timeframe? Or should we just be patient and wait until she becomes used to dairy?   She is my second child. My oldest daughter only showed such intense crying when she was very hungry or was ill.   I suffer myself from a (pea)nut allergy.  "
644,What are good ways to clean plush toys?,We have toys that can't be laundered? What are some good ways to clean these infant/toddler favorites?  I read somewhere that putting them in a sealable plastic bag and putting them in the freezer kills the dust mites.  How would you clean the surface of dirt? 
645,Ways to shield a child against religious indoctrination/pressure?,"What effective methods (preferably backed by some sort of data) are there for avoiding religious indoctrination or pressure on a child? Some of the possible factors I'm thinking of are:   Teachers and other authority figures asserting their own religious views as fact or just drawing inappropriate focus to them. Desire to fit in with other children who are part of religious community. Religious themes in popular books/entertainment/etc. Harassment/bulling from other children - ""You're going to hell!"" Concepts of guilt/shame/etc.   Are there good approaches to develop an ability to understand others' beliefs as just ""their beliefs""/""their story"" rather than ""the truth"", or is that too much to expect for young children? Is introducing religious stories/characters early, but on the same basis as fiction/super-heroes, an effective way of framing it?  This question is somewhat inspired by Should I allow or forbid my son to visit the education of a religion that I do not share?, but I believe it's significantly different. I'm not looking for a solution to a difficult family dynamic that has already arisen, but ways to raise a child to peacefully coexist and interact with dominant religious communities whose beliefs you don't want imposed on your child. Based on my own family's background and the community we live in, I don't anticipate this being a big issue for our child (now 1yo), but I know it will come up in some ways and I'd like ideas for what to be prepared for, and I think it's an worthwhile topic in general. At this point aspects of the question that apply to early childhood up through preschool/early-elementary are the most relevant to me, but I'd also like to hear ideas for later on. "

647,I am 21 and I am terrified beyond belief of my father,"I am a 21 year old female living in Egypt and I am beyond terrified of my own father...at least I think he is my father. To say it shortly, I think I might have been adopted at a young age and no one told me about it.  In Egypt, daughters must carry the same name as the father, my name is different from my father's, hence the conclusion of being adopted.  On to the actual topic: I have been living in fear of my father since I was 6 years old. He left my mother and me when I was five and married another woman behind our backs. I have despised him ever since but my mother would have me spend every Friday with him and his family even though she hates it.  My father would hit me and yell at me since I was three and still does until now. His yells send cold chills down my spine and once I actually peed myself from fear when I was 20!   I don't think this is healthy, living in fear all my life to the extent that I have to motivate myself a couple of times before walking out of the house.   My mother died when I was 12 and I was forced to live with my father and his family which brought on more fear and anxiety because his wife hated my guts along with her oldest daughter.  My health is starting to deteriorate due to the constant fear and anxiety I have. I can't move out because my father won't allow it. I don't have any friends willing to take me in for a few weeks and my father won't allow it either, and I seem to have no other option than to just wait for my death.  Yeah... I have been constantly thinking that death is the only way out from this misery... I won't lie and say that I haven't thought of suicide... because I have... A LOT! If it weren't forbidden in my religion I think I would have done it a long time ago.  I just want help as to what I should do? Talking is not an option because my father is not the type to talk to... he is like a ticking time bomb; a grenade with the pin out.   What should I do to stop this constant feeling of anxiety and terror from my father? How could I escape this life I call my prison?   I know it's not much of a parenting question, but I thought since you are parents you would have some helpful advice. Maybe I am not seeing the whole picture clearly. "
648,Allergies: should we test them proactively?,"If a child has had no allergic reaction (yet), should we test her for allergies anyway, just in case? Or, is it enough to react after an allergic reaction?  "
649,What to do when parents disagree over medical care?,"What can you do when parents disagree about medical care?  In this case (friends of mine), the mother is undiscriminating about medical care. She forms highly speculative ideas about what might be wrong with children and rushes them to the doctor on any medical concern. She accepts the recommendations of doctors completely uncritically. This has led to situations where the children have been prescribed medicine in an indiscriminate manner. For example, in one case a GP prescribed a powerful anti-protozoan with potentially serious effects without making any diagnosis (a simple urine test had come back negative). The GP stated, ""this will clean out the system"". We are talking country doctors here.  The father is the exact opposite. His impulse is self-treat and use doctors as a last resort. When going to a doctor he wants a positive and sure diagnosis to be made before drugs are administered, especially potentially dangerous drugs. In many cases he wants second opinions, or to take the children to specialist. So, he is measure nine times before cutting once.  This polarity is causing serious strife and arguments. Worse, the mother is taking the children secretly to doctors and trying to get the children to take medications secretly without the father knowing and tells the children not to tell their father what they are doing. Of course, the children inform him anyway.  I know both of them, but only the father talks to me. I have advised him to just keep trying to negotiate, but I can foresee that the situation could continue to get worse. What advice (other than that already given) should I give? "
650,How much of an effect does parenting style have on a child?,"I'm not a parent and I haven't done as much research as anyone on this website.    This question is motivated by looking at many of my friends.  Sometimes, I find that one sibling is a high achiever, moral person, etc., while the other sibling is addicted to drugs, robs stores, and is overall an immoral person.  Both children had the same parents yet grew up to be wildly different from one another in so many ways.  Is there any evidence that the parenting makes a big difference on who the child becomes?  Any accepted research on nature vs nurture in parenting? "
651,"Can a breastfed 3-month-old go 12-14 hours without eating, when she refuses the bottle and I have to go to work?","My almost 3-month-old baby has been refusing the bottle since she was 3 weeks old. We've tried all the tricks that I know, she just likes to gnaw on it and roll it around in her mouth.   I am returning to work and I will be at work about 12 to 14 hours a day, 2 days a week. Of course, I will be leaving her with bottles and plenty of pumped milk, there's even oral syringes if they get desperate. I'm just terrified that she'll continue to refuse it.   We're offering the bottle to her at least once a day but she's only latched to it 2x since she was 3 weeks old. I've ordered foley cups and I'm going to try them next. I'm very stressed about being gone so long, but I have to go back to work. This is my third child, so I'm not new to this.   I hope someone else had experienced a baby who continued to refuse a bottle after they returned to work and could tell me it'll be okay. My main question is how long can a baby go without eating? If she does not take a bottle during those 12-14 hours, will she be okay? Should I try to reverse cycle her the night before (wake her to nurse frequently)? "
652,Washing and disinfecting a Pack 'N Play,"We lately received a (lightly) used Pack 'N Play from friends of ours, in preparation for our first baby, due 6 months from now. Pack-'N-Play-type playpen units consist mostly of fabric stretched across a collapsible metal frame. Most of the fabric isn't removable, so won't go through the washing machine. Also, this particular Pack 'N Play has been in a house with a bunch of cats &amp; ex-smokers. So, we've got two problems:   How do we get out the smoke and cat smells before the new addition? What kind of regular, periodic disinfection regime should we put the non-removable fabric parts go through once the little one gets here?  "

654,How important is it for a mother to have help around the house when she has several young children?,"My wife is a stay at home mom and we have 3 daughters (ages 5, 20 months and 1 month old). How important is it for a woman in her situation to get help around the house providing child care for this many kids and doing the domestic duties like cooking and cleaning? I work full time and I try to help out in the evenings and weekends, and we often eat out so she doesn't have to cook. But that is about all I can do myself.  There is really no one we can ask for help. She says she is okay and that she can handle it. But I would like to do more for her (like paying someone to come and help, even though that would be expensive).  So is it in the ability of most women to handle this level of child care and domestic responsibilities or at this point do they really need help?  Edited to add:   Thank you all for your input, the fact that it is a matter of opinion actually answers my question. I will defer to my wife's judgment then and leave the decision to her (which for the time being is that she doesn't need outside help).  I was just thinking that there is no way any woman can cope with this level of work and from the response here I see it is possible and since my wife says she can handle it and I don't see the children being neglected then I will just try my best to help and trust in her abilities and judgment of the situation. "
655,Toddler ignoring dad and change in his attitude,"Our son is really a good boy listening the first time on everything and doesn’t cry, but recently he has been the opposite. I m not strict but his mom is strict and recently my wife started a part time job since 3-4 months and he stays that time with his grandma and uncle.   What I have noticed is that he started using mobile for games. When other relatives' kids come over they play on mobile. He cried that he wanted too, so grandma and his mom got him one which I oppose. He is also crying when coming back home from grandma, but his recent change in mood has worried me.   He won’t listen to me over and over even after repeating until I scare him that I will take away his iPad or turn off TV. In comparison he is quick to listen to his mom. even when we are in the same room, while playing games on mobile, he would rather tell me to wait and the same thing after 5-10 min. As for his cousins, their parents don't bother as they literally give the mobile or ""12 hours cartoon"" to get them busy and it is not until someone cries that any of the parents pays attention. He learned it from them, but you cannot tell another's child not to do something, because your own child is getting spoiled (i.e. to not use mobile).  My frustration is why the sudden change of me repeating over and over again but he is not listening or crying to his mom. What is going on? Why is my son so agitated? "
656,"2 year old rarely eats food, needs bottle and milk and drinks a lot of water","My son completely refuses to eat food. If I forcefully insert it in his mouth, he tries to vomit and throws the food out of his mouth. He loves milk in his bottle, which we give him only when he is ready to sleep. He won't sleep unless we give him that bottle with milk. We try to give him food which we normally eat, we totally avoid sugary foods, chocolate, everything 'fancy' or 'junkfood' which is damageable.  Till now we could not understand what his favorite food is, except for his bottle and milk. He eats whenever he is extremely hungry and at that time also refuses to eat unless we forcefully put the first morsel in his mouth, then he continues for some time and when he gathers enough energy, tries to throw up and avoids and runs and cries.  Another thing is that he drinks a lot of water, a lot means a lot for his age.  How do we make him eat our food, is there any training or trick? And how to remove that bottle attachment? "
657,5 yr old behavioral/anger problems,"My daughter, in the past 6 months has been displaying severe anger. When a toy doesn't come together, if she doesn't get her way... she throws herself on the floor and starts kicking and screaming. Now, they tell me that she is purposely going after the teachers to kick them. Before, the teachers would get hurt because they would attempt to physically remove her. To this, I thought... ""well leave her alone and eventually she'll stop"". Like in many articles I've read: ""Ignore the child when throwing a tantrum"". At her daycare they have worked with me in strategies to deal with these situations, to no avail.  At first, we decided that if she misbehaves at school then the consequences would be dealt with at school. Before, when they told me she had a ""bad day"", I would ground her. But it wasn't fair that she would be punished all day for it. I implemented the ""marble system""... that worked for a whole week. I had to include my 6yr old son, because he felt left out. Since he's 90% of the time good, she felt it was a competition... and when a marble would be taken away she would lightly punch her head and say ""I'm a dumb dumb"". I explained to her that she is not a dumb dumb, she just has to make better choices. I read her ""Sometimes I'm bumbaloo"", book about a turtle and another book about how it's ok to be angry, but stop and think.  I've told her to ""blow bubbles""...""squeeze her fists tight and stop and think.  We started w/spanking, then to taking away toys, to privileges being taken away... Now, I try to talk to her with a calm and loving manner. I've even cried in front of her when I'm frustrated... she expresses concern, guilt and regret, but come the next day she's back at it again. I've involved everyone and anyone in hopes of getting advice or direction, but nothing has worked yet. I've explained to her the importance of her good behavior and the consequences of bad behavior. I've broken it down for her.....for example: if you misbehave you will get kicked out of daycare, mommy will lose her job, we will lose our house, we will have no money, we'll have to give our dogs away and live off of nature...I made it real drastic to see if it had an impact... NOT!!! I've sat down w/her and asked why she has so much anger, why she hurts her teachers?? I've told her we don't hurt the people we love and used reverse psychology.... ""would you like it if your teachers kicked you?""... they keep giving you chances because they love you... and you hurt them.. why?? Silence is what I get w/sorry. I told her sorry doesn't cut it. I asked her ""if i cut your finger off and then say I'm sorry, does that make it better? No, right? Your finger is still cut off.... then that's the same with when you hurt your teachers... you can't take it back."" Any suggestions please....??? "
658,"How to teach a child to ""see the forest""?","My 6-year-old son has been having trouble with not be able to ""see the forest because of the trees.""  He gets caught up in insignificant details and fails to learn the main point.  For example, last night we showed him a 42-second Bible story video.  Afterward, he was able to tell us five or six details from the video, including a couple of word-for-word quotes, except for the main point that the angel Gabriel told Mary she would be the mother of Jesus.  Is there a name for this kind of learning difficulty?  Are there techniques to teach to help him overcome it?  He gets plenty of practice, but when he concentrates more, he just remembers more trivia. "
659,"Should my 12-year son see, how I fail?","I have a 12-year old son. I don't live with his mother, but I try to do as much as possible to help him grow up a happy and healthy adult.  Couple of months ago I learned he had problems with maths and started to investigate what the cause may be. Among other things, I asked him what cool stuff they did at school during the last 30 days. He couldn't answer.  Then I asked him, what cool stuff he would like to do, if it was possible.  The answer was ""something related to programming"".  Thereafter we (me and his mother) made him the following offer: If he manages to earn enough money with a legal, ethical job, me and his mother won't bother him with grades (""enough"" means ""enough to survive in his region in a place separate from his mom's"").  He said he'd like to learn everything it takes to make money with programming, but he doesn't want to give up on school.  Then I started to teach him programming (I'm a software developer myself). First couple of lessons were about the ways he can make a living programming (employment, freelancing, own company). We have been learning to program via Skype since then. Large part of the sessions runs like this: I explain a particular FreeCodeCamp lesson to him (both of us look at the same text), then he tries to do the exercise. I help him, if he has difficulties.  At other times I'm just talking with him, usually discussing some article I found on the Internet and which I consider useful for him.  My impression is that he does less than he could. Sometimes he does an exercise in less than five minutes, but doesn't want to do the next one. Also, right now he doesn't seem to do them in his leisure time.  I tried several motivation hacks. I sent him the ""Pirates of the Silicon Valley"" movie. I explained to him the principle of conditioning (the stuff with the Pavlovian dog) -- when he rewards himself by eating a small, sugar-free candy after every completed exercise, it's easier to keep going.  There is a big gun I could use: I'm also constantly testing business ideas (mostly tech-related) and could tell him, how I do it myself. Up to now I never told him about this because most of my ideas were bad (didn't pass the validation phase). There are pros and cons.  Benefits of telling the child about how I test my business ideas   He will learn, how to test ideas on low budget (i. e. in a safe way, without taking unreasonable risks). He will see, what lean methodology looks in practice. He may get motivated -- sometimes you can change a person's behavior by doing what you are preaching yourself. If he looks at me testing ideas, he may some day do the same himself. He may learn, how to learn from feedback (the art and science of hypothesis testing). He may learn, how to find out things that nobody can tell you (scientific method). When you have a new product, no authority on Earth can tell you whether or not it will be useful to somebody. If a particular idea fails, he will see, how I get up and move on (pivot) to the next one (i. e. that failure does not need to destroy a person). He could learn the economic common sense that most people lack and which you can acquire only by doing a lot of business planning (incl. basics of accounting). This common sense is useful regardless of whether or not a person wants to start a business. Acquired common sense like ""you can't spend more than you earn indefinitely"" allows you, among other things, to stay out of numerous traps that financial institutions put in front of you (e. g. ""fast and easy"" consumer credits; a big problem in the region where he lives). In the ideal case, he will learn, how to build a company that is tailored to his personality. Potentially, a better emotional bond. Building a business is the second most important thing in my life (first being the child). If I show him that big part, it could lead to a deeper and better connection between us. I could argue that even if I continue to fail at business, it's better than not trying it. This activity keeps me alive and prevents me from drinking alcohol, starting unhealthy relationships, and making other suboptimal choices. There are women worth chasing even with zero chance of having a relationship with them (by ""chasing"" I mean primarily improving oneself to become worthier of her). I could argue that the same applies to my business-building activities.   Risks  My biggest concern is that he sees me trying and failing, he could make the wrong conclusion that he shouldn't even attempt entrepreneurship. A German business book says that many children of failed entrepreneurs are so traumatized that they don't even consider starting a business themselves.  All my ideas failed so far, but he didn't suffer because of those losses (I lost time and some non-catastrophic amounts of money).  Should I show and tell my son, how I'm trying to build the company of my dreams    here and now, or  do it when and if I've made my first billion?   Are there any other risks I'm not aware of? "
660,Should I be concerned about this poem?,"My daughter (11) chose this poem to take to school and present to her class:     Sometimes when I'm alone I cry because I'm on my own   The tears are bitter and warm   They flow with life, but take no form, I cry because my heart is torn.   I find it difficult to carry on. If I had an ear to confide in, I would cry among my treasured friend   But who do you know that stops that long, to help another carry on   The world moves fast and it would rather pass by   Than to stop and see what makes one cry, so painful and sad   And sometimes I cry and no one cares about why.   When her grandparent asked her if she felt like that, she said no, she just liked it. Should I say something to her? If so, what? "
661,How can I keep my newborn baby warm during nappy change?,"I'm 3 days in to parenthood and every time I change my son he makes heart-wrenching screams that go through my skull.  I have deduced that it is due to being cold; it's Winter here and really starting to get nippy. Even so, it is 21°c+ in the room but he still gets incredibly cold and therefore unhappy.  I know he's cold because he shivers sometimes during, and often after nappy changes.  Are there any ways to keep him warm during the nappy change?  Are there any materials that won't be so cold and uncomfortable for him, that are used to make nappy changers?  I have been trying to keep his clothes on and only take off the bottom part, but sometimes things get messy and I have to redress him in new clothes. I also just tried leaving the nappy changer on the radiator which he seemed to like a little more - but still ended up shivering. "
662,Can Prozac stunt a teenager's growth?,"I have a close friend whose son turned 14 last October. He started on 10mg of Prozac in September 2013, gradually increased to 60mg in July 2014, where he has remained.  My friend keeps regular records of her son's height, and he has not grown a single centimeter in the past eight months. His height was tracking slightly below average, but otherwise normal, prior to this.  His pediatrician did blood work in January and does not recommend any action at this time, so we assume his hormone levels are normal. (I have already suggested confirming this with the pediatrician.) But my friend is very worried. Just given the timing, the Prozac looks like a plausible culprit... But of course that could be random coincidence.  So my questions are:  1) Are there any reliable studies demonstrating or refuting a link between Prozac and stunted growth in teenagers? Simple Web searches turn up many pages, but they seem to be largely anecdotal.  2) What advice would you give to my friend? "
663,20 month old doesn't follow commands,"My 20 month old doesn't respond to commands. He doesn't talk yet. He is not responding to his name.   Hearing problem?  But, he responds and looks at me when I sing any of his rhymes. Wherever he is he will run towards kitchen for some specific sounds like Microwave sound.   Does he point at things he wants?  No, but he brings to me or try to bring whatever he wants. For ex. He brings his empty tumbler when he is thirsty. He brings his toy to me when it is OFF(he wants me to turn it On) etc  If the things are out of his reach, he will try to climb or just look at it and groans.   He doesn't want to make eye contact except when I'm singing his rhymes.   He pronounced some words when playing. He used to follow commands at 12months, like he moved his body when I asked him to dance or waved when said bye, but now he is not showing interest or he doesn't understand. Not sure what went wrong. Can someone please help?  "
664,How do I stop a twitching newborn waking itself?,"When we eventually get our three day old baby to sleep after what seems like hours of pinkie time and rocking, within five minutes of putting him down his violent arm and leg twitches cause him to wake and start fussing again. We've tried swaddling, to no avail, and we're definitely waiting until he's properly asleep (ragdoll for 15-20 minutes). Is this normal?! Any strategies for mitigation? "
665,"Toddler misbehaves a lot less with dad, than with mom","My 2-year-old is misbehaving a lot less with me, than with his mom. He goes to bed without issues, stops watching TV when it's time for bed, no tantrums in the super market (mostly), no problems with brushing teeth, when he is with me. With his mom, it's a very different story.  When he is with her there is constant tension, which is partly her reaction to his behaviour, but he does act up more with her, he insists on what he wants more, he cries far longer, when he doesn't get it. For example, when I go for a long subway drive with him, he starts to complain and revolt at some point, but it's manageable, whereas with her it's a lot worse. I definitley don't let him do as much in public, I tend to insist holding his hand for example, while she is more willing, to let him run around the super market for example.  I have suspected, that this is due to him feeling more close to his mom, and maybe because I am less prone to give in to his ""tactics"" and more likely to ignore the tantrums and make less compromises etc.  I have read, that a child will let out stronger emotions, when with mom, because of the closer relationship with her. Especially when she comes back from work, he will instantly go to her and start acting up, which I read is good for the child, as a way to vent or let it all out.  I have noticed, that when I start making more compromises, that he starts to act up more with me too. At least, that's what I think I noticed, anecdotally.  So I thought, maybe him not acting up with me is actually a sign of a feeling of distance? Maybe I should optimize for more acting up with me not less? On the other hand he seems perfectly fine and happy, knowing that there is no point arguing with me about brushing teeth and watching TV, since it's a hopeless cause. He seems to be calm and happy, knowing exactly what is going to happen next, etc. I also often spend time with him and he doesn't complain, most of the time, when his mother leaves and he falls asleep with only me present without issue.  So basically I am not sure, what would be better for him: Feeling more intimate with me, but acting up more. Or maybe feeling more distance to me, but being calmer and acting up less?  Is there any data on the subject? "
666,Should young children be kept away from a depressed relative if the latter ignores them?,"I have a brother who suffers from depression. He is in his late twenties, is unemployed, has almost no social life and lives by himself. Every other weekend for a day, I have him over at my house where I live with my wife and 2 daughters (7 and 3).   There was a time when he would speak and play with my eldest daughter, but the past few months he has begun to ignore her (he would smile and say 'hello' but that is it). My daughter has asked me why her uncle is different now and I just told her that he prefers to be by himself (not sure how to explain his exact condition to her). He still talks with me though (and she has probably noticed this as well).  I don't want to ask him why his behavior changed because I learned a long time ago not to criticize anything he does (he always assumes that I am blaming him or trying to find fault with him).  So given that he is ignoring her now, is it better to keep him away from the house and my daughter? Should I just meet him outside or go over to his place?  For now my daughter seems to have figured out not to expect too much from him and she just plays by herself or with her younger sister when he is around (I play with her also when he leaves).  I want to take care of my brother but I don't want his presence in the house to harm my daughter in any way. He used to have tantrums but he has gotten that under control the past few years and so far he has never ""lost it"" in front of my kids (although deep down I have a fear that one day he might). "
667,How do you handle the boomerang effect with Teens?,"15 year old teen boy in question.  Generally good kid but minor annoyances here and there  coming &amp; going without saying hello (sometimes).  missing please/thank you (sometimes).  speaking courteously to parents (2/3 times in general, particularly to mum).  concentrating on study during study time rather than multitasking chat + study.  By boomerang effect the meaning was, we tend to micromanage him a little, and as he grows older are finding it is starting to just bounce off him and the harder we try the more it just comes back in the opposite direction like a boomerang.  He gets frustrated when told off and says stop lecturing me &amp; clearly wants to be left to his own devices in terms of studies and other areas but we are just trying to help.  How do you balance telling a kid what to do vs developing their character to be self sufficient?  He has this year &amp; next to finish highschool and get university entrance so we are really pressuring him to study as much as possible to get accepted into whichever degree he chooses (currently undecided but likes science field).  He has bursts where he will study a lot, then cools off and does very little. It's inconsistent.  Any good articles on this? "
668,Does my newborn sleep too little?,"My 8 day old daughter has slept about 13 hours during last 24 hours. She eats a lot, poops often and properly (at least 7 times in 24h), is breast fed and there is enough milk for her.  Is that normal? Supposedly, newborns should sleep much more. Should I be worried? "
669,Where are the majority of children on the Autism Spectrum?,"Our doctor suspects our 2 year old daughter has Autism so we have booked her in for an official diagnosis and we are madly reading everything we can on the net.  I can see under the DSM-IV Model that people fall under Aspergers, PDD-NOD, or classic Autism.  She had a delay in language (no dadda or mamma) so I know she would not meet the Aspergers. But motor skills seem fine, and her restrictive / repetitive play symptoms seem very mild.  What percentage of diagnosis fall into each category? Is Aspergers, PDD-NOS or Classic Autism the most common? "
670,Should middle school students/high school students be able to choose their own bedtime?,"Sleeping is important, but do students have the right to choose when they do so? Or should they let their parents decide the bedtime? Students above the age 12 need over 8 hours of sleep. It's important or you'll be drowsy, moody, upset angry etc. You will also be refreshed every morning, and have the ability to stay up longer without a proper amount.   If a student above that age has the right to choose their own bed time, they can choose when they feel is right when to go to bed or wake up. They may not get this right at first, but students need their own arrangement to take breaks, do school work, and other. Though an arranged bedtime by your parents may be difficult to follow, maybe by 9 p.m. This may not give you enough time to complete the tasks you've been thinking about doing.   The bedtime we can make ourselves may be 10, 11, or a bad time, 12. We'll learn from these mistakes and should be able to choose when we should sleep and wake up. Parents and or guardians shouldn't have to make a time or watch over us when. What do you think?  "
671,What to do when a child gets angry while trying to lead a group?,"On a children's camp we have a group of 4 boys (around 12 years old) with no appointed leader. One of the boys is naturally trying to lead the others, but they are lazy, so it's not easy for him. The problem is that one of them is not just lazy, but he's intentionally sabotaging games and other activities. This behaviour makes the one who's trying to be their leader very angry, to the point he gets a tantrum and we have to forcibly move him away and hold him till he calms down.  There is a second boy group (around 1-2 years older), whose members get on very well.  The children could choose their groups themselves.  My question is, what can we do about this problem? Shall we put the ""leader"" to the other group? Or should we move the troublemaker there...?    Based on anongoodnurse's comment:  They have been together in their groups for about 11 days. Mostly, they spend together about 3-4 hours a day (during some games or other activities). Of course, we always try to explain the troublemaker that he should behave, but it's difficult because he isn't demonstrably doing anything wrong; it's just the way he ""unintentionally"" slows down the others etc. We haven't tried anything in order to prevent this problem yet; it only happened 2 times so now we're just begining to think what to do about it. The other boys take the ""leader""-in-the-making as an actual leader - they follow him, mostly; when he gets angry, they don't laugh, they take it quite seriously, although they don't do anything about it (they just stay back). "
672,If a 4 year old is afraid to swim is it better to keep trying or wait?,"My son is afraid of swimming, and has been for a very long time. We first took him to baby swim classes and he never took to it like the other children in the class. I took him to swimming classes when he was three and he again was afraid and although there was progress he never gained the confidence that other children got. Now my son is 4 and we've put him in more swimming classes and he still seems terrified, some classes he cries from the beginning to the end.   I do not want my son to be afraid of the water, my thought was that if we kept taking him to swimming classes he would eventually get over it and learn to swim a bit, or at least not be afraid to get in. Now I am concerned that by pushing it when he's obviously so scared that I could turn this into a life-long aversion to the water.   What's best? Do I stop classes and wait for him to get older before trying again, or do I keep him at it until he gets over it?  "
673,What to do about my almost 3-year-old son now going late to bed and wanting us to stay in his room with him?,"My 2 years and 9 months old son has never been the best sleeper, but we don't know what to do anymore. He used to go to bed without a hitch at 8:30 pm and sometimes get up at 2-3 am or sleep until 5:30 / 6 am, which is fine by me.   Now he won't go to bed until as late as 10 or even 11 pm and wants someone in his room with him. We've tried letting him cry it out and some nights it works and sometimes it doesn't and he will cry for 45 minutes with no end in sight. I go in and lay on the floor in his room and I see him just looking around blinking. It's crazy because he is going to camp and swims a few times a week in the late afternoon.    I'm wondering if all kids go through this phase where they start to become more aware of their surroundings and don't want to be alone in their rooms? It's so hard, because my wife and I both work fulltime long hours and commute. He takes late baths, too. I guess we are just screwed - hopefully not for too much longer. Does or did anyone else have a similar situation? What else did you try to do? "
674,How to improve our 3-year-old's sleep cycle without skipping long afternoon nap?,"My 3-ear-old goes to daycare where they have the policy to not wake up the sleeping kids. Therefore she ends up taking 3 hours nap from 12-3. When she comes home around 6 pm, she would be all fresh and active and won't sleep till 12-1 am, even if I take her to bed early and switch off the lights.  I have tried to request daycare teachers several times to wake her up early, but they simply say they cannot do that.  What kind of activities should I try to make her tired and sleep in time? As it's quite cold, we cannot do many outdoors activities. At home, we try to jump/dance and play with bubbles. Any suggestions on how to improve the sleep cycle?  "
675,Handling a toddler at a hotel/hostel,"My parents asked if we'd like to go on a vacation with some of my extended family. The vacation will be spent almost entirely at a nice hostel; we mostly want to relax and spend quality family time together. In general I've enjoyed these vacations in past years, but the last two times we've tried to vacation with my daughter (now 1 year 10 months) have been extremely difficult. My two biggest problems are:   It doesn't look like we can get something with more than one room. This means that whenever my daughter is asleep, somebody needs to be in the room with her, with the lights off, keeping pretty quiet. (She usually sleeps 2.5 hours in the early afternoon, and goes to sleep at 9pm.) Meals are a central part of the vacation,  with all the family sitting round together. But with a toddler they become very difficult. At home I can let my daughter run around and play if she's not eating precisely when we are. But in any kind of lodging, the dining room is large and crowded with strangers. This means she needs constant supervision throughout meals - which means either me or my wife can't really participate in the ""main event.""   In addition to all this, there's all the usual hassle of taking care of a kid without our full homecourt arsenal of toys, food, etc. And, on the other hand, there's not much present for her to do and to enjoy, except general running around (and getting kvelled over by the entire family).  So the bottom line is, watching my daughter becomes such a hassle under these conditions, that I (and/or my wife) have little time to actually enjoy the vacation itself.  Are there ways to avoid these problems and actually enjoy what the vacation was originally meant for? Or should we pass on this particular gathering, in favor of spending family time without vacationing, and vacation time in more toddler-friendly (or toddler-free) circumstances?    Note: This vacation is planned around a Jewish holiday, during which lots of normal everyday activities are forbidden - including using computers, phones and TVs; driving (e.g. away from the hostel); listening to music. I'd appreciate answers that took this into consideration, though for the purposes of the FAQ-for-the-ages I also welcome suggestions that ignore this limitation. "
676,Do we need an electronic breast pump?,"Since we plan that my wife is going to be a full-time/stay at home mom, do you think she will need an electronic breast pump?   We are first time parents. We do not sure if we need the electric one or the manual one. The thing that we worry the most is that manual pump can't give us enough stock for our newborn. We want to trade off between the cost and the usability.  We understand the benefit of electric pump such as using less time to do pumping. However, as we mention, if my wife is stay at home all the time, is it necessary?   Side question: how many day do you have breast milk in stock? "
677,Disadvantages of a single bedroom?,"Looking ahead to the future, me and my partner often discuss how we would raise children. In these conversations, recently, a theme of sleeping arrangements has emerged.  We appear to agree that a lot of teen and preteen isolationist tendencies could be curbed if we had a single communal bedroom. We also believe it would foster a tighter family bond, and would likely be cheaper to boot.  Now, it made us wonder why this is not the norm? Why do we give kids their own rooms? By extension, and in essence, what would be the disadvantages of such a communal bedroom arrangement?  Incidentally, but of note, we believe sex would not be an issue, as we have no intention of ever hiding that from children in the first place. We want it to be normalized before any questions need to be answered. "
678,How to help a shy 6-year-old make friends?,"I have a 6-year-old son. He's the oldest, and we moved from the US to the UK three years ago. He's in Y2 (second grade), and is one of the younger children in his class. There are 35 kids in his grade/class, and honestly, the vast majority of the other boys are... not who he'd be friends with. He's fairly quiet/shy, loves football (soccer) and chess and reading and crafts.   During Friday night dinner, asked me ""how to make friends"". I gave a quick answer, and tried to ask a bit over the weekend about the underlying source of his question, but without too much luck.  What I want to do is give him a really good answer about how to make friends. With some concrete suggestions.  Most of my initial thoughts about making friends come from my own experiences, that it's usually easiest with like minded people – who enjoy doing the things you enjoy, and that you bond over/while doing those activities.  I'm happy to encourage him in this, and create more opportunities for it... but want to make sure that I'm also enabling him, so that it's something that he wants to do.   So... any suggestions? About how to answer him, about making friends? And about how to create situations that will help him to be successful? "
679,Do we need a life jacket for our almost 2-year-old when we go to the beach?,"   Possible Duplicate:   What should we pack when going camping with an infant?       My family and I are going to the beach this July.  It will be the first trip to the beach for my son, my daughter, and my husband.  My daughter will be a few days shy of her second birthday when we go, and my husband insists that she needs a life jacket.  We obviously have no intention of letting her go near the water on her own, and when we do go in the water it will be shallow water and we'll be holding her the entire time.    I see my husband's point.  Yes, there's the possibility that something could happen and she could sprint away from us and into the water without us, or we could lose our hold on her and drop her I guess.  With four adults (my parents are coming, too), I just don't think it's that much of a concern.  However, I agreed that I would post to the community and agree to the consensus.  So:  life jacket or no life jacket?    If you recommend life jacket, could you point me towards a place where I can find a life jacket for a child who weighs &lt;25 lbs?  My daughter is VERY small for her age and we might hit 25 pounds by her birthday--maybe.  She's 21ish pounds right now. "
680,How thoroughly should a newborn girls private areas be cleaned?,"I'm concerned about the hygiene of my newborn daughter's private areas. After pooping there are rarely any poop globules located between labia, but it does sometimes happen. Moreover, the ""liquid"" poop also has a chance of getting there - and it sometimes does.   How firmly should I clean those areas? Just on the surface and delicately remove any globules, or widen the area with two fingers and clean the area around the opening of the vagina more thoroughly? "
681,What to tell an 8 yo when his mother is incarcerated for 1+ years?,"The press of the moment is arriving.  It is highly likely that the mom (divorced) will be incarcerated for 1+ years (first incarceration).  (She has been in jail for 3 weeks now with no bail allowed. Child living with dad, who has primary custody, so not a big change in living conditions, just no weekends with mom.)  The crimes are all financial. The question is, how to explain to an 8 yo that his mother is in jail?  What to volunteer and what to be prepared to say with respect to questions on such topics as: a. How much detail on the current reason for incarceration (parole violation) b. How much detail on past crime (embezzlement) c. Mention other past criminal convictions, all financial (dating back decades) d. Mention new, pending charges (theft)? e. Explain goal of prison (rehab, punishment) f. Describe how to stay in contact while in prison g. Length of time before get out? h. Why did mom do this/these? (Need? Poor judgment?) i. Unconditional love j. What other topics should be on this list  Update: Sesame Street has some materials on this: [website]Pg 11 has some suggestions on breaking the news.  [website]Especially “Visiting a parent in prison”  (This URL leads to other materials, but without a change to the URL) "
682,Language Developmental Milestones of Children at higher stages?,"In the early stages of language development, children goes through milestones such as     Speech blurbs, Single words,  double words,  Use of verbs  full sentence  etc.  [I may be limited in my knowledge so correct me if so]   Now by the age of 2.5 to 3 (and in case of my kid it is at 3.5 years) children do express themselves reasonably well.   However, there are many kids at four which are very clear in their expressions just like any other adult and are also comfortable expressing ideas at a bit more complex and abstract levels; where as in my kid (also observed in some kids) manage to speak only actionable (often not very fluent) or in other words their ideas are restricted.   My question is: what are the milestones of language (and if you consider it as cognitive) development of children after the are able to get basic speech? How do they evolve from there both in developing their languages and their understanding of details of the world?   PLEASE NOTE: i don't know if cognition and language are two independent things. I, as a parent, only want to be knowledgeable about a typical growth path that children follow (or are expected to follow) after basic speech is achieved. "
683,What causes a 7 year old to be overly affectionate,"My 7 year old daughter has very recently become very affectionate with her soon to be step dad. What could cause this? She doesn't see her dad often, but calls him daily. Could it be as simple as she see's me hugging or kissing my boyfriend, so she assumes she should do the same? She seems to always be asking him for hugs or cuddles or trying to kiss him on the cheek. She isn't overly affectionate when it is just the 2 of us at home, only when he is around recently.  "
684,Do I really need to wake my newborn to feed him?,"We have a two week old child. He's eating well during the day, eating at least 8 times a day, and is breast feeding. His weight gain has been 'normal' so far, and he regained his original birth weight by 10 days. We're getting conflicting advice on how to handle feeding at night time. We have heard:   feed him every 2-3 hours, just like during the day it's ok to leave it 4-5 hours at night, as long as he doesn't wake up and 'ask' for food let him sleep as long as he wants, and feed him when he gets up   Are there any studies or definitive answers out there for this? How should we handle the night time feeds? Sleep is obviously good for the wife and I, but how much food do we need to get in? "
685,Why did my pre-schooler suddenly develop an odd accent?,"Over the past week, my three-year-old son started talking with what I can only describe as a Southern (U.S.) accent.  He has started elongating his pronunciation of ""ah"" sounds, so that ""yeah"" sounds more like ""yea-ah"", with two syllables.    Similarly, he'll say ""they-err"" instead of ""there"", and ""way-er"" instead of ""where"".  It seems to have developed totally out of the blue.  Is this normal?  What can cause this?  Will he outgrow it? "
686,How quickly do I need to change my newborn with a dirty diaper?,"How quickly do I need to jump on changing a dirty diaper? What are the downsides of waiting vs getting right to it?   I have two specific scenarios in mind:   I'm holding my son during the day time, and he lets one fly. Should I interrupt what I'm doing to get him cleaned up? Should I wait for a bit to make sure he's done? If he's not unhappy about the situation, can I just wait? It's nighttime and he's sleeping. We can get through a feed with him waking minimally, eating, and then going right back to sleep. However, changing a diaper wakes him up completely and makes it much harder to get him back to sleep. Can we just leave it if he's not complaining and he isn't developing diaper rash?   My son is an infant (currently 2 weeks), how does the advice change with age? "
687,How to clean a baby's mouth from Gentian Violet?,"Does anyone know of any way to get Gentian Violet off of a baby's mouth/lips? We have to give him 2 more doses I believe and he is already a purple mess after the first dose. I realize that the mouth, teeth and tongue are going to be stained. But surely there is a way to remove some of it from all over his mouth? "
688,Should toddlers have learning goals?,"My two (almost 2-year old children) have started going to a day care centre a couple of days a week - they seem quite happy there and it's all going well. The centre has a learning framework for the early years and has asked us what our learning objectives and goals were for our children. The framework lays out goal areas such as developing a sense of well-being, showing confidence and independence, etc.  So I am simply wondering whether my kids should actually have goals at such a young age. If you have objectives, then you must also think about performance (are objectives being met?) and what you do with it (if objectives are not met, then what?). My instinct tells me this is all overcooked, that my children will soon enough be under scrutiny and required to perform (against standards, others, themselves, etc.), and for the rest of their life (at school, at work, outside, etc.). Doesn't putting objectives on them so early put unnecessary pressure on them (and us)? Am I missing something altogether? "
689,Is carrying or cuddling a newborn a good way to soothe it in the long run?,"Our newborn (11 days) daughter sometimes - about once every three times - has trouble sleeping unless she is being hugged, cuddled or carried by me or my wife.  We have tried leaving her crying for 10 minutes, but after that time there was no sign of calming, so we took her to cuddle her to sleep eventually. She slept peacefully from then on for a few hours.  The question is: is such behavior of ours going to introduce bad habits later on, or are we allowed to do it for now, at least sometimes?  What are the signs to watch for to avoid bad sleeping habits in the future? "
690,How long can a newborn girl bleed from her vagina?,"The bleeding from a newborn girl's vagina is completely normal, it happens due to hormones being absorbed by the baby while still in the womb.  How long can this bleeding last?  Does it come and go, or does it occur only once for a period of time?  Today morning during diaper change of our 12 day old we have noticed some blood and mucus coming from her vagina, and of course have cleaned it. During next diaper change (2 hours later) there was even more blood - even more than during the first few days after her birth when she also bled. Should we be worried?  Update:  My daughter is almost a year old now and we had no further problems. We've also then consulted with a pediatrician, she said it is rare (the blood appearing, disappearing and appearing again), but it happens. And unless there was a relatively large amount of blood (a major leak instead of a droplet) we sholdn't worry. "
691,Is blood from an injured nipple harmful to the child?,"Nipples sometimes bleed, and some of that blood can be sucked by a child.  Is it harmful to the child?  What effects can it have? "
692,"Is it better to introduce formula while my daughter is still drinking breast milk? If so, how gradually should it be introduced?","My wife was fortunate enough to produce a lot of breast milk (enough to feed our 7-month-old daughter and also pump a significant amount, which we froze).  In the first few months of our daughter's life, she was exclusively breast feeding, but now my wife is back to work and her supply is naturally dwindling and she's now at the point where she's no longer pumping.  We're guessing that on an average day, our daughter gets maybe 4-6 oz. per day from breast feeding, and about 22-24 oz. from our frozen supply.  We probably have about 6 weeks' worth of frozen milk left (2 months' worth at the most), and at that point, my wife probably won't be producing anything, so we'll have to transition to formula.  Note that the milk is in a deep freezer, and it's unlikely that any will be more than 6 months' old when she drinks it.  My questions are:   It seems better to me that we should start feeding her formula while she's also drinking breast milk, so it's not a big shock (and so we have breast milk to feed her in case we need to try different formulas, etc.).  Is this true? If so, is there an ideal time to start the formula (e.g. when we have 2 weeks' worth of breast milk left)?  At that point, how much formula vs. breast milk should we use?  Should we introduce the formula slowly (e.g. start with 1 bottle per day of formula vs. 4 of breast milk, and then work our way up to 5 formula?) Should we mix the formula with breast milk (i.e. in the same bottle?)  If so, similar question to above - should we start with a low % of formula in each bottle and work our way up to 100% formula in a bottle as a way to ease her into it?  "
693,Is it possible to control iPad message language without my 10-year-old daughter hating me?,"A few weeks ago I found my 10-year-old daughter using inappropriate language on her iPad. As it was the first time I caught her swearing, and the message was more in her own defense of another's bullying, I didn't go too hard on her. We do not swear in our home. I let her know it was inappropriate and wouldn't be tolerated in the future.  Her time spent on her iPad (which she bought with her own money) has gotten out of control, and her attitude and disrespect towards me has gotten worse. Her marks at school are not good, and she failed her last math test. In response to this I recently cut her screen time to 1 hour a day on week days and 3 hours Saturday, 3 hours Sunday. I also have moved the docking station out of her room and into a family area. So of course now she hates me and says this is not fair.  That I could deal with. Today I check her iPad and saw more inappropriate language and rudeness to a 15-year-old boy that she doesn't even know. I am so disappointed. I didn't want to strain this mother-daughter relationship further, but feel I must take it away altogether or remove any apps that allow private messages. What should I do? I don't want to alienate her from her friends, have her hate me and be impossible to live with, and be grouchy to her sister, but don't feel I can allow this behavior. Any suggestions? "
694,When to give up learning an instrument with a 6-year-old?,"My daughter has been practising the violin with the Suzuki method since she was 3.5 years old and she is now 6 (so 2.5 years practising). However she's never really wanted to.  She has struggled severely to learn the instrument. It took her 18 months to learn the first song - Twinkle twinkle little star. We effectively let her drop a year after the first year because she was so far behind the other children. We have effectively practised every single day during that period.  She now can play until the 8th song but again is falling behind.  Problems:   Verbally wants to stop, says that she never wanted to start Never wants to practice, we have tried different times of the day, giving stars where she gets a gift after getting 10 stars The violin school is a great place, it's a very friendly community that does everything together on a Saturday morning - there's nothing like it anywhere near us She is ingraining bad habits - holding the bow, holding the violin, posture She will do the absolute minimum in group lessons by just pretending to play with her fingers  We've been considering quitting for over a year There does seem to be more of a problem than just motivation, she gets very confused with similar song structures and seems to forget what she has learned very quickly   Going well:   She can learn to sing the songs - and sing them very nicely She has made it to song 8 and is slower than the other current students but not as bad as with the first year   Clearly we are pressuring our child into doing something she doesn't want to do. But what will be the consequences of giving up?  Similar to this comment:     Pressuring is really a balance I think; I felt some pressure with continuing my instrument, but I am happy that my parents were persistent. Learning to give up at the first hurdle is not a good lesson.   Do we persist but somehow relieve the pressure? Give up and leave it until she shows some interest (but I'm not sure that will ever happen)?  "
695,How to evaluate social/emotional development?,"I know there are many books on evaluating academic success and deficits, but how do you evaluate social/emotional learning?  Are there studies to help with this? What milestones should a parent look for?  Should the amount of schooling in the younger years be factored into the evaluation as the child started learning social skills at a younger age? "
696,How does a parent's misophonia impact the child?,"Misophonia is hatred of sound. The condition causes the individual to have a reaction of sudden rage and stress and the need to get away from the sound. The sounds vary from individual to individual, but the common ones are chewing sounds. Other examples are sniffling, cracking, certain speech patterns and vocal frequency. The sounds which cause these reactions tend to have a pattern to them.   Chewing sounds and noisy eating, as well as sniffling are very common among children. Does it affect the level of bonding the parent can have with the child? I see quite a bit of archived reddit threads which discuss how the parent handles it for themselves, but how does it impact the child?     additional information:  I do not yet have a child. This is one of the deciding factors for which I will or will not have a child.   The sounds of reaction are eating, drinking, and sniffling, coughing. Sound of metal against plate etc. Anything with a repeated pattern.   The reaction varies depending on the sound and source of the sound. I usually leave. Ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, music do not work in most cases. I have above average hearing acuity ( has been tested).   Will it build resentment if I ask the child to stop making sounds?   Will it cause bonding issues because I likely won't be able to take role in feeding?  Will the child pick up the stress I feel?  Will it cause behavior issues in the child in the long run?   Will it cause them to be constantly self conscious and develop low self steam?   I would appreciate if someone who has a parent with misophonia, or a parent with misophonia who has raised a child that is currently in teenage years or higher, can speak from their experience.    While the experience may vary from person to person, it will at least give me some data on what to expect.    "
697,What can I do to get my wife to be more involved?,"I'm writing this in the middle of the night, right after a bottle feed and a nappy change coupled with incessant wailing piercing through my ears. I've often tried to seek solace on the internet hoping that I'm not alone in this situation and that someone out there has some answers to offer or, at the very least, is able to say that I'm not alone in this trying times.   My daughter was delivered via c-section just over 3 weeks ago due to unforeseen birth complications that arose during labour. Upon seeing the amount of pain, discomfort and immobility my wife had to endure in the first few hours and days post-op, I offered to sleep on the couch with the cot by my side during the night so that I can tend to my daughter (change her nappies, bottle feed her and rock her back to sleep) without her jolting my wife up from sleep with her crying. I made it my goal to ensure that she had at least 6 - 7 hours of uninterrupted sleep before she gets up to breast feed at intervals in the day. My mother-in-law also chips in to help during the day so that my wife wouldn't have to move about too much. All I wanted for her was to have a speedier recovery so that we could look after our child to the best we can.   3 weeks on, I endured with only an hour or 2 of sleep in the night before throttling off to work. I usually knock off around 5 - 6pm and get back home in less than an hour. I try to have my dinner as quickly as possible before starting my shift around 8pm by helping my wife to bathe and then tending to my baby. My mother in law is usually exhausted by then so she usually turns in early. The last breast feed my wife gives is at around 11 or 12 before she turns in and leaves everything else to me.  3 weeks in with the lack of sleep accumulating and work piling up, I'm beginning to feel increasingly frustrated that:  1) Despite making such quick recovery and being able to move around without assistance (the Gynae has even remarked that she has recovered extremely well), my wife doesn't seem to be getting herself involved as much as I would like her to be. I'm still running the same night shifts and my mother in law is still doing the bulk of the work in the day. My wife does chip on a few rare occasions when neither of us are available, but that usually amounts up to 1 or 2 nappy changes.  2) No one in the household seems to recognize that I still have a job to do in the day in order to pay for all my family's necessities. Not once has there ever been an offer to lighten my burden; somehow it has just become an expectation that I have to fulfill by default.   Does anyone know how I can cope with this? I understand that it generally takes 6 weeks for c-sect mothers to fully recuperate but by the 2nd week or so, most are able to tend to basic things.   Does basic things constitute of just breast feeding or is there more that c-sect mothers can and should do 3 weeks in?   It seems that fathers traditionally make up the half of parents that do not contribute enough or are unable to properly fulfill parental duties. The internet has no lack of advices on how mothers can ""deal"" with this. Is there something that fathers can do if they find themselves in a reversed situation like mine?    My night shifts are driving me nuts and it doesn't help that my daughter is showing signs of baby colic.   Can somebody point me in the right direction?   UPDATE  I wish I could mark all the responses I've gotten so far as an answer because every single one has so much truth in it.   I took the time to speak with my wife a little about my frustrations and limitations today. Although we haven't really gotten into the motion of working things out just yet, I certainly felt a lot better speaking and talking about it. I could tell that my wife appreciates the honesty as well. How things pan out at the end of the day remains to be seen, but I'm definitely a lot more optimistic than I was yesterday.   A big thank you for all the support and advices that I have received thus far. I'll be accepting the first response as the answer not because it is any better or worse than the others but because I should at the very least mark this thread with an ""answered"". I hope that I'm not stepping on any toes by doing so; please be assured that every single response I have gotten has really provided me with valuable insights and support.  "
698,Am I losing control as a father and head of house?,"Our 3.5-year-old son just keep reacting: asking mom about all things. He doesn’t care if I am calling. if he is crying I am trying to console him. He would fight me to go to mother and I keep repeating his name but he wouldn’t listen.  It has become very frustrating for me. It is like talking to a wall or a mean person. I know he is my son but I feel like I don’t have any respect like my words doesn’t matter. He do listen to a strict voice of his mom, when I get strict voice he would run for his mom and we end up having argument that I am not understanding him (TBH I give him my best) but she has a upper hand being strict even scaring him that he get spanked with shoes (Asian standard of locking in dark room).  Background: I work full time, my wife works part time. He is with his grandma. He got 4 uncles all under 30. I think they lack etiquette. There is yelling, loud laughter. My son got constipation and making him do potty is a HUGE issue which is all crying and screaming. He wants to see TV all day and want mobile while going to bed and wake up to ask mobile (the reason is my wife wake up late and he wake early so to make him busy she gives mobile) and lately we had a fight because he kept asking mobile. At night and I kept saying no mobile in night, but he was constantly ignoring me and kept repeating to his mother during which I lost my cool.   Even in grandma's house it’s mobile or TV because she cannot take her out, her boys are either on TV, mobile or PS4.   I do not know what is contributing to my son's behaviour of totally ignoring me (sometimes he just cries and wants to get X thing and my wife gives it, once telling me I scold him more because of you? Again blame game). But I really want to take the things out which is making him so ignorant towards me.   Why is he becoming like this? Should I take away internet from home and cut off my wife mobile? Am I thinking too extreme? What can I do? "
699,How bad is a metal spoon for a 6-month-old baby?,Our six-month-old daughter loves to chew on metal spoons. She already has two teeth. Is this harmful to her teeth and dentition? Is a hard plastic spoon less harmful despite small plastic particles that can come off? 
700,Is it a good idea to go on an overseas holiday with a 6 month old baby?,Thinking of going on a short holiday to Amsterdam (the Netherlands). Do babies enjoy travelling and going to new places? Is it easy to travel with a 6 month old? Flight is 10 hours so not too bad. Will the experience will enrich my baby in some way? Is Amsterdam safe for babies? She has started solids but is not eating much so I'll be breastfeeding her. She is not a good sleeper though but loves going on walks and looking at people and the scenery.  
701,Different discipline approaches by working mommy and stay-home daddy,"I work at home (although me being independent is almost a euphemism for being unemployed).  My wife is the primary breadwinner in our household.  My wife is also currently under a lot of stress, as her job responsibilities have increased in the lasts months, we have faced some unexpected payments, her mother died after a long deteriorating disease, etc.  We also have some disagreements in how to upbring our children.  I rather have the kids take responsibility of their acts (v.g. if you don't make your bed you have to sleep in an undone bed; if you don't to your homework you will get a bad grade) while, on the other hand, I am pretty relaxed on enforcing behavior. Probably too much relaxed.  My wife, on the other hand, prefers to watch them more tightly, giving orders and expecting orders to be followed, or else.  She rather prevents undesired consequences (v.g. living in a mess, getting bad grades, etc.) so if the kid does not follows an order, he or she will be punished but the chore will be made by someone else.  This leads to some conflicts, and while I attempt not to reverse her orders or decisions in-front of the kids, she is a little less reserved in criticizing my parenting, and pointing that bad behavior from our kids (particularly from the older boy, 8) is induced by my bad example.  She also accuses my relaxing parenting as just laziness.  While she might be right at some points, I do believe I am not always wrong.  When I try to point out some disagreement she usually feels attacked.  I do believe she should calm down, and having a more relaxed attitude that would even help her with her own stress.  But my main concern is how my kids are getting these mixed messages.  Too controlled by their mother, too relaxed by their father, and not having to deal with direct consequences of their behavior other than being grounded or having TV and gaming privileges revoked.  Am I right in this last concern?  How can I prevent giving these mixed messages?  How can I (we) mitigate the effects or how would I prepare to the consequences?    I had already read both the question and answers of How to deal with the child when both the parents are not on the same page? before posting this question; and I find that the situation is not the same, the requested advice is not the same, and the answers, while useful, are not the ones I need. "
702,Does a child's resemblance to a parent affect attitudes of other family members?,"When a child strongly resembles one of his/her parents it can create a reaction in people who meet the child.  Can a strong physical resemblance to a parent affect relationships with both close and distant family members, where there is a strong emotional connection (positive or negative) to that parent?  Has there been any research into this and if so, what were the findings? "
703,Father always wants to be right,"I am a 22 year old living with my parents. I'm currently in quite a bit of distress as my father has kicked me out. I assume my mom will talk with him when she gets back from her night shift but for now I'm not welcome. He assaulted me (tried to strangle me) before kicking me out.   The reason we had this argument is because he always wants to be right. My sister had insulted me minutes before because I had done something slightly wrong. I was aware of what I had done wrong and accepted that. I did not however accept the insult. My dad explained what I did wrong. In turn I explained I didn't like being insulted. He said ""You don't understand, you did X wrong."" It went on a bit like that. He just got more and more angry. I kept telling him I did understand, but I didn't like being insulted about it. I probably got angry too. Then he exploded and assaulted me. This happens more often. My sister and my boyfriend pulled him away from me, dad told me to leave, but I went all out on my sister. I told her I hate her and it was all her fault. I don't hate her, I said that in anger and frustration.   He has been angry before with me and it's always been because he says I don't listen or I (or my brother or sister) doesn't agree with him. I don't know what to do with this. How do I handle it when my father only wants to hear ""You are right"" and nothing else? He has argued with me and others over things that could be proven wrong. He once argued with me how a place looked that I had visited that day and he last visited 30 years ago. There were absolutely no stairs over there, he said. Now I even said he was right but he didn't accept that I felt insulted.   What can I do when my father always wants to be right? How can I speak to him about this?  I should probably mention both my father and I have been diagnosed with autism. And I don't want anything legally done. I love my father and understand why he does this. I need to know how to cope with it somehow. Excuse my ranty post. I'm fine with edits to the structure.  "
704,At what age should I start looking to have my daughter interact regularly with other children?,"My daughter is 8 months old. She stays at home with my husband and I all day (we work from home). While we do get out (we have a daily walk), she probably sees non-family-members once a week and other children once or twice a month.   We're always getting comments from friends/family that we should be getting her out to meet people more, and she should be playing with other children more often too. Is this really an issue? At what age should she be playing regularly with other children on a daily basis?  In the future I'll be looking at playgroups/childcare for her. What age will these things be a necessity? (to clarify, the childcare wouldn't really be for our convenience, but rather for her social needs. We can keep her here at home without any issue) "
705,8 month infant does not smile,Is that normal? Or this may be a sign of autism? 
706,What kind of spoon should be used to feed the infant who is used to be fed by the bottle?,The tea spoon holds quite a less amount of milk. The kid of 5 months old is used to bottle feeding for past 4 months.  I was thinking of using a soup spoon instead (which is round and has depth). Will that be a bad idea?  What kind of spoon should be used such that she doesn't miss the bottle too much? 
707,Is non-professional homeschooling detrimental to children?,"In a comment to another question the following assertion was made:     Are you a qualified and trained teacher? Homeschooling would be detrimental if you are not a professional in this industry.   While detrimental means ""tending to cause harm"" we can probably lower the bar a bit.   Do children homeschooled by those without professional teacher training or specific teaching qualifications have worse outcomes in life than those schooled by professional, trained, and qualified teachers, as found in public education?  While personal experiences are valuable, I'm specifically interested in research or studies show or demonstrate this. "
708,Is it reasonable to put limits on a pre-teen playing video games?,"Posted on behalf of a friend of mine:  What are appropriate rules for how much time kids actually get to play video games (such as x-box 360, PlayStation 3, or on the PC)?   Apparently we are the ONLY parents who set limits. Everybody else's mom and dad lets them play as much as they want. Thats what my son says anyway. It is all he ever wants to do and we are about ready to get rid of it!!! He wants to know what he has to do to earn time to play it more. How should I handle this?  Is there a different set of rules for limits on ""social"" games, where he's actively playing with his friends (either in person or over the internet)?  My son is 12 years old. "
709,"Should a teether be given to an infant? If, yes, then at what age?",The kid is 5 months old. She keeps on chewing her fingers.  Should she be given a teether or should she be allowed to chew her fingers?    What are the possible disadvantages of giving an infant a teether and how should they be countered?

711,What language should we teach our child if our native tongue is different from the local language?,"My wife and I are from Indonesia and we live in an English speaking country. I'm not sure what language we should speak to or teach our baby boy (now 8 months).   Should we use English, so that when he's older he won't have problems with speaking to other people here or in school? Or should we use Indonesian, because it's the language my wife and I naturally use to talk to each other? Also, our extended family (including the grandparents) are mostly in Indonesia and many of them don't speak English, obviously he has to know Indonesian in order to communicate with them.  If we teach both languages (very likely), is there a best approach? Can we teach them simultaneously? Do we have to follow ""one parent, one language""? "
712,How do I get junk off a reluctant toddler's teeth?,"I have a two-year-old son who is extremely mild-mannered but hates having his teeth brushed. He cries, squirms, clamps his mouth shut, sticks out his tongue to block the toothbrush, etc. He's been getting better about this lately, but I still don't get a lot of time to brush his teeth before he starts making it very difficult.  My wife and I have noticed that he seems to have a significant amount of... something... built up on his bottom teeth around his gums. Even when he allows me to brush his teeth vigorously for a minute, I can't get the buildup off. What is this stuff? Is this dangerous to his oral health? How can I get it off?  At this point we still haven't brought him to a dentist. I can't imagine any possible way will allow a stranger to stick his hands in my son's mouth for any extended period of time to clean his teeth. "
713,"Drawing the line between abuse and ""roughhousing"" a teenager?","While this is not anyone in my family, I witnessed a father at a party treating his adolescent daughter like crap. The daughter's kind of introverted and didn't socialize too much, but the father would frequently approach her, say something offensive, and when she would retaliate, he'd punch her in her arm and sort of wrestle with her, but she didn't enjoy it and wasn't having fun, often screaming for her mother to get him to stop, but the mother wouldn't do anything either. He would stop after she screamed for her mother though, but the fact of the matter is that if he's annoying and agonizing her this much in PUBLIC, he could be treating her even worse in private.  He seems to see her as a ""teenage punk"" and treats her rough because I guess he is either a jerk or also doesn't like the way that she treats him, but maybe she treats him distantly because he is treating her like crap? I don't know, but one time she stayed sleeping longer than usual, and she was in a  bad/annoyed mood, and I saw him grab her and start clapping really loudly in her face, and when she throw an arm in his direction, he twisted her arm behind her back and put her in a headlock and everyone was laughing but her face suggested that she didn't find it funny at all.  Basically, he yanks her by her arm, punches her (not as hard as he can, but still does it with some force to anger her), and is always roughhousing her, even though she doesn't like any of it and resents it/him despite lots of people laughing like it's ""father-daughter-time"" or such, but I feel that she's being negatively impacted by this by being the target of his behavior towards her.  He often doesn't do it out of visible anger like one would think, but laughs/finds it amusing to do. I do not tell anyone because he's my relative's boyfriend's sister's husband, and I don't want to start my trouble with everyone, including family members of my own by saying anything negative.  Any input? I'm asking if anyone considers this as abusive or not. "

715,Are playpens (playards) physically or mentally damaging?,"I just cancelled my order for a playpen. The playpen that I ordered is 1.2 m x 2 m (we live in a city apartment). I read online that putting your baby in a playpen is akin to neglect. Babies placed in a playpen could grow up to be less intelligent than their peers because they are not free to explore their surroundings. Their curiosity and creativity will be dampened apparently. They could experience developmental delay because they can't access furniture to assist them to stand or walk. In addition, I read that it may cause depression because of the isolation. They could even experience language delay because of being left alone. What do you think?   Another thing I was thinking was, what if I sit in the playpen and play with her? Because one of the annoying things is having to contain her to stop her from hurting herself (we have tile floors so she gets hurt when she falls down). I was thinking I'd put a soft playmat inside the playpen.  "

717,What should I buy to prepare for being a new Foster Parent,"I wish I could have found a clear cut answer to this when my wife and I were looking to setup our home for passing the home study, and receiving our first foster child.  What should I buy/get to be prepared as a new foster parent?  It can be a bit tricky to get toys, cloths, rooms, furniture, and everything else you need for an unknown number of children, of an unknown gender, of an unknown age, and of an unknown race or culture. So what do you need to get, how much of it, and why should you get it?  "
718,How to spank in public without having everyone around you assume you're a child abuser?,"I believe corporal punishment to be a useful tool in the tool-shed when it comes to lovingly training my beautiful 3 year old boy.[1]  For the purposes of this question, I'll just say that my style of corporal punishment is to stop what my child is doing, calmly tell them why I'm going to spank them, and then give them a strike on the rear or hand that is just light enough to be uncomfortable, then reiterate my expectation and give them a hug and a kiss.[2]  This method has been phenomenally effective for my wife and me and we have no qualms with doing it at home or in front of friends/family that we know implement the same style of parenting. I do not, however, ever spank my kid in public or in front of strangers.[3] Not even a flick on the hand. I don't want to embarrass him, but even more-so I'm petrified of having someone call Child Protective Services (CPS) on me because they may believe that all physical punishment points to heinous abuse back at home. I'm not ignorant to the fact that spanking has (for whatever reason) gained a bad reputation in the last decade, but I'm also not ignorant to the fact that many (most?) parents spank their kids too.  I live in a state that allows physical punishment so legally I should have no concerns, but I still find myself stuck when my child disobeys in public and I feel forced to do nothing about it until we get home (which by then it would be too late for them to associate their bad behavior with the spanking anyway). Is there a way to execute corporal punishment in public without triggering unknowing and irrational fears in strangers?    [1] This is not an invitation to debate as to whether or not you agree with spanking. This is asking for a best-practice guide on spanking in public. I started my question with ""I believe corporal punishment to be a useful tool..."" to set the precedent for any expected answers (unlike this question) :)  [2] Note that he initiates 90% of these hugs, and I never force affection on him. The whole ""spank then hug"" thing was not a planned out disciplining strategy. It just sort of happened once and now it's routine. He expects it and I think it helps him to know that the issue is over and done and daddy isn't mad anymore.  [3] When I say ""in public"" I don't mean I hop on a table and shout ""TIME FOR YUR SPANKIN!!1"" and then whoop on him. I would still be as subtle and discreet as possible. "
719,Giving a baby a bottle while in a car seat of a moving vehicle...should this be avoided?,"My wife and I took a roadtrip and thought that we were totally prepared. We brought bottles of pumped milk (stored in a cooler). We also brought a thermos of hot/warm water so that we can warm up the milk.  We figured that when our baby got hungry, we can give her a bottle. I did the driving, while my wife tended to the baby in the back.  About 30 minutes into the trip we heard the cry of hunger. We gave her a couple of ounces of milk after we warmed it up. All seem to be fine, until she got fussy and finally she had a big spit up.  We think that basically we couldn't burp her in the car so that's why she got fussy and eventually spit up.  Is there a better way to handle this in the future? I guess the proper thing to do would be to pull over at a rest stop, feed &amp; burp the baby and then resume our trip.  Is feeding a baby in a moving vehicle bad practice? "
720,Dealing with the psychological consequences of punishment in parenting,"I'm 18 yo boy living pretty much an amazing life. Yet, I've been dealing with feeling of annoyance(sometimes anger but not as rough as the word sounds) every time(almost) I hear people talking very quitely or in a desperate way or unenthusiastically or unenergetically and so on. This has lead me to become an amazing personality in terms of productivity, achievements, attraction of people into my life or whatever you can think of related to progress. Anyway, there are some drawbacks I've noticed.  The way I was raised wasn't the kind that any child would like. Note that if you say I need to forgive my parents, do not worry I've already done this. The thing is that some memories have plunged so deep into my brain that somehwere along the line, the reactions I get from them have become just habits. Additional info.  Apparently this isn't one of the best ways to raise a child. Despite all the positives I get from being annoyed from negative people, unenthusiastic and so on I'd like to stop getting agnry at these things. Stop paying attention to them. I'm really, really trying hard but at times it's just the stupid habit I've developed. Sometimes I talk with friends, very close ones and if I hear similar sounds to the mentioned above I get angry and this way I hurt them(not physycally but by stopping being responsive(not talking or answering with few words) and taking my time to calm down). So, please community give me all the advices you can that might help me deal with this. EDIT: How can I start to relate all these annoying sounds of the talks with something that would make me feel if not good at least nothing? How can I stop recalling all these memories from my childhood(note when I hear smb talking it's just happening on a subconscious level, I don't visualize anything in front of me or smth, it just happens under my lowest layers of my thought)?  P.S. And parents... please think before you punish your kid! With me things aren't that serious but if I didn't find the strength to deal with this, I'd have become very destructive by now. I'd say you can always find a way to make your child do smth by treats and making him/her interested in the certain activity. Never tend to punish them! Never shout at them, trust me although they might not show it, it kind of stays deep down burried in their minds.  Update1: Here is why I don't go to therapists for now. The cons are many more, just these are some of the few that help you get the idea. "
721,Short naps and frequent night wakings,"I have a 4.5 month little boy. He has never been a great sleeper. He has never slept longer than an 4.5 hour stretch his whole life. He is able to fall asleep on his own most of the time, especially at bedtime. We put him down awake in his crib and he usually talks to himself for a little bit and then falls asleep. We have also watched him on the video monitor and he wakes several times during the night and puts himself back to sleep. He generally sleeps from 6:30pm to 6:30am (5+ night wakings). Here are my problems:   After his first 4 hour stretch at night, he wakes up every 2 hours to eat. When it becomes closer to 4am, he starts waking up every hour. I have tried just soothing him through these wakings, but he won't go back to sleep unless I nurse him. I think he is actually hungry, and not just comfort nursing. How do I get him to sleep longer stretches? Even 3 hour stretches would be great. During the day he takes multiple cat naps (3-4). Most of the time he wakes up after 25-30 minutes with an occasional 45 minute nap. He is tired after 1-1.5 hours of waketime. I have tried keeping him up longer to see if he would be tired enough to sleep longer, and he still takes a 25 minute nap, and then is overtired because I kept him up so long. What should his nap schedule be like at this age? How can I help him consolidate his naps?   Thanks so much for helping this tired first time momma out! "
722,How do I get my 17-year-old under control when I raise him alone and his behavior is unacceptable?,"My husband passed away 9 years ago. My 17-year-old son is currently in high school. I also have a 25-year-old daughter, who doesn't live with us but visits us over the weekend. I'm the one who is solely in charge of taking care of my son. He has failed a lot of courses.   Sometimes he doesn't respect me. He screams so loud and I get scared, and the last time he hit me with a pillow. I try to talk with him but He doesn't. Sometimes we scream at each other too, but nothing more. I don't punish him because he ignores me as well as any punishment I may try.  He doesn't want to get a job. He only wants to go to music school (music school is free and the bus is the only thing that he pays, with my money of course). He doesn't seem to care about regular school. In music school he had his first girlfriend, now the girl is his ex but they still are in touch.  What should I do now? What can I try? "
723,Would enrolling a 5-year-old in pre-school be okay or slow down his development?,"I have a 5-year-old and we're in the USA. He had been to preschool when he was 3.5 years old for 1.5 years.   Now at 5 years 4 months, he is able to read the sentences, write words, do almost 2nd grade math. He loves doing math, additions, subtraction, etc., and he does it fast. Now reading the books.  Because of the job, we moved to a different place and had a travel. Now after the dust settled, we wanted to put him in Kindergarten or 1st grade. But since it's almost the end of the academic year, no school is willing to enroll him. There is one school that is okay to enroll him now, but it's for pre-schooling. As we have no other option, we are planning to enroll him there, instead of keeping him home.  However, we are very concerned that he might not learn anything new and or not enjoy his schooling, as they will be teaching ABCs and 123s, and will be sitting with kids younger than his age. He always likes to go to school.   Is it okay or might it back-fire? Or better to wait and put him in proper class? Would his development slow down? "
724,What's the best way to deal with illogical reasoning that can't be explained to a child?,Lets say you have an argument with your kid.  And the kid needs to understand something very important; lets say almost on the level of importance of life and death.  And the kid listens to your explanation and the light bulb still doesn't go on; and the kid still continues to do the wrong thing.  What do then?  Is there anything you can do? 
725,Son chooses what my daughter chose then gets upset he doesn't get it,"We have a nearly 5 year old boy and a 2 year old girl. Our son has gotten in the habit of, when we ask them both to choose something, waiting for his sister to choose then immediately choosing the same. For instance: Me: ""Which plate do you want?"" Kids: ""Ummmm...."" Daughter: ""Green"" Son: ""I want green!!""  Usually we give our daughter her choice and explain to him that he can't just wait and pick what she wants, but I can see this rubbing him the wrong way because ""she always gets what she wants""  Any other suggestions on how to handle these issues?

726,"If a parent goes vegan, should the small kids, also?","If a parent decides, for humanitarian reasons, to go vegan, is it reasonable to ask 4, 6, and 8 yo kids (generally upbeat and compliant) to follow suit, at home and away?  In any case, how well do kids take that type of request?  If it works for a short time (say a month) is it likely to work longer term?  Does anyone have experience with this?  Update: It is now a few months and all is not well.  The young kids cry when they are at a birthday party and cannot eat the cake.  Sigh. "
727,"When is corporal punishment abuse, really?","My friend (who believes in corporal punishment delivered lovingly[1]) has cancelled two of her pediatrician appointments now because one or another of her (4) children have had bruises on their bottoms. I also know that some kids bruise more easily than others. Her pediatrician (who was also ours) does not object to corporal punishment in certain circumstances.  I know of, and witness, her deep love for her kids. She just really believes in corporal punishment. I've never seen her deliver it (it's always done in private), nor have I ever seen her really out of control with her kids, though some of the stuff she comes out with is pretty wild (she told her oldest, knowing he wasn't trying his hardest in an AP math course, ""I don't care how hard you try. What matters is that you get an A."" He got an A the next semester.) The kids don't seem to be afraid of their parents (indeed, the opposite is true; their relationship seems very positive); they seem to respect their kid's feelings (while at times differing with them, and it is clear that they believe in instilling their values - and only their values - in their kids), and the kids are very (but not robotically) polite with adults. Honestly, they are lively, intelligent, seemingly happy kids who get along beautifully. They are also all high-achievers (each of her kids are proficient in piano and are studying a second instrument of their choice.)  I have really mixed feelings about the fact that she's actually had to reschedule appointments to hide the fact that she does use corporal punishment. I have no mixed feelings about what the Pearls espouse; I detest it. Yet it seems to work in this case, and no, her kids are not frightened automatons.  I know what seems abusive to me, and that involves more not recognizing and respecting the rights of people to feel and believe the way they do (obviously barring mental illness where delusions are present.) Refusing to recognize boundaries, and that kind of thing.  Are there any studies that don't support the idea that all corporal punishment is abusive? Or that, at any event, not everyone suffers serious consequences from it?  I've read some of the previous posts on corporal punishment. I'm honestly kind of looking for an intelligent discussion of the subject that avoids knee-jerk responses, so to speak.  If this should be closed as a dupe, I can live with that quite well.  I have a hard time thinking this isn't abuse. If her kids argue too much, she puts hot pepper sauce on their tongues. They do use time-outs as well, and other measures - like taking away privileges. But her kids seem so well behaved. I've certainly not witnessed any paddle-worthy behavior.  As espoused by Michael and Debi Pearl "
728,Options to have a child but not giving birth,"My wife and I want to have a child, but my wife does not want to bear a baby.  We know we can adopt one from an orphanage. But what about child transferring from another family? Or bearing from another woman? Or any other options?  We are totally okay with the child not being completely biologically related to us.  If it depends on the country, we are in Australia. "
729,My parents got divorced and want financial information from me,"I live on my own and am relatively financially stable. A few years ago my parents got divorced. Things didn't go smoothly between them and they went to court a number of times.  I never fully understood the details but my dad always said that the courts had ordered both him and my mom to give me money because I am young or was still in school or something like that. He claims that my mom didn't give me the money owed, and that he wants 4 years worth of financial records from me. My dad had given a series of post dated checks and made it clear this was his contribution. My mom seemed to haphazardly give me money. It was very confusing as I was covered by both of my parents extended medical and sometimes my mom would include these payments with the reimbursement from medical. Also she would sometimes direct transfer money into my bank account so I didn't know it was coming from her. For the record it wouldn't be unusual for my mom not to be fully honest and for my dad to be bad at explaining things.  I'm not sure what to do. My dad basically wants income statements from the past 4 years, which I don't really have on hand. I guess a question I could ask him is if needs everything or would it help if I only had the info for some of my jobs and could guess the rest? (over the past 4 years I have worked at several different places)  How much work, if any should I put into this? Should I start trying to call up past employers and ask to speak to the pay roll department? Should I ignore my dad or say I'm not interested? I don't even know what's fair/moral. I'm an adult now so I guest the caned response is ""you're on you're own"" but I did find my parents seldom helped me (for example everyone beneath 30 I know had some help from their parents paying for school. Point is it's common in my area to get financial assistance from parents after 18).  My mom once helped me pay rent and latter said it was a gift and I didn't need to pay her back. So there's that.  "
730,What are healthy ways to help my 7-year-old in developing a thicker skin?,"I have an amazing 7-year-old daughter who is unbelievably empathetic.  Which, allows her to be a good friend, wonderful daughter and just a loving soul all around.  However, her emotions can also be very intense and along with the empathy a high level of sensitivity.  Really she isn't unlike me to be honest.    To demonstrate her sympathy level, I'll reference reading The Hobbit together.  As a family we read the story in the last few months.  When Gollum loses his ring, Tolkien does a good job of making Gollum pathetic and sad and the reader is meant to feel for him a little, but he is also the bad guy.  My daughter burst into tears.  Why can't Golum and Bilbo both have the magic ring mom?  I know Golum is creepy but that doesn't mean he should have to be so sad!  A few minutes later she had taken a deep breath and was talking about how ""every good story has to have its story bumps, I know and I know it isn't real, but it is still so sad.""  I have always felt that just as every rose has its thorn and every cowboy sings a sad, sad song, (sorry, song reference - had to do it)  but seriously, every gift brings its curse.  Where the challenge lies for my little one, is helping her keep it all in balance.  She is an excellent reader, (A few months ago, she was tested again and has a 12th grade vocabulary, 8th grade comprehension, and spells like the second grade kid she is).  So, choosing literature for her school lessons is a challenge because she isn't emotionally ready for most of the stuff written at a level that would challenge her.    She gets on really well with other kids of all ages including her own, but becomes sincerely hurt at the slightest hint another child doesn't like her.  To make matters worse, this last summer, three of my daughter's best friends all moved away and for completely separate reasons we had already changed school programs before we knew this was going to happen (she is partially home-schooled, but we have a coop and she goes to regular classes once/week as well).  She is needing to make an entirely new batch of friends at school, her best friend (and only girl her age) in Taekwondo classes is one of the three that moved, and she was moved into a higher belt class as well, and the theater (another social out-let for her) is not currently doing any plays that have parts available for her age.  She still has one or two great friends from the former school program we have set play dates with and she is doing well with meeting and making new friends at the new school too, but every little slight by any of the kids at the school sends her to tears (sometimes I think they are only perceived slights too).  I think the loss of her friends is making her even more sensitive than she already was.  How do I help her develp that thicker skin and just appreciate the friends she has made, move on and let it go? "
731,"How can I handle a situation with a faulty, cruel teacher that does not like me and takes it out on my child?","Let me start by offering to explain my situation. It is a lot more challenging to handle than the title presents, so I should definitely elaborate, then I'll ask my question.   My child is in 1st grade, has always been a well-behaved student and works hard with me on his work. However, he has a speech issue that gives him trouble with articulation and it has slightly slowed his progress with learning to read, but with my help, I am keeping him at a satisfactory level.  His teacher shows clear signs of not liking me, and I would not care if it were not for the fact that she for some reason takes it out on my child. She does not allow him to play with other kids, misleads him in ways which cause him to come home to me crying and in distress. Rather than bringing up questions with me, she asks him, stating it in such a way that makes him think she does not like him or that he has done something wrong (ie. usually pertaining to an absence, tardy, or permission form of some sort). She forces my child to participate in activities that require a permission form that I did not approve.   His teacher also neglects to teach him properly. She does not work independently with him on things that she'll work with other students on or answer his questions. She will skip over him instead. I can correct him and teach him a concept at home properly, he will go to school, and have unlearned the entire thing, or be confused. In addition, his handwriting on in-school assignments is messy and rushed, he often tells me the teacher tells him he has to hurry or that other students are bothering him while his handwriting at home is very very neat and legible.   He (my child) has lost interest and confidence even though he loves school, and has told me he would would rather not go to school and learn at home.  At the beginning of the year, things were fine and his work and grades were good but the teacher has been excessively cruel and degrading towards him. She is taking extreme amounts of points off on simple classwork assignments, way more than necessary, just to fail him. I have a child in AP classes in high school whose teachers do not take 13 points off per question no matter how hard the assignment.  If you wonder where this sudden change in behavior from his teacher might stem from, I believe it is all related to his speech issues. In this district, in order to get a speech class for your child, your child must be registered within the Special Education program. I have had him in the Special Education program before, but they did not actually take him to speech and he did not receive assistance at all, so I took him out. But I believe her harsh grading, and lack of help for my child in class, as well as the cruel behavior might be to push me into putting him into Special Education because the district receives additional funding PER CHILD in Special Education. I sincerely hope this is not the situation, but I do believe it is possible.   I apologize in advance for all this writing but I am at a loss for what to do. Conferences with the teacher are difficult, she will not allow me for a ""walk-in conference,"" becomes irate over the phone, and attempts to talk over me and become irate. Going to the principal has not proved successful, and I'm not sure about approaching the district just yet.   My questions are:   Is there ANY alternative for schooling for my child for the remaining 2-3 months of school? How should I deal with this situation, in general? Should I try again with the principal, go to the district or should I seek higher (I am in the United States)?  How can I help my child? He has no friends in school, and is very upset because of the conditions he must deal with in school.    Thank you for reading and any advice you can provide. "
732,How to continue with removing breastfeeding at night,"Our daughter is just two and a bit. My wife still breastfeeds a lot. Our nights aren't particularly great.   Our arrangement was that usually I sleep in one room and my wife and daughter in the other so that I can get up early after a good night's sleep to do the morning chores and take our daughter to nursery while my wife catches up on sleep.  I take night duty, too. Both when my wife is here and, especially, when she is away on work. My experience is that the first two nights are difficult with the daughter waking up often, sometimes having one crying fit for about 20 minutes asking for mother, and after that she sleeps through from night 3 on. Once my wife is back on duty our daughter wakes 2 (rarely) to 10 (often) times a night to »drink« (it really is more like a cigarette butt hanging from her lips now when she breastfeeds).  Two nights ago we explained that in order to sleep through the night, which was desirable for everyone, she would have to learn to go back to sleep without the breast. We did an enactment with her and she did understand that her mother would hold her tight and cuddle if she woke up, but that the night needed to be over before she could drink again.  The first night went ok, she went back to sleep without breastfeeding once. When she woke up a second time, she cried and yelled until my wife gave in.  The second night she went back to sleep without breastfeeding a few times, but all before midnight. After midnight she woke and cried angrily for over an hour before my wife relented.   Now we are unsure how to continue.   Letting her cry for so long does not feel right, but it may be necessary. Is it? Should I take the next night? It seems that our daughter is afraid of losing her mother/her mother's love, so we are unsure whether this would be the right kind of signal Should we regard this as a failed attempt and next time have me start with 4 to 7 nights in a row before my wife tries? Should we try to end co-sleeping first?   We need to get this through soon because the way the nights work at the moment is not sustainable for us (mostly for my wife).   On a different forum (German language) we found a question by someone in a similar situation, but the angry crying fits had already continued for 4 weeks. This would be even less sustainable for us. This question and this as well as that address a similar matter but deal with much younger children.  UPDATE: She slept with me ever since and her sleeping pattern is much better. She wakes twice a night at most, often only once and for a few times not at all. She uses her own bed now and it helps. When she wakes up, she still wants to be with me, but that is ok for now. The biggest progress I think is that on several occasions she managed going back to sleep on her own with me not being there (we both woke, I said I needed a drink of water and asked if it was ok for her to wait and when I came back she was sound asleep again).   Our idea now is to slowly phase in mother nights, first one, then two etc.   "
733,"Where can I find solid, responsible advice for parenting in a marijuana legal community?","I'm so confused with all of the conversation and battling between the industry and the non-industry advocates.    Is there one good location to get information on how to teach my children to socially, emotionally and physically manage the effects of marijuana?      Thank you for your feedback and requests for clarity. More specifically I am questioning:  How do I handle the situation that my son's friends' parents use edibles, should I worry about my son's safety?  My children's ages are 8, 10, and 12. What should I tell them about the use of marijuana? I drink wine most every night, but I would never want someone to judge me as a result of that use. I also wouldn't drive after drinking under any circumstances.  I would like to find a community of parents who can start a ""chat room"" or ongoing dialogue related to real life scenarios that play out in different parts of our lives -- in the schools, in hospitals, in legal cases, in the community in general.

734,Does too much or too little exposure to infection affect long-term immune health?,"Every time our children spend time with a group of other kids, there's at least one with the sniffles or worse. It's tempting to shield them from such sources of infection, but (leaving aside the non-medical downsides of isolation) presumably they'd grow up with weak immune systems if they didn't have this early exposure.  Does frequent exposure to sick kids, such as in daycare or public school, have a negative impact on a child's later immune health? Positive? What about very minimal exposure? Is there a happy medium to which we should strive?  I'm specifically interested in exposure to other children, not so much to environmental sources (i.e., eating dirt).  Here's an article saying that yes, some exposure to infection is probably helpful: [website]Another article, suggesting that there is such an effect but perhaps only for babies and toddlers: www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/12/06/daycare.kids/ Also, this simply claims that children will be more resistant in elementary school if they're exposed in daycare; I'm more interested in the kids' eventual health as adults.

735,5 month old won't fall asleep because she always turns herself onto her stomach,"This question is related to How do dealing with infant flipping over during sleep training?, but not exactly the same.  Our 5 month old daughter flips onto her stomach constantly. When you put her down on the play blanket, she immediately flips onto her stomach AND props herself up with her arms. This is okay during awake times when she can play with toys, etc.  This becomes an issue when we try to put her down in her crib. She loves to flip over onto her stomach and pushing up with her arms. So, when she's in the crib, she's not even resting her head to try to sleep. (This is the part that differs from the above question). So, we can't put her down, unless she's already drowsy.  When we co-sleep with her at night (bring her into bed in the middle of the night when my wife nurses and when she's done, she stays with us) she sleeps between my wife and I. Her head level with our pillows. I would put her close to my stiff foam pillow so that it acts as a barrier for her so that she can't flip. :)  Is the only way to put a physical object next to her to block her from flipping? Even when she is partially swaddled (i.e. only legs are swaddled) she still can flip. She bring her legs up and swings to the right!  CLARIFICATION  The issue is not that she is sleeping on her stomach, it's that she is propping herself up when she's on her stomach and can't put herself to sleep in that position. When we put her on her back, she returns to the propped up stomach position. "
736,"As a teenager, how do I communicate with my mom about her yelling?","I am 17. I have been learning to drive for about a year and a half now. I must have a permit if I want to drive, unless it has been a year or unless I'm 18. After that time I can get a license, but we are waiting on that because it is cheaper after I'm 18. This means I can only drive if I have someone 21 or older in the passenger seat, and no one unrelated in the back seats.   I'm adequate, except for parking and backing up. When I drive with my dad he gives me pointers and advice, which I appreciate. When I am driving with my mom and dad, my dad sits in the front seat and gives me pointers as usual. My mom is nearly silent in the backseat. When I drive with my mom she yells at me when I do not follow her instruction or know things already.  Every chance there is for my mom and I to go somewhere together (open a bank account for me, go to school) she insists I drive, which is fine. The problem is she will yell when I go too slow, or turn too sharply, or accidentally drive through an empty turn lane (if it wasn't empty I would have crashed the car). If we are in a parking lot she will give me directions on how to turn around, and if I decide to turn around a different way she yells.  My mom will give me a direction, like ""turn right here"" and I will decide I can't slow down fast enough, so I turn right at the next intersection, and she gets very angry. We live at the end of a dead-end road, and people constantly park their cars right behind our drive way, making it difficult to get out. When I try to get out, slowly, my mom will yell at me every time I start moving.  I have tried telling her multiple times that yelling doesn't help, and that telling me over and over how to do something will not make me better at it.  I have told her many times I will not tolerate her yelling. Whenever we are driving in a parking lot or a neighborhood and she starts yelling at me I stop the car and get out. This is never effective because she is stubborn and I get impatient. At home I refuse to drive but to no avail.  How do I explain that I can't focus on learning when she's yelling? How do I explain knowing how to drive and actually having the experience driving are different? "
737,"Kids (ages 4 and 6) only listen when raising my voice, tried everything, what am I doing wrong?","I hate to raise my voice, but there are certain situations where no matter how or what I say, my kids won't listen. I'm not talking about hearing what I say and deciding not to do it, they simply either willingly or non willingly ignore my voice as if I was talking to a wall. (boy almost 6, girl almost 4)  I was diagnosed with ADD, and I can relate when people tell me - you don't hear me? I was talking to you and you didn't hear a word I was saying (I was doing something in hyper focus, and literally didn't hear a word)  Is that what happens here with my kids too?  Here are a few situation where I can say something a million times in pleasant tones and will get complete ignoring from their side    They are in the bath playing, I'm asking them to get out / wash their head etc. This is the worst - the TV is on. Can't get ANYTHING out of them, it's like there are in a different universe. I can tell them that Santa is here and brought them all their wishlist and they will not even turn their eyes. They literally don't hear anything when the TV is on.  My son is drawing something / playing the Legos    etc...  Now, I know they say ""don't yell, don't shout, they won't listen, it just making it worse, don't be emotional and take out your frustration with life on the kids""   But I'm not doing it emotionally, it's done practically and without anger, without any frustration, just because the kids simply don't respond otherwise in these situation.   Is this ADD in play? I was like this as kid (And still sometimes, people can call me and I simply don't hear it if I'm hyper focused)  Or is this just normal kids behavior?   The doctor said that the kids are just fine, and they are doing very well in pre-K and kindergarten, (one teacher said something about my son regarding focus, but new school - new teacher - no problem, just at home)  So here is my question. If the only way I can get my kids to listen is either raise my voice, or do the ""one, two, three"" count (works every time) is that still wrong? I feel really bad with myself but otherwise my life will be just talking to myself, very nicely and respectfully and kids who don't take bath's / stay in it till midnight, eat only candy and never go to bed.   What should I do? I love my kids, I tell them that all the time, I hug them, I read them stories, I spend time with them and they show me a lot of love back. But there are times where the only way to get things around here is to just raise my voice. Not even yell, it's just increasing the volume so they will turn their heads to listen, not even the case of whether they want to do it or not, it's the mere event of them getting my words into their awareness, after that getting them to ""listen"" is even less hard to get them to just ""hear me"".  How do I get them to listen without raising my voice? Should I start wearing funny customs just to get their attention? should I use a funny voice? Should I use a clowns horn / stuffed animal? I'm open to ideas, but nothing worked until now...   (p.s. when shouting at them, they don't get scared or insulted or anything, they don't cry or stop running around the house at 9pm, or jumping on the bed, they just go like ""oh, dad, you were talking? sorry, what did you say? we were busy doing something much more important like jumping like monkeys on the bed while your were whispering something about going to sleep"" )  Is there a solution? "
738,"What else can I teach a 2.5 yo child related to reading, pattern recognition, and memory?","Our daughter is 2 years and 5 months old and for some time already she knows all the letters (i.e. both reciting and recognising letter by letter in written words), numbers to 10, common shapes, and colours. However she's not talking in full sentences yet. Considering when children usually getting interested in written letters, this seems to be pretty good.  If she has an ability in this and likes it, what else can I teach her? Of course I was thinking about reading, but teaching reading in English is quite different to our native language, so I'm not sure about phonics reading vs sight word reading and all that stuff. I'd like to read some scientific materials on how children learn to read (you know not usual recommendations like blah blah don't worry, all children are different). Or maybe not reading at all? What are activities we can try to help encourage her memory and pattern recognition skills?  This is not a question about such skills vs social skills, physical skills and so on. So please don't recommend that it is better to learn to play with other kids - that's just a separate question. "

740,Will a 12-18 month old understand a baby is on the way?,"My first son is 12 months old and I'm expecting another child who will be born when my son is 18 months old.  My son is fairly verbal for his age.  He understands phrases like, ""Put the ball in the box,"" or ""Bring Mommy the book.""  He also says about 8 words. I'm sure that once we bring the baby home, he will understand that there is a new person around, but is it likely that he will understand before?  Does it do any good to talk about having a new baby or mommy having a baby in her tummy?  Would bringing him to an ultrasound make any sense at this point? "
741,Completing the homework - how much is this in parents' responsibility and up to which age?,"We have a 10-year-old child who is generally not interested in doing homework. He prefers to play games and watch TV. He's bored by homework which requires some patience and concentration, like learning vocabulary. Teachers require parents to make children complete the homework. My attitude is learning can't be forced, or forced learning is something else but not learning.  If the child resists to complete the homework, how much and up to which age is it the parents' responsibility to try to get him/her to do that? When do you give up? I mean besides a pure opinion, is there kind of strategy to build an attitude for that? "
742,How and when to disclose to children a parent's suicide?,"My children's father committed suicide 10 years ago, when they were aged 9, 3 and 1.  At the time of his death I did not want them to know how he died, but it became such public knowledge I was forced to disclose this to my oldest child, as I did not want him to find out at school.  Growing up, I had a friend whose father had died and it wasn't until he turned 18 that his mother disclosed to him that his father had committed suicide. This always stuck with me, as he was shocked, but also at a better age to deal with the concept.  Prior to their father's death, my children did not know of the concept of suicide. Even though they had a paternal aunt who had suicided before they were born and later a maternal uncle's death was deemed suicide (this was the year following their father's death).  So suicide is a huge issue in our family.  Is there any research into disclosing the cause of death of a parent when it is suicide?  What are the pros and cons with early disclosure or waiting until children are older?  I am not interested in anecdotal evidence or opinion, but expertise and any research on this subject.    I asked this question here:  How to help children cope with a parent&#39;s suicide? "
743,Is it recommended to use warm water for bathing my baby?,"I don't know whether this is a good habit or not for my baby. But my wife is always taking our baby a bath using warm water.So when the time we would to take our baby to swim in the pool, our baby were shocked and crying. We thought that this is happened because the water in the pool is cold. Is there any recommendations that we have to use warm water for bathing a baby? If yes, when is exactly the right time to use normal temperature water for bathing a baby? For your information, our baby is 6 months old right now. "
744,How to keep a baby cool in summer without air conditioning?,"I have concerns regarding our baby (less than 1 yr) sleeping in an air conditioned room. I live in Mumbai. Its an area with extremely high humidity and very hot temperatures. We all sleep in an air conditioned room. But we are afraid that the baby will be accustomed to sleeping in A.C. rooms only, and that this might interfere with her sleeping in areas that aren't air conditioned.   If we go out to some relative's place, will she be able to sleep in a non A.C. room? Is there any way to keep the baby cool without A.C.? "
745,Do toddlers need every size of shoe?,"When we find shoes we like on a big discount, is it a good idea to buy a few sizes up at a time (like sizes 7, 8, and 9 all at once)? Or is there enough overlap in sizing that our toddler might move directly from size 7 to size 9, skipping over size 8 as her feet grow? "
746,Raising polyglot children through television - a reliable method?,"Doing some research on strategies for raising polyglot children, I stepped on this paper (not peer-reviewed) on academia.edu. Also available here.  It suggests that through television it is possible to teach children a language not spoken at home or in the every-day environment:     After just one year of age, “E”, began to communicate with her father in Venetian and in Armenian language with his mother. The evening after supper, every single day, “E” has to see a cartoon or a movie for kids in FRENCH language for about an hour. This block of french language cartoons consisted of about 2/3 weeks alternated by another block of 2/3 weeks of cartoons or movies in RUSSIAN language.    I have no experience in raising polyglot children but it seems to me that they can get to understand a new language only in an interactive way (mostly by speaking it). This that cannot be done with television. So I am a bit skeptic.  Do anyone ever heard of similar approaches? Do you think that they're reliable? "
747,How do I get a young toddler to walk holding my hand?,"Baby boy is just 12 months, but walks really well and prefers to walk.  When we are at the grocery store or somewhere we need to go from Point A to Point B, sometimes he doesn't want to go where I want to go.  If I try to lead him by the hand, he throws himself to the ground.  If I try to carry him, he screams and throws a fit.  I usually either let him wander around a bit, if the situation permits, or carry him screaming through the store ignoring his fit until he stops.  Since I can't usually let him lead the way, any advice on how to get him to walk happily by my side?  Sometimes letting him push the cart in the store works for a while.  Is this expecting too much from a 12 month old? "
748,Is my child autistic?,"My son speaks 8 languages and is learning 5 more. He is not even yet able to interact socially with strangers and he switches languages whenever he feels uncomfortable, which is often. He also inappropriately touches his female classmates and sometimes starts laughing for seemingly no reason. He's still not learned to go to the bathroom at night, he wets his bed instead and prefers to eat with his hands...   We haven't yet taken him to doctors because it's a scary thought that if he's diagnosed with autism, how will it affect everything? His future? Our life? "
749,Changing a child's name,"Our son Thomas was born about 6 months ago.  Now, we're feeling like he doesn't really look right for his name, and we're thinking of getting it officially changed to Charles instead.  We're also not sure we like that Thomas means ""twin"", as he isn't a twin.  So what do you think?  Should we change his name, or is it too late for that?  And please, let us know why you answer the way you do. "
750,4.5 yr old not making friends,"A brief background. The kid in question is a bit naturally reserved. She has few friends. Her best friend moved to a different country recently. She now has one friend with whom she plays in park. And plays with no one else. Now things have come to such a pass that she sits in park and keeps waiting till her friend comes. Surrounded by kids who are playing. No matter how much parents coax, she does not play with anyone else.   It is becoming a bit of a bother since many times the friend does not turn up. Parents have not given up. They want to keep her around kids so that her social skills improve. But standing around with the kid sitting and doing nothing sometimes gets on the their nerves.  How to get the kid out of this rut? When she will be comfortable making new friends? "
751,What to do when we are concerned about the sexualisation of our 20-month-old son?,"My baby is 20 months old.  He cannot talk that well, mostly only saying a few words clearly or baby speak.   He goes to nursery twice a week, for the rest of the time he is at home with his mother.    We had some mild concern about him trying to kiss us on the lips - open mouthed, we don't do this with him, we kiss him on the head, or peck him on the check.  We mentioned this to his nursery caregiver, she advised it was pretty normal and I wasn't too concerned.  I'm providing this information for context.  Today, my wife called as we had a weird incident at home, he was laying in our bed in front of her, and he reached for her hand.  She thought initially that he just wanted a cuddle, but he pulled her hand towards his crotch.  She thought maybe he wanted to go to the toilet (we really want him to start vocalising about toilet needs more so we can start toilet training and getting him to use a potty) but instead he wanted her to rub him on the crotch (through his nappy) - she pulled away and said it was inappropriate but he pulled her hand back, she realised as well while hes doing this that he had a baby erection.   We are used to when changing him for him to grab himself down there a bit (but not excessively) which I always viewed as self exploration but this seemed different to her and has caused us both concern.  We know that we have no real evidence of anything, if we suggested anything to the nursery they would not admit anything and would probably be more concerned about covering themselves.  It's so incredibly frustrating when a child is not at a verbal stage to be able to tell you anything themselves and am at bit of a loss as to how to proceed.  I know babies/young children can play with themselves out of boredom or exploration - but my wife feels someone must have taught him this. We could take him out of nursery and try somewhere else, but it's concerning and we have no evidence/proof of anything bad, just a potential suspicion.  Is this behavior normal? What should we/can we do? Has anyone had to deal with a situation like this? "
752,"Choosing same name as a friend, how to ask or annonce?","So there's a name that we liked for our baby but I have a childhood distant friend having the same name.  Would she (yeah its a she) be offended if we name our baby after her? How do I approach or announce it to her or considering that she is distant but in my facebook, should i ask her anything at all?  Edited to add: The name is not in her honour since we are not acquaintances but I quite like her name which is pretty uncommon. "
753,Why is it so hard teaching your own children and how to improve the process?,"I have two children, 6 and 9 years old. I find it very hard to teach them skills or school subjects and I wonder if there are any tricks or methods to it? It seems my children are much more eager to learn if it's an outsider teaching them.  When I or my wife try to teach them skills we are actually good at (I'm a ski instructor, my wife has many years of music school behind her) it invariably ends in the child giving up way too easily. When they have to learn something, like a new song for a performance, they work hard at the music school and they usually give their best at the actual performance, yet at home when we help it often ends up with arguments, sometimes bitter ones.   This dynamic is more pronounced with the older son, but is visible in both children to some extent. Now it's possible me and my wife are just bad teachers, but many of my friends say they noticed the same thing with their children.   I've started thinking that maybe it's hard for them to accept criticism and straight talk from somebody who is otherwise usually their emotional rock, quick to dismiss ""unpleasant"" things or turn them into a joke - which doesn't work when you have to understand a theorem, master a technique or learn the notes by heart.  Does anybody notice the same thing with their children? And is there a way to make this easier?  "
754,What can be done to encourage grandparents to be equitable between siblings?,"The short question is this. How can we as parents encourage our parents to be more equitable in their treatment of their grandchildren?  As background here is my situation. When my wife and I got married, we had made the decision that we weren't going to have children. This was devastating to my mother who really (read really really really) wanted to have grandchildren. Independent of her wished, a few years later we decided to try and our first son came along who is now 7. Grandma immediately bonded with him, showering him with love and attention (and stuff). Four years later our second boy came along (now 2 1/2 y.o.) and while grandma loves him, she is still very bonded to our oldest.  Up until now, it hasn't been a big deal because the baby hasn't had the mental maturity to understand the differences in their relationships but his behavior of late has indicated that he is starting to notice something... or at least wanting more.  An example would be something like recently we had made arrangements for grandma to spend the afternoon/evening with the toddler and then when they came back she was going to take the older one home for a sleep over. On the day of, she decided that she would take both boys for the afternoon and then keep the oldest one for sleep over. Ostensibly she says it's to give my wife and I some time alone, but my observation is that she often includes the older one in the time planned with the younger, but rarely (if ever I can think) alters plans with the older one to include the younger.  So what can I do to encourage her to spend time and develop a relationship with my younger son?  Should I point out what I observe or how I interpret her interactions?   Am I making too much out of nothing? Do I need to get over it? "
755,Fear developing in three year old,"I have a three and a half year old boy. We have been going to this theme park for years, he has gone on all of the rides which are age appropriate since a little more than one without any sign of fear. Today he has been completely different. He won't do anything, he breaks down into uncontrollable screaming when we get close. He won't even walk by the adult rides, he says they are ""too scary"". He doesn't want to watch the Sesame Street characters. Is this the normal way fear develops in children, or is it possibly a sensory issue? (There were children yelling excitedly, maybe too much stimulation?)  And, what should I do or not do?  Edit  We were able to distract him in line by keeping him busy, and he went on some of the ride he was on last year. Afterwards we asked him if they were scary and he said ""no"". We didn't push the issue with the rides he has never been on before, because we didn't know how he would react. When approaching the adult ride (one in particular) we would wait till it stopped before walking past. On many occasions he asked for his headphones (which we provided). It was a jarring experience for us because his reaction was so different to when he was younger, in fact he has done the same things at a younger age with absolutely no sign of fear, and we were scared of pushing him too hard and introducing significant stress.

756,How can I tell if my suggestions have become a form of bullying,"   Possible Duplicate:   What constitutes verbal abuse of one&#39;s child?       I am worried that my constant reminders and punishments are being taken as bullying.  I might be over reacting but then again, I might not.   I imagine a youth reacts to bullying differently when its from an elder. Is there any research or experience on this matter? The last thing I want to do is mentally abuse a child. "
757,Should we always ask to have urine tested when we go to urgent care?,"Went to the urgent care the other day because of a high temp over a few days, lots of fussiness, lack of eating and when she does eat she would vomit. They did all the normal things like checking weight, temp, looking in ears and throat. The conclusion was ""take fever reducers and here is a prescription for medicine to help with nausea"".   My wife asked about any infections, specifically, UTI's, because she was playing in sand in Florida for the past few days. The doctor said they don't like to do the urine test, because, well, it means a catheter to get the urine and they only do it if there was a past UTI.  Long story short we opted for the urine test and she did have an infection and it was probably the cause for the fever. And it's only by luck that we know. I, for one, am going to want a urine test no matter what but should everyone ask for that? What other tests that are ""optional"" should parents be asking for if they find themselves at the urgent care with a fussy, high temp child? "
758,Baby gift suggestion for third boy?,"What is a good idea for a baby gift for someone who has just had their third boy?

759,Does separating necessarily cause damage?,"Me and my (ex)girlfriend have a 3 years old child. He is an accidental child from a one night stand (where I was completely drunk and she was sober), but I didn't want to leave them alone, so I gave up my former life (I was living in a different country with a life set) and moved up together with them. We were living together for a year and a half.  BUT things are just didn't work out well between my GF and me. We had some arguments and different standards (in parenting and other things as well). Basically she is kind and wants good for our son, but on a different way than me, hence we couldn't get along.  Beside this, she thinks everything is my fault in our relationship, she did only one thing wrong, let me into her life...  So, long story for short, we separated  in peace, we didn't want these arguments evolving to fight and shouting and stuff and thought better if a child has two separated, balanced parents instead of together, but hate each other.  We have not experienced any changed in our son's behavior. He still likes singing, active, playing on the playground and kindergarten as before. Still curious about everything just as before. He really likes me and the mother also. No anger or blaming in him at all.  Obviously, he has questions: ""When will we sleep together again (three of us)"" or ""Where are you living now, dad?"" or ""What home are we going to go now?"" or ""Do I still have my room?"" ""Why mom is not here?"". We are trying to give him clear and ""process-able"" answer, but obviously he can not get the truth, but we are not lying at all.  I'm trying to spend as much time with him as I can (every other weekend and trying to get 1-2 days during the week), but basically he lives with his mother. (on top of this we often skyping, even though we are in the same city, but sometimes he just wants to talk with me, specially before going to sleep)  Does a child necessarily needs to be hurt or has to have a sign because of the separation? Is it not strange that he has not, beside those question? Any idea how to maintain this situation and keep this up in him? Or  what do you think of this situation at all? "
760,"Kids in multicultural, multi-generational household","My wife is Chinese and I am an American guy. We live in the US and have a 4.5 y/o and 18 m/o. My wife's parents, in very traditional Chinese fashion (I guess it's common among many Asian cultures), come every 6 months for a 6-month period (i.e. 6 on, 6 off) to help us cook, clean, raise the children, yell at and complain incessantly about all of us and tell my wife and I specifically what good-for-nothing, incompetent, ungrateful, scum-of-the-earth people we are. And that's just in a morning.  My question comes down to, what will the children's development be like in this situation? Specifically, if anyone has any experience w/ this kind of thing, I'd like to know how your kids turned out; particularly in terms of emotional adjustment, anxiety, patience, etc. I have met few people living regularly in this kind of multi-generational household and fewer still with a multicultural and multi-generational household.  My in-laws are very nice in their thought to come over and never let us lift a finger to do any housework ever again for the remainder of their lives. However, I do worry about the anxiety and stress this places on my children (not to mention the in-laws). To give some perspective, my in-laws grew up in Maoist Beijing. What we in the US would consider less than trivial (e.g. using a paper towel to wipe up a spill), can be a major transgression in their eyes. Obviously, when you've got 2 young boys tearing through the house, breaking things to watch them break, throwing food -- in other words, being kids -- this creates a lot of tension. In addition, my wife and I frequently clash with what we see as my in-laws' overbearing behavior. Over things like career, money, raising our children and just generally what godless sacks of Satanshit my wife and I are. So those are the cons...  The pros that I see: my kids are really bilingual. My Mandarin isn't great and so my wife and I communicate in English. When the in laws are away, I can tell my kid's Chinese deteriorates. Dinner is on the table every night at 6pm (convenient for us but I think more importantly for the kids). Thanks to the Chinese belief that a child without a mouth stuffed with food is a child on the verge of starvation, my younger one has really thrived (whereas before he was underweight). Free childcare is also a bonus and they do provide better care for a young child than any nanny or childcare center. But I also have been trying to think about this more long-term as well. My in laws expect to be taken care of when they're old and my wife has pretty much committed to that. Although I don't know what that means for me (I'll probably be participating in that somehow), I do think it's good for kids to see multiple generations taking care of one another; in fact, that's one of the major criticisms I have of US culture, which I see as a general disregard for the well-being of families and caring for our vulnerable populations.  So anyone with experience in this kind of situation, your advice and feedback are much appreciated. As my post denotes, my wife and I clearly have our own issues with her parents. I'd wager Those who have lived in this kind of culture (natively or otherwise) would agree with me that asking my in-laws to ""compromise"" -- at least in the US/Western context -- is not going to happen. Given that our situation will probably continue into the foreseeable future, should I just try to shield my kids from some of the craziness? I do try to counterbalance our incompatibility by being a (relatively) calm(er) but firm force in the house, in a meager attempt to arbitrate some peace and sanity.  NOTE: I do make some generalizations about cultures here and I don't mean to offend anyone. I realize that I'm coming at this from my own cultural perspective and I carry my own biases. And yes, I know ""they're like that because they love you so try to understand blah blah blah"". I'm also aware that we can tell them not to come back; but that is not something my wife, and to a lesser extent I, want. My question, very specifically, is what are children's developmental outcomes when raised in this kind of environment and what can I/we do to optimize our situation. "
761,"What are practical tips for helping newborn with possible ""Silent Reflux"" condition?","After doing some research online (which admittedly is always a bit prone to error) I feel pretty confident that my newborn son has Silent Reflux (or laryngopharyngeal reflux). In short, it seems like stomach acid is entering his esophagus after feeding and causing discomfort/irritiation.  We spoke with our family doctor about it and he didn't seem that concerned and mentioned that it can pass over time. I'd still like to explore practical tips to help in the meantime.   Has someone had experience with this before? Any suggestions? "
762,What is the black line on pregnant womens belly,There is a vertical black line on a womans belly (shes white caucasian). I heard that its a common fact.  Where does this line come from? Does it have a biological function?  I heard about a remnant of a survival feature that would help a newborn baby to reach for the breasts. Any clue? 
763,Trouble with parent who pushes the envelope in every argument,"I Live with my father during the summer, and I do my best to make sure that I leave the smallest footprint possible. Doing my own laundry, dishes, food, etc. I think I do a good job.  My father and I will argue about things, and when I try and end the argument, he just keeps egging it on, and then later he complains that it's a shame that we have to argue ""like this"". To me, he's being a drama queen.  Here is an example:     Father: [tuskiomi], Do the dishes.   Me: Aww, I didn't make dirty any of them, though.   Father (very simplified and shortened): Everyone has to help out and do chores.   Me (realising that I've dug myself a hole) : Okay, fine I'll do them.   Father: [tuskiomi], why do you always complain about things?   Me: I'm not complaining; I'm doing the dishes.   Father: I don't hear anyone else giving me any lip. It's just a part of living here..   Me: I'm doing the dishes. you can stop lecturing me.   Father: (more lecturing about how it's simply expected of me to do chores)   [some hour or two later]   Father: You know, I don't like arguing with you..   I don't have anything against chores, and I do every one that my father asks me to. I don't egg the conversation on, and I admit, I do complain, but I'm not the only one, and It's more of a vent than objection. I've told him that I'm going to do what I ask him, and that he shouldn't take the complaining personally. He took that personally as well.  Now, I'm willing to change, and I'm willing to lay terms with my father. Open to the both.   How should I deal with my father egging on a conversation that isn't worth having anymore? "
764,teens nagging at each others,"The kids of my GF, 14 and 11 respectively, have that annoying tendancy to nag at each other when night time is coming. Teen girl likes to pout and teenage boy thinks himself as some kind of prima donna that like to be respected.  Please find the kind of scene/play, I'm witnessing     TB: Let me show you, the pictures I've taken from entertainement park      TG: Oh this is the rabbit I draw (she goes to the screen and point that out to us)      TB: TG! Are these your pics or mine? Do you want to show them or should I???   Another example:     Mom: Let me do a charade      TG: Oh! I know this charade! I give you the answer      TB: No! Me first!      TG is unhappy and pouts   Other example:     TB: Hey TG, are you ok?      TG will not answer because she pouts due to sensitiveness over different topics   Luckily, they don't do it often but when they do, I'm at loss at what I should say if I should say anything. Usually, I'm taking a back seat and it is like I'm having to endure a bad play, a funny bad play I would say but still a bad play.  My aim is to get minimal peace of mind when I'm arriving at home, but if I want that minimal peace of mind, I have to intervene (or I think I do). One of my belief is I should intervene only if their behaviour are going out of hands and that they should find a way to deal with their issues or simply to be able to behave properly, despite the tiredness/emotional upheaval.  I'm bit at loss between strict authoritarian rule and too much laissez faire. I know the limit is between the two but I could not find my balance yet. I know that their mum should be doing the discpline but she has more of a friend's attitude toward them and sometimes just sometimes, she has a all or nothing attitude, yell or unconditional love.  I'm also a bit at loss because, well , it is a teenage boy and also a teenage girl  Most likely, my question will be very much opinion based but to be honest, your insights are more than welcome as I'm learning parenthood and hopefully, becoming a decent one.  Thanks. "
765,How can I help my preschooler develop empathy?,"My 3.5-year-old preschooler is pretty book-smart, but is quite emotionally immature for his age.  This has led to a frequent, difficult situation for us.  He'll be acting out a bit - say, not wanting to get out of his carseat at preschool.  Mommy will start to pick him up, and in the process, hit her head on the car a bit, saying 'Ow' and clearly being a bit hurt.  Or, he'll be having a hard time going to bed, and hit or bite Mommy, and she'll again be hurt and express that.  He then proceeds to laugh, quite a bit.  This is pretty frustrating, if you've just hurt yourself because he was acting out, or been hurt by him, and then the reaction is laughter.    Dealing with this on our side we largely understand; it's hard to actually do, mind you, but we know what we need to do.  Take a time out, go somewhere else, have the other parent take over, whatever to get us out of the situation so we don't get any more angry.  But, how do we help him deal with this?  We've tried explaining to him that he's hurt us or we're hurt, and talking about how he'd feel.  When he's entirely calm he understands this.  But it clearly doesn't carry through when he's not entirely calm - even when he's mostly calm, just acting like a normal three year old.  The only thing that seems to work (to get him to stop laughing and understand it's serious) is yelling at him, which isn't what we want to do (and not something we do on purpose - just when we lose control).  Then, he cries and is quite shocked (presumably as we very rarely yell), and apologizes; so he clearly knows what's going on, but we can't find a better way to get through.  What is the expectation of a 3-4 year old in terms of empathy, here?  Is it unfair for us to expect him to show empathy when he's not 100% calm?  This page seems to suggest at 2-3 they should understand happy/sad, and certainly at times he does, but at more important times he doesn't seem to. "
766,What are the stages of child speech and language development?,"What are the distinct stages or landmarks or milestones in speech in language development, in the order they're typically reached, and why is it that order?  For instance, I know that certain types of phonemes are learned at different times. Vowels are usually learned early, and different types of consonants are learned later.  As well as phonetic mastery, there is also grammatical mastery. An example is expressed in: I am vs my is - when do children develop this bit of language?   I'm asking primarily about English pronunciation and grammar.  Please feel comfortable using technical terms, such as those found in Articulatory Phonetics, Occlusives, Manners of Articulation and linguistic/grammatical terminology. I have access to resources about these areas of interest.  I'm particularly interested in the why of these developmental stages. Phoneme acquisition charts are easily found, but they don't discuss why certain phonemes are learned before others. A list of sounds/grammar rules and comparative ages isn't as useful to me as understanding the physiological or cognitive underpinnings of those milestones.  Age range can be assumed to be from start of speech until ""mastery"" of all landmarks. I'm not just interested in a single age, but the full breadth of development. (Unfortunately, I have to be this broad. Since I don't know the individual stages, I can't right now ask about them individually).  If necessary, I can separate phonemes from grammar for two separate questions. "
767,How do you handle invites and venue registration for a venue birthday party when you don't know the turnout?,"My wife and I are finally thinking of throwing our first venue birthday party.  My son is of pre-K age and has classmates he wants to invite.  My wife and I don't know the families or the kids ourselves and I can only rely on my son to tell me who his friends really are.  If I RSVP for a venue, they want me to say how many kids/adults will come, but I don't know.  On one hand I want to know ballpark how many kids will show up and, to a larger extent, if it is even worth it to have a venue party but on the other hand I need to reserve in time to have a space.  If no one would come to the venue, I would rather host a family/family friend party at home.  How does one handle this balance of reserving early versus figuring out how many might actually show up?  Or, to have more objective answers, what can you do when you want to call up a venue to grab a spot? "
768,Unusually agitated and constantly sucking two-week old,"Today our two week old was (and still is) unusually agitated. She slept two hours less than her up-until-now average, requested breastfeeding for entire one hour more and was more cry-prone than ever. She has trouble going to sleep, won't sleep on her own, has to either fall asleep on a breast or be cuddled. And when she does sleep, she won't sleep for too long and will soon wake up crying, instead of usual calm looking around or fussing. And she rejects a dummy which she liked before.  We have followed all elements on every newborn checklist we could find. She has no fever. Her clothes seem perfectly comfortable (she wore them few days before). Everything we can think of seems to be in order.  Do such days happen? Is there anything we can do to calm, soothe her?  EDIT: One day later.  My daughter seems to have calmed down. She does not seem to have grown yet, but she does seem ""smarter"" and more agile. She rotates her head more quickly, follows our faces with her eyes more ""fluently"" (she used to do it, but in large ""jumps""). She also spends more time just lying and looking around at the world. I guess she gathered enough experience points and was going through a level-up;)  To sum up, it seems I shouldn't have worried. "
769,Daughter and school dress code,"I have a daughter who will be starting high school next year. Because the public schools in our area are terrible, and because I want to try to get her to become an engineer (I'm a civil engineer/architect), I'm enrolling her in a private school for the coming school year. All of our family loves it and we feel that it's the perfect choice (she got a good scholarship, which helps too). The only thing that concerns me is the dress code.  This is a rather ""preppy"" school, and while there isn't a uniform, there is a strict dress code (for example, boys wear dress or chino pants and a collared, button-up shirt). What concerns me is that this dress code requires that girls wear a skirt, skorts, or something similar, along with a collared top or a modest sweater. Here's the relevant lines from the dress code passage that they sent us as part of admission materials:        Appropriate bottoms include skirts, skorts and collared dresses, all of knee length and worn at the waist line (jeans are appropriate only on approved ""out of dress code"" days)   Tops are to be collared casual or dress shirts including polo shirts, blouses and turtlenecks. Shirts which are made to be tucked in shall be worn tucked in.      My concern is that my daughter is 14, and having her wear a skirt every day to class makes me a little nervous, especially because it's a co-ed school and there are bound to be boys there with sex on the mind, and I don't want my daughter to be the target. What can I do to be sure that she is prepared? I know that every girl will be dressed similarly to how she will be dressed (any knee-length skirt and any blouse is okay, within limits; it is not a uniform), and the boys will be dressed nicely as well, but this does concern me.  Just to be clear, I have no objections with a skirt being a part of the dress code; after all, one of the points of a dress code is to teach students how to dress in a professional environment. I just want to make sure that my daughter will be okay and will be able to meet the dress code while at the same time not being made a target by overzealous boys.  Anyone have any suggestions? "
770,What do we do when timeouts are not effective?,"We have a three year old toddler, and he has just seemed to realize that timeouts are nothing more than him sitting in a corner for a few minutes.  He has recently started doing a whole suite of bad actions (throwing things at people, hitting people, etc), and when caught, gets an impish grin because he believes that all that will happen to him is a timeout.  How do I make these things stick?  Or, if there is a point where they don't, what's the escalation move?  I'd rather not go towards spanking (pretty sure that will just let him think that hitting people is ok rather than a bad thing).  EDIT: Thanks for all the replies.  I can see responses vary wildly depending on parenting style, so we'll be looking into these things.  I can't give a check until I see which one works for my son, and even then, it'll just be for my son and another child may respond differently.    EDIT 2: We've tried a number of things from these suggestions, but so far, the idea with the most effect appears to be a) find a particular, specific spot for timeouts (in this case, standing on a subwoofer facing the corner) and b) fighting the battles to stay in timeout until he stays in timeout.  He still does naughty things, mostly in an effort to get our attention when we're really too exhausted to play with him at the end of the day, but he understands that he will get the timeout and he doesn't fight it.  Instead, he seems to be getting the 'mommy and daddy are worn out, I'll just color by myself' idea pretty nicely.  We tried the charts with stickers idea, but that didn't work as we found ourselves not being consistent.  Without our own consistency, he just ignored the chart too.  We found that to be the case with most ideas, that our own inconsistencies leads to an idea not working.  It's only by paying attention to everything that we noticed it.  Thanks to everyone! "
771,ML@H + OPPL = confusion?,"I speak Italian while my partner speaks Korean and we speak English between us. The community language is French. We were thinking to raise a tri-lingual child (0-years old now) with a 'One Person One Language' - 'Minority Language at Home' mixed approach.  In practice, to the child I would speak only Italian while my partern only Korean while keeping going to speak English between us. Do you think that the child will be able to pick up Italian like as a  speak-with-father language, Korean as a speak-with-mother language and English as a speak-with-family language?     Also note that the nanny will probably speak mostly Italian to him.  Do you think that it would be more effective if I would speak English, my partner Korean and the nanny Italian? "
772,"Boy defending himself from sister, or fight back?","I've read this question, but I don't think that is the solution for my situation.  My son is 6 years old, and has a 5 year old step sister. The sister is able to get under his skin very quickly - either being annoying, hitting him, or screaming/singing random sounds. My son has learned from a very young age to just walk away if asking the person to stop does not fix it.  This all sounds good in theory, right?  My issue is, she will follow him, and eventually an argument breaks out, and my son starts crying because his mom (who lives in a different household than I do) told him ""Boys are stronger, girls are smarter. You can't hit girls back"". He simply doesn't know what to do, so looked to me for advice.  The advice I gave him was, ""You know you are stronger than . You know you have more maturity and intelligence than she does. If asking her to stop, and walking away are not working, and she hits you, you can hit her back. You cannot hit her harder than she hits you, and you cannot load up and keep hitting her over and over.""  My thought process was ""If a girl is going to be a bully, why does it matter that she's a girl"". I've seen my son, time and time again, walk away or ask her (or others) to stop doing whatever it was that was bugging him. I've also seen where he gets egged on, and it frustrates me as the parent as well.  I explained this to my partner in private, and she said it was the wrong lesson to teach. I asked what should happen then when he tries the other methods and they fail - neither of us could come up with anything better.  I want my son to be able to stand up for himself, and not fear being in a different room than I am since he ""shouldn't hit girls"". He is a confident boy, and is very polite, even to his step sister.  My question is, am I right in how he should defend himself after exhausting non-physical responses? If not, what would be a better way of dealing with this situation in the future? "
773,What's the motivation behind school uniforms {or} Why can't my daughter wear a dang princess on her shirt?,"I just registered our daughter for Kindergarten at a school that has amazing ratings online - Great Schools ranks it at a 10/10 (for whatever that's actually worth, I'm not really sure). So I'm super excited that she'll apparently be in an excellent learning environment.  My concern is the dress code. Details aren't necessary but suffice it to say it's entirely boring (limited solid color, no-design polos, etc.). I value education, but I also equally value individuality.  Can someone help me understand the benefits of discouraging 5-year-olds from wearing their favorite princess or super hero shirts at school? I'm aware of what's attempted to be achieved (distracting from competing in dress, focusing on academics, etc.), but are there any real data to support the claim that such policies actually produce the expected benefits? Or even better, any real-world experiences that directly benefited from such a policy? "
774,My newborn won't sleep,"Yet another sleep-related question.   My baby is five weeks old. He sleeps like a champ at night - he'll go down around 10 or 11 pm, wake up for a feeding or two (and sometimes we even have to wake him), and will usually be up again around 6 or 7 am. Recently we've had success in putting him back to bed if he gets his last feed no later than by 6 am (starting time), and then he'll sleep until around 8 am or 8:30. We'll either put him down awake or drowsy or asleep, depending on the state he's in - it doesn't seem to matter too much.  Napping during day, however, is a complete other business. Starting in his second week, he'd simply refuse to go to sleep. If we attempt to put him to bed, he'll cry hysterically until we take him out of bed again; shushing and rocking and what have you not won't help. He will (mostly) sleep when carried around in a baby carrier or in his pram. This means that he'll get about 8-12 hours of sleep per day at most.   I would expect him to be overtired; but actually, he seems quite happy to be awake, and he's not fussy or cranky unless we attempt to put him to bed. He also has no problem at all staying awake for long stretches of time like an eight hour stretch. I've tried swaddling, to no avail (he enjoys sleeping with his arms above his shoulders, so I can see why would hate swaddling); I've asked the local children's services, who basically responded by saying 'well, if he's thriving and seems to be happy, then there's no reason to worry' - but I can't imagine that sleeping this little is healthy for him, and I also worry what this means for his future sleeping habits (and honestly, I could use a break as well).  We fed him on demand within 3 - 4 hours until last week; we then decided to introduce a fixed three hour schedule. We noticed that after three hours he isn't really hungry enough, so we just started stretching that to a four hour schedule. He seems to do fine health-wise - he was born with 3 kg, and gained 1.2 kg within four weeks.  Any ideas? Anything that I'm missing? "
775,How much of my prior drug use should I disclose to my tween daughter?,"My daughter started middle school this year (she is 11) and tonight at dinner she told me that during an assembly some teachers had shared tragic stories about friends and family members who abused drugs and/or alcohol. One story involved a teen who drank until he passed out and then died from choking on his own vomit.    Our conversation evolved into us talking about the kinds of situations she might be exposed to as she is getting older and how she might act in those situations. We talked about what she could do if she was at a party where kids were drinking and/or passing out. I wanted to emphasize ways that she can stay safe, help her friends stay safe and most importantly that she can always call her parents if she's in a dicey situation and needs help.   She assured me there was nothing to worry about because she would never drink or touch drugs. I told her I think it's great that she feels that way now, but that should things change I would rather have her talk to me about it than feel that she can't because she once promised she would never do those things.   At the end of our talk, she asked me if I drank alcohol in high school and if I smoked pot before I was 18 (where we live recreational cannabis is legal for 21 &amp; up). I told her that I did experiment a bit and gave her some context around that and told her I wished I had waited until I was older. She seemed satisfied with that for now, but I know these questions will come up again.   My early teen years were traumatic and I was rebellious and self-destructive. My later teen years and 20's were pretty colorful as well. How do I balance honesty and open communication with keeping communications age-appropriate and constructive? Do I just edit out large parts of my life experience?  "
776,Methods for reducing or coping with sleep deprivation,Sleep deprivation is a major problems for parents of a newborn child. Are there methods which could help young parents cope with sleep deprivation or reduce it? Have you tried any of them? What is your personal experience? 
777,Threat of internet predators -- how significant is it?,"There is a lot of talk about securing your children's access to electronic devices, the web, etc. There are lots of scary stories about terrible things happening, no doubt many terrible things have happened.  However, what I have not been able to find is any solid statistical data. Data showing for example a dramatic rise in non parent abduction or internet facilitated child molestation, or some of the other terrible things.  Is there data to support this? What is the realistic risk for kids from this? Is it different for different ages and sexes? How does it compare to the other risks and channels for children to be abused in this way?  I might be naive but it seems a seriously overblown threat compared to the many other dangers our children face. It strikes me as something that sells a lot of books and lectures and makes scary TV shows rather than actually being a significant threat to children. However, I would be happy to be disabused of my complacency by hard data.  Anybody know of source?  And of course, if it is just one child it is terrible -- but we as parents have to carefully marshal our resources to protect our children from the serious threats while allowing them the liberty to grow and thrive and take risks on their own. When I was a kid I had free reign on a computer and it allowed me huge vistas of intellectual growth and enjoyment. Of course things were different back then, but I want my kids to have as much of that same experience as it is safe for them to have. "
778,What are the pros and cons of using dessert as a motivation for kids to work hard?,"We have a kindergartener whom we homeschool. We also send our child for once-a-week violin lessons, which requires us to practice with our child every day.  Most of the times, our child is motivated to work hard at her writing, math, and violin practice. At other times, our child just has a bad attitude towards homeschool and violin practice.  We are thinking of making after-dinner dessert conditional on good behavior during her ""work time"". In our minds, dessert seems like a natural consequence of working hard. After all, if our child were an adult, and did not work hard, our child would only be able to afford basic food, and not the very tasty desserts our child would want to buy. FYI: Our dessert is generally healthy but is sweeter than other foods, usually clementines, apples, frozen berries but sometimes ice cream.   What are the pros and cons of such an approach? Have you tried this approach personally and has it worked for you?  "
779,Boy Crazy at Seven,"My seven year old daughter is fascinated with boys already and has 28 of them lined up to ""marry"" her.  She flirts like crazy and frankly, it is amazing to watch how she can get these boys to do just about anything she asks - and I don't think she even realizes how wrapped around her finger she has them.  I think the fact that they ""fall in line"" so easily makes her believe she can marry them if she wants that much more - maybe she will marry one of them one day (one never knows really), but for now, I wish she'd just give it a rest.  Just the other day she also told me, ""I think I've got boobs coming mom.  How long til I can actually get married?""  She doesn't really, but she is excited about the idea of it so believes it anyway.  I know girls are obsessed with marriage sometimes, but this is actually pretty crazy.  My husband and I have had a few laughs over it, but it also gets us a little nervous sometimes too.  How common is this?  How do I chill her out a little and not be so anxious and obsessed about it?  and should I be worried about it getting worse in adolescence or is it just a ""practicing"" phase? "
780,How would I tell my Father-In-Law that he's being too lenient in disciplining my brother-in-law?,"My wife and I are newlyweds, we married last December, and we're still trying to straighten out the paperwork for our new home. I've been staying with my wife in her family's home for couple of months.   My brother-in-law is under 18 years old, let's just call him ""Jimmy"". I've noticed my father-in-law is not strict at all with Jimmy. I've never heard him scolded Jimmy even though Jimmy stays out late and usually gets home at 11:00PM - 12:00AM. We don't have any idea where he stays during his late nights. Jimmy skips his classes without a reasonable excuse and I've never heard my father-in-law say anything to motivate Jimmy to attend classes even though Jimmy has a very poor academic history (it took him 10 years to complete his primary education, instead of the usual 6).  Another thing I noticed is that when Jimmy asks for something (buy a new phone or shoes) my father-in-law never says no. He also gives Jimmy soda daily, which is not really good for his health. It seems to me that he's spoiling Jimmy too much. I feel that there's supposed to be a reward system to motivate Jimmy to strive harder in school and teach him the value of education. I've never seen Jimmy working on homework assignments, thus I believe he is not serious in his studies though he just reached the secondary education this year.  I'm concerned about Jimmy. I have two younger brothers and we've grown up with our parents putting a strong emphasis on the importance of our education, which motivated us to study hard and do well academically.  Should I just let it pass? I'm afraid that my father-in-law might be offended and think that I'm trying to tell him how to parent his own child.  EDIT: Sorry if I really missed one point. Yes, we do talk about it with my wife, of course I do open up to her, we've been in a relationship for 8 years before we get married. What I usually ask her ""Why your father is too kind? and explained what I noticed.."", and she will just respond ""because that's what my father is"", and if I talked about Jimmy to her. She would usually respond to me ""We (with my mother-in-law) already tried to correct Jimmy a lot of times, but it looks like that is what he is."". I really appreciate all the response. Though I might just pre-judge Jimmy's action that would affect his future (that is where my concern is). Glad I have not talk about it yet to my father-in-law, "
781,How to prepare a toddler's sleep habits for the disruption of a newborn?,"In the near future, there will be a new baby in the home. From previous experience, sleep is highly disrupted.  I'm wondering what effect this will have on my son and his sleep quality, and how it may affect him during the day.  Some facts:   We live in a very small apartment. The bedrooms share a wall. Noise travels easily: We can hear our son breathing when everyone is in bed. The new baby will start off in our room, but may have to share a room with our other son once we switch from a bassinet to the crib, because we have no other free space. Our son is 2, and will be about 27 months when his brother arrives.   Is there anything that we can do to help make this transition easier on our son? It doesn't have to necessarily be before the baby arrives, so suggestions for what to do afterwards are acceptable.  Should I even be concerned? I completely expected the impact a child would have on my sleep patterns, but it's only recently that I've wondered how it will affect a young child. "
782,How do I convince my daughter to agree that I want to quit my job and not strain our mother-daughter relationship?,"I want to leave and start something on my own. But my husband is not working as well and I fear my daughter will feel bad to say that both her parents are not working. What should I do? I have enough money  saved to give her a reasonable future. My husband earns a good pension.  She has always seen me working and gathers comfort and pride from that. My work is killing me and devaluing me. I want freedom and need to look after my health. Also I have a dream close to my heart. I want to follow that dream. If I succeed I could earn money AND be happy. If not there is not much loss of money.  So my daughter and what she feels is holding me back and I am feeling more and more fatigued in body and soul.  I love her, she is a temperamental child but sometimes selfish like many children are... PLEASE HELP. Tell me I am not selfish in choosing something good for myself however my daughter says she feels about it... Am I being a good parent when I choose to follow my own dream? Time is running out an changing me into an empty money earning shell...She is just a young teenager and may not know better... but still...

783,Can/should I ask a sitter to take first aid classes?,"I live in a relatively rural area which limits certain options for me.  Where I live has no professional sitter services at all, you just have to find someone you personally trust.  I have recently started to interview some candidates for ""as needed"" babysitting (just the occasional evening/weekend).  I am not finding anyone I am completely happy with as so far none seem to have taken any actual health/safety training.    I am trying to sort if it's reasonable to ask someone to take first aid and CPR training.  I am willing to pay for the training I want them to have, but I can admit I am a little concerned that I will pay and they would end up not finishing it/showing up and/or perhaps not babysit for me enough after to warrant the fees. If however it worked out and they were able to fill in here and there for a few years, I find it an absolutely worthwhile investment.    Is this a weird thing for me to offer?  Might I scare someone off or can I suggest it without it being too odd?  Should I expect to also pay them for their time to attend the class if I offer this?  I really don't know what is typical as I haven't had to look for anyone before as I had people I knew who also were well qualified (like one was a registered nurse, so she obviously had plenty of training).    I am sorry if this seems obvious to others, but I have some anxiety about how to ask and if this is overstepping.  I had a couple of candidates I rather liked other than their lack of knowledge in that specific area.  I took that training prior to ever watching children, so I personally find it a necessary step and I have actually used my training while caring for kids.    My location is such that the soonest help would come if you called for it is 20 mins and that would be EMT/fire station arriving.  If you need a hospital, the drive after that is at minimum an hour.   "
784,When do girls usually start shaving?,"Since my heritage includes a few of the more hairy ethnicities from Europe, my family is quite hairy and always has been, (you should see my hobbit feet in winter when I haven't shaved them for example - at least they aren't as bad as my father's but still. . . )  When I was young, I had hairy legs before my legs became truly hairy because of adolescence.  Early in fourth grade, a then-girlfriend of mine ""dumped me"" because I had hairy legs and wasn't shaving yet.  My daughter has my genes and though she, thankfully, has a lighter hair color than I, she too already has quite a bit of hair on her legs.  I don't plan on pointing it out or anything - I figure she'll let me know when she has noticed and wants to do something about it.  However, I was wondering approximately when I am likely to recieve this information/request from her, as most of the kids I have dealt with were students and I didn't pay much attention to whether their legs were shaved or not, or they were way too young.  Is there an average age young girls start this practice?  It does seem to me, it is fairly likely a lot of girls begin before sixth grade - am I correct on that count? "
785,Is this bullying? Are we overreacting/under-reacting?,"My happy, positive, loving, open-minded, outgoing teenage daughter gets along with other people very easily. She's kind by nature and cares deeply about the feelings of others. She's mature for her age and doesn't usually experience drama with people, which is why I'm concerned about a recent situation.  Her best friends for many years is a boy who lives across the street. He always seemed like a very nice boy. Their friendship is strictly platonic.  My daughter dated a boy from school for a week or two, but broke up with him because his behavior seemed abusive (I agreed). She told her best friend because she was hoping for emotional support. He told her that it was impossible that her ex had been abusive, that he knew women who were really being abused and my daughter wasn't one of them. My daughter stopped talking to him. It took him a month to apologize.   Our family is spiritual, but not religious. My daughter reads sacred texts from every religion. She shared her excitement about new things she's been learning with her best friend and he told her that she couldn't possibly believe in the existence of God. He then told her if she talked about God or her beliefs that he'd give her the silent treatment. She stood up for herself. She told him that she felt it was arrogant of him to tell her what she did or didn't think, feel, or believe and even more so since he'd threatened to give her the silent treatment for talking about something that he'd never in the past had any problem with. She ignored him for about a month and he eventually apologized.   My daughter (almost 18) watched Game of Thrones, but she found the show too violent (it gave her nightmares.) She told her best friend this. He sent her taunting text messages and Game of Thrones-themed porn. She showed me the messages he sent her. I thought them creepy and disturbing.  My daughter wants to block his number, email address and social media profiles. I agree that she should do that. However, being that my daughter is a decent person, she at least wants to send him one last email stating that they've grown apart as friends rather than just severing all contact without saying something to him. His behavior has her feeling distressed and upset.  Does he even deserve an email from her saying that they've grown apart as friends before she blocks him? Should she block him, especially being that since this type of behavior began it hasn't stopped? What would have caused him to change so radically? Could he be mentally ill, a bully, a coward and insecure? Might he be drinking or using drugs? Should I speak with his parents since they live right across the street?  My daughter just informed me that her best friend recently told her that all of his ex-girlfriends ended up in therapy following dumping him, but he didn't elaborate. He might just be an abusive individual and it took a long time for the mask to come off. "
786,How can I get others to respect our toy/parenting choices?,"Let me explain as this sounds weird. So my wife and I are foster parents, and one of the very few things you do differently for foster children than you do your bio-children is a kind of screening of their toys (and other things but lets focus on toys).   For example if you have a child in your care that is, due to abuse, sensitive to loud sounds, you avoid loud toys. If you have a child that is, due to past occurrences, prone to play with dolls in a sexual manner, you avoid dolls. Some of the things you ""filter out"" may seem odd from an outside perspective.   Another great example are toys that encourage expression, creativity, and interaction are favored over toys that are ""one player"" in many contexts as it gives foster parents a way to interact on their level. At the same time, toys that are for group play may not be the right choice for children that are currently having behavioral problems in groups.   Lastly, at least my wife and I take co-parenting very seriously, and use every opportunity to involve the bio-parents in the decision process. Sometimes, for one reason or another, they request we avoid certain toys. When it seems reasonable, we try very hard to comply. When it's not reasonable we try to be flexible and comply anyway, but the concept of reasonable is objective, and sometimes we're not able to. For example, we provide nook tables to kids of all ages. If the bio-parents don't like that (none have had an issue so far) then I don't know what we would do, as it's the primary way the children would read, watch ""TV"", and many other things.  At the same time if the bio parents recommend certain toys, as long as we feel they're safe, then we try to get them. This has never been a problem for us. No one has ever tried to recommend we get a 4 year old a chain saw. But it could be a problem, for example if a parent recommended the entire Disney VHS collection. First because we don't think kids should watch that much TV, second because we don't have a VCR (or anything to hook one up to).  So toy choices (in this example) can seem unusual.   How do you get others to accept your rules for toy choices?  We have a large problem with ""others"" getting what they think will be fun.  For example a neighbor getting a toy for our foster child that would normally be perfectly fine, but for this case, it's not ok.   This usually falls into two categories.   Ignorance the neighbor just doesn't know that something as ""normal"" as a play dough play set is a trigger for this child.  Being Ignored usually not neighbors and friends but ""grandparents"", just going - ""It's ok, you liked playing with it when you were a kid"" (or similar). And just ignoring our rules as unimportant or wrong.  So, back to the question, how do you enforce your toy choices, when other people may not understand or respect the boundaries. And failing that, how do you  ""take away"" a gift because it is a trigger, even though the child may not understand that?  "
787,Is it normal for a newborn to develop pimples?,My daughter is 2 weeks old and has developed a pimple like rash on her forehead.  Is this a common problem for new babies?  What things (if any) can I do to alleviate the problem? 
788,Should I make contact with my son's dad after 3 years?,"My 6 year old son's dad hasn't been in his life for over 3 years now. He is getting older now and asking questions about daddy. Me and his dad have had a volatile relationship, we were both young and eventually fell apart shortly after our son was born. Since then he was in and out of his life until shortly before his third birthday. I can now see he wasn't ready for the responsabilities of being a full time dad. He would often cut all contact for months (and when he did have him he would just leave him at his parents whilst he went out). He never actually showed interest in his son. I was always the one to make the first step to get back in touch. I usually did that by contacting his family, who were a bit difficult to deal with due to religious choices, but always happy to see their grandson nethertheless.  I got into a new relationship and this didn't go down well with my sons dad. It was causing alot of aggrevation to everyone including his family who were the ones looking after my son on the weekends that he was supposed to be with his dad. Often when he was meant to drop our son back he would disappear to his friends' house. Because his family had religious beleifs, I would have to stand outside for hours until they finished praying. I would often be driving home at 10pm when both me and my son would have an early start the next day. This was obviously causing grief to everyone especially my son. That's when I told his dad that I would go to court to get a contact order that he has to stick to, if he does wish to be a part of our sons life. That was the last time I ever heard from him. No phone calls on my sons birthdays, Christmas, nothing. Not even a card from him or his family. He knew my adress up to about 6 months ago where I moved to another city. He knows my phone number, e-mail address, and he's not blocked on any social networks. If he really wanted to be a part of his life, he easily could have contacted me.  His dad is nog physically or mentally abusive, nor is he on drugs or alcoholic. I think he and our son could have a good relationship, should he want one.   Should I make the first step yet again? Should I encourage my child to have a relationship with his dad even though he has shown absolutuley no interest in wanting one? "
789,"Are ""Potty Parties"" generally effective?","A couple I know recently threw a ""potty party"" for their three-year-old son.  The general idea is outlined here, and is that you dedicate a day to intensive potty training.  Some of the main ideas are:   It is a full, intensive one-on-one day with no (or minimal) distractions The child is encouraged to drink a lot and eat lots of salty snacks, to maximize how many potty attempts there will be. A doll is used to model the desired behavior. Instruction is given to the doll, rather than the child, and the child is encouraged to help ""train"" the doll. Presents and a general celebration are held to make the child excited about the concept.   Quite frankly, the whole thing sounds rather silly to me, and I worry that such a plan might put too much pressure on the child to ""succeed"" immediately (the goal is to complete potty training in a single day, and the author of the book referenced in that article claims that this is a reasonable expectation).  Is this an effective technique?  Does anyone has experience with it?  Does a child need to reach a certain level on their own before this technique becomes effective (beyond being developed enough to physically ""hold it in"" long enough to make it to the potty)? "
790,Raising a bilingual kid. When should we introduce the majority language?,"We are a family living in an English speaking country with a 3-year-old. My wife and I speak both French and English and we are committed to raise our kid bilingual in both languages. So far our approach has been to expose him only to French since he will eventually pick up English from the outside world. So his daycare is in French, we (and our family) only speak to him in French and the cartoons he watches are in French…  as a result he only understands and speaks French right now. We are happy about this, but are starting to be concerned that he does not understand/speak English, especially when we have playdates with other kids who only speak English, we don't want him to feel that he is different from them.  Our long term plan for us is to follow a strict one-parent, one-language (OPOL) approach (my wife will only speak English and I will speak French to him). Should we start the OPOL approach now? Or Should we continue with only French for a few more years? Also we are planning on sending him to a bilingual school English/French, so I am not concerned about him feeling different at school. My concern is mostly with our friends' kids and other family members who don't speak French. I also have the irrational fear that he will not learn English well… which I know is very irrational, since English is the main and only language where we live.  "
791,Breaking my rejection of christianity to my parents,"I know this isn't exactly appropriate for this site -- I'm not a parent, I'm a son -- but I think it's still applicable to the community here. I would prefer feedback from actual parents concerned about other parents, not people who theorize about child-parent relationships, but if there's a better q/a site for me to migrate this question to, please let me know.  I am 20 years old, third year in college. I went to church about every Sunday for the first 18 years of my life, with my parents. When I moved out to go to college, I stopped going to church all together. My Mom still tells me every time I see her (whenever I go home, about twice a semester) that she's praying for me. I go with my parents to church every time I'm home, sing the songs, pray the prayers at dinner, the whole deal. Both my parents ask me if I've found a church yet, how often I go looking, etc. but I always manage to give them the excuse that I've been really busy with school (which is true, but of course irrelevant).   The truth is, I haven't self-identified as a christian since I was 16. I've avoided telling my parents this because... well, it would be very difficult. My Mom would probably get really upset and my Dad would probably just try to get in a huge theological argument with me, but it wouldn't change my mind, it would distress them further, and lead to a large divide between us. At the same time, it feels wrong to outright deceive them all the time. I'm definitely willing to continue whatever traditional religious stuff I would otherwise do to please them, even though it all means nothing (other than family tradition) to me.   As a parent, can you give me some advice on what to do? Should I have the talk and break it to them? If so, what's the best way to do that? How can I avoid religion causing a divide between us? "
792,"What to tell the child that says, ""Mom, is Santa really real?""","I am not asking if it is okay to perpetuate the Santa Myth here.  There is another question about that here.  I am also not asking when this is likely to happen.  That is answered here  I am asking how to help a child that has believed in Santa to move through the moment of realization when Santa suddenly is no longer real whether they figured it out for themselves or because some other child let the cat out of the bag is irrelevent.  The question is really two-fold because often, when they find out, they share their knowledge with their ""friends"" and pass the grief on as well.  So,   How do you help them move through the grief and enjoy the holiday anyway?  and   How do you help make sure your kid isn't the one letting the cat out of the bag for everyone else? "
793,"How high should I put bathroom stuff dangerous to young children (cleaning agents, razors etc.)?","We have a very small bathroom. Currently cleaning agents stand on the floor and we have a little bath cart for razors, cosmetics, sanitary napkins and so on.  Both cannot stay that way because our child will become mobile and want to explore everything at some point. (It is not born yet but will be soon.)  So we want to build a shelf, hang it onto the wall and put all that stuff into it. The idea is that the child cannot reach the stuff in the shelf until it is old enough to understand that the content is to be handled with caution (1: no licking/drinking! 2: be careful that you don't cut yourself! 3:...).  Since the bathroom is so small, we want to hang it as low as possible - the lower it hangs the more space we have to store everything (we will use more boards then). Otherwise we would need to store stuff outside of the bathroom, which we want to avoid if possible.  Also, if it hangs low, the child may later use the lowest board to put its own stuff there (after reaching a certain age - which age?).  So the question is, what is a good minimum height? I read that the mouthing phase usually ends around age 2, and in that age the child will be between 80cm and 93cm. But I don't know how high they can reach at this age, and I also don't know about the probability that the child will have its mouthing phase until age 4 (which seems to be not uncommon)...  Any experiences or hints?    We want to avoid building a cabinet because   we currently do not have the skills to build furniture with doors. doors would limit the ventilation of the inside. We will build with wood, and it is the bathroom, so there must be good ventilation. the depth of the furniture can be maximum 12cm (the only space to put it is behind the bathroom door, which opens to the inside of the bathroom), so adding doors would limit the storage space even further.  "
794,Should I wake my 8.5 month old for feeding at night?,"Our little one is 8 and a half months old, has started on solids at least twice a day, and is mostly breastfed. We are also slowing converting her to formula feeds to help my wife transition back to work.  We recently survived putting her in her own room, and she's subsequently gone from waking us up in the night, where my wife would offer milk, she would drink, then fall back asleep, to trying to let her settle herself when she wakes for a few minutes. We're a bit worried that she might actually be waking hungry, but is too sleepy to get too worked up about it.  For example, last night she went to sleep just before 8, her last feed being about 70ml of formula, followed by breastfeeding at about 7. She woke for a feed around 10:30, but then slept through (more or less, woke a few times, but settled) until 7:30am.  She's not 'starving' in the morning when she wakes. She is a smaller baby, but her parents are both relatively small people, and at her last weigh (8 months), she was on the lower end of the scale, but had moved up since the previous weigh. Health nurse was not at all concerned.  Are we missing a feed? Should we go in and offer a feed in the small hours of the morning? "
795,How might one comfort a newborn with sore gums whose teeth are about to erupt?,I would like to know how to comfort and relax a newborn whose primary teeth (or milk teeth) are about to emerge. What about soothing the gums with a teether? I have read that  they are harmful and should not be used.   Should we alleviate the soreness with some kind of medication? Or should we just leave things alone and let Nature take its course?   Please base the description of your suggested approach on specific details and proven methods.

797,Babies and math concepts,"Does anybody know what are the logical basic concepts that a baby could understand? For example regarding numbers, I think until the age of 1 they cannot distinguish between the concepts of one and many.  And until the age of two they cannot distinguish between two and three.   Furthermore, what about the logical connectives, like and, or, not and more... With my daughter it seems (20 months) that there is no problem with and, but she still seems to not understand the or.   I know that at that age every single baby follows his own way. But, I know also that they learn according the external incentives.  Regarding logical and mathematical concepts, there are three different levels of understanding:   Knowing the difference between numbers, The ability of managing numbers (at different levels depending on the age). To be fascinated by the beauty of math (and in particular of numbers).   Just in trying to explain the differences between these three levels, let me give one example.  If my family (me, my wife and my daughter) goes to an art museum, I would be the one who would enjoy it the least. Also if technically I'm better than my daughter (translating I'm better in level one and two), I'm not at all able to understand (especially with abstract art) the essence of a painting (I'm lower in level three).  Resuming three different levels of understanding means three different types of external incentives.   It seem to me (but I didn't already see the links) that the good answers of balanced mama and Valkyrie cover, almost completely, the first two types. But what about the last level?  Some years ago I read a book of  Daniel Tammet. He is an autistic savant with particular talent in remembering numbers. What is his strategy? He associates to numbers' surfaces, colours and objects. This is quite common among mathematicians: a demonstration could become a story, where the logical passages became landscapes and objects became characters.  In general I think that, starting with numbers, our brain  makes, for a certain point of view, completely irrational connections. Moreover I think that our brain starts to make these connections really early.   I would like that my daughter will appreciate mathematics from this point of view. The question now is:   what kind of external stimuli accomplish to this task? Does somebody know more about that?   "

799,"Advice for carrying out the ""Stay in Bed"" technique with our 2-year-old","My two-year old has always had trouble settling and sleeping through the night, but recently the problem seems to have become an awful lot worse. It all came to a head one night a few weeks ago after he woke at midnight and didn't drop off again till 4am, despite our best efforts with the ""controlled crying"" technique. That was when we knew we had to do something proactively, and soon.  After seeking advice from various different sources (including this forum), we opted to try Supernanny's ""Stay in Bed"" technique. She describes it in her book and there are various clips of it on the TV show (e.g. this clip~ 24 mins &amp; 29mins ). She says it is the best approach for a child of his age.   Basically it involves making sure your child has eaten and drunk well and carrying out a calming bed-time routine, putting your child in bed and sitting in the room with them, sitting side-on and without making eye-contact. The first time he gets out, you say ""It's bedtime."" and put him back. The second time, you say ""Bedtime"". Any subsequent times, you say NOTHING- ignore the screams, the questions, the begging for food, drink, etc- just lift him up and put him back.  It's all very well. But I've been doing it for almost a week, and so far the number of times I have had to put him back to bed (in chronological order) have been: 40,23,21,4,8,18. Last night he woke at 3am and (despite me sitting silently in his room after he woke) would not settle till 5am.  On the TV show, the technique always works very quickly and effectively when done correctly. But as far as I can see, I have followed everything to the letter, and I certainly have not once said a word to him when I shouldn't. The only doubt I have is that sometimes I lie down, rather than sit when I come in after he's woken in the middle of the night (can you blame me?)- don't know if that's important.  Has anyone got any advice on what I may be doing wrong, or maybe just some encouragement that it can take a long time?  One last point- I know there are loads of contrasting techniques out there, and I'm sure each has its merits. But I'd really rather stick with this technique now I've started, rather than start trying another one. Simply because changing it is distressing and confusing for him. "
800,Rough Nose is Painful to wipe - what to do?,"There is a horrible cold going around so I have a couple of rough noses that need blowing and wiping that are attached to children for whom this has been pure torture.  We have used moisturizers and jellies to soften little noses and I found some boogie wipes also, but even with the skin improving I now have kids that assume it will hurt and are screaming and fighting before blowing can even get started (three and five).    How can I talk to the kids about blowing their noses to make it less frightful?  Are there any nose blowing techniques that would also help in the future to avoide dry skin in the first place, and/or reduce the rubbing and friction within the process preventatively and now?   "
801,How to remain unaffected by my 10-year-old son's angry outbursts?,"My son is ten years old now and I feel that over the past year or so he has become increasingly irritable and prone to angry outbursts. He is easily frustrated by the smallest things and tears up and gets into a rage over what I perceive as nothing.  The problem in all of this is that I find it increasingly difficult to remain unaffected by my son's negative emotions. He gets over his fits of temper quickly and returns to a happy mood after a few minutes or half hour, but I feel that his rages destroy my mood irreparably. For example, we might start an afternoon in a good mood, I'm looking forward to what we have planned, and then something doesn't go as he wanted and he gets angry and stomps off to his room. After half an hour his good humor has returned, but now I am sad or angry or both and cannot get out of my funk for the rest of the day.  The worst of these situations happened two weeks ago. My son had an outburst, which wasn't even extremely bad, but it got to me so that I went to bed and cried and couldn't bring myself to get up again for the next few hours. I just lay there, thinking that I didn't want his anger to have happened, and unable to let go of no longer wanting to experience his moods.  By now, I look forward to the afternoons or weekends with my son with extreme apprehension, and I live in almost constant fear of his outbursts. When I am alone with my son, this apprehension and my attempts at not provoking him (while at the same time not bending to his wishes for more candy, more TV, or later bed time) is so stressful, that after a few hours I am so tired as if I hadn't slept for two nights.  I understand that it will take time to teach my son to deal with his emotions, and I sort of know how to go about it, but I don't know how to deal with my own emotions. All I want is to have the happy, easy-going, and fun child back that I had until about two years ago, and I am mortally afraid of his puberty.  What can I do to not let his negative emotions destroy my mood? How can I enjoy the time that I spend with him despite his frequent fits of anger? I feel like all the fun has gone out of my life. "

But when I am ask him to study, to complete his school homework and do the studying that I give him, he just tells me that he will do it but in the evening when I go home and ask him ""Have you completed your school homework and homework that I gave you?"" it is not done. He just passes his time watching TV, cartoons, or playing on the computer. He has started lying to me that he is not feeling well so he couldn't do his homework.

804,How to deal with teen self-destructive behavior and complete lack of sense of responsibility?,"A 18-year-old who is in the final year of high school is exhibiting certain patterns of behavior that seem very troubling. He is currently doing well in school, but I'm afraid that these patterns of behavior will soon enough lead him to disaster (academically and otherwise).   Lack of deep interest in most activities, apart from watching sports or playing video games. Lack of interest in any specific academic topics. Avoidance of any responsibility or school duty until the last possible moment before the (homework/exam) deadline -- to be precise, he does in the end do the job, but goes about doing it in the following way:   he asks for help from his parents and does it in a way as to imply that it is their responsibility to insure that the task is completed; he refuses to go the extra mile in performing any academic task. What is more, he is always ready to cut corners that do not affect ""too much"" the performance -- one of his favorite saying is ""I don't want to do useless extra work"" (while actually talking about work whose avoidance will not make him fail, but will avoid him truly going beyond mediocrity).  Complete abdication of responsibility for any aspect of his life, from trivial decisions to more important life-changing ones -- e. g. he has not yet even thought about his college major (or job perspective) after finishing school (to clarify, in my country you have to decide a fixed major before applying to university). Complete lack of skills and awkwardness in the most trivial/easiest manual activities. Refusal to complete even the most trivial tasks (even when pressed) -- including showering, brushing his teeth, set his room in (the tiniest amount of) order. This kind of lack of self-care is consistent with depression symptoms, but, in my experience, being forced by an external force to complete such tasks is ralely met with active defiance in depression cases (in those cases it is more of a ""letting oneself go"" rather than actively resisting an external push towards self-care).  Severe misbehavior and lack of respect towards parents (or adults in general), sometimes to the point of threats of violence or simulated acts of violence. In some cases, I can see where his frustration comes from, but it is still unacceptable.  Unwillingness to learn (in many contexts) from others (even school teachers -- for example  one phrase he uses often is ""Why does teacher X go on blabbing about this useless stuff, can't he just assign pages from the textbook and be done with it?"").    I must say that these things have been a problem with him for many years, but recently have become more and more severe.   One approach to try to deal with this kind of behavior would be to let him be until reality sets him straight. However, I'd really rather not have him suffer the consequences of his actions, because in my estimation they will surely be permanent and disastrous.   I cannot figure out the causes of this situation and when it is brought up for discussion his reaction is mosty avoidance (one phrase that he comes up with a lot in these circumstances is ""Don't stress me out"" -- which is also used when he engages in procrastination about school or other activities).   What should the parents do to deal with this situation effectively? "
805,What do I do with my husband?,"I dont know how to say this but, well, I dont even know if I am asking this on the right website but, I am Jessica and I am 27 years old, and i got a son, Carl. He is only 6 years old and he is very innocent, but his father is teaching him how to use a gun! I dont even know how my husband has that gun but i love Carl and i cant let he know those things!! Well, my husband is aggressive, he already punched me and throwed me on the wall. Of course I ''fought'' back but he is too strong. He has been using drugs lately, that is an absurd! I try to protect my child but hell, I even went to the police to make an occurrence but they said they would do something about it but they DIDNT!!! Im desesperated please I love my son so much and i have this growing hatred in me that wants to kill my husband but I still love him! What should I do?? "
806,Should I try and prevent my child from becoming like me (in some aspects)?,"As an adult I realize I am not perfect. I have my ""glitches"". One of them is that I am too shy and an introvert to people that I do not know well (somewhat extrovert to friends and family). Would I not want to be too shy? Yes. I think that in some situations I could have acted in a better way and maybe had more friends (although the ones I have are really close) or felt less awkward in unknown places with unknown people.   To put it in different words, if I ever had the chance to go back in my life and try to change something in my behavior, shyness would be the first thing to change.  My 4.5 year old daughter is shy and a bit of a an introvert. And my question is, having realized that I would like to be less shy and less introvert, Should I try to talk my daughter into that direction? Will I succeed? "
807,What are the advantages and disadvantages of BLW (Baby-led-weaning) aka the Rapley method?,"Lately I've been hearing some of my friends talking about the Rapley method of introducing solid food to your child, skipping the ""mashed food"" phase almost completely. They claim mashed food is unnatural and most of it nowadays is marketing anyway, to get us to buy prepared bottles and food processors.  What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Rapley Method? Will a child have enough food and variation by eating directly solids?   New link: [website]"
808,How to help a tomboy not dread puberty,"She's ten and mostly plays with the boys, fitting in well due to her easy-going nature, outstanding athleticism, strong sense of fair play, and wild and crazy sense of humor.  She's super competitive, one of the leaders of the pack in terms of ability, while still stopping to help the kids who need rules/strategies explained.  The problem is, from her point of view there's nothing on the other side of puberty to look forward to. The boys will be getting stronger; she will be getting breasts.  Not fair!  She's miserable about this and it hasn't even started yet.  EDIT:  Since a large part of the community are also members of sites like StackOverflow, I’ll try translating this question to, say, mathematics.  Say you are ten and you are good at math.  You and your good friends all go to math camp, have started learning various programming languages, have Raspberry Pi on your Christmas list.  You in particular sometimes help the non-math kids with their math homework. You’re very compettive and love to compete in Math Olympiad, and if your score isn’t always the highest for your grade, you’re generally in the top three.  Recently you found out that over the next four years, most of your friends’ math intelligence is going to get a four-fold boost.  Even some of the kids you help with math will get this boost.  You, on the other hand, will get a two-fold boost. Period.  Plus, you are going to have a French accent whenever you talk about math.  Not an ugly French acent – it will be pleasant, but it will be very, very noticeable.  So, how comforted would you be if someone said to you, “That’s okay, you don’t have to be any less mathematical, just because everyone else is going to be better!  It’s not only about being the best.  While other kids are doing calculus or even multivariable calculus in a few  years, you can still have fun with trigonometry!  Or, why don’t you learn to cook?  You get to use math to measure things in cooking, right? Besides, don’t a lot of cooks have a French accent?”  Yes, this is over-simplified.  My daughter is more than just a jock (another “label” for you).  She’s one of the top math students in her grade and one of the best creative writers… and she’s the class cut-up (even the teacher laughs... sometimes especially the teacher).  She's kind.  She likes to draw manga; she single-handedly bakes a mean apple pie (crust ""from scratch,"" of course); and she’s currently trying to memorize the periodic table of elements  (don’t ask me why).  She has some girl friends, not all of them into sports.  But she won’t wear dresses, and she finds makeup and what she calls “fashion lady stuff” ludicrous.  She generally prefers the straightforward friendship of boys to the drama of girl friendships. And sports are her favorite thing.  It’s not that she won’t live through puberty, but I'm hoping to find something positive for her on the other side of it, so that she won’t be so depressed about it.  She’s already watched a half dozen of the boys get better than her in soccer;  it will probably happen in baseball in another year or two. "
809,How to deal with children when parents are caught in the act?,"A near relative discussed this issue with me. They have 2 sons and 2 daughters and everyone sleeps in the same room. They cannot afford as of now to live in a large apartment with separate room for kids.  So, it seems that one night after the kids slept, the parents were doing the special cuddling, to put it neatly. After the act, they came to knew that one of their son who is 6 years old was awake and pretending to be asleep.  He was pretending because of strict rules of bedtime and the kid had to get up early the next day for school.  The parents are concerned that they did a mistake and should have thoroughly checked if everyone was asleep. This is the first time it happened to them and they are clueless.  The mother told the child the next day that she was applying some sort of balm to the father as he had some pain and asked the child if he was awake. The child told that he didn't see anything as it was dark but heard 'noises' and then 'smiled'.  How to deal with children in such situations and what could be the psychological impact on them? Is it too early for them to understand about intimacy? What if they get more curious and want to experiment?  "
810,Can I insist my daughter to be non beliver in religions?,"My daughter is 11 months old. Even though I am from conservative family, I am a non believer in any religions. But my wife believe in god. And she use to go church regularly. Now a days She is taking my 11 months old baby to church. And now she is starting to kiss god's photos and all. But I dont like this to happen. I would like my daughter to believe in herself and science.   What should I do? Can I insist them to come in my way or I should keep calm? What is the best way? "
811,I'm not happy about the new seating order in my class,"I am 13 and my place in the classroom was changed today because I was talking in the class. But the teacher made me sit next to a girl. While she was thinking about change of seat, she was muttering ""hmm, I need a concentrating student to sit next to him...""   When she asked to move, she said to the girl, ""Don't worry, your friends are still here around you"". She also changed the seat of my best friend and made him sit with a girl behind me so that I can feel okay, but I don't want to sit next to a girl. Only two of us are sitting with a girl in the WHOLE class!   She is just very boring but she scores good marks. Other children ask me to enjoy it as she is the sexiest girl in the class.  Please tell me what to do now? Everyone and every teacher is now thinking that she is my GIRLFRIEND. (All teachers know that I am not interested in sex and love but now they are thinking negative.)   My mom teaches in the same school, and my sister is also one class below mine. Should I tell the matter to my mom? I am afraid to tell her as our WHOLE FAMILY does not think about this sex and love and girls! "

813,"How to help my 4-year-old son, who pretends play to be a girl with long hair, develop a stronger identity?","I have a 4-year-old son, who is a high functioning autistic child. Since age 3 he began wearing his jacket over his head pretending it was his long hair.   Recently, my Mom gave him a Halloween wig to play with and he loves it. He likes to look himself in the mirror with the long hair. But recently, my Mom asked him who was that in the mirror and he responded it was a girl. He mostly has girls as friends, at school female teachers and there aren't many boys around to play with. At school he is often rejected by other boys due to his special needs, although he doesn't seem to be aware of that. There aren't many male figures in my son's life.   Could my son be confused since he hardly has activities with males? What things can we do to help him develop a stronger identity?  "
814,What is normal for 4.5 month old sleep patterns?,"My son was doing really well up through 3months with sleeping. We would put him down at 8 and he would not wake up until 3am for his first feeding, then 6am for second and then be up for the day around 8am.  Each feeding he'd go right back to bed.  When our pediatrician told us at our 3month visit to start training him to self soothe and fall asleep on his own, things have changed and I want to know if it's normal or not.   Here are my questions:   Is it normal that at 4.5 months, his naps are still only 30 minutes long? Sometimes he wakes up happy, other times crying. We wait 10 minutes when he wakes but he won't fall back asleep. His wake time is only 1.5 hours between naps.  He still takes 4-5 naps a day and I'm concerned that these short naps are what's causing the frequent nightwakings (see question 2). are these short naps normal and will they naturally consolidate and become longer? He knows how to self soothe back to sleep because he does it on his own for naps and bedtime. Even when he stirs in the middle of the night after a short period of time, he's usually able to go back on his own. The question is, he now wakes up every 2 hours and since we have the baby monitor near us, we also wake up every 2 hours and lay there listening to him fuss!  We moved his bedtime up to 730 in hopes that it would solve the issue but even then he's still waking every two hours! Is this normal? We do not have to go in to get him to sleep usually (except every now and again in rare instances) so I think we've successfully trained him to self soothe but is it normal that he wakes up so often?   Please tell me that this will end? Is it the 4 month sleep regression and if so when does it end? Thank you! "
815,Why do parents refer to themselves in the third person?,"Can anyone explain to me the reason why parents tend to refer to themselves in the third person, when talking to their young children?   E.g.:  ""Hold Daddy's hand while we cross the road""  as opposed to   ""Hold my hand while we cross the road""  Is there any real benefit in this? "
816,I don't want to be a father,"I feel awful about this, but I can't keep my silence about it anymore.  I'm a 25 year old man. I am a piano teacher and have a lot of entrepreneurial/artistic dreams and goals.  I met a girl about two years ago, in the spring of 2013. We began dating seriously and I moved in with her in the June/July of 2013. Before this I had been living with my parents.  Beginning that winter, of 2013/2014, I began to lose interest in the relationship. I didn't find her mentally stimulating anymore, and I had been introduced to the concept of polyamory when I read a book on the subject. It was world changing. I had been unknowingly searching for that philosophy for years, and I so completely identified with it that I couldn't believe I had been living any other way.  However, I've always had a weakness with feelings of irrational guilt and obligation, and it's always been pretty easy for people to sway me to do what they want if they have those things on their side, and in this situation I felt extremely guilty and obligated to her. I didn't want to be with her anymore for a variety of reasons, but I felt awful and didn't break up with her like I should have. I also felt financially afraid to strike out truly on my own. I had been living with my parents before this. I also felt like I would be abandoning her to financially rely on her (awful) family. Lots of guilt.  I didn't do anything about it at all for literally months as I waffled about what to do, and eventually told her about the polyamory. She is pretty much the definition of a completely monogamous person, so she was completely horrified by the idea and not open to it at all. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, since I ultimately didn't want any relationship with her, polyamorous or otherwise.  We sometimes argued about the polyamory, but I continued to not act on it and not break up with her, feeling paralyzed by my various feelings. Time passed, and finally, this last September of 2014, I tried to break up with her. It was a huge ordeal, and despite the fact that I don't want a relationship with her and don't really like her, I'm still in love with and attached to her. It was very difficult for both of us, but in the end, her frightening statements about attempting suicide if I left (she's attempted before in her life, before I met her) were what ultimately kept me there. I also of course felt afraid and in emotional pain and guilty, etc etc.  About a month after this whole ordeal, we found out she was pregnant. She had been using birth control pills our entire relationship, and I really don't know what on earth happened. It ultimately doesn't matter.  She is completely anti-abortion, and she desperately wanted to keep the baby. Again, in the flurry of guilt and obligation I agreed to marry her (she had been hinting and pushing since at least the 6 month mark), and we got married in November of 2014.  She's now 7 months pregnant with a boy. Our relationship continued as normal (you know, considering the circumstances) and on the surface appears strong.  I however have never been more miserably unhappy. I was deeply unhappy even before the pregnancy, but now I'm basically a zombie. I trudge through my daily life, and have that intense feeling of heaviness and tightness in my chest, all of the time. I never really wanted to be a father. I always have placed more personal importance on projects and accomplishments and friendships than romance. I want to be important and powerful and change the world. I can't imagine a more miserable life than to be a monogamous family man. I realize that some people achieve great happiness with that life, but I simply don't feel that's who I am. My now wife has always been lovingly but overbearingly suffocating, and my ambitions and other friendships have all completely stagnated in the two years I've been with her. I hate the lack of freedom, I hate the sense that all my time is spoken for, I hate every second of my life. I want out intensely.  I don't know what to do. I'm so completely lost. Would my son be better off with a father who doesn't want to be around but is putting on a smiling face, or a father who was divorced early on? How do I handle my situation? What's the right thing to do? Am I defective? Am I a bad person? "
817,"When my 5-year-old is throwing a tantrum, should I leave her alone or stay?","My 5-year-old daughter is generally a pleasant and balanced girl, but sometimes she will get really, really mad and throw a major tantrum. This usually happens when something does not go her way (even something trivial) while she is tired or otherwise in a bad mood. Sometimes it is because I refuse to give her something (such as watching a video when it's already bedtime), sometimes something else which annoys her (such as bad weather or a friend who cannot come to play).  Then she will sit down somewhere, or even lie on the ground, be angry, cry without pause and generally look quite miserable. She will not accept being touched, held, comforted or sometimes even being spoken to. This can go on for over twenty minutes before she calms down.  I am still a bit unsure how to best handle this. I don't want to punish her for the tantrum, as I think she does it because she cannot (yet) control her emotions. At the same time, I do want it to stop, both for my sanity and for hers.  In particular, I tried leaving her alone and going to a different room, so she can cool off. However, it seems to me the tantrums take even longer then. On the other hand, she refuses to interact with me even if I am there, and it feels silly to sit there, watch and do nothing.  Should I stay and wait for the tantrum to go away? Should I leave her alone? Sometimes when I tell her I will go away, she objects, sometimes she does not react at all. "
818,What to do when an 8-year-old is not motivated by rewards?,"When I want to get something done by my 8-year-old, I offer rewards for that activity, but still the rewards don't motivate him to do that task. The rewards are something that he loves the most, for example iPad time or the candies he loves.  Some of the tasks I ask him to do are like cleaning up his toys, reading the book he does not like etc.  What are the other ways I can get him motivated to get the task done? Is this the common behavior? "
819,Stomach damage/sickness long after pregnancy?,"My wife had quite a tough time during pregnancy. She had morning sickness all the way through, vomiting regularly, although not enough to put her in hospital or require treatment. She also had severe heartburn. As the baby was breach with the cord around her neck, she had an elective caesarian.  They both seem to be in good health now, except that my wife is especially prone to stomach bugs/food poisoning.  The first time this happened was 6-8 months after birth. My wife came down with a norovirus-like bug, lasting a day or two, recovered, then came down with something similar 2 weeks later, and again a week after that. My daughter was fine and I was only sick for one day. The local hospital did an abdominal ultrasound, but found nothing unusual.  Now, a year later she's had another bout and still feels a bit nauseous ten days later. I'm fine, despite being in close proximity and eating the same things.  Obviously we're not looking for medical advice, but I'm wondering whether she might have been made more susceptible to this kind of thing as a result of pregnancy or the caesarian operation? Has anyone heard of that? "
820,7yo step-son runs away when he thinks he's in trouble,"The child in this case is 7 years old. Just as an example; maybe he breaks his own toy, clearly by accident, but right after I asked him not to do whatever caused the breaking.  I would like to calmly tell him that's why I asked him to stop, and to pick up the toy. I figure the breaking of his own stuff would be a punishment in itself.  Instead, he runs - thinking he's in trouble. If I follow, to explain I'm not mad or anything, he gets more ""desperate"" to get away from me and ignore anything I say. So I don't chase him.  But, rather than this example, say he does something he knows is wrong but also warrants a consequence such as time-out or taking away a privilege like game-time. He runs, and I'm not sure what to do.  I could chase him down, I did once - but during the explanation of what happened and why he is being punished he just looked angry, like he was ignoring everything and internally blaming someone or something else. I don't think anything got through that running doesn't help but rather hurts his situation.  I tried waiting until he has calmed down but he just attempts to avoid me for prolonged periods of time - eventually I go to him and again, it seems like he is making excuses to himself and blaming others, seemingly me, though he doesn't voice it - I'm just going by the anger he shows towards me when he's in trouble.  He is my step-son, I have started having a larger impact on his life about half a year ago. I don't ever discipline him in a physical manner, and neither does his mother. I'm not sure where the running comes from. I also usually let his mother do any disciplining, it just seems more effective. I personally have only had to do it less than a handful of times.  What is the correct way to handle this, both for the case where he's not really in trouble and the one where he is? Should I let him calm down or give chase for immediate consequences of his actions? Is he actually hearing me, or do I need to use a different strategy to reach him? "
821,How to make sure my dog and daughter have a safe relationship,"Puppies do a lot of ""mouthing"" including, often, on their owners and care-givers if allowed, and when they get excited they jump up on kids a lot.  for anyone around 5 or younger, this is probably quite intimidating even from relatively small dogs.  I want to be sure my child and the children I care for are safe from being bitten by an over-excited puppy and/or knocked over.  I also want to be sure the dog is fairly safe from pulled hair, ears and tail, poked eyes and other unpleasant things for the dog.  What are some rules and procedures I can instill to be sure to keep everyone ""safe?"" or at least, ""safer?"" "
822,How to reverse a new born's sleeping schedule?,   Possible Duplicate:   How can we get our newborn to sleep at night as soundly as he does in the day?       My wife and I had our first child three nights ago. The last two days she has been sleeping all day and up for a good chunk of the night.

823,How can I get involved in the parenting of my girlfriend's sister's 5-year-old who spends too much time on screens etc.?,"I am a 30ish years old man, living at my girlfriend's parents place for 4 months. It's been 2 months already, 2 more to go. I don't have kids (yet, but want to). With us is my girlfriend's sister and her 5-year-old daughter.   She is a single mom, not working and taking care 24/7 of her child. She is vegan, and so is her girl. She is breastfeeding. She is using non violent communication with her child, and has that education principle where she is letting her do whatever she wants, whenever she wants, with as little restraints as possible. So, no schooling at all (where we live there is nothing mandatory until the child is 6), it is all driven by her child's wishes. There are no limits apart from the limits of physics, and finances, because the mother doesn't have lots of money. Basically the mother considers her child like an adult making her own choices, capable of knowing what's best for her.  This includes:   Eating what she wants when she wants. Spending all day long, all night long on a smartphone or computer, either playing games or watching videos (of people playing games, mostly). Going to sleep between 3 and 8 in the morning, depending on the days, then waking up in the early afternoon. Crying and yelling until she gets what she wants. Throwing things at people, hitting people (mostly her mother) when she is angry (she gets angry very easily). Ordering people (mostly her mother) to do things. For example, her mother needs to ask for permission to go pee. The child has no regular friends, they go out sometimes and she can play with other kids, maybe once or twice a week, nothing regular.   I am very worried about the child:   She looks like a video-game addict. I know because I've been there when I was 18-20, and with her character it's hard to cope with. For example, when she loses at a game, she starts crying/yelling (she is not throwing the phone away anymore since the time she broke it, yay) loudly, only getting calmed down when she's at her mother's breast. Also I've read a lot about screens being bad for kids and she spends easily 2/3 of her awake time on them! The sleeping hours! The education. The principle looks nice, learning things you're interested in, but in this case I feel it is only creating an addict with a horrible character, and I don't see how she's going to learn anything like this. The social skills. Her only friend is her mother, and she is also her slave. She also looks very skinny, compared to all other children that age I know. She eats mostly rice and fruits/veggies, and her mother's milk.   The grandparents are worried as well but they support their daughter's decision of choosing this type of education, and they are quite passive with the child.  Here is what I have tried to do until now:   Speak to the mother. I told her how concerned I was about her child, especially the sleeping hours and the screen-addict thing. She seems concerned too, but I didn't see any changes since I spoke with her. She thinks the freedom of her child is more important than anything else. I also insisted that the mother should express her needs more to make the child understand that other people have needs too. With respect to the education principles (using NVC, etc), I try to make the child think about consequences, about putting herself in other's shoes. Like, when we were on the beach and she threw sand at my girlfriend's face, asking (the calmest I could) why she did it and if she would like someone to throw sand at her face. Same when she forbids her mother to do things. Or asking why she continues playing games if it makes her cry so often. But I have very few interactions with the child so I don't think it's making much of a difference.   Being not related to the child, how can you have an impact on a child's education? What can you do concretely in this kind of situation through interaction with the child? "
824,How much time is too much time playing educational computer games?,"I recently bought an iPad primarily for my 3-year-old daughter. I put nothing on it but educational apps and children's books. No YouTube, no Internet, no (non-educational) games. I've decided to let her use it as much as she wants, for now, and see how it goes. That was a few weeks ago.  So far she's been using the iPad maybe 2 to 5 hours each day. She still enjoys other activities -- playing outside, playing with dolls and blocks, interacting with friends, being read to, etc. And I think she might be learning a thing or two from the apps. Still, several hours a day seems like a lot. How do I know if it's too much?  I've searched the web, and there's lots of info on limiting TV time and video games, but I can't find any recommendations on limiting use if it's only educational games.  Relevant: Should I let my 3 year old play educational games on my iPhone? "
825,How can I make my kids passionate in science while being religious?,"Please be considerate in your answers.   We are an observant jewish family, although I was educated in secular institutions. I feel that I have a wealth of knowledge that I want to pass to my kids that I don't see they'll ever get in a religious school.  More specifically: My kids are currently toddlers, and their DVDs and books abound in creationist explanations and absolutely no science. I grew up with science and I want them to learn it from an early age. My wife wasn't taught science at school either and would need a serious paradigm shift to understand evolution. I try to avoid the issue.  I still want my kids to learn our values, have faith (which means for us to take life in a mature way and with patience), be part of our warm community and stay away of the lousy mainstream. -I don't mean to offend anybody-. I don't want them to be confused or overwhelmed either. I believe in evolution myself and think the creation story is figurative.  What's the proper way to handle this? How can I make my kids passionate in science and technology while spiritual and connected to Judaism?  I respect this forum and I hope I wrote in the right place and in the proper manner. "
826,Basic guidelines for supporting psychological health of a sick 3-year-old?,"My 3-year-old son has become ill over the last few days - his white blood cell count is low and the diagnosis is immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).   The prognosis is good - he should get better in a few weeks or months. He also feels good, but now we have to restrict his activities - no bicycle, no somersaults, no climbing, etc. At the same time, we have been seeing doctors, getting blood drawn, and discussing the topic as we learn about it. I would like to minimize psychological harm as a side effect - and, if possible, squeeze some positive educational opportunity out of it.  Considering the circumstances, he has been handling it very well. But he is starting to get worried - when we tell him he can't jump around he takes it very seriously.  How can we minimize negative psychological consequences of this situation? What should and should we not say to him? Maybe we should not discuss it at all in front of him? How should we discuss it?   This is making me realize the limits of my knowledge and abilities as a parent. For example, tomorrow we drive 2.5 hrs to see a doctor. To what degree should we avoid the topic? Should we go so far as to pretend that we are going to a park or museum with a quick stop at a doctor's office on the way? "
827,How to help my 8-year-old son who is not potty trained whatsoever?,"My 8-year-old son has regressed in his potty training. He was fully potty trained when he was 4 or 5, then slowly stopped. Now he won't use the bathroom at all.   He's in second grade and has to wear diapers to school. Even kids making fun of him at school didn't push him to try to potty train again. We have seen doctors, specialists and a therapist. Nothing has helped.   The only thing the specialist did was put him in hospital and clean his intestines of all poop by doing a complete flush out of his system. The doctors just said he was being lazy and they couldn't find anything wrong in x-rays either. We even had him tested for autism and ADHD, but he doesn't have anything.  My son says he can't help it, but the doctors keep telling me that nothing was wrong with him. Punishment doesn't work. Reward charts and bribery don't do anything.  I'm going crazy. I just want him out of diapers already. He's going into 3rd grade soon. Is he ever going to be out of diapers? Is there a reason why he does it?  Another thing that the doctors ignore is how many times a day he poops and the fact his poop looks like baby poop. It doesn't come out as turds or logs. "
828,Is it safe to breastfeed through pregnancy?,"I have heard 2 arguments against breastfeeding while pregnant, that it causes contractions that can lead to premature labor, and that it can be difficult on the mother to support a developing baby, make milk for another baby, and have enough nutrition for her own body.  My OB, and another that I've talked to, have both initially said that it was dangerous due to the possibility of early labor.  Dr. Google seems to give a different answer, that the body is designed with safeguards that prevent nursing causing early labor in a healthy pregnancy.  Both doctors have said they will look at the current reasearch and get back to me.  Neither has done so.  Does anyone here know of any studies proving the harm or lack of harm in breast feeding while pregnant in a healthy pregnancy?  Does anyone know of a trustworthy, unbiased organization that has taken a position either way, especially in recent years? "
829,Pacifism vs. Standing up for yourself,"My girlfriend has a 7-year-old who, when angered, sometimes expresses his anger in a physical manner such as hitting. We are explaining its not okay to hit; that he needs to use his words to express himself. He's coming a long way from where he was.  I've recently had a dream which brought an issue with our method to my attention.  The dream involves him being bullied and I tell the bullies off, only to have the bully's mother confront me in anger, even starting to swing at me. At this point I woke up, because I didn't know how I should respond.  My first instinct was to demonstrate pacifism. I do believe that not fighting back completely defeats fighting in anger. However, it occurred to me that in the case of bullies like in the dream, I would want him to stand up for himself, not let people walk all over him.  Are we sending the wrong message? Should we explain that it is okay to defend yourself, but no more than that - or does that just go without saying? How would you demonstrate how to handle an attacker who may or may not be calmed by pacifist means? "

831,Is there any problem with same-sex siblings sharing a bedroom when there is an 8 year age gap?,"I am a 20 year old female living at home with my mother, her boyfriend and my younger sister who is 12 years old. We live in a 3 bed council house. My mother has now discovered that she is pregnant with a baby boy and is now saying that me and my younger sister are going to have to share a bedroom. My sister and I do not get along at all. Also, I see it as wrong: in my eyes I am an adult and she is a child and we shouldn't be sharing a room.   Will being forced to share a room make our relationship worse?  Are there any strategies to help my sister and I share space without being at each others' throats the whole time? "
832,How to help a 1-year-old sleep for longer than 1.5 to 2 hours at a time when we only have one bedroom?,"My 1-year-old son is only sleeping for 1.5 - 2 hours at a time. He is breastfed and we co-sleep.    I have seen similar posts on here and they recommended gentle sleep training and I have come to the conclusion that it is what I need to try, but I live in a one bedroom and don't have a space for him to get used to his own room and space. I have a pretty large room and I'm open to trying to set up his space in it and maybe add a curtain to give the feel of a separate space.   Also from what I have read having a consistant pre sleep routine and and bedtime is important but my husband works late most days and I don't think I can get that routine down.    Is there anyone in a similar situation who has had success? Any tips? "
833,Explaining the concept of underwear to our toddler,"Our 21 month old toddler will use the potty when we leave her bottom bare - she has been successfully doing this for a month. Tired of cleaning stinky diapers, we leave her bottom bare when she is home.   She doesn't particularly enjoy wearing diapers, and when we put one on her, she doesn't take the initiative to tell us that she has to use the potty. However, when we have company over, we put a diaper on her.  We are trying to transition her into wearing panties; however, she is very opposed to them. She equates them with pants and doesn't want to wear them. While she is fully capable of dressing herself in pants, she hasn't mastered taking her pants off yet.   How do you introduce underwear to your child? When do people normally introduce underwear to their child? How do I explain the concept of having to take her panties off before using the potty?  We in no way want to discourage her use of the potty, as she seems to really enjoy pooing/peeing outside (she claps for herself whenever she uses the potty). But if she is interested in potty training herself, I do want to show her the concept of an underwear. "
834,What do I do to get my daughter interested in presenting her science experiments at the science competition(fair)?,"In my state we get the primary school aged kids (8-12) to enter a State Science competition. (In other states and countries - the equivalent may be a school science fair.)  My daughter (9) has some interests in science. She has:   tried lots of different slime recipes to get the best results built a pair of unicorn slippers with lights programmable by Arduino for dancing in.    When I ask her about entering these in the competition - she goes quiet and mumbles. She hints that the teacher that runs the competition puts her off.   When I asked her last year about bringing in science experiments to her teacher (whom she loved) she was reluctant. (She would take in the lego compressed air steam engine, but not the slime experiments).   My mother's feeling about the situation is that my daughter feels that teachers take all the fun out of a perfectly good thing to play with and talk to your friends about.   My question is: What do I do to get my daughter interested in presenting her science experiments at the science competition (fair)?  EDIT: Why put an entry in a science competition? A couple of reasons:  (1) because she has pushed beyond what looked easy before (voluntary State Maths and English competitions) and done much better than she thought. (Not to say that underperforming grows you because you learn how to do better and how to be a good sport in that situation)  (2) because this is a way to get recognition for what she is already interested in  (3) because science competitions are a factor in private school scholarships   (4) because science is amazing. Since the enlightenment we have questioned and measured our world and this has lead to longer and more comfortable, and more enjoyable lives.   Note: I need to put this up due to the rules of this site. I’m fine with answers that disagree with the premise of this question. "
835,How to handle my 9-year-old's uncontrollable raging fits?,"We have four kids: a 9-year-old boy, a 6-year-old girl, a 4-year-old boy and a 20-month-old girl.   The 9-year-old boy is in general a delightful, well-behaved, kind and considerate boy. Sometimes he becomes so overwhelmed by his emotions that he spirals out of control and becomes inconsolable.    It sometimes begins with some kind of mild but disrespectful remark which my partner or I let him know is not tolerated.  This often escalates immediately into him being flung into a rage complete with stomping, etc. In other cases the raging fit is triggered by one of his siblings pestering him.    In either case we normally send him to his room until the rage turns into crying.  That usually signals that he has become consolable. Because it seems so obvious to us that he is having feelings that are just beyond his capacity to handle we try to let him know he's not in trouble it's just that the rest of us aren't going to be around the raging fit.  This happens a couple of times per week, and has been for some years. His teachers do not report this behavior at school.  His report cards and conferences indicate positive behavior.  Can I stop this and should I? How do I get to the bottom of it? Should I do something differently? Does anyone have a magical spell that will fix this?       "
836,Son not wanting to talk to his father,"My son is almost 9 years old. I've had sole custody of him since he was 2. I have given his father chance after chance to be in his life, and everytime he has hurt my son. He is in and out of jail and on and off drugs my son's entire life.   Now he is out of jail and living in a sober living house and now he wants to call my son. He has not tried to contact him for the past year. I talked to my son and told him his dad would like to talk to him, and he got upset and doesn't want anything to do with talking to his dad.   What should I do? I don't know if I should make him talk to his dad or just leave the whole topic alone and keep living our lives? Any advice? "
837,How to help a 6-month-old who won't soothe in the crib?,"TL;DR Version  How do people get a 6-month-old to soothe without picking them up? Has this actually ever worked for anyone? We are on baby #2 and it seems like a myth?  Long Form Version  We are on baby #2 and have hit an issue that I feel like is reasonably common: the kid can almost never soothe himself to sleep in a crib, regardless of how drowsy he is. He's breastfed, no co-sleeping, consistent night time routine (feed, wash, quick-book+dim lights, crib, music, white noise+dark).  Unfortunately, he's a negative sleep trajectory. After being relatively normal to about 4 months (naps ~45-1.5h, night: 3h then 1.5h after), he had a sleep regression and blew up his naps to 45m and first night cycle to 1.5h+a mix of 45m. He returned to the original better night sleep for almost a week (3h+1.5h blocks). He is now on 45m blocks... for all naps and in the night. For those in the back row, that means 10-15 wake ups each night, depending on how quickly he soothes back down. Even tag-teaming, this is a WW1 style trench warfare existence.  His typical pattern is to wake up not immediately startled/crying but with an escalating grunting and barking vocalization that eventually turns into uncontrollable crying if you wait long enough (5-10 minutes). We're taking a full court press on this issue to knock out possible physical causes (e.g., reflux meds, cutting out dairy, tried some tylenol at times where physical discomfort seemed possible). Related to this is an issue: the kid just can't be comforted without picking him up and holding/bouncing him (depending on where in his waking cycle you catch him).  Spread across hundreds of pieces of literature is this concept of ""Oh, just put your baby down drowsy but awake! If they get upset, soothe them in place!"" With no apparent backup plan when they are not soothable without holding them. Methods tried so far, with the level of success noted from ""some"" :-\ to ""makes things worse"" :-(    Audio:   Shushing :-\ Singing lullabies :-(  Physical Pressure:   Patting :-( ""Holding"" with hands on sides but without lifting out of the crib :-\  Motion:   Vibrating hands gently on the sides :-( ""Rocking"" by bouncing baby gently in place without removing from crib :-\  Sucking:   Finger :-\ Baby hand :-\ Pacifier N/A (couldn't keep it in well enough, preferred his hand)  (Feeding): We haven't fiddled with this much, but the kid is chunky and eats great. Only about ~2 wake ups seem to have much hunger cues, and we just feed him then. Props (haven't tried much on this):   Stuffed animal N/A (haven't tried much due to choking/smothering risk) Tube socks filled w/ warm rice/grain N/A (considered, but he is in a Merlin suit so unclear if it would give much pressure/comfort)    We have found only a handful of wins where the baby falls back asleep through some combination of these methods. Ones with mixed results typically cause some temporary soothing, but the baby staying up so long they are no longer tired and then there's a 40 minute waking cycle or otherwise need serious bouncing/nursing to settle. Given that it has only worked maybe 3 times ever, the ""critical failure rate"" is about 5-10 times more likely than the success rate.   Worse, the successes don't mean the baby sleeps any longer. We recently had our first ""put baby down in crib, leave room, it falls asleep."" They then woke up 40 minutes later, and every 40 minutes thereafter until 4 AM (where a 1.5h double-cycle happened by pure luck).  Breaking down this question into actionable bits:   Additional Methods: Anybody has soothing methods not on the above list? Baby-Gone-Good Stories: Is there anybody who had a baby that consistently escalated in a crib, but then got better at it (in the 6 month area)? Wins?: Was it even useful to help a baby soothe with less intervention? This seems to be a common wisdom, yet are not seeing that less assistance in sleeping results in the baby stringing more cycles together.  "
838,When the length of a commute can be recognized as not acceptable for a kindergartner?,"I have learned of kids with crazy long commutes in their school bus for public schools. I'm surprised of having such longs commutes (1 hour) for a 4-to-5 year old starting kindergarten.  I understand that sometimes a long commute might be the only option to get a child to school, but I think that a long commute, along with an early starting time, could be counterproductive in the academic performance of kids, and much worse in kindergartners, who might be having their first school experience ever.  In the state of Massachusetts (USA) a child can only be on the bus for an hour, but authorities can decide than an even longer bus ride is OK if needed.  I guess that that is the rule for all children, but obviously is going to affect some more than others.  Is there any research or documentation about when the length of a commute can be recognized as not acceptable for a kindergartner? (in the sense of, ""longer than this is counterproductive for the child to have a productive school day and can cause mood issues, attention or performance problems or the like, and should be avoided if possible"").     While it may not directly answer the question I would really appreciate additional information (via comment maybe) about similar regulations in different States (do all states thin that one hour is the longest a child should be on the bus?), or even different parts of the world. That could help comparing specific rules and understand what is adequate for a kindergartner (4 to 5 years) and what is not. "
839,How can I get my strong-willed daughter to stop being so lazy when it comes to chores?,"I have two daughters, age 8 and 10.  My 10 year old is very diligent and responsible and has always done her homework, chores, etc. without any reminders or coaxing.  So we have had a hard time adapting to our 8 yo daughter, who needs to be dragged/coaxed through every step of even the simplest and quickest of chores (clean the cat litter, put your dishes away, bring down your laundry, whatever).    She is very stubborn (very close to being diagnosed Oppositional defiant disorder) and efforts to impose consequences (taking TV/computer time away, canceling playdates or dessert, etc) generally result in huge tantrums and dragging out the process for far longer than reasonable.  We almost never give in and let her off the hook, unless there are serious time/safety constraints involved -- which is rare since we have evolved to anticipate this behavior.  We've also tried incentives in terms of allowance schemes, earning TV/computer time, etc, which seems to have zero effect on her motivation.  The flip side of this stubbornness is that she is really diligent for any task she's bought into on her own - she will get her homework done immediately after school, works hard in sports, will feed the pets in a heartbeat, loves gardening work, etc.  I want to make it clear that other than this one issue, this daughter is a delight in almost every way who makes us proud every day (poetry?) -- I'm not calling her ""lazy"" to be demeaning, she just is actually lazy in this one area.  Ideas? "
840,How to discern whether a 3-year-old's repetitive hand movements are normal or not?,"My 3-year-old son has a habit of holding his two hands tightly closed near his mouth and biting teeth so as to show he's excited. He performs this action only when he plays with toys. It comes naturally from him. Even though I hold his hand, he shows his excitement by biting teeth for one or two seconds.   He is also having delay in speech. OT therapist told me that he is completely normal and just expresses his happiness. He responds to his name and is normal in school and church.   Is there any difference between normal repetitive behaviour and autism? And how to reduce it? "
841,Choosing a Doctor,"How does a parent go about choosing a specialist doctor?  Yes I have the pediatricians recommendations.  However, usually I would also ask friends, however the specialist I need to see is not a popular one so I am not sure how to trust the person I see.  Is the internet a good source of information about Doctors?  Where else can I get Doctor evaluations?  As well, on a similar note, how do I evaluate the advice of a doctor?  Must I seek a second opinion or is research on the internet enough? "
842,Don't touch my hair!,"I have little twins that aren't two years old. One of them I have no problem washing his hair; he even laughts when I dry it with the towel. His brother screams his lungs out every single day, every time I start washing his hair. And when the bath is over, drying the wet hair is another ...quest (he fights!).  Doing the same thing for both, I don't know what I might be doing wrong, and as far as I recall it's always been a drama (reminds of very first bath at hospital... yeah, always been a drama). Any clues?  They both enjoy the water, they play with their toys in the bath; when it's over I grab the ""easy"" one first and while I put his diaper &amp; PJ's on, the ""screamer"" is all angel-like, picks up the toys, drains them and puts them where they belong, and then he even pulls the plug and calmly waits for his turn... and when I pick him up and the fight for dry hair begins.  What can I possibly do to stop fighting? Not washing the hair is not an option... "
843,Why is my daughter shouting so much?,"My ten months old daughter has been in a little nursery for a couple of months now. There, she has begun to act more wildly. It is something we expected and we like her getting in touch with other infants.  There is a little kid, a bit older than her, who shouts a lot. Long, very acute shouts that are quite unpleasant for everyone's ears.  Our daughter apparently liked those, so now she is shouting quite often. In the beginning I thought she was just playing with her voice, but now it is becoming more frequent and a bit annoying if we are in closed places with other, unrelated people.  I am trying to look at her seriously when she does and I shake my head saying ""no"". She kind of understands it, but after a while she starts over again.  So: is this normal? Is my approach going to work out? Is there anything else I can do? "
844,Feeling inadequate as a parent and role model,"I am a dad to 3 wonderful girls ages 8,4 and 3. I tried to spend time with them after work, playing tag or reading them stories. But when I am done with that, in my down time, I just watch sports or movies or play video games.  Sometimes a little voice in my head tells me that in doing so I am not setting a good role model for my children. It tells me I should be out there volunteering or learning to play the violin or trying to better myself in some other way. So they also will think there is more to life than entertainment. But honestly I am just too lazy to do any of that, and then I have to live with this guilt.  Is that normal? Should I push myself to a better person to set a good example for my kids? Or should I just hope that they accept me as I am but still turn out to be better human beings than their Dad? "
845,My 3 years old doesn't tell me when he needs to use the bathroom,"My son is 3 years old and doesn't tell me when he needs to use the bathroom. It has been 5 months now that I took his diaper off him. I just do not know what I should do.  Should I put a diaper on him again?  I mean, is this normal? Please help. I get frustrated sometimes.  He doesn't want to potty at all! I did train him before but now that he understands, he doesn't want to go to potty. "
846,Sources to help you in teaching your kid your native language,"I am posting this knowing the danger it may be closed. There are many helpful posts on this website covering multilingualism for children, e.g. this one. However, I want to educate myself in-depth on the subject. Hence, my question:      ""What sources or books are there out there to help a parent in   teaching their native language to their kid?""   I have found many links on ""multilingualism and parenting"" on the web, such as this one. Unfortunately, most of the coverage in the suggested books is on the benefits of speaking multiple languages...  My intentions are not academic. I am already sold, I do not need convincing. I want to know ""how"", not ""why"". I need a practitioner's guide. What (paid or unpaid) sources have you found useful?  Any recommendations very welcome. "
847,Should I worry About My 10yo Nephew's Interest in Violence?,"I have a 10yo nephew who is obsessed with violence. It's all he talks about. He asks me and my father things like;     If I had a gun and you had a knife, could you kill me?      If I start doing weights now, would I be like the hulk?      Where is the best place to shoot someone?   He seems to live in a fantasy world, as me and my father have noticed.  He doesn't seem to have a dark side, he's always playing with my daughters or playing Call of Duty: Black Ops when I see him on the weekends. He watches You Tube a lot.    He is very skinny and I don't think he has a lot of friends in school. He hates school, he hates his teacher. He says she picks on him for no reason. Which could be true as my sister has had personal problems with her and the school. He gets bullied at least a bit. There is one big boy who gets mentioned a lot, they have fought at least twice.  He has never had a father really, I think he looks to my father and me for guidance, but I don't see him that much. When I do see him, maybe once a week, he is really excited to see me and he usually has something violence-related to ask or tell me.  My mother, who sees him a lot more than me, brushes it off with ""It's just a boy thing"". But I'm not sure and I'm worried he is influencing my daughters, one of which is two years younger than him and play-fights with him all the time.  I have talked with my mother about sending him to Karate lessons to give him some discipline and a taste of real-world defense fighting.  Is encouraging the fighting with Karate the right thing to do? Should I be worried about him and possibly my daughters? or is this normal behavior? "
848,How to help a 6-year-old who witnessed a school shooting?,"I am not a parent, but am asking this for a good friend. He has a 6-year-old daughter who was in the attached elementary school during a recent high school shooting. I don't think she saw anyone get killed, but she was in the building when it happened, and saw the aftermath with the other students.  She's very upset and confused, and he doesn't know what to do. She keeps asking ""why"", and he doesn't know how to answer. He's always told her ""school is safe"" and ""school is good for you"", and now he feels like he's lied to her. She doesn't want to go back to school, and he doesn't want to make her.  What should he do? I know everyone's answer will be ""hire a therapist"", but what about in the short-term? And what if he can't afford one? "
849,"My son is being hit by a friend, and we need to discuss the situation with his mom","I have two kids, an 8-year-old son and a 6-year-old daughter--second grade and first grade, respectively. They are both tiny. My son is only 46 pounds.  A child entered my daughter's first-grade class. Let's call the boy Joe. He's big, maybe 60 pounds. He's had behavioral problems his whole life, and his mom chose to homeschool him for kindergarten after he was removed from preschool.   Joe gets overstimulated easily and hits impulsively. He doesn't understand what he's doing is wrong. Dozens of teachers, social workers, and parents have urged the boy's mother to seek professional help, but she refuses. A petition to have Joe removed from the school was quashed in favor of an IEP (Individualized Education Program), which sometimes works.  We are (were) his only friends. As a family, we are compassionate and forgiving. Joe hit my daughter twice, but that was months ago, and she is willing to be his friend (they are in the same class). However, she is extremely sensitive to aggression; we don't even watch Disney movies.  A few weeks ago, Joe hit my son in the park and hurt him pretty bad. My son doesn't want to be friends anymore which I agree with. Joe's mom wants my daughter to still be his friend; he has no others.  The boy's mom asks if Joe and my daughter can have a play date at her house without my son present.  I have not responded to this request. Also, my daughter's birthday is coming up, and my son requests Joe not be invited.  Joe is aggressive towards my son in almost every social setting, but we do better in small play date situations.  My questions:  1) What can I tell the mom about Joe and my daughter having a play date (without me? of course not). My instinct is to say when he gets professional help, we can try again, but that seems too pushy.  2) What is your feeling about my daughter's birthday party? My instinct is to not invite him because it would definitely harm my son's experience.  Edit: 4/20/17  The situation was resolved--mostly. We simply cut off contact. Joe's parents didn't object in any way; they've been through it before. He wasn't invited to my daughters party, but his mom and he briefly crashed to give a card. Joe invited us to his birthday. I dropped by with a card and $10 at the beginning without my kids. Nobody else came.  My son wants to do Scouts. Joe's in Scouts. Perfect. At the introductory meeting, I saw Joe hit 4 kids including my son, and I wasn't even paying attention to him for the most part. I'm going to ask his parents to keep Joe away from my son, or I'm just going to start calling the police. (His dad is one of the scout leaders.)  Update 8/2019  Joe has slowly gotten better with his aggression. However, I had to take a knife away from him at a Cub Scout event (in now the Pack leader). I talked with a classmate of his. I mentioned Joe seems to be hitting kids less. The boy responded, ""Yeah, but he wants to."" Great. Joe and my son actually shared a tent at a Scout campout, and it went fine. It was out of desperation in frigid conditions. (May and October are not safe for consistent weather in the US's Upper Midwest.) We invited Joe to my daughter's 10-yo birthday, but we haven't had any play dates. "
850,Dealing with overprotective parents - is there anything I can do?,"I have been tutoring a child, and over the past months I have come to the conclusion that the parents allow the child to stop when things are getting hard. The child has from my view only little willpower, persistence, and discipline, and instead of dealing with difficult situations and working through them, the attitude is to drop the situation. Also I don't see the child having much self confidence, in terms of ""he doesn't believe in himself"".  I hate to make conclusions like this, especially because I can't say that I see everything that goes on every day, but there have been a large number of incidents and stories that I heard, that lead me to believe this.  I just came across a paragraph in a blog article that describes very well what I see is in the making:     a record number of 20-somethings who are depressed and don’t know why.   These young adults claim they had magical childhoods. Their parents   are their best friends. They never experienced tragedy or anything   more than normal disappointments. Yet for some reason, they’re   unhappy.      ...parents today are too quick to swoop in. We don’t want our children to fall, so instead of letting them experience adversity, we clear the path. We remove obstacles to make their life easy. But adversity is a part of life, and only by facing it can our children build life-coping skills they’ll need down the road.                 “Many parents will go to do anything to protect their kids from even     mild discomfort, anxiety, or disappointment—’anything less than     pleasant’—with the result that when, as adults, they experience the     normal frustrations of life, they think something must be terribly     wrong.” - psychiatrist Dr. Paul Bohn           While I find it great that today’s parents are more invested in their children’s lives than previous generations, our involvement can go overboard. ...Unless we’re mindful of that, it’s easy to handicap them by making their lives too easy.      As my favorite parenting philosophy goes: “Prepare your child for the road, not the road for your child.”   I see this issue manifested in quite a few ways, and I feel there has to be a line drawn somewhere.  My question is:   Is there any way that I could communicate this to the parents? Plant a seed in their head, at least give them perspective, make them think about it?  Or what else would be a good way for me to deal with this and put closure to it, at least so that I stop worrying about the child. I get very passionate about this, and feel many things should be handled differently, but obviously I am not in a place to have much say.  How can I as someone who is not the parent deal with this? "
851,Restless fingers while speaking,"It's very hard for me to have a relaxed talk with my son - 12 years old.  He does not like talking and if he does he is playing with his fingers.  This drives my crazy and it makes me afraid. I tell him friendly to stop it, he does it, and some seconds later his fingers grab the next thing and they play around again.  It is like one brain part is talking with me, and the other brain part is on feeling-adventure.  In general he is well and not ill. Most other areas (friends and school) are like most other boys in his age.  He seems to prefer military dialogues: Command and short reply.  .... but I don't.  It's very hard for him to explain the story of a video he saw. He is not stupid, he knows the story, but telling the overall story in two sentences is very hard for him. And if he tries his fingers and hands start to play and move...  Question: Is there a name for this?  Question: Is there a training to improve the ability to focus 100% on the communication?  And guess what: He likes math and hates languages at school :-)  Please ask if you don't understand something. I am not a native speaker. "
852,My 5-year-old's friend's parent doesn't like my child and I fear it might isolate my child after a while,"When my son was 2 he went through a biting stage which was fairly traumatic for us and I guess for the parents of those he was biting. We worked through it with the daycare and over a period he stopped doing it.  However, one of the children he was biting has also ended up being friends with (they are 5 years old). However, the parent of this child has never liked our child and at that time was trying to get him removed from the childcare. Now, she won't even acknowledge my child when he comes over to her kid to talk, however if another of the group of friends comes over she is very talkative and encouraging to that child.  Also, my boy wasn't invited to this child's birthday but I know another of the group of friends (they are a group of 3) has been. I'm also aware the mother of the other child is actively encouraging and establishing the relationship with the other boy and I can see that it is slowly isolating my boy, i. e. I know they invite each other over to play etc.  Should I encourage my boy to move onto other friends? How can I stop my son from being pushed out even though he won't realize? My boy will be starting school 2 months before this other boy however they are in the same sports team at the moment. There is a possibility I could get my child moved to another team so they aren't together?  To date I have only encouraged and been friendly as I was always of the understanding that you shouldn't force your kids away from friends. However, when it's the parent of the other child who is doing things that will isolate mine I'm not sure what to do. "
853,How should I handle a little boy who likes girls' toys?,"I have a 5-year-old boy who likes to play with girl stuff. He doesn't like to dress up or anything like that, he just loves to dress up the Barbies, and he will even help me with my clothes by telling me which ones he thinks are ugly and so forth. His dad has been absent from his life most of the time, and I guess this has led him to like more girl toys than boys but I don't know --I'm just a scared mom. He also plays with boys' toys and when we go to shopping he always runs to the boys' section and picks up the clothes he likes, and they are always boys' clothes.   The thing is that I took him to his dad's house to spend a week with his dad, and his dad called me and told me about the situation. I told him I already knew it and that for me it was something normal, that he was a child and kids like different things. His dad told me that he ""wasn't raisin a faggot"" and that he should have our son living with him so he can teach him how to be a man. I won't agree to this because he is my only child. I really don't care what my son will be in the future as I will always have him and he will always be my son.  But my question is: Is it normal that he likes girl toys? And does that means that he will be gay? And I am handling the situation right? What can I do to help him out? Please help me. "
854,Should I allow my child's in-and-out father to be a part of his life?,"My son will be 3 years old in a couple of months and his father lives out of state.  He did live here when my son was born but was not there and would not sign the birth certificate.  It took a long time for him to become a part of my son's life and it was all me forcing the situation and then I believe he just liked the attention he got from others.  He has a drinking problem as well.  He moved out of state about 6 months ago and wanted to do the Skype thing (when he wants).  I don't like the in and out father thing and then to be a father when he wants to.  What do I do about this situation?  He is not on the birth certificate, he has no rights and he hasn't seen my son in 6 months and about 5 months on Skype.  My son has a speech delay so he has never been able to talk to me about him, and for the most part he never asks ""dada?"" which he can say. "
855,Does extended looping improve student outcomes in elementary school?,"Motivation  I'm a parent of a preschool-aged child in an urban region of the US. He'll be entering kindergarten in a year or two and we have a number of options for primary schools in the area, offering various programs and curricula (e.g., GATE, Waldorf, Montessori).  Some of these programs follow the practice of looping, where students have the same primary instructor from year to year, potentially for as much as the first nine years of their classroom education. I have no direct experience with looping; when I was in elementary school, I attended what I consider to be a more traditional program, with teachers assigned to particular grade levels and students changing classrooms and teachers each year upon moving up a grade.  Problem  I'm not sure how to evaluate looping as a component of the programs available to my son starting in kindergarten. Kids can have better and worse relationships with their teachers—and so can parents. It seems obvious that looping would provide very different experiences, when the student and teacher are together for many years, based on whether these relationships are particularly good or bad.  The potential benefits of an extended positive relationship seem attractive but I had more than one negative experience with a teacher when I was young, where I felt like I just had to survive and cope with the bad relationship until the year or semester ended and we could both move on. Not having the option to do that, short of changing schools (definitely undesirable), seems alarming to me, especially in the first few years of a kid's education.  Looping is particularly emphasized in the Waldorf approach, where students may stay with the same primary instructor for 6 to 12 years. (From what I've read, the latter extreme seems more common in European than in American Waldorf schools.) There's some quantitative research around the effectiveness of Waldorf methods (e.g., examining student creativity1, science education2 or implementation in a public setting3) but, while looping is suggested as an area for further research4, the papers coming up on a Google Scholar search for ""education looping"" haven't been helpful. Most are not available to me to read and/or focus exclusively on the minimal version of looping, where the term of the student-teacher (and -parent) relationship is extended only to two years total. In our case, there is no real middle option of only looping for two years; either we can choose a traditional program with new teachers every year, or programs with what I'll call ""extended"" looping of six or more years with the same teacher (à la Waldorf).  How are educational outcomes for primary schoolchildren affected by this practice of extended looping?  My spouse and I consider the cost of changing schools outside of the normal transition years between primary and secondary schools to be very high, based on our own experiences as children. This makes where to start school a particularly important choice we're making on behalf of our child, so we need to consider evidence-based implications for any and all areas of development (not purely academics).

856,Are these strange communication habits of urban teenagers normal?,"Being a teenager now, unlike when I was young, has some differences regarding communication regarding mobile phones / internet.  I have noticed some strange behavior in teenagers (around 15), which I find a bit baffling.  It's a mix of small things, so will list in dot point.   Plans for meeting/catching up are often very vague/unknown, right up until the event. Counterintuitively, contacting others seems to be quite hit-and-miss. When an event is disorganized - suggesting ""Why don't you call them to find out whats going on"", often gets some reply like... ""he doesn't check his phone"" or ""she's lost her phone"". A related issue, after-school classes, younger staff there may - for example, post on facebook when the stating times for the class change (with very little notice). Not considerate of people who have to travel a long way, or plan lifts ahead of time!. Teenagers often don't know each other's home-phone numbers (of course it's increasingly common not to have a land-line), nevertheless - if they do, there may be anxiety associated to calling them... (had calls where they person who called did not feel comfortable to talk so just hung up). Later I was told a friend called but was 'too shy' to speak.   In short, my impression is that many teenagers accept fluid (read haphazard) plans where they don't like to commit to activities and instead choose to ""play it by ear"", since this is now an option; further, there are so many forms of communication (phone, text, email, multiple social-media sites), that ignoring them is accepted too.  I'm told by my teenager that this is ""normal"".  So my questions:   Is this change in behavior normal/common, have others noticed this? Is this something that parents should try to prevent/mitigate?     Notes:   Phone calls are just one way to communicate, and I get that there are all sorts of apps... however the result seems to be that young people (in my anecdotal experience) have problems contacting each other reliably/effectively. The teenagers otherwise seem fairly well adjusted and outgoing (involved in theater, sports, music). This seems to be the case for both boys and girls. Not sure how this question comes across, but this isn't about being a control freak, knowing if someone is/isn't visiting (e.g., should we get extra food, or tidy the the house :), isn't so unreasonable).  "
857,Problems with my son's friend,"My son's 11 year old (male) friend, whom I will call Mike for the sake of discussion, is loud and rude.   At the beginning of the school year, Mike asked me if I was willing to drive him home occasionally because he was left to walk 4 miles home (alone!) if I didn't drive him on the days his Mom couldn't drive him herself. It felt manipulative, but he lives close to me so driving him occasionally wasn't really a big deal.   I recently fell and hurt my back (herniated disk, torn muscle). My son asked if Mike could come over to our house to play. I was in so much pain, and unable to take pain killers because I had the carpool. I told them both I was in a tremendous amount of pain and just really needed to focus on resting, so, no, coming over was not a great idea at the time. Mike asked, ""come on, why not?"" Again, Mike is a loud kid. I told them I needed quiet time to recover. Mike said, ""what, like the sound waves are really going to hurt your back?"" How rude!  Mike's Mom has yet to ever reciprocate and take the carpool. She didn't even help when I hurt my back. She expects me to drive her son, and even got miffed when my son was absent and Mike needed a ride. Like I was supposed to go get him anyway?  How do I deal with Mike?   I don't want to tell my son who he can and can't be friends with. I don't believe it's my place to correct Mike's behavior. I just need to know how to deal with a rude 11 year old.  "
858,Finding out who initiated sexual contact. What needs to be done?,"I live with my girl friend and her 5 year old son, and my 7 year old daughter. Recently they were found in the closet suspiciously. Her son had his boxers improperly outside his shorts. So his mom asked him at bed time what happened? He said ""naked stuff "". My girlfriend never told me she was expecting my daughter to bring it up and tell me.   Couple days later it happened again they were playing in the closet. The next day my girlfriend asked her son what exactly went on. According to him he had his shorts down and my daughter touched his penis. I separately questioned my daughter about what had happened in the closet and she told me the same.. That her son was touching her private part. Me and my girlfriend are having problems over this situation. Suggestions of what should be done? "
859,How to start a new feeding/sleep schedule for a 6 month old?,"My 6 month old grandson has no feeding / sleep schedule. He was born 3 weeks early, weighing 5 lbs. My daughter in law, Liz, is breastfeeding. The Dr. told her to feed as often as possible to get his weight up. He weighs now 14 lbs. Healthy, perfect, no problems.    I think the problem is that he only nurses for a couple of minutes each feeding, so eats whenever he whimpers. A tiny bit a time, every 30 minutes or so, so he never really gets full, never is really hungry enough to eat a whole meal. Even all night long he is up every hour. Mom is exhausted and gets up to feed him every time he stirs. She thinks he still needs to eat every few minutes. At 6 months old.    I am worried about my son and daughter in law. They are getting no rest.  Still. She has the baby sleeping in her room so she can get to him easliy every hour! She has no idea how to get him to eat more each time, so less frequently. Her Dr. told them to look up ideas in books!?    How can they break this exhausting habit and get back to some kind of sane sleep pattern for them all? "
860,How to help our 3-year-old deal with continuously missing clothes and bad behavior from another kid in the nursery?,"My 3-year-old daughter has been going to nursery for a year now. We live in Denmark.  Her clothes began disappearing in the day care (first a dress, then a jacket). And she was saying the name of one of the kids. This kid also behaves very weird towards my daughter. I observed it while leaving my daughter in the morning. Even I am 20 cm away from my daughter she was trying to pinch her. My wife told me the same.   Like 3 weeks ago our shoes disappeared. My daughter said it is the same kid again. We asked some of the teachers to ask this kid if she knows anything, but for privacy reasons the teachers didn't talk with the kid. They looked around the nursery for 1 week and finally today we asked another teacher who talked with the kid. And it turns out our shoes were in her home confirmed by her mother. I suspect that other missing stuff is also in their place.     What I worry about is that my daughter is having a hard time in the nursery. Today, the same kid also poured sand from a big box all over her hair. Even she is 3 since she is multilingual (my wife and I are from different countries and we are living in another country) and can't speak yet, I am worried that makes her an easy target since she can't explain it to her teachers yet. What I am trying to teach my daughter is to say ""stop"" loudly. And if it still goes on, I want her to tell her teachers.   Do you have any suggestions about how I can be sure my daughter is not having some hard time in nursery? Or and any suggestion I how to ask for other missing clothes? Should I speak with teachers specifically about this particular child and their relation with my daughter? "
861,How to successfully start the infant on semi solid foods?,The kid turned 6 months old on 17th Decemeber 2013. I have failed to make her eat any solid foods properly.  She doesn't want to eat with spoon. She doesn't like plain lentils. She doesn't like Cerelac.    She likes to suck from the bottle and she happily sucks formula. Cerelac is sweet so she should like that too.   Where am I going wrong? Is there any particular method of making the infant eat? How much should I expect the infant to eat throughout the day? 
862,"How to deal with rat and mouse, and fox, wolf, and jackal in story books?","I don't know the difference between rat and mouse, and fox, wolf, and jackal in real life. Means that I know they are different but I can't make out who's who on seeing them.  The story books have hand painted pictures of all these animals, and somewhere they call them mouse and other place they call them rat. Same is the case with fox, wolf, and jackal.  The toddler is 22 months old. I read her the stories and she listens attentively. I point out to rat and say this is rat and then ask her to point out to the rat again, which she does.   Question: Should I stick to rat and fox irrespective of what the story book writes? Should I use rat, mouse, and fox, wolf, jackal whenever story book mentions them?  Shouldn't that be confusing to the child? Till what age should I continue doing the same?  I forgot turtle and tortoise too! :( "
863,"How to give a 5-year-old ""the talk""?",We have a 5-year-old son and my wife is pregnant with a second child. Our son asked us how the baby got inside of her. Should I give him the talk? If so how much detail should I go into? 
864,My son isn't smiling back at us anymore when we pick him up from infant care,"We began to send our 3month (almost 4 month) old son to infant care. The first two days are half-days only. On the second day, after we picked him up from the center, he didn't smile back at us as usual. Is it because he has never separated with us before? Is that normal?  At home he stays only with us. We are staying overseas, so there are no in-laws or other family who can look after him. And as our house is pretty tiny, we don't have visitors. We usually go out with him during weekends. And sometimes meet other people. "
865,How do I foster what seems to be innate aptitude for music and leverage a seemingly above-average memory?,"I have a 3.5yo daughter that I think is...at least of above-average intelligence for her age.   I want to cultivate the innate intelligence that I've noticed in her without having her participate in 75 different programs/activities (sports, drama, dance, band, etc.) that make her so busy that her life becomes miserable.  What are some age-appropriate ways to keep her busy, encourage exploration, and foster development?  Her memory is incredibly good. In addition, she knows the lyrics to several Queen songs and several Beatles songs, a Kansas song...those are the ones I can think of; for certain musicals (like Les Miserables or Hamilton), she can recognize when a song is from that musical, even if she isn't familiar with or hasn't heard the song. When listening to What's This? from Nightmare Before Christmas, she recognized it as the same voice as Jack's Lament; these are two entirely different musical styles and tempos. She's also capable of making a non-squeaking sound on an alto saxophone (with plenty of squeaking sounds as well, mind you) and she can buzz her lips to play a trombone.  These are just the things that I can think of off the top of my head.  She reminds me a lot of me: I have an excellent long-term memory. I can remember movie lines and song lyrics and weird factoids that have absolutely no bearing on my life. I don't have perfect pitch, but I do have very good pitch memory.  I want to make sure that she succeeds in life and that she doesn't struggle with the same things that I did and still do.  Any suggestions? "

867,what is going on with the 2 mo old morning struggle?,"2 mo old baby - sleeps very well at night, 6 -7 hours with 1 feeding, then immediately slumps over again.  He does this thing in the morning around 6,7am, where he is all squirming all over, his face all scrunched up, and pivot around his torso, with his arms and legs flailing every which way and is half crying, and half whining. His eyes remain closed the entire time. He does this for an hour-ish. He doesn't really wake up before then even if I shake him a little, or pinch him a little. Once he is truly awake, and his eye open, the squirming stops. He's just normal and all sparkly eyed and smiley.   What is going on there? Does anyone else have the morning struggle? "
868,Ferber method advice,"My son is 9 months old and we started the Ferber method a few nights ago to hopefully eliminate the # of wake times throughout the night. The first night we started with the 3 min as our first wait time, then 5min, then 10, etc.  The second and 3rd night he slept throught the night. The 4th night he woke up at 4:30 crying. My question is: would I still treat it as the 4th night in sleep training and not go in for 12 minutes as my first wait time? Or does it re set (back to 3min) since he started sleeping throught the night? Also--if he cries and then is silent for awhile and then starts crying again does the clock start over? Just looking for the Ferber pros out there that have been around the block and can offer advice :)  "

870,My 4 year-old says she doesn't love her mom,"My 4 year-old daughter keeps saying to her mom that she doesn't like/love her, and refuses to retract the comment or say sorry. Is this ""normal""? A ""phase""? It's pretty hard for mom to take.  For context, mom is a stay at home mom, and I work. My daughter seems ""normal"" enough, but perhaps a little non-social (not anti-social; just doesn't actively seek out the company of others her age). I (father) have a close relationship with my daughter, and she spontaneously says she loves me.  There is a younger sister 2.5 year-old on the scene, and she is very attached to mom. My enquiries to my daughter as to why she is feeling this way seem to point toward her being jealous of the attention mom gives the little one.  Have others encountered this behaviour? Should we be seeing a shrink? My suggested ""solution"" is for mom to spend some special one-on-one time with her.  Any feedback/ideas/experience welcome. "
871,How to help a child not be afraid to struggle with things that are easy for her older brother?,"We started homeschooling this year, and my four year-old daughter has been comparing herself to her six year-old brother, then acting afraid to do anything when she doesn't measure up.  For example, she will ask to write, which she doesn't know how to do yet.  Note this isn't an assignment we give her, it's always at her own request.  I say something like, ""Okay, let's learn to write,"" and give her something at her level, but a little challenging, like practicing writing an 'A'.  Sometimes she does it happily, but just as often she balks away and whimpers.  I'm not sure the exact reason, but I think it's because it's not the kind of writing her brother does.  Her brother did his first year at public school, so she didn't see his beginning steps of learning to write.  To her view, when we started ""doing school,"" her brother already knew how to write and she didn't.  She doesn't understand why he can do it and she can't, even though she is far ahead of where her brother was at her age.  How can we help her understand and be happy with the level she is, and not be afraid to struggle with something she sees is now easy for her brother?  Why does she ask to do something, then not want to do it? "
872,Kid screaming after waking up in a car?,I recently became involved with this awesome guy who has two kids. His son who is 3 is a very sweet boy. But when we take car rides and he wakes up while in the car he is hysterical. I've heard of kids waking up scared but normally a few comforting words and the kids ok. With him he gets worse and won't go back to sleep. He will also kick and scream and hit anything nearby till we stop and take him out. It's bad. And it only happens if he wakes up in the car. Any advise?? 
873,Preventing anti-STEM bias especially with girls,"Both of my children love science, and my wife and I have encouraged this in our children.   However, at a recent school activity fair the representative for a science oriented group (robotics if I remember correctly) spoke to and gave an activity to my son but not my daughter, though my daughter was in the target age range for the group and my son was not.  We ""compensated"" for the ""gimme"" they gave my son by getting my daughter a similar experiment kit.  We didn't directly address the representative at the booth, but later emailed the group leader about this. Should we have said something on the spot? What else have people done to overcome anti-STEM bias? "
874,What are some good natural teethers?,"It seems our 6 month baby wants to take everything in her mouth, it would be nice if we were able to give her some natural food-based teethers, but which edible substances can be used as teethers? Do they require any processing and what kind? "
875,Ego-centric kid or control-freaked mum?,"Apparently, I'm doing something wrong or I don't know how to connect with my child properly...   I have a lovely 5,5 years old daughter, who is an absolutely cute and non-problematic girl at a kindergarten, with my boyfriend, with my parents, but not with me.  As soon as I appear, she becomes very whiny, ego-centric and defiant. She wants something, she wants it now, and she keeps repeating it constantly. She can't accept that something is not like SHE wants it to be. No matter what form we choose to deliver our decision, doesn't accept it.   When I ask her to do something or remind her that soon it's time to do something, she refuses.  I have tried everything:   listening and mirroring her feelings -> she just keeps saying ""but I want this"" or refuses to do what she's asked (""No, I won't clean my toys) removing the privileges and explaining why they are removed and how she can get them back -> she calms down, does what she is asked, promises not to do so and after some time misbehaves again give her warnings and timeout -> she throws a tantrum, hits the door, yells, then does the same as in 'removing the privileges' point spanking -> I guess, no additional commentary on the efficiency of this method is needed asking how she would feel if I behaved the same way -> she says she wouldn't like it and it's not good to behave that way but still does it after some time passes giving her choices -> she simply chooses what is not listed, e.g. I ask ""will you clean your toys before lunch or after?"" and the answer is ""I won't clean them, I don't want to"". And if I say that such an answer wasn't among the offered options, she will respond something like ""But I don't want to do it anyway"".  explaining the consequences in various situations, even the consequences of her own choices (and letting those consequences become real) -> no effect whatsoever   I have a feeling that she simply doesn't listen to me and literally doesn't hear me (though her hearing is ok, because unwrapping the candy or chips pack gets her attention even from another room). If I ask her what did I just say, she can't answer to me, she stares silently or says she doesn't remember or says something completely different.   She also likes to be in control of everything, when we are doing something together and I try to correct her even in a very mild manner or simply say that this should be done differently, she acts very emotionally and wants that we do it her way. Same goes with role-playing or any games that have certain rules, she doesn't want to follow those rules.  We are not able to go out with her anywhere, because every time it's a horrible experience for everyone - she doesn't listen, she keeps repeating what she wants and it drives me nuts.  I am seriously thinking if I need to be checked, because I get very angry with this behavior. Sometimes I even don't want to come home from work, it feels like battlefield for simple routine things like eating, cleaning her room, going out, etc.   I understand that I am a control freak myself and I have worked on that to be softer with her and not to demand so much, to lower my expectations but is it too much to expect if I say ""Please walk slower, you're running and the dog gets too aroused"" or ""I can't play with you now, I'm busy, we'll play when I finish"" and want her to understand that I really mean it and I need this behavior at this particular moment?  "
876,Counting out of context words?,"We have been trying to count our 20 month old's vocabulary and are trying to decide if words which she has learned incorrectly (words which are said correctly but may require further context for a listener) count to a professional?  As an example, a 7 year old sibling introduced some 20p coins ( as twenty pees ) and now pee is used to mean money.  She's correct that a coin would be something 'pee' but would you count it? "
877,Coaxing a child to perform her best,"My five year-old daughter likes to keep her abilities to herself.  She pretty much taught herself to read about a year ago, but didn't let us know.  If you asked her what something said, she would shrug, but if you gave her instructions that required reading silently, like ""Click on 'check out'"" at the library kiosk, she could do it easily.  Now the cat's out of the bag, but she's still reluctant to read aloud to her full ability.  She will fluently read a word like ""beautiful,"" then pretend to stumble over ""the.""  As a result, we have no idea what her true reading level is.  Any ideas what could be causing this?  It's not a lack of confidence, as it's very intentional.  It's not stage fright, because this is one on one in her own home and she's treating it like a game.  It's not lack of praise.  In fact, praise actually shuts her down harder.  It's almost as if how well she reads is her own private business that she simply doesn't care to share.  Any ideas how to persuade her to show us her best? "
878,When to transition to letting the baby fall asleep on its own? Is my baby ready for sleep training?,"Our daughter is 2 months old. As of right now, we have a pretty well working routine of putting the baby to sleep. Bath, lights out, long feeding, then falling asleep on our hands, then falling asleep on us when we sit/lay, then being put to bed. It all takes about 2 hours, which is acceptable.  The problem is that this routine involves a lot - about ~20 minutes - of carrying and another 20 minutes laying on us falling into deep sleep. It will become more difficult and tiresome as the baby grows, so we would like to change the routine and eliminate those two parts.  When should we start trying to lull her to sleep in her bed? Is it already time to start sleep training? On one hand, we would like to start it as soon as possible, but on the other - the current routine is working well and we wouldn't like to rid ourselves of a few hours of sleep per day.  Up till now, she has managed to fall asleep on her own only three times - two of them in the last week. Is it some kind of hint that we should start trying to let her fall asleep on her own? "
879,What should my wife eat and drink during pregnancy?,"During pregnancy, what would be the great foods that I could make for my wife? *(does not matter if it is morning, afternoon or dinner)  I have to choose and prepare the food. This is not my specialization and I would like to have some diversity in foods i make. She is undoubtedly a smarter person in the kitchen, but she can not answer a simple question : ""What do you want to eat?"", instead I have to ask : ""Do you want to eat X"".   I live in Europe, but my wife has Russian/Asian roots and and tends to eat somewhat spicier foods. I have found, that atm she likes soups and oven cooked foods.  I have guidelines like :   Do not use any citrus *(orange, mandarin, lemon) - she is hyper allergic Do not use any nuts - she is hyper allergic to some  Do not use fatty, fried, and greasy foods - she avoids them  Do not use any unpasteurized milk products - they may cause Listeria infection Do not use fish -   ex 1: she likes tuna, but where i live it contain high level of mercury ex 2: she eats white fish, but not at the moment  Do not under cook foods *(or over cook)  ex 1: baby can get salmonella from under cooked eggs   "
880,when do children start answering questions ?,"My child is 2.5 years old. He understands two step instructions and expresses himself.  However, he does not answers questions. For example: if I ask where is your mom? he will not answer that she is in the kitchen.   When do kids start answering questions like these? "
881,How to break the cycle of lies?,"My six year-old son has recently started lying almost constantly.  This is somewhat puzzling to us, because:   He almost never gets away with it.  Fortunately for us, he isn't very good at it yet, but he is getting better. It causes him to lose the activity or object he was lying to obtain, and then some.  This is the consequence we use most often, because it is the closest to the natural consequence.  For example, if he lies about being done eating, so he can go play, the consequence is not only does he not get to play now, he has to wait longer to play than it would have taken him just to finish eating. He lies even when it hurts his case.  For example, he will lie to try to get a cookie, in situations where he could have gotten one just for asking. His untrustworthiness causes us to check up on him more, which ironically makes it harder for him to get away with stuff.   It's gotten to the point where he is constantly lying to try to stay out of trouble, but the biggest reason he's getting in trouble is because of the lying.  My answer to this related question isn't working anymore, partially because he tells the truth so infrequently now that there are no opportunities to reward him for it, and partially because he has started taking advantage of the rare leniency to try getting away with even more.    My question is different from What are appropriate methods for disciplining a primary schooler for lying? because typical rewards and consequences both seem to be setting up a perverse incentive in his case.  How can I break this behavior spiral so normal occasional discipline will work again? "
882,How to teach civil rights to children who don't know about racism?,"Martin Luther King Day is coming up, and I want to teach my children about him, especially since the civil rights movement is such a huge part of our local history here in Alabama.  My dilemma is that my children (ages 4, 6, and 9) are currently completely oblivious to racism.  They treat everyone the same and it doesn't even occur to them that anyone would do otherwise.  Is there a way to teach them about the positive things that came out of the civil rights movement, while still maintaining their innocence about racism?  Or is this a subject best left until they're more mature? "
883,How to resolve blocked milk ducts after weaning,"Our 1-year-old has been weaned off breast milk for a little over a week now, which was completely her doing. My wife has been dealing with the engorgement since then, which she says has subsided. However she noticed a hard lump in her breast. We think it's a blocked milk duct and not mastitis. From reading about mastitis, she thinks it should be much more painful, and she isn't presenting with a fever or chills or anything like that.  Most of the treatment for blocked ducts or mastitis involves making sure you continue to breastfeed in order to drain. Of course, our problem is our daughter is weaned. My wife doesn't want to express her milk, as this will set her back as far as stopping milk production... we think.  What we should do? If it is just a blocked duct, will it simply clear on its own? "
884,How can I tell if my toddler is truly gifted or just bright?,"I'm the father of a 2 years and 4 months old daughter. I can't understand if she's gifted or just very bright. We live in Italy, where giftedness is not recognized by law and there are no special programs for gifted people. I'm gifted myself and going through school was extremely painful for me. My parents never realized that I was gifted therefore they never took action or did something to help me.   I never failed anything in school but I was always extremely bored and sometimes I skipped entire months and stayed at home instead. This was really painful for me, and I'm afraid that my daughter might experience the same thing. She can do a lot of things, but a the same time we taught her all of that and we spend a lot of time with her just playing, talking, reading or teaching something.   She can read about 100 words and the amount of words she's learning grows at an exponential rate (We actually measure this). She can count up to 10 both in Italian and English and she can do simple arithmetics. She can understand both Italian and English with ease, she only has troubles with abstract things like the idea of space, but after a little while she even got that. She's pretty good with puzzles and problem solving in general. She can type words with a computer and use a mouse with some patience.   I understand that all of this stuff is what a gifted kid can do BUT, and I can't stress this enough, we spend A LOT of time with her. I don't get if she's just very good at learning (and she usually enjoys that) or if there's some kind of internal process that actually gives her additional insights on the world. Here in Italy we have no possibility to test her, I'm trying to create some metrics to understand that, but I feel like I'm a little biased (I feel that she's not gifted). My issue is that being gifted is not necessarily different from having a problem. Gifted kids need a specific treatment and because of the lack of support here in Italy it is crucial to me to understand that. I'm not worried about her being successful or anything else, that is not the reason why I need to understand this! So, if she's bright I'm ok, if she's gifted I need to find a way to help her.   What can I do to better understand the situation? How can I help her if she's gifted for real? "
885,Good routine for a 5 year old,"My step-daughter is heading to school this year. Her pre-school hours last year were 9.30 until 2.30 and her school hours this year will be 9.00 until 3.30.  It will be quite a sudden change in routine for little miss, but as I haven't dealt with having a child in school before, what sort of routine should I start for her? I'm not really sure how long it will take to get ready as well as I will be preparing out boy for Kindergarten. Idea's for routine and an appropriate bedtime? "
886,How old must a baby be to be lifted under its arms?,How old must a baby be to be lifted under its arms? Is there any required age? Is this kind of baby lifting safe for a newborn or toddler? 
887,Should we put siblings in the same kindergarten group?,"I've got one child in kindergarten and another one that will begin there next year. The way it works is that the youngest ones have a group for themselves, with ages from 2½ to around 3½. From 3½ until school age, they're all in mixed groups, what they call ""family groups"".  When your second child starts kindergarten, he'll go into a young group first, but then we are facing a choice between letting him stay in the young group until he is the oldest, or putting him into a family group sooner than that. Based on the experiences with the first child, it's not fun to be the oldest in a young group, so ""graduating"" sooner to a family group seems preferable.   Now, the question: There is more than one family group. Should we put our second child into the same group where his older brother already is, or should we put him into a separate group? What are the pros and cons of each alternative? "
888,What can be done to extend the fertility of a woman?,"I want to ask the question: ""what is the age cut-off for female fertility"", but I think that varies a lot between women.  Instead, I ask, what can be done to extend the fertility of a woman? Basically, what can be done to slow down the onset of menopause? "
889,"Simple, wooden, not painted or colourful toys, bricks?","What toys are better for 1.5 years old toddler - natural, simple, wooden, unpainted bricks or very colourful ones? Natural were recommended by Rudolf Steiner (and are used in schools teaching with his methods) and they orjust feel right, but most of today's toys are very colorful - any specific reason? "
890,First keyboard: Qwerty or Dvorak?,"Should I start my toddler off with a Qwerty or Dvorak keyboard?  I use Qwerty myself. I have tried to learn Dvorak but I failed. The Qwerty key strokes are so hardwired in me that it would take a monumental effort to change. But I am persuaded that Dvorak is a better layout, at least for typical users. So if I was starting from scratch I would learn Dvorak - and I'm wondering whether I should encourage my toddler to do this.  I can see she'd have some problems, particularly on school computers that inevitably use Qwerty. But these problems can be dealt with; all modern OS support Dvorak. Does anyone have practical experience of this?  Would it be worth talking to the school, to see if they'll teach the whole year group Dvorak? "
891,Grandparents want our three year old daughter to throw tantrums like her cousin did,"When my nephew was a toddler/pre-schooler, he had major separation anxiety issues and tantrums. Specifically, whenever his grandparents or we (his aunt and uncle) visited him, he'd never let us leave in peace. He'd cry, follow us out of the house, throw tantrums - the entire production. It'd always delay our plans by half hour to one hour. His parents never objected to this behaviour, in fact, I think they even supported it because they found it adorable and/or amusing.  Around 4 years later, we have a 3 year old daughter. She loves it when her extended family comes over, and has a lot of fun with them. But doesn't throw a tantrum when its time to leave. (I think we've raised a sensible and well balanced child) She sometimes asks once or twice if they (or we) could stay for a little while more, and if we say they (or we) can't, she understands.  The grandparents though, seem to misinterpret this as lack of attachment. They told my daughter that when her cousin was her age, he loved them so much, he'd never let them go so easily, that he'd really miss them if they went away, and that he'd often ask for them in the night if he wasn't able to sleep. (That, according to me, was just lack of discipline and sleep training!) I assured them later that she misses them just as much, but just understands that they have to leave. I don't know if I convinced them, but that's the least of my concerns.  When our daughter spoke to us after they left, we found out that they've said things along these lines a couple times before too. She feels really hurt that they think she doesn't love them as much as her cousin.  A tearful ""Does [bob] love them more, daddy?"" broke my heart. I told her everyone loves everyone else the same amount, but have different ways of showing it. I thought that was that, but she seems to have learnt the lesson that the way her cousin showed his love was better. And she actually did cry a lot and told her grandparents not to leave the next time they visited! This has never happened, I've never had more than a pouty face, and nothing I couldn't fix with some explanation and some distraction. But this time she didn't stop crying till the grandparents agreed to stay for 1 more hour.  I'm at a loss now, how do I handle this new development? I don't want to tell her that its her cousin's and his parent's behaviour which was wrong until I absolutely have to. I don't want her to ""learn"" separation anxiety, nor get her way with her grandparents by crying. I could convince them not to stay back just because she's crying, but would that confuse her more? Would she feel that she can't win their favour no matter what she does? "
892,How to teach a child a third language you don't speak yourself fluently?,"I speak English and Korean and my partner speaks English only. I am currently speaking to my 2-month-old daughter predominantly in Korean to promote her to be bilingual. However, I also want her to speak French, because I am French as well but never learned to speak it. The only French speaker in the family is my father but he doesn’t live close enough to be an exposure. I hope to enroll her in Alliance Française around 4 but a lot of research depicts the importance of phonetic exposure before 3.  I am hoping to play some audiobooks or read to her in basic French (although my pronunciation isn’t perfect). Would that help at all? Does anyone know how to successfully teach a baby a third language without speaking it themselves fluently? "
893,"My pre-schooler is out of control, and I feel like my parents are undermining my relationship and authority with her","Alright, I guess a little back story would help. I am a single mother and an only child, I will be 21 in a few months. I've graduated high school with honors and have been raising my daughter on my own since her birth. We do live with my parents still, but I blame the economy.   My daughter will be 4 in less than 2 weeks.   We rarely had problems when she was little... But as soon as 3 got close, it became a battle ground.   I do it all, I work from home, provide her with her wants and needs, etc, Dad does NOTHING. I feel horrible for admitting this, but I feel like her and I are starting to grow apart.   We fight non stop, time outs aren't allowed because my parents think they are ridiculous, she back talks, hits, harasses people, she acts out on a whim, she throws tantrums all the time, I can't get her to eat any form of real food... I am at my wits end.   She goes to my mom and dad if I yell at her or if I say ""No."" Then I get in trouble. But that's not the point.   Everyone sees her as being some sweet and darling child, unless I am with her. Then she becomes a rude and obnoxious little brat. I didn't used to be this way... I am considering therapy because I have reached the point where I am angry and frustrated all the time. Oh yeah, she's spoiled... by EVERYONE.   This may sound like a jumbled up mess, but I haven't slept. She has night terrors and has had them since a newborn. She co sleeps with my mom now because I used to work 3rd shift and I'm still on a night life schedule.   If I had to make one statement to explain how I feel, it would be ""I feel unloved and rejected. I wouldn't go back and erase her by any means, but I wish we could grow up as sisters. They're supposed to fight and harass one another until they both run screaming to their rooms.   My friends have seen this, counselors have spent days with us. Everyone suggests we move out. But with what money? Bills and the car and school eat it all. I look for dance lessons and stuff for her to take to get her out of the house. Preschool is when this started... I don't want to lose her, but I don't think this can be repaired.  I am at a loss and I am wondering if any of this is normal?  I know living with my parents doesn't help, but trust me, we are trying. I pay rent and cover our expenses.   Please give me some advice, I don't want her to hate me like my mother and I hate one another. "
894,Divorced parents care less about me,"I'm 23 and my parents divorced about a year ago and since then, they both make me feel like I'm less important/no longer needed.   I live with my mom, she is lovely but only when the house is clean. I do most of the laundry, most of the cooking, all the dishes, all the cleaning and stuff (even her own bedroom!). Keep in mind that our house is 120m^2. Besides that, every saturday she expects me to help her at her job (5am - 2pm). She is that kind of person that you cannot explain that I have my exams and I have to take my studies time, or else that I want to see my friends. She indeed has her part in ""house duties"" and that is (as she understands) buying food. There is no way of standing up to her, she has excellent memory for things that you did wrong and she would not hestiate to use that against me.  Now, don't get me wrong I completely understand that she is working, she may be exhausted after work and wants just some help from her child but I'm also working, I'm trying to pursue my career at my profession. As much as I would love to help her, she is constantly outraging as soon as something does not meet her expectations, that is very sad and discouraging.  Now my father, there was never any issue with him. He is cool, calm and now he lives with another woman, she is fine I got used to her and even had few nice chats with her. But somehow, after divorce I feel like he is trying to get rid of me but he will never admit it. He sends me child support, he has to, so I guess that's not any way of showing how much he cares. Anyway the money is mostly given to my mom.  I'm very emotional about all of this, I dont want to lose contact with them at all. Is moving out the only way to free myself from my mom? How can I help my contact with dad? "
895,How to prepare children for impending death of a parent?,"My wife has been told that she has a limited amount of time left due to an illness, the average life expectancy is 7-8 years after onset, of which we have used up 7. With excellent management, and slow progression of the disease, people have been known to live up to 20 years after onset. But even in that best case scenario, my children who are both below 5, are likely to have their mother gone by their teens.  Is there something we could do to prepare them for that day?  I understand death of a parent can happen to any child, but is it right to pretend we don't know what's coming? Or to have the children take the burden of dealing with the situation because of our squeamishness? Needless to say this is a massive burden for any family to carry, and the pressures it places on us are enormous, but how can we best deal with this situation? "
896,Parents salt food too much,"When it comes to food, my parents like to salt it a lot more than I do. Besides tasting bad (in my opinion, at least), the salt amount is unhealty and, according to my calculations, about twice the 5 gram limit per day recommended by the WHO. I've asked them politely to salt less, but after saying ""Ok"", they continue just as before. I've asked them two or three times in total to no avail, and don't want to continue nagging them about it.  When I cook, which I do about half the time, I salt according to my taste, and when we eat they just salt the food on their own plate more without anyone making a fuss about it. It works just fine for everyone. How can I convince them to salt less, too?  Do not answer with any of the following answers, please     ""Just ask them to do it""   I've tried, it simply doesn't help.     ""Cook your own food""   I do rather often, but sometimes I can't. Besides, I can't refuse to eat their food without offending them, which I preferably would avoid.     ""Don't be so picky""   I'd prefer to avoid eating food which tastes bad and is unhealthy for several more years.     ""Move out""   I'm 16.  Any ideas or suggestions? "
897,How much can I and my parents help my wife directly after giving birth when she wants to only rest and breastfeed?,"My Korean wife and I are expecting our first child in a couple of months and I am curious how things normally go directly after birth. My assumption was that both my wife and I would need to be constantly caring for the child but she thinks that it will be me doing basically everything except breatfeeding. Quote from her copied from text message     i'm just going to feed the baby that's all i'll do    i'm staying only in the bedroom   nobody else than you and [the dog] is allowed in the bedroom. that's all I want   you take care of your parents if you want them to come   if you want to know what other people usually do about visitors, you can google    you should start reading about baby and wife care    I really have no idea what to expect, so what she is expecting feasible or is it going to be impossible?   Also I thought we would need a lot of help so I was going to invite my parents to come (hers will come a couple of months later). Is it normally helpful to have parents around immediately after the birth or is it better to wait and do things alone? "
898,My dad still yells at me as an adult and I don't know how to react because he's my dad,"My dad has always been a ""mad person"". Recently I was talking with my mom and she said a large reason she divorced with him was because he was always mad.   Now, the following is a onetime example but similar things keep happening and I don't know how to get it to stop. Also, some details I consider irrelevant, but others may not so I'll try to give as much info as possible.  My dad had offered to do me a favor and give me a ride somewhere. We met at his place. While at his place I had some work related notes I had to read. Now, I thought it was pretty obvious I needed to focus but he kept talking to me and distracting me and I snapped ""be quiet!"" (I may have said it in a loud voice but I didn't yell at him). He started yelling his head off at me for the next 15 minutes. He was saying things like ""I'm allowed to speak! This is my house and I make the rules!"" He also acts threatening when he's yelling and is very animated.  One thing I don't get is what my dad want? At my job I deal with lots of angry people, but they're angry because they're not getting something they want. I realize it was rude for me to say be quiet, but him yelling for a long time is ridiculous. In fact, I'm sure if he conducts himself at work the same way he would get fired (and to my knowledge he has never been fired).  I don't know what to do about it. At work if a colleague yells at me I would wait for them to calm down and tell them yelling doesn't help the problem. If a stranger yelled at me I'd ignore them. If a friend yelled at me, we wouldn't be friends if it happened as frequently as it does with my dad.  He seems to always do this when he has an advantage over me, like how he offered to give me a ride and I was already at his place. I keep forgetting not to trust him. I made my self a note on Google Calendar not to trust my dad with help and I have it set to remind me each day, but this kind of gives me a bad gut feeling.  I admit he's good at manipulating me. For example his text message said ""I have lunch for you here. How about I come pick you up in 10 minutes?""  Also, I've considered it might be a mental illness on his part. But I sometimes don't see what difference this makes. I used to work for a company where someone got away with breaking all the rules and being a jerk because he was diagnosed with alcoholism. In the same way, if my dad has anger management I can't just decide not to be bothered by him yelling at me.  EDIT: he also gets mad and yells at other people (including strangers and family) but he seems to do it the most to me.  "
899,What should I do with my daughter on Take Your Child to Work Day?,"I'm a programmer and will be observing Take Your Child to Work Day with my four-year-old daughter, Thing1, on Thursday.  I'm planning to get us dressed up, take her to breakfast and then bring her into the office for some fun business shenanigans among my ~150 coworkers.   She loves learning and games and is quite good with letters, numbers, and 3-4 letter words.  I will have no problem recruiting accomplices to assist me during the 3 hours or so that I'm in the office with her.  What should we do?  I want her to be involved with others in the office and feel like she's contributing (no mindless busy work).   Ideas so far (this is where I need your help!)...   Create questions for an ""interview"" (favorite color, movie, subject, etc.) with colorful office supplies (crafts are fun) Run some copies (copiers are fun) Conduct the above interview with fun coworkers (talking to people is fun) Send some emails (banging on computers is fun)   More ideas? I'd love to work in something programming related--if you can think of anything a 4yo will have the attention span for I'd love to hear it.  I'm taking this as vacation - I don't have to be productive at all. "
900,How to cope with going back to work as a stay at home dad with two working parents,"I was mostly a stay at home dad for the first year and a half of my son's life. By mostly I mean I was a full time student and we had some daycare for a couple hours a day starting very young so I could study and working up to 5-6 hours a day after he was a year old. Then I got a job. Its a decent job, but my wife is also working full time on an erratic schedule. Due to contract restrictions she can't just ""quit,"" nor does she want to.  We have about 10 months left until our situation changes completely, and 6 months until things get easier from a scheduling perspective. So our situation seems like it may be temporary.  While at daycare my son looked at the ""family wall"" where they have family pictures for the kids and stared for a minute before starting to cry. However, overall my son is a pretty happy guy. I'm travelling right now. Him and his mom were visiting family for two weeks, home for a week, and then I left for business for the week. But this is the reality of our schedule for the next few months. I come home, my wife leaves, she comes home, we have a couple days or maybe a week together as a family and then one of us will be travelling again.  Has anyone out there been faced with this sort of situation?  Does anyone have any suggestions for how to teach my son (now 21 months) how to identify how he's feeling and keep things in perspective?  Is anyone aware of any long term consequences of a lifestyle like this (besides the counter intuitive greater sense of security he may gain in learning that we do come back and those times are great)? "
901,One year in a foreign country with a three year old,"We (2 parents, 1 child) are moving to Denmark for a little more than a year. Our child is around three and a half years old. We are all Finnish, and the adults speak good English, some Swedish and a smattering of other languages; we do intend to learn as much as Danish as we can, also. This is a short academic job, so it is possible we will continue in Finland, Denmark, or some other country after this. (Germany and Japan seem probable countries, for example.)  It is likely that daycare in Danish, English and maybe even Finnish are available. I might find colleagues of various nationalities with children of roughly the same age, or maybe not.  Our first priority, language-wise, is for the child to speak fluent Finnish. Our second priority is for they to have children to play with. Our third priority is for them to learn an additional language or two, preferably as well as possible.  The question Moving to a foreign country with a 2.5 years old child addresses a longer stay (I guess) and involves only two languages.  My questions are:   Which language should we speak at home and with each other? I'm guessing Finnish, so that she will master it. What should be the language of the daycare?  "
902,"How to make sure my 7-year-old daughter doesn't go outside alone, without scaring her or impacting her confidence?","I have a 7-year-old daughter who sometimes likes to go out without me or her mom. Last week we had an incident that she went out of the school premises and got herself in trouble. In my opinion, she is not old enough to be on her own yet. She doesn't know about the dangers of the world out there.   A few yeas ago, I saw the movie The Lovely Bones that greatly touched me. I was wondering if it is a right thing to have her watch this film? My concern is that the damage might be greater than the benefit. Do you have other suggestions to teach her to stay with us, e. g. at the mall, that do not scare her or impact her confidence?  "
903,Is it bad to use a pacifier?,I've been using it when she gets fussy and she seems to love it. Is this a bad habit to get into? I've heard there are potential dental/breastfeeding/dependency issues. Is there any truth to this? 
904,Is the child obesity epidemic biasing growth charts?,The prevalence of obesity in children is increasing.  Is this biasing the growth charts that physicians use to assess normal growth? In other words are children that would have been in the 50th percentile before the rise in childhood obesity now in a lower percentile? 
905,Putting a toddler to sleep and have him continue to sleep,"We have a 2 year old son.  He's wonderful and we love him very much.  There are two problems that we have...  1 - I am his father.  I have very rarely put him to sleep by myself.  I'd like to help my wife by putting him to bed.  The thing is, whenever I try, he throws a tantrum and calls for mom.  How can I learn to better put him to sleep and have him be OK with it and fall asleep?  2 - At least 3 to 5 times a night, he wakes up in the middle of the night and goes to my wife to nurse.  This disturbs our sleep and wears my wife out.  How can we put him to sleep (preferably I would do it half the time) and have him continue to sleep?  Honestly, if we were to fall asleep and wake up just once to snuggle, that wouldn't be so bad (as long as we can put him back into his bed and he can continue to sleep there.)  Thoughts?  Suggestions?  Ideas? "
906,How do you respond to your pre-schooler when they tell you that you're on Santa's Naughty List?,"My three-year-old son really enjoyed Christmas.  My son is still talking about how Santa came to our house to fill our stockings two times (my wife put treats in one night, and I put some in two days later), and loves to tell everyone about all the presents he got.  We haven't really pushed the whole ""Santa only gives presents to good girls and boys"" thing (I'm not a fan of using threats of withholding rewards as a motivation).  However, he's watched a lot of Christmas movies, and definitely knows the theme.  Unfortunately, this has led to him telling his mother or I that we're ""on Santa's Naughty List, and aren't going to get any presents"", usually when we're enforcing common rules that he has broken (e.g. ""don't leave the dinner table until everyone has eaten"").  I'm mostly concerned with explaining that enforcing the rules isn't ""naughty"", but I'm not certain that, at three, he's developmentally ready to really understand this.  Is he? What is the best way to respond to this? "
907,Teen may be racist,"I am a mentor to a 15 yr old girl. Today I was telling her about what happened in Charlottesville and getting her thoughts on it. She said she kind of agreed that white people are better than everyone else. (She also seems to think she's better than everyone else.) of course, I was horrified. Reacting, and telling her that kind of thinking was really messed up. I have no idea how to handle this situation and could really use some advice. Thanks.  She has been very teachable and open to new ideas. I'm wondering if there are some kid-friendly videos I can show her that won't make her feel like she's in school? Or just anything else to teach her about what non-white people have been through. She's knowledgeable about the Nazis and Hitler and thinks he's horrible. Maybe I can expand on that? "
908,Sleeping duration for a toddler,"My 15-month old has 2 long sleeps during the day. From 10am to 12 or 1pm and the second sleep from 3.30pm to 6pm.  I have read around that at this age he should be sleeping around 2 hrs during the day, which means my little one is sleeping up to 3x more!  Is this bad? Should we wake him up? Anyone with similar experience? "
909,How to help a 5-year-old deal with negative emotions?,"My 5-year-old gets angry and frustrated in situations like:   losing at a board game being told he is wrong about something being told not to yell 'You are so fat!' at a teacher with the explanation it is not nice and the teacher knows he is fat being told not to use the kind of name-calling (poop, willy) he uses with classmates when talking to our neighbour   These are all completely normal situations and as a grown-up we have the same feelings but we somehow deal with them. How do I help my son deal with them?  I'm reading the Optimistic Child, which stresses to explain failure as temporary and caused by circumstances (i.e. I failed this test because I did not practice) and not as some personal trait (i.e. I failed because I'm stupid).   However, I don't think the explanation is a problem. For example, in the first case he knows that anyone can lose at a game and he also knows he reacts disproportionately. We were reading a story the other day where one person loses a competition and gets nasty, he noted that he is also a sore loser. I quickly replied that he never behaved as nasty as the person in the story.  It's the rush of emotion that my kid has trouble handling. I am not very good at it either, when something stressful happens it throws me off for a few hours, sometimes days.   So what are good strategies to deal with negative emotions? "
910,How do I babyproof an electrical baseboard heater?,"My son is 9 month old, and our rental apartment has an electric baseboard heater, similar to this [website]I'm sure it's very dangerous to touch it when it's hot/turned on, but it is attached to the wall very low (the website does say it must be placed lower than the window), and I'm afraid even if we never turn it on, he might get hurt anyway since there's a lot of metal edges. Any idea how to baby-proof this? [bonus] Is there any chance that I can baby-proof and still use it for heat? "
911,Is it really that bad to get water in a baby's ear?,"My 7-week-old girl loves taking baths but, of course, we get conflicting information about how often and how careful we should be of water in her ears. The pediatrician said every other day and didn't say anything about being careful about getting water in her ears (though, maybe it's obvious since, you know, you gotta keep her head above water).   Anyway, is it really that big a deal if water gets in her ears? She turns her head and, unless I try really hard, water makes its way in there, especially when washing her hair.   Will this cause ear infections? "
912,At what age is handedness preference firmly established?,"Based on the discussion in the comments here:  Is being left-handed going to be more difficult for my son?  Some of us are interested in knowing when hand dominance becomes firmly established.   I'm looking for a general timeline of the related developmental milestones. I know that there's ambiguity and fluidity regarding handedness in young children, but I'm not positive on when the switching becomes less common, and when it zeroes in on one or the other.  Some reports are that it happens quite early, but when 90% of the population ends up being right-handed, I think it's a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Some research suggests it actually happens quite late. I'm not sure if there's more to back up/refute the information found here.    Both of these:   How does a child develop &quot;handed-ness&quot;? Is handedness predetermined genetically?   are related questions, but discuss the how/why, not the when. "
913,How to encourage our 11 month old to walk alone?,"Since about 3 month, our little one can walk and stand, when both her hands are being held or she can hold onto something. As soon as we retract our hands and she realizes it, she will sit down.  Since about 1.5 months now, she decided that she can nicely hop on her knees. So when she needs to use her hands, she does not crawl but ""walk"" or hop on her knees. She also does that if she is in an especially good mood.  No ""accidents"" happened to her while walking with help and also learning to stand by herself went without anything more than the usual(?) minor drops. In general shes a brave one and likes to explore new things and areas - in those cases even crawling/rushing away from the parents. But shes very clingy in areas she already knows (e.g. she plays by herself on the floor sitting next to me, if i get up and sit onto the couch she will shortly after stand next to me). She still sleeps with us in the room and usually after waking up after 8h sleep around 4 o'clock in the morning is allowed to sleep another 2-3h with us in the big bed.  Did we -somehow- fail in giving her enough self-confidence? Failed to give her the proper incentive? Maybe shes just lazy and we skip her and try our luck with a new one (joking)? What might be our mistake?  Do you have any advises for us how we can get her to walk all by herself? "
914,How to stop our 2-year-old's bedtime tantrums and make her sleep through the night?,"Our daughter is approaching 2 and has consistently had issues with bedtime.  At the mention of bedtime, she will regularly start crying (but still follows me upstairs to bed). In general, one of us takes her upstairs at 7:30 pm, changes her into pajamas, turns off the lights, and turns on her nightlight. Our daughter usually helps with all of these behaviors. We then sing some songs in the dark and I pray that she's fallen asleep.  This always seems to be crap shoot. Either she's conked out and fallen asleep, in which case I can put her down and leave; the whole process taking maybe 30 minutes (out at 8:00 pm). Or she's not asleep at all, and the suggestion of leaving causes her to throw a tantrum that one of us has to mitigate or we have to endure for something in the range of 2 hours plus (she won't fall asleep until 10:00 or later).  If we let her do as she pleases, she would play around downstairs until about 10 pm and then fall asleep on the floor. This isn't acceptable to us for a litany of reasons.  Furthermore, her nighttime sleep pattern is not consistent. She's often prone to waking up at any hour of the night between 1:00 am and 7:00 am.  Is there something we should be doing to break these tantrums? Is there anything we can be doing different to keep her sleeping through the night? "
915,Bringing babies to bar?,"Full disclosure: I'm not a parent.  I was at a bar last weekend, and I saw something that was pretty startling to me. There was a woman with a baby in a baby bjorn, standing in the bar drinking and talking to her friends. I don't mean a small toddler, I mean a infant. He looked like he was at most three or four months old.  Since I'm not a parent, I'd like to know if this is frowned on by the parenting community. It's certainly not anything I would do, but her friends, the bartender and everyone else seemed just fine with it.  I happen to know that in our area, minors are allowed in bars only if it is a non-smoking establishment, which this bar is.  The place was not particularly loud; a room full of people talking with light music. Also, this was not a dive bar by any means, it's a pretty nice brewpub with probably not so much as a mild argument happening inside.  What I'm trying to ask is: Is this something people do? and What are the potential effects of being in a bar-style environment on a baby's health? "
916,Is a swim spa safe for a 5-year-old?,"My 5-year-old daughter loves to swim. She’s like a fish and always gets in the water whenever we give her the opportunity. We want to nurture her love of swimming wherever possible as it’s a great way to exercise.  This is where the problems start. We live very far away from the nearest public pool (over 3 hours drive). Our schedules allow us to take her there once or twice a month, but as you can imagine it takes up the entire day. For her the 6 hour round trip is no problem (she is excited on the way there and sleeps on the way back), but for us it’s a little less enjoyable.  We have looked into open water (natural) swimming options near us and to be honest there is nothing suitable at all. There’s a river that adults swim in, but it's fast flowing and far too dangerous for a child learning to swim.  We have looked into the possibility of getting a swimming pool in our home, but we just don’t have the space. It would be big enough for her to swim in for a while, but it would be unusable for me and my partner. We love our little girl, but paying [tex]10,000 for a pool we can’t really use isn’t really an option for us.  A friend of ours suggested a swim spa as a possible alternative. They seem to be a compact way to allow us and her to swim in our back yard. However, I know nothing about them. I can’t even find how much they cost accurately (there are no price lists online for any swim spa manufacturer and the only pricing information I have found ranges all the way from [tex]60,000).  Even the lower end of that price bracket isn’t a small investment for us, so we want to make sure it’s going to be suitable for our daughter before we actually even consider the prospect.   Are swim spas safe for young kids?   Obviously me or my partner will be closely supervising but I’m a little bit worried about accidents. Have any of you heard of a young child (5 / 6 years old) swimming in a swim spa? Are the water jets too powerful for them or can they be turned down really low?  The various swim spa manufacturers websites all say that they are totally safe and kids love them, but they don't give any ages (and they would say that wouldn't they). "
917,Why my 2 years old doesn't talk?,   Possible Duplicate:   At what age should I expect my daughter to talk?       My 2 years old daughter is very active and seems to learn and understand many things. She even talks a lot although what she says is meaningless.  One thing she doesn't do is uttering meaningful words. Is it normal at this age ? 
918,When to start looking for a new nanny if our 11-month-old does not accept her?,"We have an 11-month-old son which so far has stayed during the day with either us, the parents, or his grandparents. He is our first child and we basically cared for his every little need up to the point where he might seem spoiled. In reward he is very happy and laughs a lot and he is very playful.  He is not sleep trained, he is still breastfed plus solids, but for naps we kind of have to rock him a bit. At night he goes to sleep on his own but still wakes up frequently. He is very curious and wants to see and touch everything in the room and he is full of energy.  We hired a nanny to take care of him while we are at work and we have 3 weeks of overlap when one parent is at home with the nanny and the baby, hoping to make the transition smoother.  Unfortunately, the baby does not seem to accept her. Rarely he plays with her but cries a lot and wants for the parent to pick him up. If we leave him alone with the nanny he starts crying and he stops only when a parent picks him up. She was able to put him to sleep once because he was really tired but today he wouldn’t even stay with her. He refuses to eat from her also. It’s true that she is not extremely entertaining for the baby.  She is really a nice lady and we want to set her to succeed but I’m not sure at what point we should start looking for someone else.  Is a week a reasonable term to start looking for someone else? Is there such thing as baby-nanny chemestry in the sense that we may find a person that he accepts immediately? "
919,When is a child ready to start playing with bricks?,"Just out of curiosity: at what age is a child ready to play with its first bricks? The light, large, colored wooden ones, like these below?   By playing I mean actually creating something of of them: a structure of sorts, animals, corridors, or whatever the imagination suggests. "
920,"Do dummies (""pacifiers"") hinder speech development?","I have always frowned on the use of dummies, because my mother (who ran a nursery for 25 years) was adamant that they can hinder a child's speech development.  Our new baby is very unsettled and very collicy, and the midwife is recommending using a dummy to help settle him.  So, is there any evidence behind this claim that it hinders speech development? And if so, what is the age that it starts making a difference? "
921,What can I do if my 4-month-old baby didn't get enough milk while breastfeeding?,"I'm a new mummy and my four-month-old son doesn't get enough breast milk. I weigh him before and after breastfeeding, and found out that he gets only 1-2 oz every 4 hours. He didn't gain that much weight this month as well.  I spoke to lactation specialist, and she told me to give him a bottle, but he didn't take it. I've been trying it for 2 weeks already.   Does anybody have the same problem? Could anyone help me out, please? "
922,When do baby's gas pains usually go away?,"My daughter is suffering from gas pains. We have taken steps to reduce them, which were moderately successfull. Still, I'd like to know when will baby's gas pains go away?  When will the baby stop feeling pain during bowel movements and passing gas? What are your experiences? When did your children stop fussing/crying because of that? "
923,Are there automatic dripping milk feeders?,"Does any device exist to automatically feed the baby milk, like how a IV (glucose line) continously drips glucose water? I have in fact seen a similar apparatus (not like how I want) in breast pump manuals as additional gear. I don't know what it is called, but it was connected to the breast for mothers who could not get the milk out.  Ideally I feel these milk bottles are very old technology and I would like to see a device emanating a pipe which the infant can hold with her hands and suck as and when required, so has anyone tried such devices or are there any similar devices to replace the plain old feeding bottles? "
924,How to make my 2-year-old son stop being violent towards his older sister?,My daugther is nearly 6 years old and my son just turned 2. How can I make my son stop hitting and biting and throwing things at my daughter? Should I let her deal with him on her own or step in?  
925,What to do about a 4 year old abusing animals?,"I am extremely distraught, so please forgive my rambling and errors. Edits are welcome.  Yesterday, before I got home, my wife called to tell me that she found our son choking our kitten that we've had for about 3 months now. The cat seemed to be almost passed out, but recovered after being let go (although it was coughing continually for some time after).  This is the second time something like this has happened, but neither of us witnessed the first time, we only heard the cat yelping, and when we rushed to see what was happening, our son claimed that he was choking the cat. We made it very clear that the cat could die and that if this ever happened again, we would have to give the cat away to keep him safe.  There is already a similar-sounding question that was answered here, but there are several reasons I think that the top voted and accepted answer does not apply to my case:  It quotes Child Bereavement UK, saying children 2 to 5:     Often struggle with abstract concepts like ‘forever’ and find it   difficult to grasp that death is permanent. Their limited   understanding may lead to an apparent lack of reaction when told about   a death.   This is not at all plausible, given that my son's little brother passed away shortly before his due date because of medical complications. He only got to see his little brother once at the hospital. He still remembers this event and talks about it occasionally. He completely understands that his brother's death is permanent, and does not expect him to come back.  Secondly, in the past year, both my grandmother and uncle have passed away. It is the same with both of them. He understands perfectly well what death means in these cases, so why wouldn't he understand death in the case of an animal?  Thirdly, his mental development is extremely advanced for his age. His vocabulary, understanding of the internals of mechanical objects, and even of social norms is far beyond his age. We receive comments from other parents about this routinely.  For these reasons, I reject the idea that he doesn't know what he's doing. He said that he did it because he was mad, but according to my wife, he didn't seem mad about anything leading up to the incident, or even afterward. EDIT: Either I misunderstood the first time, or my wife changed her story, but he may have been angry before the incident due to my wife yelling at him to stop chasing the cat around the house.  I wouldn't be anywhere near as upset as I am without this additional piece of context: after this incident with our son yesterday, my wife admitted that she herself killed a cat previously (while we were already married) and lied about it, telling me that it had fallen asleep in the open washing machine, and that she turned it on not knowing it was inside. In reality, she choked it to death with her foot against the floor, and covered it up before I got home.  She claims that she doesn't know why she did it, but that she had an irrational hatred for the cat at that moment, and has felt extreme guilt about what happened. This occurred 6 years ago (2 years before either of our sons were born). My wife has no criminal record, nor have I ever experienced her being violent towards people or animals, so this is a complete shock to me.  Her admission only came about because she fears our son has somehow inherited something from her that has caused this terrible behavior.  My own marriage problems (which I didn't think I had only a day ago) are obviously outside the scope of this question, but what should I do in the near term about my son? "
926,How to wean a parent from co-sleeping?,"We have been co-sleeping since my daughter was a newborn until last month when we finally converted a small room to be her room. She is 32 months old. She has her own Twin bed now. The problem is: I can't sleep without being next to her. I have always been a terrible sleeper - taking an hour or two laying there to fall asleep. When we had the baby, I couldn't sleep when we put her in the crib because I was paranoid not hearing her breathe even though she was in the same room. So we co-slept and my mind was at ease.  As a result I have become an incredibly light sleeper. I was never a deep sleeper to start but because of co-sleeping, the tiniest movements or sounds could wake me. Now when I try to sleep in the next room, I feel like I am just waiting for her to call me in the middle of the night and I go and sleep with her.   I wanted to go on an overnight with a girlfriend but I am afraid I won't be able to sleep and it will be a miserable trip. I feel like I need to get over this before I do that so I don't waste my money.   Other things to note: I am the primary person doing the bedtime routine but my husband does participate more on the weekends when he is home earlier to read her books. I am also pregnant so I won't take sleeping pills or the like.   I am training her to stay in her room for bedtime without me laying there now. But the problem is how will I sleep? Anybody else go through this? What did you do? "
927,What is the best way to have multiple monitors for more than one child?,"My wife and I are expecting another child in a couple of months.  We have one monitor now for our daughter.  When the new baby is born, we would like to have monitor transmitters for both children.  How have other people handled this situation?  Did you get two sets of monitors and have two receivers everywhere?  Did you get a monitor system with multiple transmitters? "
928,Is 4 years old too young to expect them to try to handle their own social situations during play at home?,"My 4 year old niece is very sensitive to the tone of your voice and hates confrontation. She cries all out if she is scolded or if your tone is even remotely unhappy. I think she figured out that if she does this, a punishment if any gets thrown away and she gets coddled by a grandparent.   Is it too young to have her try to handle her own social situations? These are situations with her younger brother who is 2 years old and her cousin (my daughter) 2.75 years old and at home. So I figure this is good practice for the playground? She does not go to day-care/school yet. When she asks me for help, I tell her that she and the other kid need to figure out a solution together (not in those exact words). Sometimes they do come up with a solution. If she doesn't get the compromise she wants, she gets another adult to help. I am in the same room to hear what they come up with but not obviously observing just listening in.   Should I ease up and just intervene when she asks me to because of her age?  Could she have problems coping with not getting her way (maybe from the 2 years spent on giving in to her younger brother's needs)? Is this a personality trait or an exposure issue? Or is this what being 4 years old is like?  "
929,"How and when to tell my 5-year-old son that his ""daddy"" is gone?","I am a single mom again (as of a week ago) of a 5- (almost 6-) year-old, who is in kindergarten.   My son's biological dad and I were together 5 years but we lived apart by the time I got pregnant. He pushed us out of his life pretty much as I got pregnant. He wanted me to abort him, but I refused.   Though he wanted me to have an abortion, he was present for his birth and visited 2 times, celebrated his 1st birthday together, then he simply stopped seeing him. No support, no legal stuff done; I left the area to live with my mom. Before I left, I was starting a relationship with a man that I knew for 4 years. We did end up having a very loving relationship, a long distance one, and because my son was so young at the time, he eventually became ""dad"". We were together almost 4 years.  He wanted him to be his son. He said through the years that we were together that he loved him as his son. (We had been together a total of almost 4 years; it ended a week ago.)   I did not take lightly him being called dad. He moved in with us (multigenerational household). Things were good, but he was away a lot with his work, yet I feel we did well together and as a whole family.   Last week, he said he hated living in ""the city"" and had to leave. I was blindsided. Now my son has basically lost two daddies.   My son is smart and articulate. I don't need to talk to him about his bio dad since he never knew him, but how am I to approach him about the daddy he knows now that he's gone? Right now, I'm pretty sure he thinks he's just at work. He talks about him but hasn't asked where he is yet. He lives with me, my mom, his adult sister, including our next door neighbor, and numerous family members that visit. So he has lots of love around. No abuse. Normal, for us, family life.   What to do? How to tell him? "
930,What are the risks of posting baby pictures online?,"We've set up a Twitter account for our daughter so that interested people (friends, relatives, old ladies) can follow her, find out what she's doing and see how adorable she is. My sister heard this and started panicking over how safe it was going to be, and seemed to have a haunting nameless fear she couldn't articulate.  Are there genuine risks to posting your baby photos online? If so, what are they, and what can you do to mitigate the risks? "
931,Is it safe to breastfeed an infant while being pregnant?,"If a mother gets pregnant within 2 months of a newborn, and wants to continue breastfeeding then what precautions she should take during the later trimesters? Will the newborn or the foetus be affected? And is it safe to breastfeed? "
932,Is my pediatrician missing something about my 3 month old's gas pain?,"My 3 month old has cried out at between 4:00 and 6:00 a.m. for hours in gas pain almost every night for the past 6 weeks or so.  There have been 2 or 3 nights in this time where she did not have an issue.  She usually nurses right before bedtime around 6:45 p.m., between 12 and 2 a.m. (depending on how she sleeps), and then again sometime during the gassy episodes at around 5 a.m.  The nights when she has not had pain have usually happened because she had an unusually good first stretch of sleep and did not nurse until after 3:30 a.m.  I know it is gas pain because she is scrunching her legs up and crying very shrilly.  Unfortunately feeding her at 5 does not usually help to release gas or a bowel movement.  It does sometimes put her in a deep enough sleep that she doesn't notice the pain.  To help soothe her I usually give her a pacifier to suck on and put a gently warmed rice sock on her tummy.  I'm loathe to try more invasive things because she's usually half asleep crying.  However my spouse and I are getting exhausted from the 4 a.m. morning and I can't imagine baby is getting good quality sleep either!  I've talked to either a nurse or doctor at my pediatrician's several times describing the fact that the episodes can last up to 2 hours, basically until Baby's usual wake-up and feeding (when she often does release gas and a bowel movement because she's finally wide awake - during the day she rarely has gassy episodes and usually about 3 dirty diapers, all loose to very loose).  All I ever get is ""that's normal for her age.""  One nurse did advise the rice sock, and it does seem to help her feel better.  I've seen online all the suggestions for Mom to avoid dairy or ""gassy"" foods, but I'm loathe to complicate life with an infant further without real medical cause and I don't know of any doctor who routinely advises a breastfeeding mother to avoid certain foods unless an allergy really is suspected.  My baby doesn't spit up much that we can see but does seem to occasionally spit up and then swallow it back down.  She's pretty cheerful, though, so I don't suspect reflux.  It's just this night time episode when she's been lying still for hours after a feeding, hits light sleep, and then notices the pain.  I've heard that 4 months is the magic time when the usual gas pain will go away.  I've been planning on gritting my teeth about this whole issue until my baby's 4 month check-up and bringing it up yet again if it's still happening.  What should I say when I do, or should I try calling in yet again with other information?  Could the pediatrician be missing something? "
933,Is there an effective method for cleaning butts?,"When bathing a child (particularly a baby under or around 1 year old, who can not stand on their own yet) is there an effective way to clean all of their body parts that are usually submerged under water? What I mean by this, is that regardless of the type of bathtub you use (or sink), the bottom parts of their body (their butt, legs and privates) will be submerged under water. This makes them complicated to clean. You can try lifting them up out of the water to clean those parts, and all around them, but this is difficult to do on your own, and if the child squirms you are at risk of dropping them in the water face first. You can also hold them against you, but then you have to be ready to get soaked yourself. You can simply resort to leaving them where they are, but then you are just wiping them with a wet rag (all of the soap gets diluted once the rag goes in the water) and plus its still difficult to get into all the rolls/cracks/crevices this way. When they are an infant its a little bit easier, since they move less, and you can put them on the slanted portion of the bath, but the difficulty still holds there too.  Is there a better way? "
934,What is the role of parents in conflicts between adult siblings?,"Trying to keep this short, the main question is really in the title..  Background  My sister and I have a conflict which began about eight months ago, and I am currently not talking to her. We're both in our 20's, financially independent and have our own apartments away from home.  I don't have a great relationship with my parents at the moment. On several occasions my parents have expressed support for her on this issue and ... not-support for me. (For what it's worth, I feel that most of the disapproval comes from incomplete information on their side and the fact that, unlike my sister, I no longer follow their religion - not because my choices are objectively wrong.)  Recently there was an attempt at a family get-together and both my sister and I cancelled (independently of each other, but at least on my end as a result of this conflict). When I told my mother she gave me a lecture. She's told me several times I need to talk to my sister and ""figure it out"". (I tried, it didn't end well, which is why I'm not talking to her now.)  Main question  As a kid, it seems reasonable to bring your parents in as mediators. ""Mooom, she's being mean!"" and then mom says who's right and makes you apologize and make up.  As an adult, I've avoided the subject with them. It seems gossipy at best. For instance I wouldn't involve a mutual friend, because I'm sure it would make them uncomfortable and it's not fair to throw them in the middle of it. So why would I do that to my parents! In contrast, from what my mother has told me, my sister confides in her and has talked to her about her side of this conflict.  So my question is what is a parent's role in sibling conflicts, when the siblings are independent adults? What's appropriate to talk to them about? How do I deal with my sibling telling them all about their side of it? "
935,Can feeding bottles harm our infant?,"Here in south India, most of PDs are not suggesting the parents to take feeding bottles for their infants; the main reason is that feeding bottles are made up of plastics.  Though we affirmed that we’re using only BPA free bottles, the PDs are not happy; they suggest to use only ‘paladai-or-sangu’ to give milk or medicines.  Herewith, I’ve attached the photograph of paladai for reference   – it is usually made up of aluminium or silver.  As far as I know, our elders used this mainly because it is bacteria-free, non-toxic, boosts immunity and cools the body - mainly, it will retain and restore the freshness of water and liquids.  My son was okay (not all the time), when we gave him medicines using this paladai, however it is really, really tricky and hard to give formula milk using this – he is taking formula milk from 2 months old and now he is 4 months old.  I even sterilize my son’s feeding bottles after every feeding - sterilize the bottles with running water and hot boiling water; can someone advice what is really harmful about using feeding bottles?   What type of feeding bottles can we use then? As confirmed, we’re using only BPA free bottles – not tried with Glass bottles yet. "
936,"Do babies get the benefits of breastmilk, even if they're not exclusively breastfed?","We're feeding our 3-month-old a combination of breastmilk and formula. The ratio is about half and half.   Are we still getting the benefits of breastmilk?  I ask because when I read about the benefits of breastmilk, it seems the studies are only on babies who are fed breastmilk exclusively. Are we still getting benefits even if it's not exclusive?  We can't feed breastmilk exclusively. "
937,Should my 12 month old get milk in addition to nursing?,"I'm still nursing my 12 1/2 month old, about 2-3 times a day. I also give him some cow's milk in his cereal in the morning. Should he be getting any cow's milk in addition to this?  To clarify, I've seen a suggestion of about 16 oz of milk a day for a baby this age, and I was wondering if that was in addition to, or in place of, nursing? "
938,What is next after a baby bouncing chair?,"(UK) My girl is 11 months old and is now too big for her baby bouncer chair, which she really loves and it is convenient to put her in to keep her out of the way for a bit.  What comes next? Is there a larger baby bouncer for a 1-2 year old? Is there something else on the market? I think a larger bouncing chair would be ideal for her rather than just surrounding her with pillows. "
939,How should I address daycare reports of misbehaving 4.5-year-old?,"Our 4.5-year-old has been in daycare since three months, and at the same daycare for nearly four years. His behavior at daycare has generally been a little up and down, mostly good days with some bad days (as reported by his teachers). The usual toddler stuff; hitting, pushing, name calling (he was never much of a biter).  Lately, he's been in a class with 4 or 5 other rambunctious boys and we frequently hear of him (and them) getting into ""trouble"". My impression is this consists of a lot of roughhousing and play fighting that gets out of hand, some biting (seems to be all of them at one time or another). My understanding is at least one of the boys may have behavioral problems. The daycare doesn't do anything to discipline, no time outs for example.  So pretty much every day for the past month plus, whenever we pick up our son, we hear that he's had a bad day; i. e. hit his friends, wouldn't follow directions, running around at nap time. What are we supposed to do at home to address this? Usually, he has 'bad mornings' and does well at lunch and after nap. So by the time we get him, the bad behavior is ancient history. We haven't been asked to address it, seems like the reports are a mix of my wife or I asking, and them volunteering if it was a particularly bad day. I personally get the sense they expect us to do something because one of the teachers was asking us if we did timeouts at home.  We've talked to him about staying away from kids who get him trouble, we've talked to him about being kind, patient, and listening to his teachers, not hitting or kicking, etc. We've been talking to him about these things since he was two actually. We do timeouts at home which are pretty effective with him, one minute per year, one warning then timeout. At home his behavior is fine 95% of the time. He has a younger sister he gets along with well for the most part.  About the daycare, I will say they have (what seems to me) to be fairly high turn over. His most recent teacher was let go for not being able to manage his class. Now his class has a variety of teachers from day to day, the same four or five women. My expectation is that they manage this stuff, separate these boys if they can't get along. The last thing I want to do is be down on my kid in the evening for stuff that happens during the day. So how should we handle this at home? "
940,Gift idea for breastfeeding mom,Can any breastfeeding mothers (or former breastfeeding mothers) suggest a soothing Mother's Day gift?  I got my wife and mother of 2 some clothes and other things already but I wanted to throw in something well 'er soothing and thoughtful... like lanolin or a Boppy (she already has both).  I would ask her but that would defeat the 'gift' aspect.  I would ask coworkers but that would be somewhat creepy.  Any suggestions for thoughtful stocking stuffers for a breast feeding mom? 
941,Between parents and marijuana smoking sister,"I live in the UK with my sister, who has been smoking marijuana for about a year now. I have known for a large part of that time. She smokes relatively often, however not enough that it's a major risk (health or legal).  Now the dilemma begins. A few months ago, my parents found out through friends of theirs. They reacted reasonably and tried to discourage my sister from smoking. They asked me if I had known and I said yes, but I did not think ratting out my sister would have been the right thing to do.  A week or two later, my sister starts smoking again. I'm very confident that if my parents try to make her stop again, it will only result in her continuing and hiding it more. It's also likely (for emotional and cultural reasons), that they will never accept her smoking (any amount) and could never acknowledge that she does to their friends or relatives. Currently, they don't know that she has started again. Since my sister now knows I know, she doesn't even try to hide it from me any more.  I don't want to lose my sisters trust by ratting her out to my parents. I don't want to have my parents worry about her smoking, while I know she does. To be brutally honest and selfish, the daily stress of this situation on me is also a major factor. What ways out are there? What are the moral and emotional consequences for everyone involved? "
942,How do I explain the difference in responsibilities and privileges between the oldest and youngest child?,"""It's not fair, why can't I do/have it as well?""  This must be the recurring question that annoys me the most. Why can't the youngest do or have the same things as the eldest. Why does the eldest have to do chores the youngest doesn't have to do? etc...  How do I best respond to this line of argument, from both the younger and older child?  Would listing all of the benefits and disadvantages of each perspective help?  What are the strongest arguments for showing that the benefits of being the oldest make it not worth complaining about the things the youngest can ""get away with""?  What are the strongest arguments for showing the youngest that the benefits of being the youngest make it not worth complaining about all the things the older child can do that the younger isn't permitted yet? "
943,Actual date of conception,"When ob-gyn performs US and says ""Your pregnancy is of 6 weeks"" what does it mean:  (1) six weeks since last menses or from actual conception date?  The question is related to some interesting story: the husband was abroad at the time of the calculated ""last menses"" (woman has POS with menses 2 times per year), so if he did not know the answer to this question he could think that he is not an actual father of the baby.   In addition, the women and her husband have visited ob-gyn at the exact date of calculated last menses and the doctor did not see any signs of ovulation (or was mistaken because of POS).   So, could you clarify (2) if the doctor says ""the calculated date of your menses is...let's say 1 of April"" does it mean that the conception was around 14 of April or around that date? "
944,When is it harmless to start taking a child to the cinemas?,"This question asks ""What age can you expect a child to happily sit through a movie at the theatre""? The answers may not necessarily indicate at what age all the overwhelming sound and light stop being harmful for the kids.   AAP recommends For children ages 2 to 5 years, limit screen use to 1 hour per day of high-quality programs. I'd think this applies just as much (if not more) to theater screens and surround sound. But I haven't been able to find reliable source indicating this. I have found a lot of anecdotal evidence indicating for what kind of movies, and at what age kids can sit through the movie or enjoy it. But that is no indication of whether or not it is harmful to them.  So, When is it harmless to start taking a child to the cinemas? Both to their health and behaviour. When can we expose them to this level of sensory overloading? "
945,"How can I deal with adopted son who promised to the god he believes in to never to speak until he sees mommy again, when mommy is dead?","My 5 year old adopted son is, contrary to everyone else in his entourage, religious - a leftover from his days in a war zone. His mom died some time ago - by suicide - and since then he hasn't said a word. Instead of talking, he knocks to communicate (1 for yes, 2 for no).   Only recently I learned that his refusal to speak is the result of a promise he made to his god: the promise is that he wouldn't talk again until he saw mommy, either here in this world or in his religion's heaven. He accepts that mommy isn't coming back, but he's keeping his promise anyway.   Talking is a crucial skill in life, so I would like for him to do start doing it at some point, specially now that's he's starting school and seeing other kids. He is way mature for his age so he doesn't really feel all too happy with kids his age, but that's an issue for another day. What I really would like to know is some ideas on how to deal with the no-talking situation.   Should I be assertive? Should I ask him questions for him to be able to come up with solutions himself? Should I just acknowledge his feelings and let it happen in its own time? What kind of actions can I as a parent take in order to help him? "
946,How can I stop bad language in the home?,"   Possible Duplicate:   What do we do when timeouts are not effective?       My children are aged 6-10. The consistent use of bad Language including the F word is way out of control. Things like idiot, loser, retard -  are just so unacceptable to me. I have tried punishment like time-out but it just doesn't work as they simply won't stay in a time-out. My patience level is over the top and I'm lost when it comes to the handling of bad language. My kids have a very good childhood, always doing nice things, a large family and good parents. Does anyone have any ideas? "
947,Dad makes little effort to see his daughter - to what degree should I encourage contact?,"I have a three year old with my ex. When we separated he moved back in with his mom ( he didn't have a job, bad credit, etc... I know, I was an idiot ). These issues were a big part of our separation.   So, he now says he cannot bring the child to his moms' because she ""won't let him"". He sometimes pays a small amount of child support from his newly acquired part time job. This is the other reason he is unable to see her. Because he's working. Most parents work, I don't really see this as a valid reason.  Since his mother wont allow her there, he says he can only see his daughter by coming to our home. We tried this a few times, but it always resulted in him putting the moves on me and basically just causing more tension. So I said he would no longer be able to stay here to see her. If he wanted to see her, he could pick her up and take her with him.  So now he just doesn't really see her. At first I was very encouraging to him and offered to and did drive him to work as this allowed an opportunity for them to see each other.  He rarely calls to talk her, we always call him. Hes seen her for a couple of hours maybe in the past three weeks. I always thought they were very close, but he's making very little effort. I find myself listing her virtues on the phone with him like I'm trying to convince him of the merits of being involved with her. He says he wants to see her, but is not actually doing that.  Now she asks less and less about her dad. The past few times that she dId  see him she was upset because she couldn't go with him and it turned into does my daddy love me? Why can't I see him etc...  It obvious to me that it was very challenging for her. After a couple of days she settled back down and is happy.  So I am now beginning to think it may be better if she doesn't see him at all. Less stressful and confusing for her.  Am I obligated as a parent to try to foster a relationship between the two of them? If so, to what degree? Maybe she's just better off without the uncertainty. I would not hinder him from seeing her, but I am beginning to be reminded of "" you can lead a horse to water, but can't make it drink.  "
948,I have a negative parent. How do I tell her to stop being my counsellor?,"First off, I'd like to start by saying I love both my parents very much and I have great respect for them and what they've done for me these last 24 years.  One of my parents is very negative. She gets very personal at times and  uses language like ""You always mess things up, that's why you're the mess that you are"" instead of something like ""what you did wasn't right. It caused these problems. Don't do it again."" She doesn't realize that her approach doesn't work to influence a person as much as she would like to believe.  Now, let me explain a bit about myself. I'm the kind of person who believes in being great, and reading books that inspire, such as Goals! or Rich Dad Poor Dad, How to Win Friends and Influence People etc., and I feel that I  could learn valuable lessons from these books. I have my own style of gleaning knowledge, and a firm belief that what I'm doing is in my interest. It so happened that I didn't have a great college life. I didn't make use of peer-to-peer bonding and teamwork, and so my grades were lower than they could be. I had a great 2 years in a job after that and I am looking to switch to a new one. My bosses are happy about my performance in the job.  In the parts of the world we live in, society is such that there is a lot of comparison with other people's children. ""What's your child doing these days? Which college did he get admission in? What company does your son work in?"", etc etc. My parents, are very sensitive to this kind of societal comparison, and it has its toll on me. Also, this has led in them always telling me what to do, what not to do, whether or not(mostly not) it matches with my ideals.  Just once, I feel like clearing the air. I want to say something like ""look guys, my life is my life. I don't give a damn what the uncle next door thinks about me, so just stop telling me to get this degree or that certificate or that job, ok? I'll handle things fine on my own.""  The problem is that this isn't very good in itself and doesn't help, because of my poor ""record"". I have the power to change my own life, but no power to influence them. What can I do?  Summary  I have a negative and dominating parent. She feels I'm not doing a good job with my life based on some metrics, so she tries to influence me; but what she's saying isn't of much help. On the other hand, I have a good idea of what I want, but I want to get there on my own. So I just want to tell them to stop offering to ""help"". "
949,Helping a Tension Increaser Sleep at Night without Feeding,"My husband and I will be traveling overseas for a wedding separate from our 10-month-old when he is around 11.5 months; baby will be with my parents. At the time we made the decision, he was sleeping great through the night. For the past 2.5 months, although he goes down relatively easy (just a little walking for ~5 minutes), he wakes 3-5 times a night and will only nurse back to sleep. We have been very careful about not putting him down for bed anytime soon after nursing, and he goes down for naps without nursing, so the middle-of-the-night nursing puzzles us; he is a champion eater during the day, and our doctor has given us the OK to no longer nurse at night. Ordinarily, I think we would be OK with this and just ride it out, but the impending travel means we need to figure something out. It seems that our options are training him to go back to bed at night with something else (e.g., walking, rocking), or sleep train him. Is trying to modify his night behavior without sleep training him possible? Any suggestions on how to do it? Anytime I've tried to even cut him off from nursing early, he immediately cries and pushes away such that trying to rock him is a challenge. Baby is the definition of a tension increaser and even any sort of pick-up/put-down training method has been a failure in the past, although it has admittedly been about 4.5 months since we last tried. "
950,The children are making home messy,"I have 2 kids. 3.5 yrs old girl and 10 month boy. We live in apartment.   Daily my kids used to make mess in whole house. What I mean my ""mess"" is that they put their toys everywhere, drag their washed cloths here and there, take out kitchen items and play with those, never allow us to throw their nappy boxes and play with it. But not painting on the wall, pulling/tilting over furniture etc. They do have their room to play. But they never played there. My younger one just follows my daughter's toys. He haven't started his own messing yet.  Sometimes it is up to a point where I have to watch my every step when I walk in to house. For me it's really hard to clean and vacuum after long day at work. Whenever friends and families come over, I don't have time to clean and house looks very messy. It's really embarrassing.  This is where me and wife used to argue. I prefer a reasonably clean house with a dedicated play area. And I argue with her saying,     you haven't properly trained them to behave. You should teach them to play and pick-up the toys after that.   But she tells      kids need to learn and I should let then play creatively anywhere. And we don't have back yard as well. So this is the only option to me.   I am wondering am I reacting too much? or is it very common on every-houses with similar age kids/toddlers? "
951,Up to how many hours of screen time is OK for a teenager for educational purposes?,"My 14-year-old son loves programming and he’s been doing it since he was 10, although over the last couple of years, he’s been really serious about it. Hence, he spends around 2 hours and 15 minutes programming every day.   On most parenting websites, I’ve read the recommended amount of screen time is 2 hours because more than that may cause the teens to not exercise and move, develop bad sleeping habits, etc. But please note that I don’t let my son use any piece of technology before he sleeps (usually 2 hours before his bedtime) and he also exercises every day. So I was wondering is 2:15 hours of screen time too much or is it OK since it’s for educational purposes?   Furthermore, he loves to play video games and since it’s summer, I want him to have fun so do you think I should allow him to play for 45 minutes a day  or do you think 3 hours of screen time is too much? "
952,How to teach tolerance?,"A little background: this question came to my mind because I come from a country where most of the population is caucasian and most of the population is of the same religion. Racism is not really existent because there is no racial diversity, but there is a great part of the population that is not tolerant(to various degrees), be it on religious, sexual orientation matters or sometimes even nationality. Some do not afford travelling to places with greater diversity and most of the media is sharing conservative views.  My country is developing and there are lots of youths that begin to study abroad, but even they do exhibit certain degrees of intolerance and close mindedness, even when having a ""good education"". There are other countries where the situation is even more radical. So this results in the following question:  How can you teach a child to be tolerant towards any forms of diversity while living in a homogeneous society? How to effectively pass the idea that there is no ""Us and Them"" but that there is only humanity? "
953,Why do parents talk to young kids the way they do?,"This question has been on my mind for a long time now since I saw my aunt talking to my little cousin (let's call him Luke) a while ago, in a way treating him as ""stupid"" (I've tried to avoid saying ""stupid"" but I can't think of another way of explaining it).  Basically, when I'm with him (he is 7 years old now), we talk about a lot of stuff, the universe, videogames, films, cartoons, all the things we both like. I'm more than 10 years older than him but I still talk to him as I would talk to any other human being and I feel that he enjoys being treated like this instead of the way that parents normally do with their kids.  An example of this behaviour happened recently:     We were having lunch together, he was sitting next to me while his   mother was in front of him. He said that he was going on a trip   with his school next Friday to see an important book (let's call it ""X   Book"") at the town hall. I didn't know what it was so I asked him   like this:         What is the X Book, Luke?          Then, after him not responding for a second, his mother asked him   the same question, only phrased differently, like this:         Yeah Luke, tell us all what the book is about and why it's so important.         Something close to a teacher proudly asking a question of their most advanced student.      What happened next was him feeling shy as he was suddenly the centre of attention and then leaving the table without saying a word.   It's really hard to explain by writing but I guess some of you may have experienced this as well and know what it looks/feels like.  So, the question is, why don't parents treat their children normally instead of doing this? "
954,Car seats at the front,Is it safe to put a front-facing car seat at the front passenger seat? Do I have to disable the airbag first? 
955,How can I help my 7 year old overcome his fear of playground equipment?,"My 7 year old seems to be afraid of a lot of playground equipment. It's not the height so much as I believe that he's afraid of falling and getting hurt. (He'll climb up tall stairs and go down tall slides, run across high bridges...) We were at a playground recently where they had a wall climb, monkey bars, a mini zipline, hand over hand bars (I never learned what those were called, a twisty metal pole to climb and one of those rolling logs with the bar to hand on to. He wouldn't do ANY of it. He'd go to each thing like he was going to start, then he'd say that he was afraid and what if he fell??  I tried to reassure him that I was right there and would catch him and help him, but he was still really freaked out. How do I help him acclimate and learn to overcome his fear? He WANTS to, and I can see that he's very frustrated by his own feelings.  "
956,How to address a child having a racist friend?,"I have a son who is 10.  He plays online games with a small group of other kids of very similar ages.  I know who they are, and I know the parents, but I wouldn't go so far as to say that we are friends.  I don't even have phone numbers for most of them.    Within the games there is a side chat.  I do not always read it daily, but I scroll back and read up to current every day or so.  I have realized tonight that there is a kid in there that is racist.  What he has said in the past wasn't really certain to me, as kid speak can be a little odd anyway, but the chat today definitely had some racist tones, to anyone familiar with those terms/words/phrases.  I can promise you, my son missed it completely, in chat he even asked for clarification, as it was unfamiliar to him, and the other child said ""nevermind, went over your head"".  No other children seemed to join in or grasp what he was meaning either as far as I could tell (age range is 9-11 in this group of about 8 kids in total, 6 were on tonight).    I know I need to inform my son what it meant and to explain that what has been said is troubling and inappropriate.  I am thinking, that if a child of this age knows these references, there is a very good chance he has learned it at home, so I am unsure if I should even bother trying to address the parents of this child.  I am equally unsure if other parents are monitoring the chatting, and not sure what the ethical/moral/social expectations are regarding alerting the other parents of children chatting in there.  I would appreciate input and thoughts on this type of situation, particularly if you have ever dealt with it in your own kids.  I am sure if I think longer on it I will have clearer thoughts too.  Right now I am just upset and haven't had a lot of time to think and I was hoping that some outside perspectives might assist in clearer ideas on the best way to handle it.    So recap / TL;DR:  My kid (10 years old) is in a game chat with 7 other kids he knows. I know who the other parents are but we don't know one another well.  One kid has made racist remarks which I think the other children were confused by and didn't understand the reference based on the reaction.  Ideas on how best to talk to my son &amp; explain the situation?  Do I have any obligation to tell other parents with kids in that group what I read?  Do I bother attempting to talk to his parents and make sure they are aware? "
957,How to identify whether a 7 months old baby is waking for a feed out of habit or need?,"I am subscribed to a newsletter from babycenter.com. Just now I received a letter containing the following content:     Sleep solutions:    Once she reaches the age of six months or so, your   baby will not need to feed so often at night and if you can manage to   persuade her to drop those night-time feeds, it can be a real boost to   you all as a family. Unfortunately, this is not always easy. One   method that many parents use is ""controlled crying"", also called sleep   training. The idea behind it is that a baby of this age is waking for   a feed out of habit rather than need, and the aim is to break that   habit. At the same time, the method aims to reassure both you and your   baby that she is still all right but that nights are definitely for   sleeping.   How to identify whether a 7 months old baby is waking for a feed out of habit rather than need? Can she not be actually hungry? How would I know? "
958,How to explain addition vs. place values to a 4½-year-old?,"My 4½-year-old son has had some questions recently about numbers. On and off for months, he's been asking questions along the lines of ""What does four and two make"" or ""What is a four and a two""? At first, it was unclear whether he was asking about 4+2 or 42. Eventually it seemed to be that he was asking about what the two numbers written side by side meant, so that's how I started answering him.  More specifically, he asked one recent morning about 5 and 5 and I told him that would be fifty five. He said in response, ""But Grandma said it was ten."" I did my best on the spur of the moment to explain place values but my explanation was lacking.  I mentioned all this to the guides at his Montessori school prior to the end of the spring semester, but I didn’t revisit it with them before the summer break. The questions are persisting over the break and his summer camp is mostly play-based.  At the very least, I’d like to clear up any confusion that might have been introduced by having him pose the same question to various people in slightly different or ambiguous ways. Plus, I’d like to get him on the right track about the difference between addition vs. place values. Any tips or ideas for at-home activities, resources, games, etc. that might help him differentiate between addition and place values and otherwise reinforce each concept? "
959,How to react when a child is in a dangerous situation which requires immediate reaction?,"As with all children my son (16 months old) frequently gets himself in dangerous situations  There is no problem with somewhat ""static"" situations, like trying to climb on a chair or slowly reaching for a knife. There's always time to react quickly and calmly.  But sometimes the danger is much more acute, for instance (past experiences):   He is running through the zoo, aiming towards a crack in a fence where he could drop in a pond. (Small enough so he fits, but large enough to prevent me jumping after him, also I was still 3 meters behind him)  He took a glass someone carelessly left under the couch and started to bang it on the wall. (I was 5 meters away sitting on a chair behind a desk) Someone opend the door and he ran out aiming for the stairs.   What to do in these situations where danger is acute and may become a matter of life and death or at least serious injury?  What I did:  In the first and last example where there was really grave danger, I yelled really loud. In both cases my son was startled and froze immediately, but will this work every time?  In the second situation he actually knew he wasn't allow to bang stuff against the wall and he was testing my reaction. Which each reaction I provided (starting from a calm 'no' to getting up to actually yelling and running) he was banging the glass even harder and faster against the wall, so what worked in the other situations actually escalated this situation.  EDIT: To clarify my question:  The existing answers focus on prevention, but IMHO that goes without saying. The problem with prevention is it often fails when other persons are involved.   Situation 1: The fences in the zoo are specifically designed to protect small children, but someone broke a part of the fence which was not yet repaired. (At least that situation teached be to never believe someone who says something is child-proof without inspecting it myself :) ) Situation 2: Of course I would never give a glass to my child. Someone else put it there the day before where I couldn't see it, but my son did. (Different perspective :) ) So using plastic cups is no use unless even the adults use them. Situation 3: The room was perfectly safe, until someone else who wasn't aware a child was in the room opened the door and didn't react fast enough to shut the door or hold my son. So closing the door or putting a gate before the stairs is no use, if someone leaves it open.    Because of that I'm asking specifically what to do in such dangerous situations - if they happen. I just want to be prepared for such a bad situation instead of just resting on a sense of security. "
960,"""Never punish in anger"" - How far does this extend?","I've heard the phrase, ""You should never punish your child in anger,"" before, and it makes logical sense. However, how far does this extend? If a child, let's say a four-year-old, does something incredibly frustrating or angering, should you even avoid telling them to go away or go in the other room, if for no other reason than to allow you to calm down? "
961,How much water is too much?,"My 12 1/2 month old loves water. He will drink it whenever it's offered. He is currently being nursed 2-3 times a day, having 3 solid meals and 1 or 2 small snacks, and occasionally gets an ounce or 2 of milk with his meals. He has recently mastered his sippy cup, and I offer him water at meals and occasionally throughout the day. If I leave a sippy cup near him as he plays, he drinks from it often.   It's hot, so increased thirst is understandable. I was just wondering what's a normal amount of water for this age? Especially since he has started leaking through his diaper every single night :) Would there be any reason to limit his water intake, or can I let him drink as much  as he wants? "
962,Should I report the mother of my children to the social services?,"My partner has ADHD, she has stopped taking her medication for almost two years. As a result she developed a very selfish behaviour and our relationship has ended apart from the fact that we still live under the same roof with our two children.  I have agreed to let her stay (my house and I am the working one) because I don't want me to children to suffer. If I kick her out she would drag the children with her and go seek help from housing section of a city where her sister lives. She refused to give up on the children because she wants the benefits money. She wants to be close to her sister because her sister lives a (free) life on drug and has no responsibilities  after she abandoned her 4 children.  To summarize it I accepted my partner under my roof because if she takes the children with her they will suffer lots and end up in a very unpleasant environment.    The options I have:   Kicker her out, keep the children with me. Not an option as I can't take of the children, I work for long hours, can't afford a nanny. Let her leave with the children. Not an option as she wants to take them to a very bad environment.  Let her leave then report her to the social services, the children might end up in a foster and I cant have them Report her to the doctor and inform them that she stopped her medication, the GP will contact the social services and they might take the children   The solution I came up with:  I let her stay, she takes care of the children and I pretend not to notice that she is sexting when she is in and cheating when she is out  The problem I am having:  She isn't doing her duties towards the children, she is on the phone and playing Xbox almost 18 hours a day Children aren't getting fed properly, they are dirty all the time, the house is extremely dirty. She does not beat the children but they are severely neglected. She refuse to take her medication, she becomes violent some time with me NOT with the children. Some of her ADHD problems: she thinks it's normal to ignore all her duties, she blames everything on anybody but herself, she is very selfish as in using the children's TV or having their food.  The question:  Should I report her to the social services? what that help in anyway other than having my children taken away from me and staying in foster care? Or should I just live the solution I came up with? the children are not in foster care but neglected.  Some facts to consider:   The children are 4 and 2 years old, a boy a girl My partner had a very bad life of neglect in her childhood and she has been raped by her biological father. Her sister is a very bad influence. My partner is very known to the social services as she has abandoned other children she had from other relationships 5 times. One of my children is disabled. We live in the UK  "
963,"Why does my toddler cry when I try to put her down for bed, but not when my wife does it?","So my 2 year old is undeniably a Daddy's girl. She's always clingy when I'm home and only wants Daddy when Daddy is around. At bed time we have a routine that we follow before putting her down, but for some reason she will only settle with Mommy. When Mommy puts her to bed she will usually lay down and go to sleep, but if I do it, she'll be happy while I'm rocking her to sleep, but even if she's almost out when I go to lay her in bed, she'll say anything to keep me there with her, ""Rub my back?; Play with my hair?; Sing a song?; Kiss my Hand? Kiss my 'nother hand?"" And without fail, when I stop indulging her requests and leave the room, screaming and crying and out of bed she comes. Yet, if Mommy goes in right after me, she can settle her and put her down. We have a newborn, so it's a little inconvenient for poor Mommy if she has to deal with nursing and putting the toddler down at the same time, and this behaviour seems to have started since the baby, so I've been putting her down more than I used to. What am I doing wrong here?  Almost the exact same question as mine is asked here: Why won&#39;t my toddler sleep when her mother tries to put her in bed? But the root of that problem appears to be the mother bringing the baby to bed with her. My daughter doesn't sleep in our bed, first thing she wants when she wakes up is either breakfast, or to be bottled back to bed. "
964,Is alcohol transmitted through breastmilk?,"We have a similar Question for caffeine, but I could not find one for alcohol, and I'm sure many breastfeeding mothers are interested to know:  How much alcohol is transmitted through breastmilk?  Presuming one wants to avoid exposing the baby to alcohol, what sort of intake limits (i.e. number of drinks) or timing (e.g. delay before pumping or breastfeeding, pump-n-dump for x hours after drinking) should a nursing mother observe? "
965,Losing mind over potty training!,"Help! I'm losing my mind in this process... My 3 year old boy wants to wear pull ups and stays dry most of the time. And tells me, I'm all dry! But, When he sits in the potty... Nothing! I don't think he is connecting the dots and really understands what is supposed to happen... Is he NOT ready? Should I go back to diapers? I feel like I'm wasting his and my time!!! How do I help him ""get it""???   "
966,What factors to consider when choosing where to live,"My children are still very young and I would like for them to have a stable upbringing, preferably in one place that they can call home.  I'm fortunate to be able to re-locate, but as a fairly new parent I don't really know what to look for when considering a new place to live. For example, good schools, low crime, nice climate, and seems ok -- but that's much of the world these days.  How can I narrow it down, other than simply choosing somewhere close to family &amp; relatives? Have any parents learned lessons they can share related to choosing where to raise their kids, like something which isn't obvious that they wish they'd considered at the time? "
967,How to talk about a historic suicide in the family to young kids?,"My brother took his own life in 2000 at age 23. My kids - 10-year-old girl, 8-year-old boy and 4-year-old girl - know that I had a brother and that he died, but I have not told them anything more than that he was very ill. It is now time, their mother and I feel, to tell them what happened. We don't want them to find out from someone else. My concerns / questions:   He shot himself, don't really want to go into the details with them. How to avoid the details, or should I? Is the 4-year-old too young? It wouldn't be fair on the others to tell them but ask them not to tell her.  "
968,How long should we try to conceive before consulting a doctor?,"How long should a pair wait while trying to conceive before consulting a specialist doctor?  Is it one year like most of the sites recommend, less or more? "
969,Two year old indecisiveness,"My younger son, who just turned two a month ago, is going through one of those common stages in toddlerhood (that I remember the older one going through - but less roughly - at the same time).  His brain development skyrocketed, but it's come at a cost: he can't decide anything right now.  This is a bit complicated by his cold (which probably makes food harder to taste -> harder to decide on), but it's not just food: clothes, toys, what he wants to do.  Any time he'd normally have a choice, he sits there, says ""don't know"" for a while, then sometimes makes a choice - and then regrets it almost instantly.  For example:   Picking out clothes, he often would pick out a specific shirt, and if not, I could give him a choice of two and he'd pick one reliably.  Now, all we get is ""don't know"" and when I offer anything, ""I don't like that"".  Not a specific objection to getting dressed (we do now and always have had some of those, but I know what those look like).  Once I pick for him and put it on he's fine. Getting breakfast this morning, he really struggled.  I gave him his choices - fruit, yogurt, some cereal - nada.  I narrowed it down to two choices that he loves both of - ""don't know"".  Finally I got myself a bowl of cereal (of a cereal he likes) and told him I was going to eat and he could tell me when he was ready to decide; he said ""I want that"" pointing to my cereal.  Okay, fine, went over to get a bowl; he picked the bowl he and his brother fight over because they both love it (a dip bowl that has a christmas train on it!).  I said ""Excellent"", picked it up, immediate ""I don't want that"" cry.  He picks another bowl, okay, great. I pour the raisin bran in, he immediately says ""I don't want that, I want wheaties"" (which was on offer earlier, but wasn't what he'd said).  At this point I'd already put milk in it so it wasn't going to change, so we sat down and after some crying he finally ate a few bites, was fine, and ended up eating three (small- 1 c rice bowl size) bowls of it.   We had thought this might be hunger related at times (or head cold related), but it seems to be all the time with no stopping.  His brother had something like this for a week or two, but nothing like this - it was more that he became more opinionated and objected to everything we did out of principle.  I don't think that's what's going on here directly: I think he's probably too aware of decisions and is being indecisive.  What can we do to help him out here, other than just power through?  Is it better to make decisions for him, like I did with the clothes above, or to let him muddle around for a while?  My wife and I are both not great 'deciders', so we'd like to give him the best shot at learning how to be decisive: but we'd also like to not have him too sad because of this.    Is it a good idea to let him change his mind until he finds what he wants?  Or does that lead to a child who always changes his mind and never is happy with anything?  I'm generally happy to let him (or his brother) change his mind prior to a hard cutoff, which is usually the point when some waste would occur (milk in cereal for example). "

971,Which things should I watch out for when buying sunglasses for a 1-year-old?,"I was looking for kids sunglasses to buy for my 1-year-old. The only thing I knew is that they really had to be 100% UV protection. I was also wondering how to make them stay on the kid's face (this one is quite curious and spirited).  I came into these sunglasses for kids with adjustable straps on the Internet and started to read several reviews. I realized that there are a lot of thing I didn't imagine I could/should watch out for, like the material for the straps (neoprene?) or finding glasses which won't scratch the kid's face if the kid energetically pulls them off or that would break easily.  Without going overboard, which are the main things I should watch out when buying sunglasses for a 1-year-old? "
972,Possibly long-lasting trauma as a newborn?,"Do you know of any studies on effects of traumatic events on newborns? Can they be long-lasting? If yes, when would it make sense to think of some help (e.g., therapy)?  Situation: Three days after birth, while still in the hospital, my daughter showed signs of an infection (e.g., fever, accelerated breathing). It followed that she was put on intravenous antibiotics, a 10 day treatment. During these 10 days, a number of doctors and nurses made many attempts (sometimes even several times a day) to poke her blood vessels for the IV, while holding her still on a table, accompanied by baby's uninterrupted cry. Depending on the skill of the nurse, it would even take them 1 hour to manage. In addition, they took blood samples every day. Mom and dad were always there, talking to her, and trying to comfort her, but it was nevertheless painful (for us to watch, and surely for her to experience, at least physically, but we think also and mentally).   At 3 weeks old, baby gets fever, and she has the same bacterial infection again. Same process: 10 days IV antibiotics in the hospital, plus several other tests that required her to be still (i.e., be held still), accompanied by terrible cries. Note: She was never left alone with the health carers.  Ever since, I have noticed her distress, to say the least, when putting her on a changing table (except for when at home), on a scale (at the child health center), or similar, even if it is just me doing that, and constantly talking/singing to her to keep her distracted from the context. To the point that between 3 and 5 months I refused to weigh her at the child health center, following a 2 hour long inconsolable cry at her previous weigh in. She is now 9 months old, and although her reactions seem to have improved, they are still there. (No such reactions if she just lies on the bed, or on the floor).  I should mention that she is otherwise a happy, joyful, unproblematic baby, who seldom cries during the day. She is normally developed for her age. However, there have been periods with frequent hysterical cries in her sleep, but that seems to be related to babies' development (although I do not know if my baby has significantly more such episodes than what is considered normal).  Update at 18 months: Around 1 y.o. we couldn't notice any negative reaction to being put horizontally on changing tables anymore. She also does not seem to have any other negative behaviour that is not simply age-specific and her development is normal. So hopefully no long-lasting effects. "
973,How can I ensure that my daughter is not excessively attached to me?,"I have been a single father to my two children- a sixteen year old girl and a fourteen year old boy- ever since my wife separated from me eight years ago and married another man. I have had extremely anxious moments balancing my work and my family life, but I appeared to be doing it quite successfully until I noticed that my daughter hated associating with boys in her class.This was quite surprising to me because she spends a lot of time with me at home and never seems to be uncomfortable in the presence of a male. In fact, she hangs out with me far more often than she does with her younger brother.  All the friends she brings home are girls and I have never heard her talk about the boys in high-school. I interrogated one of my daughter's friends and came to know that the boys in her school find my daughter extremely good looking but my daughter absolutely ""hates"" these boys and calls them ""stalkers"".  A couple of days ago, we were watching a cricket match. I was rooting for England but my daughter had a presentiment that Australia would win. When I disagreed, she promptly bet me a kiss to a box of her favourite chocolate that she was right. Without giving the stakes a second thought, I accepted the wager. As it turned out, I won my bet with her. She was a bit disappointed to be honest, but proceeded to kiss me on my lips. I had expected a kiss on the cheek and found my daughter's behaviour greatly disturbing.  I have tried to convince my daughter that at this age, she should get over her attachment to her father and look for young boys to give her company, but she never seems to understand my concerns. She responds by telling me that I am the only ""boy"" who loves her for something more than her good looks. I have a feeling that the boys in school objectify her. I do my best to ensure that she isn't persecuted by such boys but I do not think a few boys can represent the entire population of males in the world.  When I expressed my discomfort about the kiss, she wanted to know why the loser kisses the winner in tennis matches? I rarely watch tennis so I couldn't reply of course.   I often have heart to heart talks with my daughter. She did tell me about her aversion towards boys but I interrogated her friends just to be extra sure she wasn't being harassed. I have found it difficult to bring up the topic of sexuality as it is considered a taboo subject here in India. Also, I haven't been able to explain to her the difference between a kiss on the lips and a kiss on the cheek. I expected her to learn from her friends but she probably hasn't.  Culture: Indian Christian  How can I wean her off me?  Edit: She often gives me hugs and cheek kisses but this is the only occasion when she has shown her affection in an inappropriate way.  "
974,Why is my 3 month old waking up 10+ times a night?,"My 3 month old went from starting on a good sleep trajectory (a five hour and 3 hour stretch at 8 weeks regularly) to waking between every 15 minutes and every 2 hours. What I'm trying to figure out is what causes the frequent night wakings. She was fighting her arms out of her swaddle and getting the fabric over her face in the process, so for her safety we taught her to sleep without it.  Plus she started sleep crying for gas pain or some other cause in the very early morning nearly every morning that we rushed to comfort.  With all that her sleep habits deteriorated.  They have been getting worse and worse since 9 weeks and at 14 weeks I am at my wits end with the double digit number of night wakings.  Reading that some people consider 4 bad was hardly comforting.  I've seen Marc Weissbluth's theory that the frequent waking issue is from some form of overtiredness in Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child.  I've tried his solution, too, which is invariably to move bedtime earlier.  Well Her bedtime has consistently been earlier than 6:30 for well over a week with no changes.  I'm sure the completely fragmented sleep is making her overtired, but earlier bedtimes are doing nothing to help.   Her naps are not yet organized (I'm despairing that they ever will be at this rate) and so she takes 4 to 5 30-45 minute naps - if she'll take them - that I offer whenever she starts yawning, looking glazed-eyed, or rubbing her eyes.  This question's accepted answer suggests hunger as one possible cause.  My little girl is skyrocketing up the growth chart and eats every 1-2 hours during the day on demand.  I feed her 2-3 times at night, but not at every waking.  I sincerely doubt she's hungry, but I'm open to being wrong.  Baby does have a pacifier, and popping it back in often soothes her back to sleep.  Would trying to wean her off of it at this early age perhaps help her learn to self-soothe, or would it just make sleep worse?  I am totally fine if she wants to suck on her fingers or thumb and get us all a little sleep, but so far every time she finds her thumb it does nothing to help her go back to sleep.  She's not really coordinated enough to keep it in her mouth.  Could it be the 4 month sleep regression come to call early?  An early start of Wonder Week 19?  Is there any solution other than to soldier through?  Is there an age-appropriate form of sleep training worth trying? "
975,My son's friends suddenly prefer to play without him. Should I get involved or let the kids sort this out?,"My son is eight and is in third form of elementary school. He is friendly, social, generous, fun, and popular among both his class mates and their parents. But recently there is a saddening development among his friends.  When my son invites friends to his home, he is always open to other kids coming, too. When he plays with ""Tom"", and ""John"" calls and asks if he can come, my son always answers: ""Of course."" He loves all his friends, and wants all of them around him all the time. We used to have three to five kids in the house on many afternoons.  My son's friends on the other hand usually have one other favourite friend. They play with everyone as a group, while in school, but at home they are content with having their one single best friend over and since a few weeks they have begun to prefer to be alone with that friend. So what has been happening for almost two months now is that whenever my son wants to play with ""Tom"" and/or ""John"", the two have always already agreed to meet, and they tell my son that they want to be among themselves and that he cannot come. And this not only happens with ""Tom"" and ""John"", but with several of my son's other friends also. Most of his class mates, and unfortunately all of his – former – closest friends, have currently formed ""couples"", leaving my son the proverbial fifth (or, in this case, third) wheel.  I don't completely understand this, and my son has no explanation either. For a few weeks now he has spent most of his afternoons alone. Only when one ""partner"" from one of the ""couples"" is otherwise occupied (usually with sports or family events), the remaining kid is open to play with my son. My son is visibly sad and hurt by the ongoing rejection, but as yet he remains true to his friends.  I'm not sure wether or not I should talk to the other kids or their parents. I don't think forced friendships work, so I hesitate to get involved, but rather hope that this is a phase and will pass.  But then, there is an additional complication. I'm the coach in a climbing group for kids from 7 to 10. My son is in that group. We have a long waiting list of kids that want into that group, and some kids have been on that list for two years.  A couple of weeks back, before the rejections started, ""Tom"" asked my son if he could join the group, and my son asked me. ""Tom"" didn't know about the waiting list. I decided to let ""Tom"" skip the waiting list and allowed him to join. I did this for my son, because ""Tom"" is one of his closest friends and it made my son happy to have him in the group. And ""Tom"" and his family will move away at the end of the school year, so his position in the group will become vacant again soon and the kid at the top of the waiting list can join, albeit a few months later than if I hadn't privileged my son's friend.  Now, at the beginning of this week, a day after telling my son that they wanted to play without him, ""John"" asked my son if he could join the climbing group, too. He and ""Tom"" allowed my son to play with them on that day.  Basically, I don't feel too good about letting a second kid jump the waiting list. I was making an exception for ""Tom"", based on the fact that he would leave the group again soon, and my infringement would not be permanent. But I must admit that if ""John"" was my son's best friend and they were playing together every day, I would probably make a second, and permanent, exception, for the sake of my son.  But now, I feel that ""John"" is taking advantage of my son's friendship towards him, while at the same time he does not reciprocate the feeling and isn't a friend to my son. Today, as usual, ""Tom"" and ""John"" rejected my son's attempts to make a date with them.  So I wonder. Disregarding the waiting list for the moment, should I invite ""John"" to the group, too, because this would please my son and might actually bring the kids together again? Or does it only bring ""John"" and ""Tom"" together, who are then both part of the group? Or should I tell ""John"" that he needs to decide wether he wants to be friends with my son, or not, and not use his friendship, if he doesn't want it? Or should I just tell him that it is not possible, using the waiting list as an excuse? Or what?  I want my son to have friends. I want to facilitate these friendships, where I can. But I also want to ""deflect"" those friendships that are, in my opinion, not good for my son (in this case, because his friendship is being used to gain access to something, not out of ""love"").  What is the right thing to do?  (Again, please disregard the problem of the waiting list. I might not admit ""John"" to the group regardless of what would be right for my son and their currently deteriorating friendship. The waiting list is a different problem, and not what I'm asking about here. I'll solve that problem with my conscience and my co-coach.) "
976,Wall decals above crib?,"There's a warning for ""do not hang wall decals above the babies crib"" on the set of wall decals we got from the store.  That was really our main plan for where to put them, as the wall above the crib was going to be so bare due to not wanting anything heavy above the crib... for obvious reasons.  Does anyone know why this warning would be present?  Is it a CYA on the manufacturers part?  Or is there a legitimate reason I'm not thinking of? "
977,Is comparing my child with others good or bad?,I have a 5-year-old child. Is it a good idea to compare my child with another child with regards to scoring marks or how they perform an activity?  I think that comparing my child with another child will give him/her a bad impression of the other child and lead to possessive thoughts about that other child.  Can anyone explain their opinion to me? 
978,What should I be teaching my two year old?,"My two year old daughter has never been to a daycare, so everything she knows is something that me, my husband, or her grandparents have taught her. She sees very little interaction with other kids her age, well, except for her 8 month old sister.   I am wondering what people, or even day care centers, teach two year olds. What do they do all day long? Presently, our daughter draws a lot - she has bathtub crayons, wax crayons for paper, and chalk for the driveway/sidewalk. She attempts to draw circles and lines. We try to teach her shapes and colors, and she has a rough idea of what they are. She plays with sand in the sandbox a lot, dumping sand all over her and her sister's head. She goes to her playhouse and uses the slide and the swing.   We sing songs together - the alphabet song or the numbers song. She is able to say the correct word when I say the phonic (i.e. if I say B, she'll say ball; if I say H, she'll say hat). She tries counting, but is still learning (she goes 1, 2, 6, 7, 8...). She enjoys building and destroying towers. We read books and I sing some nursery rhymes. She plays a toy piano and dances around to it. She plays with playdough, but most of the time it just ends up in crumbs everywhere.  She also watches TV - something I know most parents object to. She enjoys watching Dora, Finding Nemo, and Cinderella. She will sometimes watch LeapFrog phonics videos for alphabet and numbers.   I am not trying to give a resume for my daughter, but merely wondering is there something more that kids her age do? Is there something else that I should be teaching her? What do kids her age do at a daycare?   Thanks "
979,5-year-old tantrums and misbehavior - what am I doing wrong?,"My two boys are 4-years-old and 11 months; they will be 5 and 1 next month.  My oldest is exceedingly stubborn, and he's displaying strong leadership traits. When he has his mind set on something, his single focus is achieving it. He is determined to be accepted and treated as an adult, and he often lands in trouble for trying to be the parent in a given situation. He's also very smart and mischievously sneaky at times. He's a good kid, but I've struggled with bad behavior, repeatedly going against what he's told, and now mistreating his little brother by hitting and biting.  My first approach when he misbehaved was to consistently sit him in a time out. I devised a three step time out, where he had to ""climb"" the stairs to exit time out. First, he would explain why he was in time out. Second, he would brainstorm ways to avoid said behavior in the future. Third, he would sit quietly in time out for 10 minutes to think about our talk. This worked for a few months. Then, he started ignoring me and the time outs.  My next approach was to take something away when he ignored time out. This went on for three months, until I had effectively confiscated everything from favorite toys to his coveted game time on PBS. He still acted out and began melting down instead of communicating, to which I helped him learn how to breathe deeply, calm down, and then talk. He stopped doing this a month or so later.  My next, and most unpleasant, approach was to talk through his behavior, ensuring he understood why what he did was wrong and why be was being punished before being smacked on the butt twice. This seemed to work, and we had a few weeks of calm before it all began again.  I have a terrible time getting him to nap and eat well. Thinking this was a contributing factor, I began focusing on sleeping and eating habits, trying to improve them. He said he didn't want to sleep because of ""ghosts in [his] room"" before saying he was making it up so he could stay up. I was so proud of him for telling me this, especially since we've been talking about the importance of not lying or making things up. Then, he said there were monsters in his room. He seemed to firmly believe there was a monster that came out when he went to bed. So, he and I ""chased"" the monster out and set up a ""protective barrier"" to keep it and all others out. A week later, he was back to tantrum throwing at every nap and bed time because he didn't want to go to bed.  He's not a picky eater, but he refuses to eat a good meal. His reasoning ranges from not being hungry to wanting to do other things first. He's starting school in the fall, and I'm trying to help him understand he needs to eat and sleep when it's time to eat and sleep. I've tried everything from a reward system to taking things away for doing or not doing as instructed.  He's never had an issue with his little brother. And he's usually a phenomenal big brother. He was excited to have his little brother move into his room. He acts very good outside of the house, and he only acts out when he's comfortable in a place that isn't home (like Grandma's or a close friend's).  But he's constantly doing things he shouldn't and now hitting and biting his little brother. He's also suddenly having a lot of accidents in his clothes and bed, sometimes several times in one day. I'm trying so hard to stay consistent, but when it seems like nothing is working and he's constantly misbehaving, throwing tantrums, and melting down, I'm not sure what to keep doing and what to change.  His physical is in June and I intend to speak to his pediatrician about all of this. But in the meantime, is there anything I'm missing? Is there something else I can try?  I've tried digging deeper to see if there is a deeper problem or issue to address, but his answers and conversations are sporadic at best. It's very hard to tell if he's being truthful or spinning a story. And I'm worried he'll be behind in school because he doesn't apply himself. He can read, but he acts like he can't. He is super smart, but he continually downplays his abilities, and I don't know why when he's always been encouraged.  Any advice will be greatly appreciated. Thanks, from one burnt out, frazzled, and worried mum!  "

983,What factors make iPad apps a good choice for second-graders?,"Can anyone suggest what factors to look for in iPad apps for learning to read (English,  native) at second grade level ? What are the recommended ways to locate such apps ?  The main factor that I consider important is that it should be as fun as possible - not just a fancy e-book. My son is in the first grade, but he has progressed to mid 2nd grade level. He will be away with my wife and her family for a couple of months this summer and will have missed 3 weeks of school when they come back. Getting him to read books at home has not been easy and he loves to play games on the iPad (when allowed, which isn't often) so some kind of fun game, that is focused on improving reading, is what I'm looking for.

984,Where to turn for help when my 12-year-old granddaughter keeps hitting her 10-year-old sister?,"I have two granddaughters, one turns 12 in August, the other is 10 years old and is small for her age (she was a prem baby). Her parents are divorced since the older child was 5 and the dad has a new partner and child and has no interest in his girls.   The older one is for ever hitting her sister. This behaviour has been going on for years and she won’t stop. I have suggested to my daughter my older granddaughter needs counselling. My husband and I have talked to our older granddaughter to try to get to the bottom of this, but it keeps happening. My daughter has withheld privileges and it hasn’t made a difference. Her mother (my daughter) says she cannot cope with this anymore. We are all at our wits' end.   Has anyone dealt with this and what worked? To whom can we turn to for help? "
985,In which language to speak to third parties when following the OPOL approach?,"I am a native english speaker settled in the Netherlands; I speak fluent (but not very grammatical) Dutch. I now have a granddaughter Rosie of two months and her mother (my step-daughter) has suggested that I speak only English to her, so that she will grow up bilingual (a variant on the One Parent One Language (OPOL) approach). They live close by and we see them almost daily.    This sounds like a good idea to me, but which language should I use with third parties (typically the mother and the grandmother, my wife) in Rosie's presence? Should I answer their Dutch questions in Dutch or English? All parties involved (family and friends) speak enough English to handle both languages. My automatic reaction would be Dutch, but I think I can train myself to always use English in Rosie's presence.    Conversely, how important is it that the Dutch people speak Dutch? For example, I recently said to Rosie: ""That was a nice big burp"" and my wife echoed me with ""Another big burp then"" instead of the Dutch equivalent ""Nog een grote boer dan"" which she would have otherwise said. Will Rosie get confused in such situations?    Fortunately we have a few months before Rosie will actually begin to recognise words, but I'd appreciate advice, both for me and the other parties.    Extra information if it's relevant: the father is absent but visits occasionally, is Dutch-speaking. Rosie will have very little other exposure to English apart from TV and adverts (English is very trendy in Dutch adverts). Rosie's biological grandfather died in a car accident, I married his widow and have excellent relations with the children (Rosie's mother and uncle).   "
986,At what point does confidence become obnoxious over-confidence?,"My 5 year old has just started primary school, and for the most part he's taking the change from Kindergarten very well. He was a little shocked by the fact that he had to sit and learn instead of playing all day but he's always taken to new experiences very well.  His teacher has commented on his surprisingly high confidence levels (something my wife and I have always tried to nurture as we are both very shy/quiet people) stating that, while most new students will not venture far from their classroom for the first few months, within two days they had to go looking for him after lunch and found him at the other end of the school playing ""tackle"" rugby with the 12 year olds.  My wife and I thought that was great. However the other side to this confidence is an increasing lack of respect for authority figures. My wife went to pick him up last week and found him in a Mexican standoff with the teacher and assistant teacher, refusing to pack his bag for home time because he had lost his water bottle and they wouldn't let him wander the school looking for it. The situation itself was (and still is) hilarious, and while I want him to stand up for himself I don't want to encourage him to defy teachers/authority figures so aggressively in the future.  How can I re-enforce the idea that he should do as he's told at school, even when he only wants to break the rules to do something positive (like find his lost belongings)? All without discouraging him from defending his ideas? "
987,Do girls and boys need different toys?,Do girls and boys really need different toys especially when they are very young? I am speculating part of reason why girls tend to play with Barbie dolls and boys tend to play with transformers is:   Parents make decisions for them.   Would girls play with Lego at all? 
988,Help dealing with son addicted to video games. Would this app work?,"My son is 15 years old and plays video games all the time. His grades are quite low now. I already tried a couple of things like rewarding him when he is studying, but with no effect.  I heard of an application that uses video game content in his studies. For example, instead of the generic practical exercise, it includes video game elements from real games. For example, there is an exercise about physics that uses a dragon falling from the sky and it asks to calculate the force air does in the dragon bodY (the dragon being a real dragon from a game he knows)  Do you think this a good approach? Would you try something different? "
989,"Should I call my sad, almost 5-year-old on holidays with grandparents and his sister?","I have an almost 5-year-old son and an almost 3-year-old daughter. My children are on holidays with grandparents far away for a week. They had the same holidays last year and it went smoothly, but this year my son cried during and after the travel there (with grandparents). He knows his grandparents well and is always happy to meet them, He sees them up to 8 times/25 days a year, and we also have been there recently. I would say they are comforting - they hug for a soothing.   I did not talk to him since I do not know if I make it worse or not. Grandparents say it was ""just sadness"" and after ""cry out"" he is fine. They also suggested it is OK for me to call, and they will probably Skype us today evening. In general my son is not overly attached to us, he can spend a day with relatives/friends just fine. I think he is sad because of being separated from us.   Now I am wondering whether I should call him and talk to him during holidays (we did not last year). On one hand it could brighten his day and encourage him to enjoy the time spend with his grandparents, but on other hand it could sadden him more.   My son is the sensitive type compared to my daughter. Last year, we expected they would rely on each other in such situations. I will probably wait a day to see how is he doing there.  Should I call my son if he remains sad? If yes, what should our conversation look like? I would guess I should talk about what they will do with grandparents. "
990,My daughter wants me to read other's minds,"My 8 year old is constantly asking me, why is that person not being safe? or why did that person do that?, why did my friend say that?... I try to tell her my best guess or I say I can't read other people minds.  Neither is getting her to stop asking these types of questions. Any suggestions on this? "
991,Should we introduce screen time to our 27 month old?,"Somehow, my wife and I have made it through 27 months of virtually no screen time for our daughter.  We thought we were doing what's best for her, but we're starting to fear it's going to come back and bite us.  To elaborate...  My question is spurred by the fact that recently I let her use my phone on a video chat with Grandma and I had it locked completely down so she couldn't do anything.  This was the first time we had tried this, and after the call ended she carried my phone around for a half an hour refusing to part with it.  When I finally insisted on getting it back, it was the ultimate meltdown of her young life.  Both my wife and I were stunned.  It was not her first video chat, but the first chat where she got to hold the device solely herself. She could not manipulate the phone so to speak as all the controls were off, including the touchscreen.  She sees her parents, other adults, and some kids with electronics that she is not allowed to see or hold, though she desperately wants to.  By keeping screens from her so stringently, is she more likely to be obsessed with screen time later?  Would she be better off now if they had been a small part of her daily life from the get go? "
992,Do baby massages improve motor skills and emotional development?,I find a lot of parents take their baby to get baby massages. I have heard that babies who receive periodic baby massages (such as once a week) are showing rapid development in their motor skills and emotional development. Is that true? Are there any good references to support this claim? Are the massage techniques something we can perform at home on our own? 
993,How to make our son use tissue in toilet,"As Muslims we are use to using a Bidet shower  for purity reason. We moved to the UK some time back and now we have a toddler who is soon going to go to playgroup nursery. One of the requirements the teacher said is that he should be able to use toilet.   First, I find it hard to understand that a 3 year old can use toilet himself. Secondly, as we are use to bidet shower, even I have trouble using toilet paper for bum.  At the moment I wash him in home as he is still learning to tell me when he has urge to go to toilet and sometimes he misses it as part of training.   How do I teach my son to use toilet paper and the right way? How do I make him comfortable using it? "
994,Why should children be rewarded for good behaviour?,"I have been reading about star charts and other reward systems for children, and wonder whether rewarding what I would call normal behaviour (e.g. do your chores, don't hit your little brother, etc) is not counter-productive in the long-run. If children are raised on the premise that they should get something every time they do something that is really part of their daily normal routine, won't they carry this type of expectations into adulthood? Is it better to limit rewards to behaviour that exceeds expectations?  Note : I guess this question may trigger opinions rather than answers so looking to the community to provide guidance and perhaps reword the question differently. "
995,Are there any effects from lying to your children?,"As working parents, sometimes my wife and I resort to lying to our children when we are going to work, going out or leaving them behind in the house. If I have time I normally try to talk to my daughter, giving her reasons why I need to leave the house. This generally works if I have the time. If I don't I sometimes take the easy way out and tell the maid to take her upstairs a while or out for a little while, then proceed to sneak out.   My question is, will this kind of ""lying"" to her have any long lasting psychological effects of her when she grows up ? What would be a better way ? "
996,What to do about a 4-year-old who has reverted to peeing in her pants and wearing diapers?,"My 4-year-old daughter was potty trained at 2 or maybe 2 1/2. At night she had quite a few dry nights, but not all were perfect; so she has worn a pull-up while sleeping. During the day we never had any issues though. Recently she has reverted. She now pees her pants over and over. She has not pooped them yet and she'll still go to the potty for that. But she no longer goes pee on the toilet.  We have had to put her back in diapers. She seems excited by this and is now happily using this to go in. Again, not poop - just pee. She says she doesn't know why she does it.  We cannot figure out if some event caused this or why this would be. A doctor wasn't any help. How might we try and correct this behavior? What could be the underlying cause?  [Edit] - Though I marked an answer below I thought I'd update this question with the ended outcome. She got worse after the post and began hitting mom and other children, yelling, and throwing tantrums. This was only during daycare. For this reason we believe it was all a ploy for attention. Being that babies get the most attention this could explain the diapers.  We believe she simply doesn't want to share mom with other children in the home daycare. We put her into external daycare 2 days per week. We hated to do it. She behaves there just fine and is improving at home from it. "
997,Can children be educated without a family by professionals?,"Disclaimer This will seem a very odd question to most of you, but it fits the topics of this site and I don't know anywhere else to ask it. In case you are wondering, what follows is perfectly serious. I am not trying to troll you.  I would like to ask if there is a place where a child can be fostered by professional education experts, in a community, family-less institution, with high standards and without second purposes such as pushing a specific religion or a way of life onto them.  Why not an orphanage? Something like an orphanage is a first approximation, but orphanages are usually a last choice for children, in terms of quality. Educators try to do their best with a high share of problematic, traumatized children. Since they do not have parents to answer to, they are not strictly controlled for the quality of their job. They are not the best paedagogy experts the market can offer, but a last resort for children who have no other alternatives. Moreover, orphanages are often run by religious institutes, which have their own beliefs to advance. Think something more like a permanent non-religious boarding school which goes from 0 to 18 years than an orphanage.  Why not a step-family? Step- and foster-parents are also universally seen as a second choice. The child would still grow up in a family-like environment, not with professionals, with all the inefficiencies I perceive in the family model. Foster-parents are not experts in any sense of the meaning, and may feel less emotional attachment to the step-child (especially if they have other children of their own). The child would know that they are in an ""inferior"" arrangement than their school friends. To sum up, for the child, a step-family has all the cons of a biological family, and less pros.  Why not a commune? Mostly, because of the people. People in communes often have their own peculiar view of life and personal beliefs to advance. The leading principle is ""we grow up our children, together, our way""; not ""we have professionals grow up our children in the best possible way"". If I were to join a commune as a parent, I'd have to take my share of the burden of educating and caring after children, probably in equal shares with the other members, and I don't feel qualified. I could fit a role in which I teach them lectures in my area of expertise, but I don't think I am the right person for taking care of a child 24/7.  Why am I asking this? This is a theoretical question; I have no children and I am not expecting any. But the answer is for my own child, potentially. I do not believe in the traditional family model. I find it inefficient and dangerous for the children: most parents are not well qualified to grow a child, in my opinion, and I am no better than them. I would like to try a more centralized institution, an alternative to the family model in which children grow up as their parent wish. I realize that this may be costly, but raising a child in any other possible way is expensive, too.  Have I read too many science-fiction books? Perhaps. This is completely different from the traditional view of family. But with 6 billion people in the world, I would be  surprised if no one ever tried something like this.  So, my question is if such a place/institute exists.     Is there any institution that does this in the world?   I am based in Europe, so a European solution would be most welcome.  I am not trying to discuss the merits of this view with respect to a traditional family; this would be subjective and argumentative and too broad for a Q/A site. I am just looking for pointers. "
998,How do you respond to minor injuries?,"I have a 21-month-old daughter. Sometimes (not always), if she bumps her head, or stubs her toe, or whatever, this results in crying and asking to be held (and not wanting to be put down once the crying has stopped).  My current response to this is to   accept her request: she's upset, and I don't want to withhold support make a show out of examining the hurt spot, giving it a kiss, telling her that she's OK try to draw her attention elsewhere (""hey, look at this!"", ""what's mommy doing?"", etc), hopefully hooking her onto it so that she forgets about being upset and lets me put her down (and hopefully also teaching her something about how to deal with pain)   However, recently a family member visited. When one such scene happened, this person's immediate response was to sort of smirk at my daughter (daring her to be upset? haughtiness because she's seen this before? I don't know), and to mock her crying by saying things like ""oooh, it hurts sooooooo much!"" (Incidentally, this seemed to make the crying last longer, in spite of me trying to comfort her.) This person had raised her own daughter pretty much by sending her to her room whenever she cried; after the crying was over, the child could come out and talk about it.  I used to agree with this method, but now I find it a little harsh (seems like it denies emotional support when requested, thereby creating a situation where the child isn't automatically accepted - and of course the mocking is bad). However, I do worry that I may be ""spoiling"" my own daughter, or teaching her to whine over nothing, or whatever.  Am I being too ""soft"", or am I falling for a dangerous cliché? It seems like this sort of ""it's only a big deal if somebody's watching"" behavior is normal, but is there a risk that it will continue (and if so, what causes it)? "
999,How to make a 3.5-year-old stop deliberately waking up her 1-year-old sister?,"We've got two daughters of 3.5 (B) and 1 (L) years, respectively. B's behaviour is sometimes a bit reminiscent of what was described in someone else's earlier question.  The particular issue/situation that I would like to inquire about is that, for the past six months, virtually every time L is on a good way to enter one of her afternoon naps1, just when she seems like she's falling asleep, B will deliberately make some noise to wake her up.  Similarly to the linked question, I suspect B sometimes resents L for taking away everyone's focus on her. This is what makes this situation particularly frustrating to us - L's nap (can be one or two hours) would be the one time where B could get our full attention. I'm personally looking forward to playing with B2, but somehow, B manages to sabotage that opportunity herself. As a result, L is awake again, and she'll take up a part of our attention again.  My question, thus, is two-fold:   Why does B do this and how do we encourage her to stop it? I'd like to let B notice the advantage of having our attention while L is napping, but B prevents that from happening in the first place. How should we react right when the issue occurs? We have tried some ways of stopping the noise (most straightforwardly, telling her to be quiet for a moment, or firmly covering her mouth with a hand ...), but that just makes her playfully find other ways to keep up the noise level (humming loudly, clapping, ...).   Some more data points:   If the children are in the same room when this happens, this plays out as described, and B is successful in her quest before we can bring L out of the room. If we bring L elsewhere in time, but B realizes L is about to sleep, B will start walking through the house, yelling ""L, wheere aaare youuuu?"" ... or B will immediately state she's tired, as well, and wants to sleep where L sleeps, promising to be quiet. Either, we grant that wish, and she'll noisily join L, waking her up, or we deny it, in which case B will throw a noisy tantrum, waking L up even through a couple of doors/walls. When we ask B why she does what she does, she'll state ""L isn't allowed to sleep."" (""... isn't allowed to ..."", without any further explanation, is her favourite complaint when she doesn't like something the way it is, anyway.)     1: It's somewhat hard to achieve, she easily feels disturbed by noises, and if the attempt for a nap fails, she might easily stay awake throughout the day, ending up cranky in the evening. At the same time, spending 20 to 30 minutes to make L sleep several times a day eats away non-negligibly from our time, as well.  2: Admittedly also because, well, toys compatible with a 3.5 year old are still a bit more interesting for an adult than those compatible with a 1 year old. "
1000,Should you teach your children to identify letters or write letters first?,"My oldest daughter is 3. I'm trying to teach her how to read and write (in English).   My daughter can recite the alphabet A-Z, but cannot identify the letters. She can trace over letters that I write very lightly in pencil, but can't write letters on her own.  In the old-fashioned rote way of learning, if you want to learn a quotation, for example, you write it 100 times. So perhaps she would be better at identifying letters if she could write them.   Should I focus on having her identify the letters first? Or should I focus on having her write the letters on the page as a way to identify them? Which method is more effective at introducing literacy; or some other introductory method that I am not using? "
1001,"How can parents avoid their child becoming a ""whiner""?","Inspired from my previous question, but distilled to be more specific:  What types of parenting would cause a child to become a ""whiner?"" By this, I mean that the child becomes someone who tends to use complaining to authority figures (exaggerating the difficulties s/he is facing) as the first choice for resolving problems.  Where I come from, the ""common wisdom"" seems to be that comforting a child for things that ""shouldn't"" require comfort (like minor pain from bumping one's head) encourages this behavior, and that the preferred method is to not ""give in"" to the child's cries for attention. Is this true? "
1002,Strong-willed child? What am I missing?,"My 6, almost 7 year old is so strong-willed that it's crushing me and destroying our relationship, as I'm getting to the point that I dread being around her. She can be so fun and nice one minute but then turn on you and be downright hateful at times. Most of the time I can handle the fits to my no's, it's the non-compliance on things that must get done that I'm really struggling with.  Two of her biggest issues are getting dressed in the morning and now homework. Getting dressed has been an on and off issue since she was 3. I have at times wondered if she could have a sensory disorder but she can go months at a time wearing pretty much whatever then suddenly go back into the daily fits where she will pull almost everything from her drawers, trying on a few things here and there, and end up in a fit on the floor. You would think this might only be a problem when she has to go somewhere she doesn't want to but there are many times where we can't get her dressed to go to a birthday party or the beach or a movie. She will lay on the floor and scream that she really wants to go but doesn't want to get dressed. This can last for 2+ hours.   This year for school she has picked out one outfit she wants to wear and has worn it everyday so far (17 days). She puts it on, no problem. One morning it was in the washer (it was a weekend) and she melted down and waited for it to be dry before she would get dressed to go play outside.  Our other issue is homework. She is only in first grade but has had homework since last year. It became an issue for her at the end of the kindergarten school year. It wasn't difficult, some of it was a dot-to-dot for example, but she just didn't want to do it; the same with nightly reading. We pushed through and I was determined to get into a better routine this year knowing that there would be more difficult work this year. We are already having battles. Yesterday it took an hour to complete her homework. 20 minutes of actual work, and 40 minutes of whining. Tonight it consumed our entire evening 2-7pm. Granted we had a snack and dinner in that time but nothing else fun until the work was done. She went to bed with it still not completed. I do think it's too much work for first grade and I'm going to speak with her teacher tomorrow after school but even if she can get by with not doing it this year, I'm worried that it's giving in to her thinking that if she doesn't want to do something she doesn't have to.  I see 1-2-3 Magic suggested here and we already do something similar to that, ignore undesirable behavior etc., but what do you do when your child won't comply with things that must be done, like getting dressed, hygiene, and homework? I am stressed to the max and while ignoring her behavior today she continued to follow me around and at one point sat on top of me and said ""I'm just sitting here enjoying watching my mommy be frustrated"". Psycho?  I should also mention that while her behavior has generally been contained to our house, her recent behavior during two separate playdates was horrendous. She was so bossy, mean, and rude that both playmates (mind you, this is two separate occasions) asked to go home. While she wanted them to stay she was in no way remorseful for her behavior. She is also complaining that her friends from kindergarten won't let her play. I imagine it's because this behavior is starting to rear outside the house.   Btw. I feel like I have tried everything... bribing, yelling, begging, giving choices, limiting choices, threatening, sticker charts, praise. It all falls on deaf ears. I honestly feel like if my daughter doesn't want to do it, she won't. Is there something I'm missing? "
1003,Answering questions about why words are pronounced/spelled as they are,"This question is based on English, but many other languages might have equivalent issues (if, perhaps, less frequent).  My almost-five year old is learning to read (has learnt, really), and is a very bright guy.  He's picked up on the various basic rules of phonetics fairly well, and is roughly at the Easy Reader Level 2-3 level.  When sounding out words with me, he'll often ask me why a particular word is spelled or pronounced the way it is, pointing out that it doesn't have X characteristic that it normally would - something as simple as why the y in ""by"" is a long y sound, while in ""blobby"" it is a long e sound, often (vowel sounds in English being some of the most confusing).  I'm not someone who is an expert on pronunciation, so my answer is often ""I don't know, it just is.""  I try to give tips for recognizing other similar words (such as, when it's a ""short"" word it's more likely to be long, like by or be, while if it's in a longer word it's more likely to be shorter), but I definitely don't know the why about most of it.  Reading this question made me realize that the why often is determinable, but of course I'm not going to become an expert in english pronunciation fast enough for my son (probably not for my 3 year old, at the rate I learn these things).    This leads me to my question:  How can I answer my son's questions about why syllables are spelled and pronounced as they are in a way that both helps him learn, and stokes his curiosity to continue learning?  What elements are most helpful to cover, both for myself (to be able to answer his questions) and for him?  In particular, I imagine there are several approaches I could take:   Language of origin (Greek, Latinate, Germanic, etc.) Word construction ('c' is hard when followed by 'o' or 'a', soft before 'i' or 'e') Rhythm/spoken language reasons (the example question, as to why ""christ"" is long but ""christmas"" is short)   Are any of these better to focus on, given I cannot learn all of any of them not to mention all of all of them?  For a young child, in particular, which will be more effective (or other approaches I have not listed)?  He does understand other languages exist (and knows some Spanish) and has some concept of other countries and cultures. "
1004,Migrating to another continent between vaccines,"I am planning migrate from overseas to my homeland when my infant becomes around 3 months old, she is 1 months old now. Though she will start some vaccines soon in two weeks. However, we cannot finish all, so in the middle of some vaccines (e.g. rotavirus, Hepatitis B, HiB), we will migrate.  My question: is there any problem with getting the first dose away, and remaining doses in my homeland country? Any pros/cons, anything I should be careful, such as should I wait sometime like a week or so after the she got her dose before travel?  I asked a few doctors, they said it is totally fine, though I heard a guy whose  child died, because doctors on the both side did some assumptions, and overlooked the risk factors. "
1005,"I want to expose my 5-year-old daughter to boys and girls toys equally, but she just turned her nose up at Star Wars. What do I do?","My aspiration is to give my daughter experiences of boys and girls toys.  My background is that I work as a software engineer and had experiences of LEGO, Meccano, programming and sci-fi movies. I don't want to hold that stuff back from my daughter.  She has decided at an early age (2) that she is a ""girly girl"" who likes pink, princesses, etc.  My question is: I want to expose my 5-year-old daughter to boys and girls toys equally, but she just turned her nose up at Star Wars. What do I do?  (Perhaps - what is the bounds of her and my responsibility on this issue?) "
1006,How to avoid food waste while not forbidding experiments with food?,"To give a bit context: We are quite relaxed with food and eating. Our daughter (3 years old) is free to decide many things about eating. Most of the time she may decide what to eat (as long as she does not get too excessive with chocolate spread and the like), we would never force her to eat up and we'd like to not endorse, but at least tolerate experimenting with food, for we believe that it's kind of important to experience the world around you with all senses.  However, there are some restrictions:   She will not get another of the same kind if she still has some She will not get more when she has already requested about 2 or 3 different foods   Anyway, we'd like to avoid wasting food, too. It's not that much of a problem with not eating up, since we can eat it up, but a bit more with the experimenting part. Generally speaking we have the rule, that if she experiments with the food she should eat up, for she usually leaves the food in a condition that nobody of us would like to eat it. Anyway, we still do not want to force her to eat up, hence we're kind of stuck to tell her (determined, but still calm), that we are angry about it, but there are no real consequences.   Sometimes it works giving her a bit of her food to experiment with and the rest will remain ""untouched"", but she can be very quick pouring her whole glass of milk in the bowl, at least rendering the milk undrinkeable.  Are there better strategies to avoid food waste while not forbidding experimeting with the food? How could we explain the whole matter to her, better?   "
1007,When to teach children to use search engines?,"I want to teach my kids how to use search engines as soon as they start asking questions. I think it's a good way for them to learn everything they want and to know that they are capable of knowing everything. I would like them to learn to try to find out things by themselves before asking me how to do something or what something means. Of course, when they can't figure something out I will help them immediately.  Is it good to teach a young kid to use search engines like Google? Or should I teach them when they're older? "
1008,What's the father's role in forming attachment?,I've read some material about the mother's role in forming good attachment in children under the age of one year.   My question is - do you know about the role of fathers in forming attachment?  Let's take a real example: If the father leaves a newborn for one year (relocation) - do you think the consequences will be irreversible?  
1009,Acting up for Daddy,"My partner's 4 year old daughter lives with us. I look after her more than my partner. She is generally well behaved, polite little girl and we have lots of fun. As soon as Daddy comes home she turns into this demanding whiny little brat. I can not stand it! I think it is because Daddy is much softer than I am so she knows she can be more demanding and play him up. Is this learned behavior? Why is she so well behaved for me? "
1010,Is my 4-year-old too dependent on over-the-counter medication?,"I have been concerned about a particular behavior from my 4-year-old and am hoping it is just unnecessary worry.  We are not by any means big on giving our children over-the-counter medication. We use antibiotics when they are necessary and only provide Tylenol when fevers are high. Lately, we have noticed that when our 6-year-old is sick and receives medicine, our 4-year-old will immediately claim to be sick and want the same medication, even if he feels fine. As expected, we decline that request. When he actually does have a fever and receives Tylenol, he consistently spends the next several hours requesting the medicine again. I can't help but feel like this is an indication of an addictive personality.   Is there anything that can done to help this situation, or is this simply a child who likes the taste of Tylenol? Does anyone recall their children exhibiting this trait and seeing it develop into something more serious?     Some say that it is simply an association with being sick. This might be true if we gave him medication every time he is sick, but we do not. It might also be true if the correlated special behavior was something he wants. Instead, we do not allow TV when a child is home from school so it does not become a reason to be sick. Instead, the pattern I see is he feels better after taking medication and then tends to want it more (as any normal person would). My concern is because he keeps wanting it after the fever has dropped, as though he correlates it with the reason he feels better overall. Hope that clears it up. "
1011,2.5 year old afraid of other kids,"My daughter has been going to daycare, 3 days a week, for a year now, but she is afraid of other kids.  We are told she doesn't interact much with other kids, as she prefers the company of the adults who work there.  When she is with us, anytime a kid comes to play with her, she either freezes or ignores the kid and runs the other way. Even if it's a kid she knows from daycare.  However, at home, she'll talk about them cheerfully.  Is the fact that we don't talk to her in the language of the country she is being raised in a factor ? (see this question ; we chose not to, but we can)  What can we do to help her ? "
1012,How to encourage our 6-month-old baby to play on his own?,"My baby is 6 month old (8.4 kg). He has a fancy play gym with plenty of lots of toys. We also have plenty of books to read to him. We make him play with our dog (poor doggy!). He also loves playing with leaves outside while we hold him in our arms.  Baby playing in the early morning  In the morning, in the first hour of awake time, just before his first nap, he is generally quite able to play on his own. He can turn on his side to catch toys and play with them. When I try to interact with him, he mainly shows interest in his toys.  He is not very good at turning from his tummy to his back yet (he is usually in ""airplane mode"" when on his tummy) and he sometimes complained to be turned back on his back. During tummy time, he is sometimes playing with whatever toy we put in between his arms (or some other toy that is nearby at the moment he flips over on his tummy). He sometimes looks at himself in a small mirror that is by the side of his play gym or just looks around a little bit. Often, he goes airplane mode and starts fussing though.  Baby playing during the rest of the day  During the rest of the day, however, things are very different. He refuses to play on his own. He does not really try to reach for toys, he accepts when we put one in his hands but starts fussing just 5-10 seconds later. During the whole day, we either directly play with him, often read him stories, walk him outside to allow him to grab leaves and things. If we play in a given position (say, sitting together in our bed), then he is good to play for about 15 minutes and then he needs to change activity. He refuses to be lying down and he does not enjoy to be in the carrier if he cannot reach for things to play with.  I would tend to think that his fussing behaviour is unrelated to the developmental of object permanence as he complains just as much if we are present but don't actively do things with him.  Parent-specific behaviour  In the morning, he typically is with me and during the day, he is with my wife (hence she gets most of the fussing). When I am present during the day (I stay at home about 4 days a week), he fusses just as much as when he is only with my wife. I am unsure as to whether our behaviour affects our son's envy to play on his own and whether we can do anything to make our son more at ease with playing on his own.  Question  Can we encourage our son to play on his own? How can we do that? "
1013,How to decide which stroller to buy?,There are so many kinds out there.  What is the most important thing to consider? That it would be easy to close it or that the child will be facing toward you? 
1014,Nursery & Preschool and Schools,"I think this is a question about 'how does this work'. We live in Norfolk, UK, and my toddler is coming up to 2. We understand that she should start attending some kind of nursery / preschool thing. But it seems that the preschools lead into primary schools - is this normal?  Do we get a choice on what primary school she goes to, or is that already decided? Someone told us we should be looking to get on a list?   I'm a little concerned about the little'uns social skill development. She goes to a couple of things, but doesn't really get much time to interact with other toddlers, and spends the rest of the day running round the house causing chaos. She seems to be a bright young thing, but doesn't talk really, just ... chaos. "
1015,Alternatives and/or weaning for late-night milk formula,"My toddler is 1 year and two months old; he's no longer breastfeeding, and the only time he drinks formula is when he wakes up in the middle of the night (usually, he wakes up once a night, takes a small bottle, and goes right back to sleep).   Over the past several weeks, he's been suffering diarrhea, which seems a direct response to the formula. (It started when we once gave him an off-brand formula, but then continued with our regular brand and we also tried a non-dairy variety. Whenever we managed to get him through a night or two without, the diarrhea would stop. Besides the diarrhea he's been absolutely fine and cheerful.)  The problem is, we don't know what to do when he wakes up in the middle of the night. He's used to getting a bottle, and cries hysterically until he gets it. He doesn't want water or sweetened herbal tea; as soon as he sees it isn't white, he bats it away.  So I'd like to know:   Is there some other drink I could be giving him? Alternatively, should I try to wean him off midnight snacks entirely, and if so, how?  "
1016,Toddler has trouble keeping balance on bicycle - will training wheels help?,"My child (five years old) is learning how to ride a bicycle. At the moment she can ride a few meters on her own, but quickly loses her balance. Therefore I practice with her regularly, by walking by her side and gently holding her by the arm so she does not fall.  This works reasonably well, and she enjoys the practice, however I am not sure whether this is the best approach - in particular, it seems her balance is only improving very slowly.  There is a general question about learning how to ride a bike, but my question is specifically:  Would it help to have training wheels on the bicycle?  I have heard they do not help a child how to keep the balance, because they completely change a bicycle's handling, making it more like a tricycle. Is that true? Or does it make sense to mount training wheels as an interim solution? "
1017,How to help my 5-year-old when other children don't want to play with him?,"My 5-year-old is in Kindergarten.  I work at home and I pick him up from the bus stop every day.  Everyday, the first thing out of his mouth after school is, ""Can I have a play date with so and so (person varies)?""  I really really want him to play with friends for multiple reasons - not the least of which being that I need to work, and I get less done if he's around - and so in spirit, I'm more than glad to grant his request.  In practice though it ends up being extremely painful.    First of all, I don't think we've ever had somebody come to our door asking to play with him.  But, he's young, I don't know if that means too much.    More importantly though, I watch him play with kids and attempt to play with kids, and it seems like they don't want to play with him.  I also watch the way he behaves around them, and for lack of a better word; he behaves ""weird"".  Other words that may fit are ""annoying"" or ""socially awkward"".  Today, I watched him follow a girl who's his age asking her if she wanted to have a play  date, while she literally ran away.  It seems like he's not quite present with people and not responding well to social cues (I don't know what I should expect here - but he seems not to be doing well).  This general sentiment is echoed by his Kindergarten teacher.  She says that he is often ""annoying"" to others, and often seems oblivious to social cues.  He has been evaluated by a psychologist who after watching a video of him interact with an intern for an hour decided to diagnose him with OCD, mild Autism Spectrum Disorder, and ADHD.  I don't entirely disagree with her conclusion, but if it's that easy to diagnose complicated physiological brain issues then it seems like the diagnosis is the same as no diagnosis.     Regardless of what diagnosis he has, I still need to deal with this in real time.   I don't want to suppress him, and I also suspect that anything I do will make it worse (I'm not saying this is true - that's just how it occurs to me), but it's now becoming too painful for me.  I need to find a way to approach this situation more effectively - right now I find myself almost resentful of my child for ""making"" me deal with this.  I love my kid; and this post is probably less about him than it is about me.  He's great.  I find myself wanting so badly to help him avoid the discomfort that can follow social difficulties; and I am way too close to see clearly; but I want to find a way to interact with this so that I have peace and he develops appropriate social skills.  Addendum - I forgot to mention that we have already begun work with the school, and in my opinion (though I lack any basis for comparison), we have some extraordinary individuals working in our school district who really seem to be competent and caring.  Also, we are sending him to ABA this summer for some of the time.    I suppose my real question is - what do I do now - in the moment - as this is happening?   How do I interact with him about it?  Should I offer correction?  Should I just try to stop being so attached to how it looks, and let him work it out on his own? (Not that I am certain that I am capable of this).   I don't want to punish him; like he can't play with his friends - he has done nothing that deserves punishment - but at the same time, I don't want to just say, sure, go play with so and so; even though it seems clear to me that so and so doesn't want to play.  Or, maybe I'm trying to hard to protect him.  I've always considered myself to have a degree of skill with thinking things like this through, and finding a sane and empowering place to come from - and if it were someone else coming to me for advice about a similar situation, I'm certain I'd know exactly what guidance to offer; but with my own kid, I feel completely helpless.

1018,Socialization strategies for a new stay-at-home Mom,"My wife is going to be leaving her job shortly to stay at home with our two children (2.5 and 10 months), which of course is a really big step.  She's a Ph.d. in immunology, and is a very gifted researcher; so she plans to spend a lot of time searching for fun activities and strategies for working with our children to keep them active and learning while having fun.  However, we're both relatively asocial people who do very little with others outside of the workplace (or school).  We don't go to parties or have nights out with other people, and don't really even know our neighbors very well (they're all very nice, but we're just not chatty people).  We're naturally worried about our childrens' social development as it is; our 2.5 year old, who's been in daycare since he was 4 months old, is not exactly a loner but certainly tends to play on his own more than the other kids, and doesn't talk to other kids very much.  We live in the suburbs of a major city, so we have a lot of events we can potentially attend (story times and such), but the one time we tried story time, the then-2 year old did not enjoy it at all (although of course we're going to try again).  What are some strategies for not-very-social people can take to ensure their children receive a sufficient education in the social side of things?  How can we help them (particularly the 2.5 year old) start to make friends in our area? "
1019,What are some healthy ways to control the speech of a child when parents are absent?,"In Pakistan, according to Wikipedia, there are blasphemy laws which can even result in death.  In the USA, where I am, we have a constitutional right of free speech, which does extend to children (all constitutional rights extend to every citizen). Although there is some political and legal confusion around these rights, generally children can say nearly anything without any response from authorities.  The question is: ""What (and why) are some healthy ways to control the actions of a child (young adult), when parents are not present (e.g. at school) and the child may not completely internalize the seriousness of  the matter at hand?""  This question is a rephrasing of an original question, which is linked at the end of this post. The following is my consideration of the question.  If a young child is playing with something dangerous and they do not comprehend the danger, as a guardian, it's easy to overreact and cause an emotionally painful event.  One does not desire to foul a young person's fire (no matter if it is personal, political, religious, or ... in nature) with unnecessarily harsh or restrictive conditions. However, it is important that this vigour be realistic in nature. If it isn't real, it is in fact pretend and does not need to be respected.  If it is real, your child may be someone who is unafraid to speak his mind and seek real answers when presented with, in his mind, an insufficient explanation, and might be very successful in his adult life due to this.  Since the original question is a serious matter where the mother is concerned about the Pakistani law, I would suggest keeping the child at home / homeschooling until his life is no longer at risk.  I thought this was a very well formed and appropriate question, but it was closed, apparently without consideration to the seriousness of the subject.

1020,Should I trust the dogs instincts?,"There is a neighbor boy who is 6. I have a 4 and a 2 year old. The boys mom is nice, the boy seems nice (I can tell he's a coddled only child, but whatever). He's been over to play a few times with the kids but my dog (a friendly mutt terrior mix) and a different neighbor's dogs both don't like the kid. My dog who wouldn't snap or bite my kids if they were hurting her snaps at the kid for seemingly no reason. The other dogs (a chow and a st bernard) both act like they will break through the fence and attack the kid. My kids have gone in and played with the chow and st. bernard and they've not so much as turned an eye at my kids. This boy has a German shepard dog which is a nice dog (no evidence of abuse that is to say). So I'm at a loss. My parenting instinct says something is up as 3 dogs don't like this boy for seemingly no reason. I super-supervise when the kids play but nothing seems out of ordinary. So I dunno. Do I tell the kid never come back? Do I let my kids continue to play and just keep supervising? (A side note, when I speak to this boy he listens and respects my authority)? Or should i not really give this more thought? "
1021,How do I give my child's age?,"People ask how old my baby is, and I'm not sure what to tell them.  He was born May 16, 2016.  Do I give his age in weeks? Days? When should I give it in months? "
1022,How to handle a 10 year-old's scary imaginings?,"Our daughter has always been easily frightened, but a few days ago she ""saw a face"" in a bundle of blankets (in the middle of the day in a well-lit room) and became so scared that she couldn't bring herself to enter the room again.  We calmed her and told her that she was safe. My wife and I explained to her that her that our brains are very good at finding and processing patterns, especially faces. We told her how important it was for our minds (especially when we lived in the wild) to make us scared of things we can't explain so that we would flee from danger. She seemed consoled and appeared to understand.  Last night she woke up screaming and crying around midnight after seeing a disembodied face in her dream. My wife and I calmed her down and reiterated what we told her before. She was consolable, but it took some time. Eventually she went back to sleep.  Today she was cleaning out under her bed and saw another face, this one she described to my wife as far more graphic and gory. Now she's scared to enter her own bedroom.  She's always been the most emotional (extremely caring, very empathetic) of our children. She's the oldest of three. She shares a bedroom with her younger sister (5). She was really scared by a game she watched videos of online (Five Nights at Freddy's), but it hasn't been much of an issue for almost a year now.  Both my wife and I were very easily scared as children (and still are sometimes), so we know how she feels and what she is going through. My parents told me to ""suck it up"" when I was scared. My wife's parents told her that ""the monsters are real"" (demons) and put a bible under her pillow (which helped at the time, though we are no longer religious).  Edit 1: Today she confided in us that the spark that ignited her recent fears was a YouTube video, though she's been unable to recollect which one specifically. She says it wasn't a scary video, just one that happened to feature a disembodied face which her imagination ran with.  Edit 2: She let us know today that once her initial terror subsides she is able to investigate and confirm that there is nothing there. We're so very proud of her for this.  Any advice to get her through this? Does this kind of recurring issue seem likely to require professional attention / therapy? "
1023,At what age do childen develop empathy?,"My son is 18 months old.  He finds it hilarious to make our cats howl by pulling their tails.  I try to discourage this by firmly saying ""no"" and ""do not pull tails"" until he stops (which he quickly does), then reminding him that it gives the kitties an ""owie"" (a word I think he understands) and that we love our kitties and do not want to hurt them.  But he doesn't seem to be affected by this.  I think the only reason he stops is because he wants to please me, not out of any concern for the cats.  At what age do children develop empathy?  Can it be taught? "

1026,The right way to address someone else's child?,"The other day I was in line with my twin 3/yo boys and another boy, who was probably 4 or 5, leaped forward and roared in one of their faces.  On the way out, they also said he touched their hair. (I had my back turned most of the time)  I didn't catch the hair part, but I did see the roar out of the corner of my eye.  At the time all I managed to do was give the parents a brief ""WTF?"" look.  They didn't seem to care.  (Which is maybe why their child is a little monster.)  The boys and I talked about how that wasn't very nice on the walk back to the car.  Days later, I'm still a bit bothered.  Maybe not so much by the child, but by not knowing how to respond.  I'm sure some parents would get aggressive and confrontational, but that's not my temperament.  Plus the other party could just double-down, and it'd get ugly from there.  Perhaps a firm ""Excuse me, I know you're probably just having fun, but it's not very nice to be mean to little kids.""?  Regardless of the result, I'm hoping it'd show my boys it's important to at least try to speak up.   Open to wiser ways to handle a situation with ""bullies"" / inconsiderate people. "
1027,ADHD and physical activity prior to school work,"My 10 years old daughter was diagnosed with ADHD two years ago. I found that when she does physical exercises before homework, she is more concentrated, happy and willing to work with me. I am reaching out to @Parenting to ask for advices on integrating physical activities at home and at school.   I do not want to replace medications with physical activities since this would be a medical advice and it is clearly not the good stack for that. I want to know or learn from this forum on any advices, personal stories or instructions about doing physical activities prior to mental activities such as reading and doing homework for people with ADHD.  I want to know things like the level of intensity of activity.    Is walking enough of should running, rope jumping or rowing for 30 minutes would do the trick.  How much time before homework you do physical activities? Do you have personal experiences about this and how to successfully introduce exercise schedule into busy family life?   Thanks  "
1028,Why do some parents have a favorite (or least favorite) child? How can this be avoided?,"Playing favorites with one's children is clearly a moral grey area at best...so why do we do it when should be treating all our children equally?  I'm a personality psychologist by training, and particularly well-exposed to heritability research through my alma mater, so I can appreciate the power of genetic variation and individual experience on personality. Sex of the parent may determine the favored sex, and I'd bet that the rarer sex among more than two siblings of different sexes would see some special treatment more often than not too.  What are the primary factors that can contribute towards parental favoritism towards their children, and how can it be avoided and overcome?  Is it ever okay? Even if not, are there relatively good reasons that are particularly worthy of sympathy or difficult to avoid as a parent?         This post is inspired by the question Why do some parents prefer some children more than others?.  Also, on a personal note, I'm not a parent yet myself, but I plan to be, and am leaning toward fathering more than one. I'm an only child, so I have no direct familial experience myself, and limited access to the intimate details of my friends' experiences with their parents and siblings. We're all just reaching the parenting age ourselves, so no one I know personally has had to grapple with favoritism toward their own children either, as far as I know. "
1029,Ok to mix breast milk with water?,"Our 2 month old breast feeds 90% of the time, but if my wife is away we will use pumped breast milk from a bottle.  The other day my wife was out and we only had 1.5 oz of defrosted breast milk.  Our baby usually eats 2 oz per feeding, so I added .5 oz of warm water so that she wouldn't get hungry before mom got home (first time I've done this).  My wife says this is bad and could lead to water intoxication.  Is this correct?  Should I avoid adding water to breast milk at all times? "
1030,Should we make a 13-year-old without any interests/hobbies do something?,"My 13-year-old daughter has absolutely no interests or hobbies and never had. When she was younger we tried to force her to do some sport but she constantly refused and cried whenever it came up. We also every so often try to suggest her activities, e.g. ""why don't you xy a bit (xy e.g. go for a walk, read a book, paint, decorate, learn crochet, try out new hair styles, go to a mall...)"" but she always refuses. I suggest her various things (either doing together or alone).   When being asked by other people what her hobbies are she always replies sleeping or doing nothing. Apart from that behavior she is a nice child who obeys when being asked to help and do homework.   Can we force her to go to our condo gym or pool to do at least something instead of sitting in bed all day after school? Or should we let her have her way and leave it be?  "
1031,Setting boundaries with parents regarding topics of conversation,"My mom is very upset with me about how little money I make at my job. She's mad because I recently finished school and have a large student loan to pay off. I've asked her not to talk about these things as it's never constructive and always leads to a bad argument. She always finds way to tangent into the subject from a related subject, for example she says ""I  think you should get a new job"" and I say ""why?"" and she says ""because you're not making enough money"". I've tried telling her I don't want to talk about work but then she says ""well if I don't know which days your working, how do I know if you're available to visit or not?"".  Things she says that upset me are ""I know a librarian who is making twice as much as you!"" or ""it's going to take you 20 years to pay off your loan at this rate"" (which isn't true).   I'm planning to send her the following e-mail and was wondering if it looks good or if I should make any changes?     Dear mom, I don't want to discuss my student loan or what I'm getting   paid with you any more. If it does some how come up, I'd like to move   away from the subject as quick as possible. If you try to discuss it,   I will have to leave or hangup the phone. I've given this careful   thought and this isn't up for negotiation.   One thing she doesn't get is I am looking for a better job and would like to make more money so I kind of don't get what she wants, me to flat out quit my current job?  Obviously a lot has changed from when my mom started her career. In their day degrees guaranteed a well paying job immediately and people found work from reading a newspaper. It's hard to discuss these things with her, for example I told her I had studied a topic which I did poorly with in an interview and she told me I should should call the interviewer and tell him I now know it. There's so many reasons this wouldn't work, but even if the position hadn't been filled, it's unlikely I would get another shot at it just for saying ""I now know this"".  My main question is, am I going about this right and does the email look good? Also any suggestions are welcome. "
1032,Should I seek a diagnosis for dyslexia for my daughter?,"My daughter just finished second grade and will start third grade in the fall.  She was diagnosed with ADHD when she was 3 and a half.  We started her in pre-school at age 4 with an IEP, and she has had an IEP every year since.  She has always struggled in school.  Her handwriting is horrible, even now, and she can not spell even the simplest words like ""and"", ""let"", ""that"".  We have always just attributed it to the ADHD.  We hired a private tutor to work with her over the summer to try to get her caught up.  After a few sessions with the tutor, she suspected that my daughter may have dyslexia.  I took an online survey and gave her an online assessment, and both indicated she should be tested.  So I started reading on how dyslexia is diagnosed and treated.  It seems that the diagnosis process is complex and requires several tests and various specialists, etc.  And the treatment is basically an IEP with the same accommodations she already gets for her ADHD.  So my question is; should I bother with getting an official diagnosis?  Would having a dyslexia diagnosis be treated any differently than what we are already doing for her ADHD?  I ask because I have been through several of these diagnosis processes ,and they are expensive (high deductible insurance) and usually take several appointments spread out over several months.  If the end result is just another label for why she does poorly in school ,and no real treatment options, I'd rather not waste the time and money. "
1033,Do we NEED to help a baby learn how to self-sooth? And how long can it take?,"Before our girls were born, I told my husband that I didn't want to go through ""crying it out"" because I knew I wouldn't be comfortable with it. At the time he agreed with me.  However, after close to 8 months of sleep deprivation, and friends of my husband telling us about sleep training, my husband wants us to let one of the girls cry out. He claims that she NEEDS to learn how to fall asleep by herself and that she won't learn if we don't help her.  I thought that babies/kids would learn at some point to fall asleep on their own, even if parents have been helping them the whole time (picking them up when they really cry).  Am I wrong thinking that with time, she'll learn? And is it something that can last for YEARS or is it more a matter of MONTHS?  EDIT:  I'm mostly talking about the part where they fall asleep without crying at the beginning of the night, not so much about night wakings. My husband thinks that one of the girls can't learn by herself since she doesn't calm down with patting/singing/rocking, but only with nursing, which means we always have to pick her up (otherwise she'll wake her sister up).    Context: We have 2 baby girls of almost 8 months old, one of them sleeps ok(ish) during the night, the other one started refusing sleeping in her own crib about a month ago. We've been co-sleeping with this one, allowing her to nurse back to sleep more easily.  We have a bedtime routine such as: I come home and nurse them, we play/sing/read, daddy comes home and we give a bath, then pjs, some solid food (usually fruit+oat cereal), then we go to their bedroom, I nurse them again while we put some rain sound, we dim the lights and we read ""Goodnight moon"", we give a kiss/cuddle/say ""goodnight, we love you"" and put them down. When we put them down, they are unfortunately sleeping and not drowsy (it hasn't worked AT ALL for us), and the bad sleeper just starts screaming as soon as she lands!  (Quick note: only nursing usually calms her down, when she starts crying and we pick her up, she's escalate even in our arms to a raging point that is pretty impressive :().  I did ask my parents, my brother, close friends how they got their babies to sleep and if they ever let their babies cry to sleep ; all of them said they would just pick up the baby and rock/cuddle/sing ... and that they didn't let their baby cry more than 5-10 minutes. However, all these babies were sleeping in their cribs / through the night (or at least a good chunk of the night) before they reached 6 month old.  I really would like to show my husband that she'll learn at some point to fall asleep by herself (I mean, teenagers don't have to be rocked to sleep, right? :)), and that letting her cry it out is not the only solution. "
1034,Tips for helping my 4-year old daughter transition classes at daycare?,"We've been sending our daughters to the same daycare for a couple of years now. Our oldest just turned 4, and is 13 months ahead of her sister.   A few weeks ago, our daycare moved kids ""up"" in a facility wide transition (Two A -> Two B, Threes -> Four A, etc.) -- my oldest daughter had a hard time getting used to her old class (Threes), but absolutely fell in love with one of the teachers in that class, which by and large served as a type of security blanket for her. If Miss Daisy was out for some reason, my daughter was extremely reluctant to let me leave. She and Miss Daisy developed a great bond, which helped my daughter feel more comfortable in her classroom.  Now, she's been moved up to a pre-k style class, and her sister is in Miss Daisy's class. My oldest daughter is always super excited to go to daycare to ""see Miss Daisy"", even though it's only for a few minutes while we drop off her sister. The class that Miss Daisy helps in is very playful and creative -- when we walk in, kids are playing in dirt, doing crafts at the table, playing with instruments, playing with toys, just being kids for the most part. This is where the trouble starts though... because we leave Miss Daisy's class, and my older daughter is still super happy, all the way up until we open the door to her new classroom (across the facility).   Her new classroom is a stark contrast. This is Pre-K, not ""daycare"" I suppose. But, biasedly, I can see why she doesn't like it. It's incredibly quiet, no kids running around, no kids playing. Usually, it's a group of kids sitting at tables with a notebook, practicing writing with one teacher walking around helping; another group is siting in the floor in a quiet group, listening to the other teacher go through the days, months, etc. It's nothing like any class she's been in over the past two years. The class is legit ""school"", not just ""daycare"" like she's been used to (pre-k doesn't officially start until August, but I presume they're getting a head start since the kids are already in the class for the summer).  Anyway, I know I can't change the style of the class, and I know this transition is expected as she starts getting older. My question is, how can I help her with this transition? How can I reassure her that this class could actually be pretty fun too? When we walk into the class, she will hold onto me, telling me she misses me and doesn't like daycare (she used to), and refuses to go participate in the class until I carry her, or a teach comes and gets her, either way with her full of tears begging me to not leave her there.  What have been your strategies for consoling a tearful toddler in these sorts of scenarios? I know this is for the best, but how do I convey that to a 4 year old girl who doesn't understand why daddy is leaving her in this new class for 10 hours (2-3 times a week)? "
1035,What order should my child watch Baby Einstein?,"I just got the 26 DVD Baby Einstein collection for my little one and I'm a little surprised that there is no recommended viewing order.  I can't imagine that learning numbers, colors, sounds, etc. are all equally recommended to start with. There is no numbering on the disks, but there is something like a color code... at least my observation is such that the disks have labels printed monochromatically, some are blue, green, red, or brown.  The one called ""Baby's First Sounds"" has no language selection feature, but appears to be teaching baby how to make sounds like ""aah"" or ""buh"" but is associating these sounds with English French and Spanish words equally. For example ""ba ba baaaby"", ""ah ah los abeha"", ""ah ah anyu"". What am I missing here? Is it teaching multiple languages? That doesn't seem very primary.  On the other hand, the ""Baby Van Gogh"" teaches colors at a very primary level, as expected.  What order should these be viewed in?  EDIT 1  I did some more research. The color coding is to denote volume. Volume 1 has a recommended age range of 0 to 24 months. Volume 2 has a recommended age range of 6 to 18 months. I don't know about the others.  Baby's First Sounds, the DVD I started with is the black sheep of the series. Widely recognized as a terrible product for teaching baby's first sounds with 5 different languages mixed in a random.  Thus far the viewing order appears to be: Volume 1, Volume 2, the other volumes at random minus ""Baby's First Sounds"". Baby's First Sounds goes in the trash.  EDIT 2  Assume my child is whatever age is appropriate for watching TV, that's the purpose of this question.  Feel free to recommend an order that specifically omits disks of questionable quality, or even omitting the video/sound of other disks, etc.  Much like most popular Star Wars viewing orders omit Episode 1, my incomplete ""so far"" viewing order would be: 1. Anything with focus on music. Possibly only with sound. 2. ????? ... Specifically Omit: Baby's First Sounds, as it is garbage.  I am hoping for an answer from someone who knows the content of these DVDs and can at least minimally comment on said content. "
1036,How to approach my little brother's addiction to TV and computer?,"I'm 26, my younger brother is 13. He is spending almost all of his day on TV and computer. Common problem, but I am really worried about him.   I came back to live in my parents' house since it's close to my school.   He is a younger son, our parents are getting close to their 60s, and they don't really have any educational agenda, nor the discipline to apply one. They are tired of fighting with him. They have consulted with a psychologist which insists they have to let him do anything he wants, so he won't feel an urge to rebel. I think this is super-stupid and can prove it with my own life. Even his school has a stupid ""democratic"" approach which says all kids have to do only what they feel like doing.  He is an artistic kid, he can enjoy playing guitar, woodcraft, board games, hiking, climbing, etc. But it's getting harder and harder to make him participate in those activities. It's also hard because we don't have enough discipline as family. I've decided lots of time to make sure we go out of the house together at least once a week but found it really difficult to follow.  What I need is a plan. A well planned change, involving our parents. We need a long-term change. My main problems are:   How do I tell my parents about this? I want to get them alert, so they'll be motivated to make a real change, but I don't want to make them too worried. I thought of telling them everything, so they'll know they can't keep the situation as it is. How can we restrict his TV and computer usage? I want to create alternatives but it won't work if he has totally free, unlimited access to TV and computer. I thought of a technical solution, but wouldn't it make him feel we don't trust him? (well, I don't..) And what is a reasonable, non harmful time for screen activity? Alternatives: I can think of plenty activities, but how can we make him participate? I find rewarding systems problematic - at a certain time in your life you have to be able to do stuff only because you choose to, not because you look for the reward. Is there a way of creating an intense, committing activities agenda without using power or rewards? Discipline - How can we make sure it won't be a few-weeks change, but a long-term change that will last for the rest of his youth? Knowing that we have a discipline problem as a family..  "
1037,At what age do toddler's become picky?,"It's interesting how we learn new things from our kids everyday. I have noticed a certain trend with my boy when it comes to fruit time.   So what I do is I take different varieties, like say Pawpaw, Watermelon,  Orange, Grapes, Ovacado and bananas and cut them into small pieces and put them in a small bowl for him to eat during fruit time(just a balanced portion). So my biggest concern has now been he eats all the other fruits apart from bananas. He picks everything and on one side pushes all the bananas aside.   I try to make him eat them but he doesn't want to eat them. So I end up eating the bananas. I thought this was a one time thing until now I realized he just doesn't love bananas.   When do babies begin being picky?  Should I over think the issue or just let him eat what he likes for now? Just want to hear what you parents would do and if you were ever faced with that situation. I was forcing him to eat them but it's not working. I know bananas to be good fruits.   He's 17months now. "
1038,How many hours should a baby sleep in a day?,"Recently, I noticed that my 2-month-old baby sleeps almost all day, including naps (maybe 3-5 hours awake). Should I do anything about this? Should I wake him up or, is it normal? "
1039,Options when you feel your child is unsafe around another child?,"We are in the awkward situation where new neighbors have moved in and it would seem they have a very different parenting style to our own, which in our opinion has begun to affect the safety and well being of our children, I am wondering the best way to approach this situation as obviously it's very delicate and high emotions are involved.     History  We are fortunate enough to have a communal garden area that all the houses face into, where no cars etc can come through creating a great space for the kids from the area to play.   Our first child is now 4, and for the past 4 years, we have been able to take him out on the front and experience the pleasure of the other neighbor's kids playing with him and including him in games despite age differences. In the last year, we have built up to and began to feel comfortable to let him play outside on his own, providing he stays within a certain area and that he checks in roughly every 10 minutes (handily we can also see roughly the whole area from our landing window :) ). Many kids now ""knock on"" and ask him to come out :)   The Change  The first problem is the new parents seem to treat the area as a front garden i.e. a lack of understanding that it is used by other children/adults and therefore it is a place of potential confrontation, confusion, and danger.   Their children are 7 and 2, they put both outside the front, without any supervision for long periods of time, I don't know if they believe other neighbors are watching or their 7-year-old is capable of looking after the 2yr old. This concerns me but it has started to become a problem because the 2yr old has very little understanding of sharing or frankly danger.   On multiple occasions he has pushed my child off / snatched their toy, hit other children/animals, been found playing on the nearest road and running around with a Phillips screwdriver (real &amp; pointy). All this means I no longer feel comfortable to let my child play out on his own, I also no longer feel comfortable leaving my front porch open as the young child keeps removing toys/items from our front porch &amp; garden.     Around 2 months ago, the young child would listen to me, and I was able to make some progress on the snatching and the front porch (I play with my child outside often, sometimes in games with their child, so I found myself present in times of bad behaviour), but recently he has to started to simply screech ""daaaaa""/run home/both, whenever I try and speak to him. This has to lead me to situations where I am trying to talk to him in the presence of his parents, to which they often say some variation of ""he doesn't understand what you're saying, he is only 2, you can't use words"", most recently this statement was delivered in a somewhat confrontational way. Disappointingly this often ends with the other parents ""snatching"" the item off the child and handing it to me I have to bite my tongue to stop me saying ""I wish you wouldn't do that"".  Resolving the conflict?     Obviously, this is a conflict of parenting styles, and every parent feels their own style is the best way and I feel quite horrible and snobby writing this but the way I see it, something has to change so either:   I tell our child to play in the back garden more (and put lockable gate on our front) I tell my child to stay away from their child (and put lockable  gate our front) I have an conversation with the parents   The first seems like simple cowardice and denying my child something he has earned the right to do (he built up to playing outside, follows/ed the rules and plays nicely).   The second seems like it would eventually lead to confrontation, kids are very honest and I could easily see him saying to their child ""my daddy says I can't play with you"", it would also be a shame, their child in my eyes is not a ""bad kid"" he can actually be very sweet and I have successfully played nice games with him, my son and my 1 year old. It really is just a lack of understanding.   Now the last seems the correct thing to do, but despite some efforts, we haven't really established a relationship with the neighbors (we are at the 'hello, how are u', 'not the come over for dinner' stage), so it would be quite hard to initiate the already difficult conversation. This almost seems like an interpersonal question, but does anyone else have experience of this situation, advice or tips?   I had one attempt at it last week, not sure how it went down. We went outside to play on my child's balance bike, but it was missing from the porch. It turned out that it had been left outside, and another neighbor was kind enough to keep it safe at theirs. Now I know 100% that when we put the kids to bed, that bike was inside the front porch. I do not know 100% who took it, but so far only one child has ever taken something from the front porch. So while playing with my child and his child, the father became interested in the game, and I tested my luck: me: ""Small thing, his bike was left out last night, and I know we brought it in, I don't know how it got out. I know *** sometimes takes it from our front porch so could you talk to him about it and help me keep an eye out anyone else who might be doing it?""   him: ""It wasn't ****, i know, I saw another kid riding around on it""  me: ""oh, ok, do you know who?""  him: ""no, didn't recognize them""  me: ""Well, could you still speak to **** about not taking it""  him: ""come on ****, [walks away with child]""  Its difficult to interpret the outcome, but I would say the problem got worse, not better.  "
1040,What can be done when a child cuts his or her hair?,A 5-year-old girl has just cut her own and her younger sister's long beautiful hair. This is not the first time.  Her parents are mortified and concerned that the girls will be ridiculed at school. They have been to the hair dresser and now have buzz cuts.   How can they make this stop?  Is there anything that can be done to prevent ridicule at school? 
1041,How to inspire more creativity in play?,"My six year-old son got a Lego&reg; set for Christmas, his first because we finally don't have choking hazard age children in the house, but we've always had blocks and other building toys around.  I've always heard that children are naturally creative, and all you have to do is give them the tools and get out of their way.  However, although my son loves the Legos, he only makes the same thing over and over:  cars.  And it's not like he makes lots of different kinds of cars.  He makes nearly identical cars, and gets excited about extremely minor variations, like adding a single brick to the back.  I'm unsure how to respond to his excitement.  On one hand, I want to encourage creativity.  On the other hand, what he is doing isn't exactly creative.  When we encourage him to make something else, he insists this Lego set is only for cars (it's what was pictured on the box).  When we play with him and make something else, he says something like, ""Cool house Dad!  I'm going to make a car!""  How should I respond to his excitement over repetitive creations?  Should I even be concerned about them at this point?  Should we force him to try something else?  He almost certainly has ADHD, and possibly also something like Asperger's, if that affects the answer.  We are working on getting a diagnosis and professional advice.   "
1042,Should I be concerned about my 3.5-year-old believing he was Spiderman?,"My 3.5-year-old son is obsessed with Spiderman comics, games and movies. He thinks he is Spiderman. He even has a 'girlfriend' in school whom he calls Mary Jane.   Is this normal? Or should I be concerned? "
1043,Coping and overcoming a rational fear,"On Friday my daughter was hit by a car while crossing the crosswalk to school.  (Side note: she was released from the hospital and appears to be doing OK, but taking her to a Dr for a full eval tomorrow.)  Now, this is obviously very traumatic!  The thing is that she comes to work with me in the morning and hangs out for about 30 minutes before walking the 2 blocks to school (and only one street with a light to cross).  She is 14yo and is reasonably fearful of having to cross that crosswalk again.  Also, I am unable to take time off of work everyday to take her fully to school.  It is a fear she must overcome in time and since she sees a therapist every 2 months (for ADHD, OCD, and a couple of other things I don't recall right now), she'll discuss this with the therapist.  My question is how do I as a parent (her pseudo-therapist) help her to cope and conquer this fear?  I know it will take time and that there is no substitute for that and the experience of the therapist should prove invaluable, but none of that substitutes for my responsibility as a loving father to help her.  What are your suggestions?  To be clear, I am not asking for medical, therapeutical, or any other form of professional advice -- only your suggestions as to what a loving parent can and should do.  Since this is clearly a matter of opinion and we are in a question-answer format, I'll be sure to choose someone whose advice seems most contributive in my subjective decision as the ""answer"", though I will value everyone's contribution!

1044,Why would you lie to your children about Santa?,"Christmas is an awesome event for children with lots of presents, but I've been thinking: Aren't the negative things it brings (telling them the truth eventually) worse than the good things? You can still give them presents at this given date without the children thinking the gifts are coming from Santa, right?  Questions:   How much effect does it have on children when they find out you've been lying to them about Santa for years? What would the negative effects be if you never tell them Santa exists? Of course there is the risk that your kid will tell other kids that still do believe in Santa about it, but I think this could be easily handled. Could it?  "
1045,How to encourage our 2.5-year-old to tell us when he needs to go to the potty?,"Our son is 2.5 years old. We have been potty training him since his 2nd birthday. It's been a long haul but we're getting there.   When he is outside in his underwear he knows when he needs to go pee and will pull down his underwear and go. We don't have to remind him. But while he is inside playing, he will have accidents and we have to take him every 1-1.5 hours. If not, he will have an accident. He will not tell us he needs to go while being inside. I know he knows when he needs to go since he does it outside but not inside.   Not sure what to do. Is he being lazy? What can I do to encourage him to tell us while being inside?   "
1046,Does skipping crawling stage affect your child brain development?,"My son is almost 9 month old right now, but he still cannot crawl. All he can do is creeping when he want to get anythings in front of him. It seems that he will skip his crawling stage. Or maybe I'm too early to judge it ?  On the other side, I heard from my neighborhood story about one of their children who skipping his crawling stage too that somehow his writing is very bad compared to their others two sons. They thought that this is caused by skipped crawling stage by their 2nd child, so that the brain development is not as good as their sons who are not skipping the crawling stage.  What I want to ask are :   Is it true that when your son is skipping crawling stage means their will some differentiation in their brain development compared to the son who is not skipping the crawling stage? and how bad is the effect? If it is true, how do we minimize those negative effect to the brain development?   Any good studies/references will be appreciated. "
1047,Our 6 month old baby moans continuously,"Apologies if this is a duplicate, it searched for the question terms but found nothing similar.  Our baby is nearly 7 months old, and after being left to do anything for over 5 minutes, just starts to moan.  Toys, bouncers, TV, anything we give her won't amuse her for more than five minutes before she starts moaning and groaning with discontent.  The only thing that pacifies her seems to be us carrying her around.  My poor wife is going nuts at the moment.  I looked around and see other people having the same issues for babies this age, but the forum posts lack any sense of solution!  While I know social interaction is very important, she's not lacking that I promise!  So I need to know:   Is this just a phase?  She's been like this for about 3 weeks now Are her toys not ""interesting"" enough?  Should we provide 9-month toys? Should we just leave her to moan?  We tried this but it was very hard with all the noise she makes   Or anything else?  I don't have much hair left to pull out.  Update  Well, what an emotional weekend it was.  On Saturday my wife and I got so frustrated with the noises we both had to take time off to calm down.    Then on Monday, she woke up and instead of the usual moaning, began making the cutest noises; part ""boo"", part raspberry-blowing, part shriek of joy with a massive smile, part trying to say words (as close as she can figure!).  She's also suddenly starting moving her arms and legs as if trying to crawl, and I suddenly feel some serious bumps under those gums.    I also bought some 9-12 month toys.  Although she doesn't realise what a plastic steering wheel is for, she seems content to try moving it and pressing buttons, so I guess that's helped as well.  While this may not be the end of the moaning per-se, it does obviously subside, and the reward as a parent listening to the result has been worth every minute of the previous grief. "
1048,When should we be concerned about garbled speech in my 2.5-year-old?,"My 2.5-year-old toddler has started saying words (more like noises) that me and my wife can sometimes understand, but they barley sound like the intended words. At what point should we start to get concerned? What can we do to help him develop proper pronunciation? "
1049,Fake driver's license discovered -- how to deal with situation?,"My 17-year-old daughter leaves her purse in the car, even at night. This is really unsafe, even for the city we live in. I wanted to teach her a lesson about the dangers of leaving valuables in a car and unfortunately chose to look through her purse so that I could say something like ""Imagine if someone had a hold of your wallet/money/valuable etc."" The reason I said unfortunately is that because of this route I took, I ended up discovering a fake out-of-state license; and clearly my daughter isn't of legal drinking age (21 in our state).  Now I'm stuck in a rut. I know I shouldn't say ""I searched through your stuff, etc., and found this, what do you make of this..."" because this is a breach of trust, and I regret it, but at the same time I'm so deeply concerned that she's underage and using this ""license"" as a way to bypass legal requirements.  What should I do? How do I ""confront"", albeit not the right word, but how do I deal with this?    After reading through the answers here I went for a diplomatic approach instead of trying to aggressively force the issue. She told me the license was only used to bypass the age 21 limit at some concerts which I could see making sense but she was clear she had not used any alcohol although that was my assumption initially. Overall things were cleared up smoothly and I have all of you to thank for the advice! "
1050,Toddler has a strong preference for one parent,"Our almost 2 year old toddler has developed a strong preference for me. In mild doses, this was acceptable but it is getting pretty out of hand. She cries when my husband, her father, tries to hug her, kiss her, put her to bed, etc. He literally has to bribe her to spend time with her - bribing with TV, or going to look at flowers, etc. But if he just wants a hug from her - she cries and runs towards me.  This behaviour is causing problems both of us: for me, it's just tiring. And for my thick-skin husband - well, he is still human and craves his daughter's love.   Now, there are some things she will go to him for. For example, usually, my husband is the one who replaces all the batteries in the toys, turns the TV on, etc. So if she needs something done - i.e. a toy is broken because the batteries are dead, she'll readily say ""Dada fix"" and take the toy to him for fixing. If he insists that she hug him before he fixes, she'll just drop the toy and move onto something else.  My husband and I both work full-time; however, I work from home (we have a separate caregiver) so she does see me more. On a day-to-day basis I probably spend an hour more with her than my husband (no commuting :)). I spend time with her by drawing, reading books, singing nursery rhymes, swimming, etc. My husband spends time by taking her gardening with him, playing in the sandbox, building blocks, going on walks, watching TV, etc. My husband and I alternate waking up in the morning for the kids (and feeding them breakfast), as well as cooking dinner (which our daughter ""helps"" us with).   Suffice to say, I don't think it is the issue of how much time we spend with the kids - I think we are fairly equal in quality and quantity of activities.   Did other parents have this issue? How did you resolve it? Is it something they grow out of? "
1051,How do children manage to sleep in noisy environments?,"Children seem to be able to sleep in noisy environments, even when carried around. Is this generally true and what are the reasons? How does the ability to sleep with sound around differ with age and other circumstances? "
1052,At what age can children start being influenced by gender stereotypes?,"There have a been a lot of questions lately asking about gender-equality scenarios.   See: I want to expose my 5-year-old daughter to boys and girls toys equally, but she just turned her nose up at Star Wars. What do I do? TV shows for toddlers that don&#39;t teach bad gender and race dynamics How should I handle a little boy who likes girls&#39; toys?  There are more as you go further back. There are also other questions not explicitly about gender that mention gender roles in their answers.  I'm particularly interested in gender-equality, and I want to avoid, as best I can, reinforcing gender stereotypes. In order to accomplish this, it would help me to be aware of when children begin to be affected by bias.  I think that it's likely that different types of bias will begin to affect children at different stages of development. Interaction with nuclear family may influence a child much earlier than, say, the fact that you usually only see super-buff males on comic book covers or fit, airbrushed models on fashion magazine covers.   At what ages or stages of development are children able to be influenced by cultural gender roles, biases, and stereotypes in their varying forms?  If all forms begin influence at the same age, that's fine. That just means I'll have to begin being aware of them all-at-once and strive a little harder to be balance out external forces (including my own habits).  To clarify, I'm not asking about:   Stereotypes regarding sexuality Gender identity, which is a purely internal, private sense of whether you're one gender or another.   I am asking for research-backed answers only. I think it's pivotal to use more than just anecdotes or opinions on a subject such as this. I want to avoid falling into the trap of common misconceptions, which are just as prevalent in parenting as anywhere else. "
1053,What are the alternatives for a lactose intolerant baby?,"I have a 2 month old granddaughter and she is potentially lactose intolerant (she's been spitting up, has runny stools, a low grade fever, fussy, and the doctor suggested it).  She's been on a milk-based formula since the breast milk dried up a month ago.  What is the best alternative?  Neither soy-based formula nor formula where the first ingredient is dried corn syrup solids seems best to me.  Goat milk?  And if so, is it ok pasturized?  (We live in Washington state (US), where it is illegal to sell unpasturized milk, and my daughter is fearful of raw milk anyway.)  What are the options, what are the pros and cons of each, and what is best? "
1054,How to handle a defiant 2-year old when he takes something he shouldn't?,"My very strong-willed 2 yr 10 mo. old son is curious about everything in his environment, which crops up as a problem now and then if something delicate, expensive, or dangerous comes into it.  Eye glasses, cell phones, computer electronics, tools...  He'll take the item and start examining it; sometimes this .  Invariably an adult will cry out, ""Put that down!"" or similar, but rather than obey his instinct is to hide the object behind his back and/or run away.  Then, if chased, he throws the item (discarding the evidence of his misdeed?)  I'd like to hear if other parents have had this problem, how they dealt with it effectively?  [Update] So what I've taken to doing these past couple days when he takes something is, ""Oh! , do you know what that is called?""  This gives him pause.  ""What?""  Then I tell him the name as I move closer to him.  ""Do you want to know where that goes?""  I put my hand on his shoulder or back (just in case).  ""Yeah!""  Then with my other hand I point to a specific spot on a table or desk.  ""That goes right here.""  Then when he puts it down I give him a ""Good job!"" or ""Thank you!"" and either pick him up or give him a hug.  This has been working well so far.  As per some of the suggested answers, when new things come into the house I'm also going to try to proactively give them to him to look while I can supervise him, on the theory that once his curiosity is satisfied the danger will lessen.  [Update #2] He's now nearly 8 years old and has a little sister a couple years younger.  The technique I described in Update #1 mostly worked (as long as we didn't freak out and directed him elsewhere, he'd lose interest in the item).  HOWEVER, this same behavior still crops up used with his sister.  He'll snatch some random item she's interested in - a toy, blanket, article of clothes, whatever - and run off with it chortling as she chases, screams, and cries.  (And she in turn has learned to do the same to him.)  I'd actually forgotten about this earlier behavior but in hindsight it's probably the same thing.  We've had to just instill in him that the ""Snatch Game"" is one of the worst misbehaviors he can do with a very stern talking to, that police throw people in jail for doing it, etc.; I can now just ask, ""You're not playing the snatch game again, are you?"" and he immediately hands the item back to his sister.  All in all, this was a tricky behavior to punish because half the motivation is to stir up a reaction, and a harsh punishment (or threat thereof) is an acceptably exciting reaction to get.   "
1055,Purposely walking slowly to/from preschool?,"Every morning before going to work, I walk our 4 years old son to the preschool located 15 minutes from home ; and his little brother too (in a stroller). Every evening after work, my wife walks them back home. Since a few weeks, our eldest son purposefully walks extremely slowly this path (saying his ""legs are tired"" for example). If we meet his classmates on the way, he will resume to ""usual"" walk, or even run with them.     In order to not be late for work, I tried the following:   Wake up and leave earlier Try to walk different paths Put him in the stroller with his brother Stop and ask him why he walks slowly (he replies he is tired)   I would like to understand better his behavior. Could it be due to a lack of sleep (he sleeps in average 8 hours at night, and has a 1-2 hour nap in the afternoon) ? A breakfast too light (juice, fruits and bread) ? Does he want more attention ?    I would like to hear opinions or advice, especially from people who experienced similar situations. "
1056,Should I encourage siblings to compromise and collaborate?,"Often when there's a chance to do something special as a family -- say, watch a movie together, or bake some cookies -- we let the three kids decide exactly what we are going to do. For example, they select what flavor (chocolate chip, gingerbread, sugar?) or what movie (cartoon, superhero, comedy?). I try to put guidelines in place so obvious poor choices are ruled out (one kid hates peanuts, so peanut butter cookies aren't a choice for group baking).  The preschooler is pretty happy to go along with whatever. However, his older siblings (7 and 11) tend to make a choice and then dig in their heels rather than look for an option they would both enjoy. Once the youngest gets older, he'll doubtless start to form his own opinions and make the situation even worse.  I see a few bad options available:   Just dictate what's going to happen all the time. Attempt to choose between them (and attempt to keep track of who ""won"" last time) Refuse to proceed with the activity until they agree on something (which seems to encourage the most stubbornness, rather than be the sibling who gives in first) Let everybody have their way (we end up making 3x too many cookies and watching 3x too much TV!)   Ideally, though, I want to guide them to reach a consensus or negotiate their way through this. Not only does it feel more fair, but it is a life skill. How can I encourage them to calmly consider the choices and find a compromise? "
1057,My 11 yr old daughter wants to be a boy,"My daughter came out as ""transgender"" to me  and my husband in a family therapy session. I don't want to call her by her ""preferred pronouns"" of he/him because if it's a phase i'll be making a fool of myself. She also wants to change her name? What do i do, should i just wait this out? "
1058,How to get toddler to eat eggs?,"A long while ago my 2 yr 9 mo old son decided he did not like eggs.  He was good enough to taste them (and re-tasted them on a couple later occasions), but he made up his mind he just does not like them.  If we even put a little on his plate he'll pick them up and put them on our plate, and remind us ""I not like eggs!""  The problem is we frequently have eggs for breakfast, so he's missing out on half the protein (he'll eat sausage just fine so I'm not really worried).  My 1 yr old daughter loves eggs and will gladly scarf down his share.  He's a picky eater in general, it's not just eggs.  But I've read How To Feed A Picky Eater and some of the other questions on this site and it gives us some ideas.  But I'd like to focus a question specifically on eggs since we eat them almost daily, which both makes them an important staple and a useful thing to experiment with.    Anyone have good tricks for getting their kids to eat eggs?  Would fixing them differently be worth trying, or would continued pushing just turn him off eggs permanently?  How common is it that kids don't like eggs, and then like them when they get older?  [Update] My son is now a 4 year-old, and still the most picky eater you can imagine.  We've tried all the ideas people have suggested; mostly it just turns into a big power struggle (he's quite a strong-willed kid), so we don't bother.  Eggs are the least of our concern now - anything we fix he'll look at and declare he doesn't like it, even though he's never tasted it.  At Easter we did find that he likes the whites from hard boiled eggs, but only a nibble, and only if the shell's been dyed green.  We've instituted a rule that when we have dinner, we're all going to eat what's fixed, and if he doesn't want it, he can have something different only after mama's done eating.  Unfortunately, he's fine with that; he just goes off and plays.  But at least mama gets to eat with the rest of us rather than doing speciality catering.  This last weekend I started working on helping him learn about money, buying things, and earning money for doing jobs.  On a whim I said I'd give him a nickel for each thing he tasted that he'd never eaten before.  And goodness, this has worked.  The first time, he held his nose took a taste of my spoon and rushed to the sink to spit it out.  Okay, well he tried it at least.  But then he returned; ""Daddy, can I taste that again?  Mmm, can you put that in a bowl for me?""  He learned he loves mama's stew.  Last night he discovered that pot pie is actually quite yummy.  Corn chips are great too, but not salsa.  And... he voluntarily tasted scrambled eggs (twice!); just not his cup of tea.  This whole other world of taste is opening up for him, at the low low cost of 35 cents.  :-) "
1059,Is it okay to raise a child by teaching them numbers in base 16?,"Would it be child abuse to raise your child by teaching them numbers in base 16, so by the time they reach school they can count to twenty, but only in base 16? Would this stunt their growth? Just to clarify for all the people that don't know what this means, it means that they would count like this:     1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F,10,11... 18,19,1A,1B,1C....   I suppose the main question is, should my child become just as good as anyone else doing basic multiplication and other simple maths if they only learnt in base 16. Surely the base you learn with is arbitrary? "
1060,What toys to start with for a 2-year-old?,We have a 2-year-old. He does not play with toys for more than the first 30mins. What toys to start with at that age? So what solutions are there? How many unique toy sets are needed usually? What are proven toys that allow him problem solving? 
1061,When and for how long should a baby and one-year-olds be allowed to cry?,"So, this question is inspired somewhat by Do we Need to help a baby learn to soothe itself? as well as my own experience with other people's children and my own.  Many mothers are reluctant to let their children cry at all, but there are times when a child just isn't consolable, there is sleep training that includes letting them cry and a host of times when a parent might just need to take a deep breath and a minute or two in order to regain patience for listening to a baby cry such as a colicky baby and step away for a bit to calm themselves.  I generally felt that it was my job to teach my baby I was there for her and that meant responding in some way when she cried - even if my response didn't always stop the crying, but I don't remember reading anything that made me ""know"" that.  It seems to me there are a lot of beliefs around how much crying a baby should be allowed to do, or not.  While I don't buy into this line specifically (considering it an old wife's tale), I've even heard, ""let her cry, it'll help her lungs develop"" from my mother in law.    What is actually known about when babies should be allowed to cry without consoling (I know sleep training methods all pretty much agree never before six months - but why six months and not seven?  What is the developmental sign they are ready to cry a little without consoling?).  Even then, for how long should they be allowed to cry?  Are there scientific studies that show certain lengths of time at certain ages to either be helpful or harmful?  What can a mother of a child that just can't be soothed be told in regard to how much crying is okay and how much is too much? "
1062,How to make my 6.5-year-old stop playing with saliva?,"My 6.5-year-old son is a normal, happy child but has a nasty habit of wiping his mouth on his hands, or taking saliva out of his mouth and spreading it, e.g. on his foot (?) multiple times a day. He understands that it can disgust others but can't seem to stop it.  I've tried consequences (confiscating a toy/special thing that will be returned after a 'good' day), showing disgust, or not being willing to hold hands, but it doesn't seem to help.  Any ideas? "
1063,How to lessen a depressed teenager's absences?,"Some context  Dad died unexpectedly on 2014 and mom was murdered on 2017. This has caused a myriad of problems for us. It's just me (26) and my brother (16) left so I have to to be a parent figure to him. Due to these events, I was diagnosed with mixed depression and anxiety and my brother was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Due to the symptoms of this disorder (mostly suicidal thoughts), he was forced out of an exclusive scholarship school on grade 9 (but still passed), and dropped out on grade 10 from a private school that I chose. He is now continuing grade 10 on a public school. If it matters, he is living with my aunt and only visits me on weekends so I am mostly managing him remotely.  Currently his teachers report that he is capable and intelligent and gets high marks in his tests so far. He was previously a consistent honor student before the diagnosis.  It is the last of my mom's unfulfilled dreams to have us complete our education. So the pressure is on us to accomplish it.  Problem  He is absent 1 to 3 times a week with any of a few reasons:   Health issues: Stomach aches, headaches The most prevalent: Dark days. He describes this as mentally unable to do anything and physically fatigued.   Although teachers have expressed concerns on his absence, it is likely that he will graduate junior high but I am worried that this behavior is carried over to senior high and college which might be more strict.  I am trying to balance how not to stress him out (esp. to the point of having suicidal thoughts) but still being able discipline him.  What I tried   We are both seeing a therapist (separate) and a psychiatrist (shared). We are assessed to be doing well since there are lesser suicidal thoughts and we are in the process of tapering off our meds. His therapist has given him techniques to survive dark days like grounding and joining. Both doctors agree that he should not stop school even temporarily as doing so will be detrimental to his mental health. I have offered incentives. (e.g. ""If you have no absences for a month, I will buy you that headset that you wanted."") No incentives have been claimed so far. Harsh ultimatums/negative reinforcement (e.g. ""If you are absent one more day this week, I will have you delete Mobile Legends forever."") has worked but I'd like to avoid it if I can. We have an agreement where he has to go to school even if it is a dark day and just go to the clinic to rest if it becomes unbearable. The therapist agrees that this deal is reasonable. He is sometimes able to do this. Since I am also experiencing dark days myself and am working full-time, we have an agreement where we limit both of our absences to once a week then slowly work it down to once a month. Based on his performance, I will decide whether or not to fund his college education. He will instead go to college on his own pace, terms, and resources. My logic is 1) some colleges are attendance-based. You will be dropped if you don't attend your classes regularly. 2) I refuse to invest my money in an uncertainty and 3) having no college education is not the end of the world. There are lots of successful people that are not college graduates. My brother has failed to uphold his end of the bargain so far. Therapist says that this might cause too much stress and I must dial it down.   Question  What other ways could I lessen his absences? What am I doing wrong?  "
1064,What to do with an adult child with a mental illness and drug taking,"Family history   We have a strong family history of suicide, mental illness and drug addiction.   My brother had died (the coroner stated suicide) two years after my husband died. He was a crystal meth addict and was diagnosed with schizophrenia.   My husband's sister committed suicide many years ago.     My cousin committed suicide a couple of years ago. He had been a heroin addict and struggled with drugs his whole life.   My sister attempted suicide and was in ICU in an induced coma for many days. She has bipolar.   Another cousin has schizophrenia, and is a chronic drug addict.    Other sisters of my late husband have attempted suicide and so has his mother.   I've attempted suicide in years gone, I suffer from depression and a complex PTSD. I'm on medication and am strict about it, and combined with health issues which make it difficult for me to do things physically, it's put strain on everyone in the family.  My son is 23, his father committed suicide when he was 9. Something he's never really come to terms with.  He has a younger brother and sister,aged 17 and 16, respectively.  They seem less affected by their dad's death, maybe because they cannot remember him.    Background  There was a lot of stress in our home when he was aged 14. My mentally ill sister was living with us and my mother. My sister was psychotic much of the time and would try to kill herself if I tried to get her to find another place to live. Finally I got her removed by the police. It was a difficult decision, as I was petrified she would commit suicide, but I was torn and distressed by the affect it was having on my children.    We had always been close, until he left home and went to live with his aunt (his dad's sister), who hated me and still does. She refers to me as a murderess and blames me for my husbands death. She also has no boundaries and would rubbish me in front of my son without any care to the damage she may have been doing.   She actually tried to get me arrested for murder, even though he gassed himself in his car, was sober and drug free and his fingerprints were on the tape and he left a note.  I know this as my son has since told me. I couldn't do anything to get him back, despite being locked in the court system for over a year, as he was too old.  His siblings and I didn't see him (maybe twice) until he turned 18.   By the time he came back into our lives, we had moved to a 3 bedroom home. There's only room for him if someone shares a bedroom. We had discussed him moving back in, and he's been reluctant. Although we've become close again and see him regularly.  Problem  By the time I saw him again he was smoking marijuana daily and has done ever since. He has also experimented with drugs and cannot stay away from them. Ecstasy, acid, some other designer drugs, crystal meth occasionally and cocaine.  He had a full blown psychotic/manic episode when he was 21 and was hospitalized. He came off the medication earlier than he was supposed to. He is still supposed to be on Lithium. He doesn't see a doctor about any of this.   He is in danger of losing his job and cannot return until his mental health has improved. He is now on indefinite unpaid leave.   He's bingeing on drugs and is not well, though sometimes he will be quite lucid and sound ok. I think this may be the drug taking.   He's moved into a dump, where he hasn't paid any rent yet and it's killing me to watch it. I find it difficult to talk about. Easier to write about. It's very draining.  His brother and sister are so supportive and help to keep an eye on him.    I don't know what to do. When I broach the subject with him, he always has a surprisingly and disarming logical argument for everything and I find myself even doubting he has a mental health issue. When I spent a few hours with him, it was clear he was unwell. He's a bit like a young child, it's really sad.   He is wary of me and anyone who confronts him about his mental health. He reacts badly to what he perceives as a betrayal, which in fact is an attempt to get him health care. My mother is talking to him and trying to get him to visit her.  I've called help lines. We've been through this, literally, dozens of times with my sister (and late brother) and she has been turned away from hospital many times, unwell. We have to wait until the person is past the point of no return in terms of psychosis.  I don't know what to do. He's not acute enough for an ambulance. I'm reluctant to call the mental health team. They will probably visit, but they're unlikely do anything at this point, which will cause another drama. I don't want to make the situation worse.   What I'm looking for  As a parent, how can I best help him? Is there anything I can do that will help? What can I do to help myself and my other children cope?    I know professional help is what is needed, but here I'm looking for emotional coping and parenting skills, rather than medical advice.  Edited to add: All family members have therapists.  "
1065,How talkative should a three month old be?,"Our daughter started babbling a lot. She used to throw gu and ga around once in a while, but now she seems to be babbling all the time. She talks to us, to all the chandeliers, her toys, she also fusses babbling instead of soft crying.  So how talkative should a three month old be? Is her behavior normal? Should it be discouraged (and how) or should we encourage it?  // almost 3 years later her mouth still doesn't seem to close at all... "
1066,When do twins know their own names?,"I've read that babies generally recognize and respond to their own name at around 5 months of age. How is this different for twins (particularly identical)? Being as they often (almost always!) hear their names mentioned together, when can they recognize which is their own name and which is their twin's...? Will they respond to both names? If so, for how long?  (My twins are nearly a year old, and I still can't tell if they know their own names or just respond to both. I was curious if there is any official data available.) "
1067,Should we add a team sport (soccer) specifically to an already pretty full schedule?,"My child (7, nearly 8 and going on 16 - yes, all one child) is involved in Theater, Children's Choir, takes piano lessons, and has Tae Kwon Do (TKD) 4 days a week (she is in the black belt club and working hard at moving through the advanced belts) and takes 30 minutes of swimming two nights per week.  She also does 45 minutes of playing tennis with her Dad at least once/week and sometimes twice per week.  She loves all of these activities.  Since we home school, having such a full schedule isn't as bad as it would be if she also had to do homework in the evenings and is, at this point do-able.  However, she would like to add more theater and participate in beauty pageants.  She is also interested in trying soccer.  The idea of adding soccer to her agenda intrigues me as she does not currently have a team sport and I'm sure there is a lot to be gained from participating in one.    Theater really requires a lot of team effort though too so I'm not sure how critical it is to add a team sport since our plate is already so full of activities.  I've already told her she can't do pageants, choir and theater though and would have to choose one to let go in order to add in pageants. (Piano actually counts as a music class for her schooling.    TKD is already paid for in full for the entire next two years.  She is in the ""Black Belt Club which means she has set a goal to attain Black Belt status within the next two years and can start doing weapons classes which she is really excited about.  Giving up TKD at this point is simply not a realistic option.  The swimming is important to me so that she can safely swim and float if ever in a situation around water where these skills are needed (I grew up on an island and my parents still live there so we are on boats and around the water a lot).  The Tennis is important time with Daddy.    I have been putting off starting soccer until I am comfortable allowing her to drop the swimming lessons, but she still can't float confidently on her own or swim across the pool without assistance.  At the same time, I am concerned that if we wait too long, it may be hard for her to get on a team as a beginner with the other kids having had years of practice she will have missed out on.    How important is it for her to have the opportunity to play specifically in a team sport?  She is obviously getting a lot of athletic activity as well as opportunities to practice working well with others.  Even things like learning to pass the ball (in the sense of sharing the spotlight, not the actual physical skill) are addressed in theater as who gets the focus or spotlight shifts and changes throughout a scene and has some parallel skills and thinking that is required.  Should I make her choose between theater and soccer?  Should we choose to drop something else to make room for soccer because there are things she can get from being a member of an athletic team she is not getting elsewhere?  Or should I continue as I am and hope she gets to a satisfactory skill level with Swimming this year before the soccer season begins in full? "
1068,At What age does a child generally recognize their shadow is their shadow and will do what they do?,"This question was inspired by At What age does a baby recognize themself in a mirror? and the memory it brought up for me of the day we were on a family ""hike"" at a local botanical garden and my daughter (age two?) looked down and started flapping her arms.  You could see that she was testing if the gray thing at her feet would also flap and when it did, she giggled with glee and started ""running"" in that cute almost falling way kids do while flapping her arms and giggling at the fact that her shadow was also flapping away.    Obviously my daughter was walking at this point, but I have video of her discovering her reflection at an age when she was ""almost"" walking but not quite.  I wondered if the discovery generally happens in the same range of time or if they are two distinct ""discoveries"" in terms of cognitive development. "
1069,"How to make my 5-year-old niece understand that I try very hard to be honest with her and wouldn't lie, when she implies I do?","My 'honorary' niece is 5 years old.  The other day I made a comment about how she was lucky to have a mommy who is always honest to her (referring to the fact that her mother was upfront and honest about things some parents are afraid to touch on, such as where babies come from, who her biological father was, or the truth about Santa Claus etc.).  She responded to my statement about her mother never lying by asking ""like you lie?"", implying she thought I would lie to her.  This is the second time something like this has happened.  In both cases it was a very honest sounding statement, I don't think she was trying to be mean or imply anything, she just honestly thought that I would lie to her.  This upsets me precisely because I go out of my way to be very honest with her like her mom.  I always give honest answers to important questions and never try to avoid answering them.  I also try to never tell little white lies to her.  In general I believe I'm far more honest with her than most adults would be as it's been a very intentional commitment to be upfront with her.  My only explanation for why she would think I would lie to her is because I will play games or make believe with her.  For instance I'll pretend to have fallen asleep, so she can jokingly 'wake me up'.  I may also do something like pretend to eat a piece of plastic food and jokingly insist it was yummy when she asks what I did with it, even though she knows I couldn't have eaten it and will find where I hid it (or I'll show her if she didn't).  I'll make up games and jokes along these lines often, but I've always believed she was at the developmental level where she could clearly understand the difference between this sort of make believe playing/joking and serious situations where I would always tell the truth.  I've also occasionally given her some mini logic puzzles to challenge her, such as betting her I could walk on water and asking her if she knew how (by waiting for it to freeze).  In these sort of situations I'm using some poetic license with the truth for the sake of challenging her (i. e., ice is technically a different state then water), but I haven't done that sort of thing often and I always explain what I meant to her if she couldn't figure it out.  Again I wouldn't have thought she would consider that to be lying.  Why would she consider me capable of lying to her when I go out of my way to be extra honest with her?  If my games are confusing her how do I help her to understand the difference between make believe games and joking and serious answers so she knows when I'm being honest?    I have told her that sometimes I exaggerate when were playing, but that I'd never lie to her in reality.  I've also always told her that if I promise something is true then it is, that I'll never joke about a promise.  Is there anything else I can do? "
1070,Mastering a foreign language without staying in a country to which the language is native,"I am not a native English speaker. What I would like to understand is - if a non native speaker who’s got a fairly decent command on the language (in this case say English) speaks to his or her kid in English, would it increase their kids grasp on English and the ability to comprehend the language better. In essence, does interacting with kids in a foreign language increase the kid’s grasp on a foreign language? I understand accent, pronunciation, modulation, intonation all these aspects play an important role but my question is primarily about the usage, and by that I mean the usage of words, grammar, phrases, idioms.  I would like to add one more parameter, If the family is not resident in a native English speaking country, and in future if the kid travels to an English speaking country would they be able to seamlessly integrate into the English speaking community (nothing to do with cultural values, in this context), and would their ability to comprehend, read, write and speak be as good OR nearly as good as the native speakers. Have you come across such cases wherein someone mastered a foreign language even without staying in the country to which the language is native? "
1071,What is the best approach for teaching toddlers not to drop items off the table at meals?,"During discussions with friends about our children (2 years and 16 months old) I discovered that some parents give their children ""normal"" (and thus breakable) plates and glasses. The reason is because in this way they learn that dropping them to the ground is bad (since they break).  I know also that some parents simply do not return objects if their children drop them down.   In my family, generally we use plastic plates and we return everything, trying to explain that is not good to knock these objects off the table.   I have some doubts regarding these three different approaches. I know that children have to respect some rules (and not dropping items off the table is one of these), but sometime they have to test their parents' reactions (both of them have to agree and to be consistent).   So on the one hand you have an efficient method in which the child plays a small role; on the other you have a less efficient method, but that constitutes many ""tests"".  There are  some differences between what is the best and what we really do, and so the two questions are:   What is the best method in your opinion (also, do you have an alternative)? What do you do usually?   Thank you! "
1072,The problem of distance and UK Primary school admission,"In the UK primary school admission process, does an applicant who applies outside of their borough, to a neighboring borough, have a lower likelihood of admission than a resident of the borough the school resides in?  Is this true even if the child lives closer to the school as the crow flies than other children in the same borough do? "
1073,Daddy daughter travel trip?,"I have an idea that may or may not be a good one, so I am looking for a little advice.  I have a daughter and son, 5 and 1 respectively.  I have this pipe dream to save some money to take them on a special travel trip just before they become teenagers.    I suppose what I want is some time with them away from home, where they can experience some of world with a little more freedom than normal, but not too much.  I hope (again, this is my pipe dream) that these experiences give us the opportunity to talk about what is out there in the world, both good and bad.  I dream that this would be both a bonding time between they and I, and also a time for them to take a small step into the adult world.  Travel always leaves me feeling a sense of wonder about the world.  Sometimes, I've felt maybe a bit threatened too - after all, it's not the home I know so much about.  But when I think about the confidence I've gained from travel, and the enrichment it's provided towards my understanding of the world, I can hardly think of anything more worthwhile to do.  This would obviously cost a lot of money.  So I am thinking like 7-11 years in advance here...  What do you think?  If this is a good idea, at what age would such an experience be best for a young woman?  How about a young man?  Last, I'd even be open to letting them pick where we'd go and what we'd do.  I have my heart on El Camino De Santiago because hey, a dad can dream!  But I know if I force my choice on them, it'll backfire on me.  Thank you. "
1074,How to get baby feeding to the next level?,My baby is 11 months old now. My wife and I feed him with a spoon. He sits in his chair all well and opens his mouth when the spoon arrives.  He starts to grab at the spoon and I think he may be ready for the next step. How can I best teach him to eat on his own? Is it possible without too much of a mess? 
1075,What exactly is the problem with the Television?,"I know it is recommended that kids not watch TV till they are at least two years old, and even then that TV viewing be pretty minimal.    However, I wonder what are the actual detriments to kids older than two?  I know too much TV impedes children's time to engage in other important activities, but What are the scientifically backed detriments?  There are actually a number of questions that inspire this question:   Is looking at a computer monitor the same as viewing the TV?   What about Participating in games on the computer or on a gaming system?  How about watching an older sibling participate in these activities (supposing the content being viewed is age appropriate. . .  Does the detriment still apply when they are teens?  Adulthood?   I don't expect answers to specifically address all of my example questions, I'm just trying to make the line of thinking clear here - I'm not asking about content and anecdotal reasoning, but real, scientifically backed evidence about what the harm really is for toddlers, school-aged kids and on up the ages and is really ""screen time"" in general that should be of concern or only TV?    Please realize there is a question that addresses concerns that apply to infants Is TV Harmful to My Infant's Development and one that addresses eyesight concerns of toddlers that watch and sit too close where I feel these questions are already answered sufficiently.  I understand and see that there are concerns regarding social interaction and language development that do specifically apply to the youngest of us.  I'm wondering about other types of impacts and impacts for the older age groups. "
1076,Typical order of learning movements for a baby,"In what order do children learn moves? What comes first - rolling from back to side, or from belly to side? When does the baby learn to sit, when to crawl, etc.   I am most interested in the order, but information about when particular moves are learned would be nice too. "
1077,Does using antibiotics increase the risk of a child getting recurrent ear infections?,"My son, thankfully, went about 18-20 months without getting an ear infection. His first one cleared up naturally.  The second one didn't seem so bad, but he was given antibiotics for it. I wasn't keen on the use, because I'd heard that treating a child's ear infection with antibiotics can increase their chances of getting recurrent ear infections.  Since then, he had another ear infection necessitating antibiotics. It was much more severe than the previous times, and I do agree medicine was needed. He's now currently suffering from another ear infection (and a URI, and the combo meant a late-night ER visit last night).  Of course, my son has been getting more colds/illness in general lately, which I largely attribute to his increased exposure to other children -- more playdates, and more active play at parks.  Anyway, I'm just wondering about the continued use of antibiotics to clear up ear infections. They seem to clear up the symptoms well enough, at least short-term, but he hasn't been not sick long enough for me to make any other determinations.  Does using antibiotics for ear infections really increase the chances of getting recurrent ear infections?  Could the earlier doses we gave to my child have caused antibiotic-resistant bacteria that keeps growing back? Or is this just a common way ear infections occur in children--low to no incidence followed by high incidence?  Here are some sites that mention the risks, although they're not where I first heard it: Choosing Wisely: Oral Antibiotics of for Ear Infections and WebMD: Antibiotics for Middle Ear Infections  From WebMD:     Doctors sometimes prescribe antibiotics to prevent infections in children who are prone to repeated ear infections (recurrent otitis media). But experts disagree on how helpful this is.   And      Use of antibiotics to treat ear infections increases the risk for antibiotic-resistant bacteria.   I've seen and heard the claim that resistant-bacteria don't get fully eradicated, so the ""same"" infection comes back. I'll try to find sources when I can, but I think I've mostly heard this in passing (and not as the main point of an article or discussion).  Please note: I'm not asking for medical advice. I am not asking you whether or not I should prescribe my child antibiotics. I think some of the relevant meta questions back me up on this not being a medical advice question:   When are drug questions medical questions?   Are questions about generic medical fundamental medical information on-topic?   Medical questions: what is the line between on / off topic, and how should they be handled?    "
1078,When will my boy be able to tell me about his day?,"At what age could your kids reliably tell you about what went on in your absence? And how did you know it's reliable?  I have an almost three year old, and although he is quite talkative, it's still difficult to find out what he did when we weren't around. We prompt him with questions, but partly he might answer yes if he likes the answer (""Did you go on the swing?""), and partly he doesn't understand the concept of today (he'll tell me he had eggs for lunch, but that was last week). I'm curious at what point we'll be able to ask him what went on in daycare, and know that he's telling us accurate and recent stuff. I know that each child is different, but I'm curious about children in general. "
1079,How to get a 2-year old to take prednisolone,"My 2 &frac12; year old daughter has come down with croup. She has been prescribed prednisolone which from previous experience is a bitter tasting and therefore difficult medicine to get children to take. Typically our twins take medicine easily but this is not the case with prednisolone.  I discussed this with the pharmacist who indicated the medicine could be ""hidden"" in juice etc. Unfortunately, the flavor of the prednisolone is overpowering the taste of the apple juice I mixed it with. She is slowly getting through it, but I hope someone might have a better idea.  How can I ensure my daughter takes her medication? Is there something I can hide it in that might cover its bitter flavor? "
1080,When (if ever) is it appropriate to spy on your teenager's texts?,"I'm an active member of Android Enthusiasts Stack Exchange and recently came across this question by a parent, asking for advice on spying on his teenage (I'm assuming) son's texts without getting caught. I suggested a few services which claim to do what he's asking for.  But it made me think. I'm not a parent, but I'm engaged and excited about parenthood in my future.  The first thing that came to my mind is that if I distrusted my teenage son to that extent, I wouldn't let him own a phone in the first place. And if I made the choice to entrust him with a cell phone, I wouldn't want to undermine his trust by discreetly reading his private conversations.  I personally support the ideas of open communication and privacy, and I'm thus against censorship and invasion of that privacy.  I would want my son to see me as a trusting and trustworthy authority - and I feel that reading private communications could disrupt that effort on two fronts:   If he finds out that I'm spying on him, I could lose some of his trust . If I find out too much of his personal life, it could affect my judgment and demeanor toward him.   If I suspected my son was into something dangerous or illegal, wouldn't it be best to be open with him and try to be a source of support, rather than an antagonist?  Am I being unrealistic here? Is my pre-parenthood naivete combining with my open-source mindset? "
1081,What role do imaginary friends play in a child's development?,"My son, currently three-and-a-half, has taken to making constant references to his ""brother,"" who is apparently a wealthy businessman and property owner (he apparently owns several stores that sell whatever my son might imagine we need, such as a ""remote control space station that flies up and down"").  He also sometimes talks about his ""other grandmother"" (not my mother nor my wife's mother, both of whom my son sees on a regular basis).  While we're not really concerned about discouraging this imaginative play, I do find myself wondering why imaginary friends like this are created.  What developmental purpose does this serve?  Are there expert papers or research on this that explain what role imaginary friends fill?  My son doesn't seem to be creating them to fill a hole in his social life; he has several friends he sees during the week at daycare, and several others he sees outside of daycare, and is very extroverted in general. "
1082,What kinds of presents for 0-6 year old children?,"Scenario: I have absolutely no experience with infants or very young childs. In fact, I never had closer contact with them yet. But now …  I’m becoming an uncle/aunt/godparent/close family friend, and I want to give presents to the child (and I may not often be able to see the child). But, oh help, what am I supposed to gift? I guess it would become easier for me when the child grows older, but I have no ideas for those early years.  I’m not looking for specific product recommendations, but for an outline of appropriate product categories for each child’s year.  For example, when can I start to consider picture-books? Cuddly toys right from birth on? What else is possible for a newly born child? When to start with wooden toys like toy trains? (… I hope you get the idea.) "
1083,Is excessive crying in front of your child bad for them?,"I have a partner who is suffering from severe depression. When we have the slightest disagreement she breaks down into tears and goes upstairs with our 1-year-old son. She will cry for hours while he watches and if I approach her it gets worse.  What sort of effect will this have on our little, precious baby boy? Does this mean he will grow to dislike me? I love my partner but my sons well-being is far more important.  "
1084,Occasional Gift or Daily Reward?,"TLDR   Is there a valid argument for not giving a child a present/reward daily or am I thinking to hard about this and it is perfectly fine to give a child a daily present/reward?   So my daughter recently has really gotten into Pokemon cards and she just turned four a week ago. The other day I picked up a small $5 pack of her first cards and she was beyond happy. The entire way home she was even examining every detail of the pack and completely zoned out...  Anyways, I am trying to decide the best option to give her more. There are some Ebay lots that I am thinking of bidding on to get a good deal on some old, used cards for her. Some have upwards of 300 cards and are going for like [tex]30 or so. Given that she does not really know how to play the game at this point or anything I feel like this would be a way to give her a new card every day, after she correctly writes her daily alphabet letter, does something without me asking, etc.  On the other hand however I am also thinking that buying and giving her such a large or constant reward might... dull the effect?  I'm also worried that it might get her into the mindset that she deserves something everyday?... I would appreciate any thoughts from anyone that has been in this type of a situation and made the wrong choice or knows a reason why I should or should not be so worried, etc. Any ideas on different approaches to giving them to her? "
1085,"I'm losing it, with a talkative toddler, a colicky baby, chores, work, and lack of sleep","I have a daughter who's 3 and a half, she's bright but always talking and is now at that ""why everything"" age.  I have another daughter who's now 4 months old. For the first 3 months she had colic which is now ""getting better"" but she's only ever learned to scream her bloody head off (think Nazgul from Lord of the Rings, literally, except way, way louder) -- so now, if she makes any sound at all, that's the sound she'll make. Hungry? Eeeee! Bored? Eeeee! Happy? Eeeee! Incessant screaming for no discernible reason, and there's not a damn thing I can do about it. My wife, at least, can breast feed her which will shut her up for a while ... but (if my wife has any milk) she will throw most of it up again, and we'll have to clean her, her clothes, and whatever she managed to hit. It's come to the point where any sound from here will make me think ""shut up, shut up, shut up...""  Big sis a morning person, up at 6 at the latest. Little sis is a night owl, wanting her last meal at 10 or 11, and occasionally at 4, too, so we are getting very little opportunity for sleep or, you know, all the other stuff that goes into a household, a relationship, an adult life.  We're getting zero (quality) sleep, we're exhausted and we're breaking down, both of us.  Right now I'm home alone, typing this while listening to Run DMC at full blast (which is nowhere near loud enough), after my wife took the kids to the playground because I was sobbing  uncontrollably over yet another batch of dirty baby clothes.  My wife is at home, has been since before birth, and will be for another two months. Then she will start working again. She's totally not ready for that. No sleep, no energy, no milk, no quiet, no sleep, repeat.  I have been working all along, but will reduce my hours in two months. Honestly, work (especially the commute) is a haven: people are behaving like grown-ups (mostly), not (much) screaming, but I dread going home. At the same time, I feel bad for leaving my wife alone with that noise machine.  On top of that we have all the ""grown up stuff"", too. Dishes, shopping, replacing the washing machine before it breaks down, finding a replacement pc backup service (our old one is shutting down, and backups are import). Fortunately money is not an issue, but we we have zero time, zero energy, and don't have room for a nanny.  I'm supposed to be the lucky one, or the strong one, because I'm not dealing with that havoc all day long, because I get to go to work. Yet I'm breaking down after ""only a few hours"" so my wife does not dare to take a (much-needed) retreat somewhere not-home.  How the hell do you guys stay sane?  Edit:  We are paying for house cleaning. We could also pay for groceries, but don't even have the time to figure out available options. Similar for other ""grown up stuff"", we find it difficult to ""out-source"".  We have some family nearby; they're either seniors, or busy same-age-as-us-folks who have, on occasion, taken the older one in for an overnight stay (and a fun time before/after). Once she stayed for two nights, but this brings me to my next point: The minute my wife is not with her children, she misses them so terribly (I think I could go a few days without seeing my kids, if I can say that without sounding like a horrible dad). I have not sought therapy or professional advice (yet, perhaps I should look into that).  Edit the 2nd:  Thanks for all your nice responses, and the edits to this post. I am going to respond to answers as comments to those answers.  Edit, 3rd edition! Ah, look at that. Little sis is teething! That surely explains some of the hollering. Well, thanks to your responses, and some thinking and growing on my part, things are a bit better now. "
1086,How to discuss art which includes mild adult content with a child (around 8 years old)?,"I recently started to give English lessons to my niece, who is nearly eight. My main method for learning vocabulary and pronunciation is listening to songs and discussing them.   So far we have been listening songs like ""twinkle, twinkle..."", and today I promised her that we will soon move to more difficult and interesting ones. She asked me, what kind of, and as I started saying, probably,  Disney, she interrupted me by: ""Can we do Lady Gaga's Bad romance?"" I said, if the grammar is accessible, we can and we finished our lesson.  Then I actually listened to the song. And here comes the question:  How do I discuss the lyrics of ""Bad romance"" with a child?  First I doubted whether I should do it at all. My general approach is that if the child is interested in something she should get the explanations. Also it creates a great motivation to learn language, since we follow her interests. She is really excited about this song and tries to play it on the piano.  But I would really like to hear advice on how to do it and how much understanding I should expect. Moreover, what exactly is unhealthy for a child with regard to sexual content?    Thank you=) "
1087,How to improve a 7-year-old's reading?,"Our 7-year-old boy has just started 2nd grade. His testing has shown that his reading and math is at a kindergarten level.  We've done the math homework every single night, and he understands it at the time, but forgets it when tested. He also reads Dr. Seuss books easily and dialogue on computer games, but only because it's familiar.  My wife is going to try and sit down with him every night and do more reading, and I'm going to try and go beyond the math homework and do some dedicated math practice every night. It's just tough finding time as he has an older brother and we also have a 1-year-old girl, both requiring attention and both major distractions for him.  Can anyone please suggest a plan for improvement? What is a good book series he can pick up on? Something to get invested in and want to read, rather than the forced 20 minutes before bed every night. "
1088,When does it become possible to spoil a child?,"As a new parent, I'm well aware that you cannot spoil a baby, and my wife and I enforce that. However, at what age (or level of the child's ability) should we begin easing off this ideology? Are there signs we should look out for in toddler-hood? "
1089,When should I teach my toddler the ABCs?,"My child (3 yr old) will soon begin his reading journey, and I'm wondering if now (or at least within a few months) is a good time to get him to start learning the ABCs?   I recently found a programmer-themed ABC book on Kickstarter (so if it actually manages to get funded, it will still be at least 6 months out before I can sit down and read it to him; he'll be 4 by then).  Is age 4 a good time to do this, or is it too late/early? I don't want to waste time showing him something for learning purposes that he can't quite grasp yet, but at the same time, I don't want to put him to sleep (I have enough problems with that already :)) "
1090,One parent one language: three-way conversations,"We are planning to use One Parent, One Language to raise our child bilingually. Parent A uses German with Child, Parent B uses English with Child. Communication between Parent A and Parent B is in English.   One question we cannot find the answer to is: which language to use in a three-way conversations between Parent A, Parent B and Child?  Does anyone have any insights on this from experience? In our household both Parents can understand both languages.  "
1091,What to do with my spoil (GROWN) children,"When my children (2 boys 2 years apart) were born, I was working and the children were left in the care of their father. He is not the best role model; his constant drinking and gambling has been a issue our entire marriage.  My fault, I feel, in all this was being to scared to divorce him because of what people would think and being the only bread winner in the house made it hard with two small children. Also, I held on the hope that every time I threatened to divorce him he would change but he never did.  At 16, my oldest dropped out of school and also had a felony. At 16, my youngest dropped out of school and had a set of twins with his girlfriend as well as a couple misdemeanors.  I gave my older boy a body shop which he ran with his father; it was shut down for illegally swapping parts, that cost me a good $100,000. Their father went to prison for 6 years for drug trafficking.  I thought with that bad influence out of their lives they could have a chance to do something for themselves.   I started giving them both $2500 a month to invest, live off, make some money out of, which of course they spent on cloths, games, movies, etc. I cut them down to [tex]75000 down the drain.  In a last ditch effort to make something out of them, I leased them both brand new vehicles, the agreement was in order to keep the vehicles they either had to go to school or work and pay be back each month for the cars. They both came to me about month before school was suppose to start to let me know they would not be working or going to school, so I cut off the $1000.  Now they don't talk to me, except when they have talked to their father to let them know I am hording the money and keeping it from them, as well as other poisoning of their brains.  The question(s):   Should I pull the cars?      What other path can I take?   My oldest son has been physical with me in the past and I am scared, what should I do?   They are now 26 and 28. "
1092,Good Mom or enabler?,"I have 3 grown children. The middle child is 28 yo and left home for the ""big city"" about 5 years ago. My husband and I have watched her go from a happy, funny, creative young woman to an increasingly depressed and always struggling young woman. We know she has abused drugs and alcohol, hangs at the bars all the time, her house is a filthy wreck. None of this behavior is acceptable to us. She wasn't raised like this.   However, we try to butt out and let her find her way. It seems like the only time we hear from her is when she is in yet another crisis and needs money. When she calls, I ask pointed questions about where her money goes. I feel there should be some level of accountability if she is consistently depending on us for support. There has been times when we didn't hear from her for weeks on end. At one point, we learned she has been diagnosed with lymphoma and had gone through treatment never telling us about it. (Was this a lie? Others in the family think so) I felt deeply hurt by this. We help all our kids when they need it. But I'm torn between being an enabler and being a helpful parent.   I watched my younger brother shred our family with his addictions and I really don't want this cycle repeated. I'm trying to respect her privacy and I never shame her on her appearance, hygiene or housekeeping though it bothers my husband and I greatly. I try to lift her up all the time (drunken 2 A.M. calls, bailing out of jail, rent and power bills paid repeatedly) and it's hard to watch her struggle. I don't do it for her love and attention and I always say to myself, if she can just get through this, it will turn around. I just want her to be happy. I always have to check my own motivations, though.   Am I a codependent parent? Should I butt out and let her figure things out? I don't want her to think I don't care but I also don't want to be a doormat. Right now, every step I take with her feels like a wrong one and I'm exhausted from worry. She has lost friends in her circle to suicide and I'm terrified she might choose this route. Her siblings reassure me she is just a selfish jerk and has been since she moved out. Is she, really? Or does she need help? I would really appreciate some feedback here. "
1093,Infant has trouble falling asleep,"My son is 6 months old and falls asleep to the movement of his swing. When we put him down to sleep, he gets super cranky and throws a fit (I think).   When my husband tells him no, our son cries hard and my husband says that's my son's way of understanding. I feel our son just gets frightened because of the stern tone in my husband's voice.   What can I do to getting my son to not act this way? Is it to early to be telling him no and teaching him at this age?    Edit: additional information incorporated from various comments: He will push himself up in his swing to where he nearly is over it even strapped in. The swing is safe, but he's too long for it. I have a crib but my son likes to sleep in his swing. I've tried transitioning him multiple times and it doesn't work. He has slept in his swing since he was 2 weeks old. He falls asleep to the movement of the swing and sleeps to the movement.   When our son starts crying and in my view throwing a fit, we both tell him no or that it's not OK to do that. We don't yell or spank him we just talk to him and tell him no. My husband puts a more stern tone in his voice when telling him no as to when I do it. And I think that's what scares him.  He has multiple toys and activities he does throughout the day. The only time he is in his swing is to sleep. Nothing else. The only time he's constantly in it is at night when he sleeps through the night. "
1094,Are my parents bullying my spouse with house rules?,"I am 23 years old, am engaged, and live with both my parents. My fiancee recently lost her home due to circumstances out of her control and my parents agreed to let her stay in our home and store her stuff here temporarily and unconditionally. About three weeks into her stay, my fiancee lost her job.  Recently, my Mother has thought of and added two requirements to my partner's stay which were not part of the original agreement: My fiancee shall wake up before 9:00am and go out to distribute CVs a majority of the week, and she will have to move her stuff to a storage facility at her own cost. The requirement of my partner to move her effects to storage was voiced to me before she lost her job.  My fiancee considers these requirements a form of bullying. Are these rules a form of bullying? Or are they status quo and would most parents enforce them given these circumstances? "
1095,How to help a 3-year-old with vicious temper to express his emotions in a healthy way?,"My three year old boy (the middle of three boys; older brother is 9, younger brother is almost 2) is smoldering with anger pretty often. He flies off the handle at little things. I've dealt with a good share of tantruming with my oldest, who had a speech delay and sensory issues, but this is something else. At the least, he's nasty - he glowers, talks through his teeth, and says very rude things. At his worst, he goes into fits of rage: eyes wide, red face, sweat, teeth and fists clenched, screaming, kicking, biting (if you come near), throwing things, knocking over furniture, breaking toys, shredding books... I have tried letting him ""work it out"", but after 45 min of this my other children are terrified, and, my tantruming child's asthma starts to rear its ugly head and he starts to gasp for air.   I have tried attempting to teach him ""healthy"" outlets for his anger - such as bouncing on an exercise ball (which worked for my oldest), counting, deep breathing, and using his wonderful vocabulary to just tell me he's mad. So far, nothing has worked.   Usually, as is typical for this age, this starts because he is being unreasonable (I want to be naked at school!), or misbehaving (stealing chocolates from mommy's special candy dish).   I firmly believe he is transforming shame, disappointment and sadness into anger. I bought a book that illustrates feelings (designed for pre-schoolers) and he furiously, adamantly, skips the two pages that talk about ""sad"" and ""embarrassed.""  That's when the ""mad face"" shows up... how can I teach him to feel sad, shame, etc., in a healthy way?  I am hoping someone can offer some advice on how to help me help him calm down before he even gets to that point.  He needs help that I am apparently not capable of.  I know he is in hell when he feels that mad, and I am prepared to accept I am doing something wrong so I can fix this.   He never hurts himself on purpose (thankfully).  But I am concerned he will accidentally. And, now that he shares a room with his baby brother, I am concerned for him and his belongings.   My last resort method is to put him in the shower - fully clothed - to snap him out of his rage. He often forgets what he was initially mad about and so is suddenly mad about the wet clothes, which I immediately help him with, and then he begins to calm. It takes several minutes for his breathing to return to normal, and then, he sleeps.   Does he need professional help perhaps? Nothing traumatic had happened... he's just got a really short fuse. It all boils down to this: it is probably an aspect of his personality (being quick tempered) and we want to channel it now before it has a devastating effect on his life. We all know how repressed anger can destroy someone and how equally destructive it is if allowed to be expressed freely as well (it's difficult to have friends, relationships, jobs, if one is flying off the handle frequently).  My husband and I have looked at our own behavior and are doing our best to always stay calm, and to acknowledge and talk about the times when we aren't (we're only two humans working full time and trying to raise three boys after all!). No matter how calm and even we are though, his temper is as strong as ever.  We discipline using the three warning system and time outs. The time outs are less and less effective because they turn into tantrums. We started using more positive reinforcement for good behavior (less emphasis on bad behavior) and this has only given him the idea now that he is invincible and can torture his brothers and get away with it.  We are totally stressed out by him, and feel really sad that our happy go lucky baby has gotten such a mean streak. "
1096,"While on vacation, how can I balance toddler's needs with parents wants/needs?","Most toddlers are creatures of habit and routine, and our toddler is the same. She is happiest when she has consistent mealtimes, naptime, and bedtime. When we go on vacation, however, we undoubtedly break that routine due to flights, long drives, hotel stays, restaurants, etc. I believe the exposure to new sights, sounds, and stimuli is good for her, but I can see that the lack of routine leads to lack of sleep and irritability.   Many countries don't have dinner options before 7 p.m. (some much later) which means staying up past bedtime if we eat out. Nap time will be on-the-go, not in a crib due to check-out times from hotels and our (selfish?) desire to sightsee. I'm happy to spend some time at playgrounds, but I don't want to only see playgrounds when there are centuries of art and culture to explore.   How can I plan my vacations so that everyone in the family is most comfortable and happy? How much importance should I place on our toddler's sleep and entertainment vs. our own?   This question differs from Balancing children's needs with a parent's own needs in that it is specific to special circumstances while traveling or on vacation.   "
1097,How do you respond to unfriendly parent volunteers at your kid's school?,"I'm starting to believe it's due to the past year's issue that we had in my child's class. A kid bullied him, but it was never caught, so the teachers and this parent volunteer (that helped out in the class all year) started believing that my son was lying all the time and doing it for attention. This incident caused a lot of issues with my son not wanting to attend school to the point where he'd cry in the mornings because he always got in trouble for telling 'lies' as well as continuously got picked on by the bully.  But this year has been going well in the class for him since the bully is no longer in the same class. We've had no problems with him coming to school and being pumped for a new day.  BUT- a new issue has arisen.    These past two weeks I've been dropping my son off at the cafeteria for breakfast. The same parent volunteer from last year now monitors the cafeteria in the mornings.   I thought at first it was just this person's personality but I'm starting to notice that they never respond to my greetings and that they act differently towards my son. Very short towards him and isn't 'happy-go-lucky' with him like they are towards the other kids that come in. This morning, after they happily greeted the other parents coming in, their demeanor changed when I looked at them and smiled. They shot a glance at me then looked away. I simply brushed this aside as it isn't much of an issue for me personally. But the fact that they're acting unresponsive or that their emotions are dull towards my child kind of irks me a bit and is heartbreaking that my son is so excited to say hi to them in the morning, only to be brushed aside...   So, how do you respond to an unfriendly parent volunteer? What would be the best way of dealing with this? Continue acting friendly and not think much about it? "
1098,Is visiting museums worthwhile or beneficial for a toddler?,"Would visiting an art museum, history museum, etc. which is not specifically geared toward children (i.e. not a ""children's museum"") be good for a toddler?  I'm assuming that the toddler is under control (not in danger of hurting him/herself or the museum exhibits/art/artifacts), and the length of time spent is in line with the attention span of the toddler, and the toddler is well fed, has had a nap, and generally in a decent mood.  This is a spin-off or follow-up question to my other question: While on vacation, how can I balance toddler's needs with parents wants/needs? where someone provided an answer that said      Museum of ancient history, art gallery, even simple sightseeing will most likely be boring for her  "
1099,How to get your toddler to ask nicely for things when they're grumpy?,"We taught our son really early on to say and sign, ""Please"" when he wants things. We've never responded to his demands when he wants something, and have him ask nicely first. We also encourage ""thank you""s and give him ""your welcome""s. He's better signing these than saying these, we accept signing just as we would speaking.  We'll usually have to prompt him, with a ""How do you as nicely?"", ""Can you ask?"", ""Candy, what?"". However, he's now doing it on his own increasingly often.  The problem we have is that sometimes he'll just absolutely refuse to ask for something, and start crying or exhibiting a (really cute) grumpy demeanor. We've never given in to him behaving this way, so we're not sure why he's trying these tactics. The only factor that seems to be at play is that he's usually less cooperative when he's very tired, but it's not consistent.   I know the title of this question mentions only asking nicely, but I'm sure there are similar behaviors (saying things consistently) that could be helpful.  So, how do you encourage a child to ask for things, when they usually have no issue with it but are currently in a grumpy mood?    I ask because of an incident the other night. Our son has found the see-through storage bin that has a rather sizable collection of unopened Hot Wheels cars. He continually tries to get into the closet to get some of them. He goes as far as clearing the closet door, opening the closet, and pulling bins off the top of the toy bin just to open it up! We don't have any problem with him having the cars, since they're technically his, but we do want him to ask because not only is it polite but it helps us track how many he's getting. We don't want him getting too many too often, as the supply isn't infinite.  Anyway, we stopped him from getting into the bin and told him he needed to ask nicely for the cars before he could have one. We were being quite sincere, and explained to him that he definitely could have one if he just asked (whereas sometimes he asks for things spontaneously, like cookies, and we say no). However, he cried and pouted at us. After 10-15 minutes, he ended up without a car simply because he wouldn't ask. "
1100,How do we determine the right amount of babyproofing?,"We have a young one finally starting into the adventure of mobility.  It's very exciting, but we know our house has never been babyproofed.  It's going to take some work to get it safe.  However, there's lots of different opinions on what level of babyproofing is desirable.  Some turn their house into a balloon animal farm of colorful corner protectors, edge protectors, and floor mats.  Others appear to believe that if they turn their house into a jailhouse of 3 foot tall baby fences, their child will never get to any dangerous situation.  Still others appear to take the Spartan approach of ""If the kid survives, they're probably tough enough to be worth raising.""  Some of them can be spotted adding caltrops to the child's playpen to accelerate the learning process.  Clearly there's a lot of personal opinion as to levels of babyproofing.  We're going to have to find our own opinion.  However, do you guys have advice on what to look for, both in our child and in ourselves, to figure out whether we have enough babyproofing?  What are the best ways to look at the situation we are in at any given moment, and decide whether the house is too unsafe, too obsessively safe, or just right?  I'd love help realizing that I am insane when I carefully foam pad the edges of every page of my daily planner to prevent papercuts. I'd love help noticing that I am negligent before the child decides to see how the wood burning stove tastes (while it is hot, of course -- it's the only time any child would go near a wood burning stove!).  (I choose these two examples as extremes.  I have no daily planner, and I have no wood burning stove.  So there!)   "
1101,How can I help my kids prepare for a long-distance move?,"While similar to this question, I would like to know how to help ease my 6 year old into a move out of state. We are going to be moving in the next couple of months, about 500 miles away.   We brought her with us to look at some houses the first time around. She was a trooper (6 houses and about 3 hours) and loved the ones that had ""stuff"" still in the bedrooms, claiming her room in each house :)  We all paid a visit to the school she would be attending as well. She did very well there also. Had a great time with the soon-to-be first grade teacher and interacted well with other students.  I'm mostly concerned with her leaving her friends here before we go. Her birthday falls about 3 weeks before we plan to move. That will basically be her going away party as well. The next door neighboor who has a little girl that is one year older that we're going to be leaving as well.   The area we are looking to move to is also pretty secluded (mountain town, lots of hills and trees). Our closest neighbor will be within walking distance, but not in plain sight.   Is there anything we can do to help ease the process? What steps can I take to help her make new friends once we move? "
1102,Should an adult pay rent to his child?,"I always read about if adults should pay rent to their parents. For example, in this question.  I also know that it's not easy to give one specific answer, there are even cultural matters involved.  But... and what about the opposite? Should an adult, who has a job, isn't going through any hard time, pay rent to his child, if the child is also an adult, has a house, and so on?  And this is not just curiosity, it's a plan that... a friend of mine... is considering, since one of his parents are giving signals that this might happen in a near future. "
1103,My 9 year old saw an R rated movie,"My 9 year old son recently made a new friend who lives in our neighborhood. My wife and I like the friend and are happy that our son is being more social.  Apparently, there are very few rules at the friend's house. For example, he's allowed to ride his bike in the street without a helmet, roam the neighborhood freely and watch R rated horror movies.  Our son spent the night at the friend's house last night, and we learned from him today that they watched Slither. My wife and I are very upset that our son saw this movie. We feel that it's totally inappropriate for kids his age. This is the first time he's seen an R rated movie, let alone a horror movie.  We haven't talked much with him about it. I asked him if it scared him and he answered ""Not really,"" but I have a hard time believing this. (This is coming from a kid who's still scared of Harry Potter.) How do I talk to him about it? Should I continue to let my kid play at his friend's house, and if so how do I approach the subject with the parents? "
1104,Making reading books the only option on long car commutes a bad idea?,"I have a 7 year old son in 1st grade. His school is rather far away, and it takes about 40 minutes for me to drive him there. We are a very busy family, and so I want this time in the car to be ""time well spent.""   What I've been doing for the last few years is allow him to play educational games on his Leap Pad portable game system in the car. This has worked well on a number of different levels. Firstly, he's received a good jump start learning basic math, grammar, spelling, etc. Secondly, we live in a country where few people speak English, and so the games (which are all in English) help expose him to verbal and written English. This English language exposure is very important to me because I want him to be a competent bilingual. He also greatly enjoys playing the games (note: I only allow him to play them in the car on long car trips).  However, one thing that has been bothering me is that my son doesn't like to read (he says that books are boring). I read a lot of books when I was a boy, and I would like for him to have a more positive attitude towards them.   Anyhow, the other day I told my son that he won't be playing his Leap Pad in the car this week and gave him two books to read (not in English, because he is not as good a reader in English as he is in his native language). He refused to even look at the books and just stared out the window for the duration of the trip. The the day after that I told him the same thing, yet he somehow managed to find an electric toy lying around in the car and played that instead. The plan is to remove all forms of entertainment from the car except books and hope is that that eventually out of sheer boredom he will pick up a book and give reading a try.   My question is, am I doing the wrong thing by taking something away my son enjoys so much (i.e. the Leap Lap) that has shown to be beneficial? Is it possible that this strategy will backfire and make him dislike books even more? I don't think that he completely despises books because before bed I read to him English language picture books, which he enjoys. Also, I've seen him thumbing through some of the books we've read together on his own which is very promising.   Another thing to consider is that within a year he will probably ""max out"" his learning potential with the Leap Pad. That is, the difficulty level of the arithmetic, grammar, etc. problems won't be challenging enough for him.   Also, I imagine that it should hard for a book to compete with an interactive gadget complete with sounds and audio? Perhaps studies have been done on this. I am worried that prolonged exposure to the Leap Pad and other electronic interactive media will make it more difficult for him to find pleasure in books in the future.  Maybe I've written enough? Given the situation and concerns stated above, does anybody have any suggestions? Continue with the book only policy? Try something different?  NOTE: While I appreciate the numerous comments and responses on fostering a love of reading, very little has been said about the use of electronic media. If I allow him to use the electronic media in the car and allow him to choose his time freely he will most definitely not be reading.  In response to comments below:  Regarding car sickness: good point that I didn't think about. However, I don't think that this is a problem because I've had him read books out loud with me in a moving car a number of times. However, that is something that I am definitely going to pay more attention to in the future.  Regarding book selection: the books I gave him to read are not English books and were picked out by my wife (the language they are in is not my native tongue). Honestly, I haven't really looked at them. He is interested in bugs, trains, cars, and, superheros. I purchased some train themed comic books in his first language but was chastised by my wife because I guess that she thought that they were too difficult? Anyhow, he didn't really look at them. I feel more confident picking out English language books. Maybe giving him non-English books to read in the car was a mistake. I have been assuming that he should be a better reader in his native language and that he is not yet ready to read English books on his own but I am probably wrong. I purchased a set of Batman and Superman I Can Read books so we will see how that goes.   UPDATE  Yesterday my son picked up a kid oriented graphic novel that we had read together and started reading it on his own! I posted this question to SE the day prior to that so I didn't have time to implement any of the ideas in this thread. So I guess maybe I was doing something right all along!   Regarding the school commute, I think I am going to mix things up a bit. I'm going to give him English language books that I know he enjoys (rather giving him books in his first language that I have no idea if he likes or not; I suppose that it is wrong to assume that a child should begin reading on his own using books in his native tongue). I'm also going to try playing educational English language podcasts in the car like Brains On! and Wow in the World. The rule was previously that the Leap Pad could only be played in the car for longish trips (maybe over 30 minutes). Maybe I'll extend that to one hour. "
1105,Why is my child so scared?,My 5 year old will not go into a room alone by herself... She won't go to the bathroom alone or even play in the next room alone... She freaks out if you leave the room.... It's so bad she will follow me in the bathroom... Has to sleep in my room... Will scream n cry she is scared if I ask her to go do something in the other room... She will make her younger sister go with her.. Recently she has taken up bed wetting because she is so scared to leave the room and go alone to the bathroom... Even if I leave lights on... Whats going on? What could be the problem? 
1106,How to explain to kids why others have better things?,"I recently read an article about how kids' birthdays are becoming a huge deal and a  status symbol for both parents and kids, which leads to kids whose parent can not or do not want to throw lavish parties feeling left out and depressed. The article had proposed schools dialling down on gifts and parties that happen in their supervision. But that solves only a part of the problem.  The bigger picture here is that no matter what we do, kids are going to figure out some people have better things than them. Could be a bigger house, a fancier car, more lavish birthdays, more toys.. anything, really. As parents, how do we explain to kids why others have things that we do not?   As a child, my parents once told me we don't have as much money as someone else that's why we cant buy [something], and I immediately heard that as we're poor and felt terrible about it. I'm not convinced this is the right argument to present to a child, even though its sometimes the real reason. Should we talk about the value of things, how if something is worth its price? The question still stands, how come the other kid's parents have it though?  P.S : I don't have a specific age group in mind, although I'd think kids would probably start to understand social differences at 5? "
1107,Boys have crush on my 6 year old daughter,"Ok so my daughter goes to this new school, and  a lot of boys have crush on her.  When I pick her up from the after school I see all these little boys trying to flirt with her.  I'm very open minded but She's only 6 going to kinder garden so I am a little worried.  I do realize that I need to talk to her but my wife does not want me to do it recklessly because she says she likes how our daughter tells her everything.  Now I am not sure how to proceed? Can you give me some ideas?  EDIT: I'm worried that things go to quick in a child life. She is very beautiful girl and I do not trust the kids out there, she keep mentioning this one boy name all the time, or even call people by his name by accident.It just does not feel right to me.   I want my daughter to focus on schools not on who has crush on her. "
1108,Teaching my son a language he doesn't want to learn,"My stepson is a six-year-old native Japanese speaker. When my wife and I first met and as we started getting more serious in our relationship, we didn't put a whole lot of effort into attempting to teach him English. Every time the topic was broached he was very adamant about not learning it.   At the same time we got married, I also legally adopted him. If there came a point where my wife, his mother, who speaks Japanese and English, was unable to be with us for a long period of time and I needed to convey something to him that was important, I would most likely need to do it English.   I am already actively learning Japanese. I take regular certification tests to note improvements and while I am a little more than conversational, I am still not quite there yet. With what I am about to ask, please keep in mind, I will continue to learn Japanese.   We have discussed this and my wife and I believe it is time that he does indeed begin to learn English. The kindergarten he goes to is already an English speaking school and he takes an hour long English program every couple of days at the same school. On top of that, I would also like to teach him at home, starting with the alphabet.   I informed him that I would begin teaching him next week and he was not so thrilled about that idea. This is not a debatable matter. Our parents had us go to school to learn about math and science and then when we got home, taught us how to clean our rooms, brush our teeth, and make our beds; all these things were a necessity. We both believe this is a necessity, not an extracurricular.  The question is: how do I coax my son to learn English while making him a willing participant?  I don't want to go the route my parents or so many other parents take when ""encouraging"" children to do better in school by grounding them or taking things away. This will only push him further away from wanting to learn.   At the moment, he watches a lot of T.V. Probably too much, but that's a separate issue. I was thinking of starting during the time that he watches T.V. If I take this time away though, he will be mad and discouraged from studying with me. If I don't take the time away though, we won't have very much other time to study (by the time I get home, he's already home). Does anyone have any thoughts?  Update Time:  It's been a month since I asked this question and I took a fair amount of advice from most of the questions and I have to say, we've made substantial progress; more progress than I could have ever expected.   First of all, from Stephie's answer, I stopped speaking Japanese completely and went full English. At first he continually asked me ""Hey, why are you speaking English now?"" but he always engaged and never ignored me. Coupled along with this answer and several other answers/comments that suggest make spending time together fun with me, I found a common activity we can do together. MineCraft!   We both really love video games and MineCraft is something we can both play, and enjoy ourselves. Since I used to play consitently for 2 years straight, I understand a lot of the mechanics of the game. This allows me to explain things to him in English while still having fun. It takes a lot of pantomiming and pointing to my portion of the screen but it works for the most part. The game also encompasses a lot of vocabulary used in the real world so it really helps when we aren't playing too!  I also noted T.E.D.'s answer and put that in the back of mind to acknowledge. Perhaps with a little one on the way, he is worried about losing some love. Mama has continually reassured him that it won't happen and I'm doing more actions that show I love him unconditionally rather than just saying it.  Also some answers noted to get out more with other English speakers. We went camping with another couple like us, English-speaking husband, Japanese-speaking wife and their daughter. My friend spoke to him in English only and we all had a good time. My son even started calling me daddy after seeing my friend's daughter say it to her daddy :-) He doesn't do it consistently but every time he does it makes me pretty happy.  Everyone, thank you for the advice and I will also welcome more answers as our progress continues. Removing the pressure and just having fun has gone a long way. "
1109,Explaining death and dealing with mourning for a pre-schooler in an atheist family with religious extended family?,"My grandmother, my 3.5 year old daughter's great-grandmother, is sadly very ill and could pass away at any time within the next few weeks. My daughter has yet to experience death (e.g. a pet dying) and does not yet understand this concept. My wife and I are reasonably clear about how we would explain death and grieving to our daughter and help her cope. My concern is that my extended family are religious, and indeed my grandmother is a central figure in her church community.   There is no conflict within my family; we all happy accept each other's beliefs and get along, however I am concerned that the different approaches to dealing with grief will confuse my daughter and make things worse for her.   How do we cope with the inevitable talk about my grandmother having 'gone to heaven' during the eventual funeral and afterwards when will have explained things differently to my daughter?   She is quite perceptive and intelligent and I'm sure this is something she will pick up on. She also thinks very literally and doesn't tend to cope with uncertainty so well; she wants to know the exact answer to questions. During this emotional time, I'm not sure how well she would cope trying to learn a complex theological history as well as dealing with the loss of our loved one.  Does anyone have any advice or experience for navigating this situation? "
1110,What to do when 14mo suddenly hates sitting at the table?,"Our 14 month old usually sits at the table to eat (in a booster seat). Last night she freaked out when we tried to put her in her seat for dinner. She tensed up and screamed and didn't stop even after we stopped trying to put her in her seat.  Her tantrum was among the worst she's ever had; flailing, screaming, etc. Doing anything to calm her down seemed to make it worse (pick her up, put her down, give her a toy, etc.). We thought she may have hurt herself or something, but she calmed down and began to eat while sitting in my wife's lap, and was fine/normal the rest of the night.  It happened again today during lunch. As soon as we tried to put her in her chair, she freaked out. Not as bad, just screaming and not wanting anything (not held, no toys, etc.), and calmed herself down within 5 mins or so. We moved the chair to a different spot at the table and she sat there and ate lunch a little while later, but freaked out again at dinner time.  We tried removing the booster seat, and that didn't seem to make a difference.  Whats the deal? What could the problem be and how should we respond? "
1111,80s-era computing experience in 2016?,"I am of the opinion that modern computing technology is too good for kids--games graphics leave little to the imagination, things work more reliably and don't require troubleshooting, etc.--so I am hesitant to get a ""kid-friendly"" computer for my preschool-age kids.  On the other hand, I grew up with 80s-era technology, where cryptic error messages and primitive visualizations were de rigueur.  As a result, I think I am much more computer literate, since I had to debug BASIC code to get anything to work.    So, my question: has anyone recreated an 80s-era PC computing experience for their kids, short of buying a C-64 on eBay?  Mostly, I want to encourage use of command lines and requiring problem solving to get what you want done, not just tapping an icon.  (I realize this is somewhat akin to saying ""You want to learn how to read?  Here's a printing press... have fun!""  Humor me.) "
1112,Kid reading too fast,"My kid is reading multiple books a day (He is home for summer holidays for now). I gather it is a good, but I doubt that he reads every word &amp; line  while reading. Should I worry that this will develop into a bad habit &amp; result into poor comprehension?   I did test him on the overall stories &amp; understanding, he seems to know the high level details, but sometimes he can't tell page by page details.  What should I do? "
1113,Toddler really likes construction vehicles,"My toddler really likes to play with his construction vehicles; every time we see a construction vehicle along the road, he shouts, ""Back Hoe!"", ""Cement Mixer!"", ""Bulldozer!""   He likes cars but when we go to the toy store he always chooses construction vehicles.   I heard on television that parents should support their children with what they like, especially in their formative years, so I wonder: can this possibly be his passion in life? What can I do to nurture this?   He doesn't like playing blocks so I think he don't like to build things, he just wants to play with construction vehicles.   What can I do to support my child?  "
1114,Encouraging good homework habits at preschool age,"Our 4 year old daughter's preschool gives out little homework books to help the kids start to learn letters and numbers on their own time.  They work in these books weekly at school, but participation is largely optional.  Our daughter is very active and has some trouble focusing, so she rarely participates in this activity at school.  She will be starting pre-K next month, so we would like to start building good learning habits by using the homework books we get from school as practice.  Unfortunately, she is not a willing participant and puts up a big fight whenever we try to get her to do any work.  She mostly just stares blankly or flops around in her chair.  When she does write, she mostly scribbles or plays dumb about what she is supposed to be doing.  I would say she just isn't ready for what we are asking, but on her own, she is actually quite good at identifying and drawing letters and numbers.    I can't really blame her for not wanting to work, because practicing letters and numbers is boring compared to playing, but we are not asking for more than 10 minutes per day.  We have tried to briber her with rewards if she completes her work, and have tried giving time outs when she refuses to cooperate.  We want to create good work habits early, not poison her against school before she even starts.  What are some ways we can motivate our daughter to do her work?  Should we avoid negative consequences at this point and only focus on positive reinforcement?   "
1115,How to help a 7-year-old who is stuck on the wrong answer?,"We have an almost 7-year-old son, a 4-year-old daughter and our oldest daughter is mentally 3 years old because of cerebral palsy. Almost every day we show a two-minute children's video to all three children, then ask a question about it.  The question is usually relatively simple as it involves recall of a fact, and does not require analysis or even comprehension.  Yesterday we ask our son the question, and he gives a completely irrelevant answer from a completely different part of the video.  We tell him that's incorrect.  We ask his little sister the exact same question.  Sometimes she knows, sometimes she doesn't know, and sometimes we suspect she pretends to not know because she finds it cute and fun.  However, she is four years old, so this is a learning experience for her, not something we expect her to already be able to do.  We ask his big sister the exact same question.  Sometimes she surprises us by knowing.  This time she thinks it's a game to not know because of her siblings' responses.  I whisper the answer to her and she gives it.  I ask the little sister the question again and she answers correctly this time, having heard her sister give the correct answer after I whispered it to her.  I ask our son the question again, who was quiet and looking directly at his sisters when they each gave the correct answer to the exact same question.  He gives the exact same off-the-wall answer he tried to give before!  We know from previous experience that he will usually get stuck on that answer.  We can repeat the cycle a few more times and he will give the same answer, so now we just give up and try it again tomorrow.  We think he is so focused on trying to give the right answer that he is thinking about his best guess for it, and forgets to listen to what's going on around him, even though outwardly he appears to be paying close attention.  This happens two or three times per week, and what also has us concerned is that sometimes he may not really understand a correct answer he gives, but just got lucky at guessing which random phrase we will ask about.  How can we tell when he is really paying attention and when he is just making lucky guesses or copying others, and how can we help him snap out of these inward cycles?  Is there a name for this kind of behavior that I can use to research it further? "
1116,How common is spanking a middle schooler in the US?,"I learned recently that my fiancé's sister does this. He told me that it is, while not especially common anymore, still at least not rare in America and acceptable to a significant percentage of the population.   Is this true? What are the statistics on spanking of older children in the US? "
1117,What would the average walking speed of a group 6 year olds?,"I am a leader in a youth movement, and since this is my first year, I still have a lot to learn.  Next week, we're going on a summer camp, on this summer camp I was planning to make a little trip in the town that we stay in. Now we will probably start at around 10am and we have to be back at noon, so we have 2 hours to explore the area and play some games at different locations. The games I made (6) each take about 10-15 minutes. Wich means we only have about 30 minutes to get to all the different locations.  How long should i make this trip? (I mean, based on the average km/h a group of 6 year olds)?  Greetings, Potvis  PS: I'm sorry for my english, I'm from Belgium and my English isn't that good :/   "
1118,When will we know if our child is left- or right-handed?,"Out of curiosity: At what age does one hand gain ""advantage"" over the other? When do motor skills start differentiating for arms? "
1119,"Baby fights to get out of arms, cries when I put him down","I have an 11-month-old son. Sometimes, particularly when he's very sleepy, he will fight to get out of the arms of whoever is holding him but the moment he is put down he starts screaming and crying. Is this something that many babies do? If so, does it mean something in particular? What can I do to make him happy when he seems explicitly opposed to both being held and being put down. "
1120,"Adopt before giving birth, or give birth before adopting?","I'm not a parent but I have considered children for the future.  I was having a conversation with my partner about adoption / birth. Let's say we were to (choosing my words carefully not wishing to offend anyone) adopt a child and have one we made? Assuming the adopted child was old enough to understand it was being adopted.   Which would be easier on the child? To already have one we made? Or to adopt, then have one we made? It's common for children to feel like they are not getting as much attention when a new baby comes and would that be worse for an adopted child?  Would like to know what people have to say, especially if anyone has any experience in this matter. "
1121,Is it normal for a 3-year-old to always lay down when playing?,"I have a 3-year-old grandson. It doesn't matter where he is, ice cold tile floor or on his bed, he lays down to play.   I've read that in some children this can be a sign of a learning/sensory disability but he is a very precocious boy. One item I did read about that related to him is he doesn't like to be held upside down.  He does seem to have a type A personality where everything must be perfect or he has a serious fit.   Should I be concerned?  If so, what should I do? "
1122,How to deal with a stubborn but brilliant child?,"I have 2 boys, aged 6 years and 4 years respectively. This concern is regarding the younger one. He has been very stubborn since birth. But on the other hand, I believe he is very brilliant and has a lot of potentials. Started speaking at a very early age and is very creative and active. Always trying to find something. There is no place left to hide things which he doesn't know of or discovers by himself. Moreover, he can create incredible stories by himself and narrates them.  He started kindergarten this year and until now have not made any friends. Today I spoke with his class teacher and she said that he speaks only with her and doesn't communicate with any other teacher. Eats food by himself and doesn't share with anybody. Have not made any friends. The teacher asked him many times about his best friend, he pointed to a girl but he never spoke with that girl. The teacher made him sit with the girl but he doesn't speak with her. Maybe he just likes her :-)   Each night he tells us that he doesn't want to go to school and cries. The teacher also told that he cries especially when he arrives in the morning. The reason is that he wants to meet his elder brother who is in Grade 1. Both travel by bus at the same time but the classes end at different times, so they come separately to home.  We convince him to go to school on a daily basis saying that there is a salad day or color day or we are going to put something special in the lunch box. During competitions at school like individual or group rhyme competition, he just says that he doesn't want to participate. During playtime, the kids are taken to the playroom, he just stands outside and says that he needs his brother.  At home, he is good, always playing around with his brother and cousins. I usually take them to a play area at least 3 times weekly and he plays nicely on all the toy cars but he is always with his brother.  What I felt is that if he is able to make friends at school, then the school would be more enjoyable to him. Maybe he just misses his brother. I was thinking of taking them both separately to the play area on alternate days just to make them used to each other's absence. Is he trying to seek attention? Or any other issues which I am not able to understand? Any suggestions? Thanks in advance. "
1123,Is handedness predetermined genetically?,"A follow up question to When will we know if our child is left- or right-handed?.  Is handedness predetermined genetically? Or is it something the baby somehow learns, or maybe it is a result of some kind of activities it does?  And can ambidexterity be learned or is it a quality one has to be born with? "
1124,Regression in sleeping for a seven month old - is that normal?,"Up until 6 months, we didn't try to train our child to sleep to any particular routine; fed her on demand through the night.  At about 6 months we started to cry it out, and after one unpleasant night of howling, she quickly adjusted to sleeping around 6 hours at one go. Lucky us, I thought, having heard many stories of people taking weeks to train their child to sleep.  However, in the last two weeks she's begun to crawl, sit up and stand, and this has coincided with her struggling to go to sleep; whereas she'd been going to sleep in ten minute or less, without crying much, she's now back to bawling for up to 45 minutes.  She'll sit up, lean back, bang her head on the side of the crib, then crawl around, sit up, bang her head again, ad infinitum, while continuing to howl.  Is this normal? Should we adjust our approach now that she's more mobile? "
1125,What to do when minor son is drawn into religious group?,"I have a son from a previous relationship. He is 8 years old and lives with his mother. I am now married and have two other kids, and he is with us regularly about 20% of his time. I have shared custody.  He recently mentioned he has been visiting Sunday prayers with his mom and her new boyfriend for several months in that new ""church"" they attend. I inquired some more and found out that the group in particular is an evangelical group. I have some experience with this group because part of my extended family belonged/still belongs to the same group.  I consider myself on the very atheist end of the spiritual spectrum, while his mother has been a moderate catholic, like most people in our environment. I have been raised moderately catholic but left as soon as I was an adult.  I recently attended a wedding ceremony of that very group, and the sermon included a stab against ""people who don't believe in anything"", who they apparently loathe. I felt directly addressed. I also know of some people from that group who have cut ties with close family members that didn't want to join their circle.  So this creates a bit of a tension field and I am worried he might be slowly drawn away from me.  His mother hasn't mentioned anything yet; she and I are not on the greatest of terms, and our relationship has slightly degraded lately. I suspect this also has to do with her new religious orientation.  How do I approach this topic with his mother? I do not wish to interfere with her spirituality, but when it comes to my son being taught that people like his dad are ill-guided poor souls, that is not something I take lightly either. Am I wrong to think she was supposed to tell me when she introduced him to that group?  And also, how do I talk to my son about this? I always encouraged him not to believe what others tell him to believe, but to find out what it is that works for him. I would never tell him that his mother's actions might be bad for him, but I do sense some cult-like tendencies in this group that I would like to protect him from without rising fear in him. "
1126,Is eating boogers a problem? (and how can I respond?),"My four year old son eats his boogers. I think most kids do. But it is not socially acceptable.   I asked him to stop and he asked me why - and told me that he liked how they taste. So I told him that I did not like to watch it and many people did not want to see him do it, and that he should at least do it in private until one day, most likely, he will grow out of it.   I presume that, like me, most kids do this and grow out of it. Is this accurate? Is there a more rational, healthy (in terms of not shameing) approach to this issue?  Although this question is similar to [website]"
1127,5-yo getting violent,"My son has always been kind and never got us worried before. Never had any issues.  We recently relocated and he had to change school. The school assigned buddies to everyone because they had merged two Reception classes and thought that would help the kids settle in.  My son's buddy turned out to be quite bossy: he tells my son off, sends him to do ""errands"" and so on.  We tried not to pressure my son to much and being supportive because we understand he's going through a big change.  Last week we received a calls from school that he'd thrown a stone into a door and broke the window. He was actually throwing the stone back to a class mate that had missed him. So the outcome could have been worse. My son was very sorry about the broken glass and was sad. We decided not to punish him. We asked what happened and explained why his actions were wrong. The teachers too were quite (maybe too much?) understanding.  Today he's received another note because he slapped another child, without reason. When asked, my son said he doesn't know why he did it. The other child did not provoke him.  Me and my wife don't know how to handle this. As said my son has always been kind and had never hit anyone before.  I'm afraid his new friends are having a bad influence and spoke with the teacher but she replied ""let boys be boys"". If from one side I agree this will help him handle that kind of people when he gets older, I worry he could end up being violent and bullish.  What should we do?  UPDATE: Turns out my son didn't actually ""slap"" the other kid. The boy didn't respond to my son's call so he pat him to get his attention. Also I've seen my son throw apricot stones in the garden the other day and he almost hit himself. I asked him to throw a rock and still it didn't go that far. Definitely not enough to break a decent glass door. It looks more and more like the school is excessively strict on small mistakes while failing to address actual bullies. "
1128,Almost 9 year old regularly seeking attention,"My boyfriend's 8-will-be-9-in-a-month daughter is with us for the summer.  Her mom lives many states away so summer is dad/daughter time while mom has her for the school year.  I am having troubles with her trying to draw my attention to her every 10-30 minutes.  Some background:  When she came to us, it was really obvious that she is behind developmentally.  Last summer she could successfully shower herself with no issue when she and her dad stayed the weekend at my place.  The first several days this summer she could not wash her own hair because mom washes it for her until I walked her step by step how to.  She also struggled with brushing her hair.  Single digit addition &amp; subtraction was a struggle.  She has poor fine motor skills compared to what I had at her age.  We've gotten her able to successfully shower on her own again, as well as brush her hair without issue.  She's practicing math each day with some games and it has gotten much better.  I'm not asking about any of this, I just want to give context here.  Details of the issue  She wants to be constantly near us and is seeking our attention.  Some ways she does this:   My boyfriend and I had just walked over to the kitchen area from the living room where she was working on a puzzle.  Within minutes, she's walking over to give a hug. We were still in sight of her &amp; the puzzle. When I have to take her to work so that she is not alone all day she is sitting right next to me and says things like ""Look"" to get me to look at her craft. When I am working from home, she is downstairs on the couch playing/entertaining herself while I am working on the computer.  I am in sight of her and she still comes over to hug me / ask me questions (start conversations) / try to get me to look at something.   Dad yells at her when she does this, such as  ""Stop coming over here just because we are."" ""I told you to play in your room.""  I tend to start gently reminding her the rules. ""What did I say about bugging me at work?  Drawing my attention is bugging me.  I need to concentrate.""  I get more forceful each time I have to repeat myself.   Stuff we do together  I get that this poor girl is starved for attention and I have been trying to give her attention.  For example she is in the kitchen about 1/2 the time I am helping me.  We make breakfast together on the weekends (sausage and eggs).  Through the week she makes herself oatmeal or cereal while I am fixing my breakfast and we eat breakfast together.  When I am cooking dinner, she mixes things and stirs things for me.  She sets the table to eat. When I am home for lunch/dinner we eat that together too (no real idea when I am not home if dad eats with her).  She helps me with housework like folding laundry.  I have gotten her some skill appropriate crafts and have worked WITH her on them.  I do my crafts on the couch next to her.  I try to find time to spend with her.  The other day I played dolls with her.  At work she is literally sitting next to me at my office desk with a book, coloring activities, and a craft to keep her busy.  And every 10-30 minutes she is trying to get me to focus on her.  (When we are at my office I make sure it is for at most 4 hours because I know how boring it is, and I work from home when I can).  Being at work with me only happens when my boyfriend is scheduled to work during my work hours and I have meetings during that time.  Closing remarks  I am an introvert and her constant attempts at getting my attention are wearing me down to the point where I don't have much energy of an evening to spend positive time with her because I need to be alone to recharge.  By not have enough energy I'm talking about tired to the point of exhaustion and making myself sick.  And I do REALLY need her not to constantly bug me at work as I have to concentrate on what I am doing.    What are some ways to help her not seek my attention every 10-30 minutes?  The closest question I could find was this one but it is for a 4 year old, and the accepted answer will not help, as she is already a part of most things I am doing from doing laundry, to watering the plants, to taking out the trash.  I have taken advantage of her willingness to help, but she cannot help me develop software at work. "
1129,How to begin sleep training with a 2 year old?,"Our daughter is 27 months (old enough that measuring in months seems silly now) and we never performed sleep training, so she is still being put to bed after bath and teeth time with a bottle and rocking chair.  We've been asked if we can sleep train her by the nursery staff (she started full time this week) as they give the children a nap at midday by lying them down and stroking them soothingly. This, of course, does not work with our child, so she misses her midday nap (which she usually gets at home) and is very tired by the evening. (Although this does make getting her to sleep easier.)  The other complication is that she can now climb out of the cot on her own (not particularly safely) so we are considering removing one side, as is typical (or so we believe.) My concern is if we use something like the Sleep Lady Shuffle or other process which involves simply ignoring her until she lays down that she will not lay and just climb out of the cot.  Have we missed the opportunity to sleep train or do we simply need to be much, much more patient and insistent? Are there resources for advanced (in both uses of the term) sleep training? "
1130,How to handle baby waking up while sleep training,"I've read that at 3 months you can start to try and train your child to sleep through the night. My child starts squirming and making little sounds (not crying) in the middle of the night still. I've read that those are signs of hunger? How should I train him to sleep through the night when he does this? I had the following ideas but not sure which to do, or if there’s a better one.   Feed him then and hope he learns to sleep through the night somehow Wait a period of time (say, a half hour). If he’s still making noise, or starts up again, then feed him.  Wait until he starts crying. I've read that crying is a late stage of hunger, so I’m guessing that this is not what I should do.  "
1131,Small amounts of water mixing with breastmilk,"I wash the baby bottles by hand and often let them air dry. Do I have to dry them completely before adding breast milk? I would obviously want to get all of the dish liquid out of the bottles. But I wasn't sure if the breast milk mixing with a small amount of water would have any impact on the baby. I would think that he might just pee slightly more frequently if I don’t dry them fully?  I'm using Dr. Brown's bottles, so drops of water collect on the nipple, bottle, vent, vent cap, and cap.  It's not clear if these trace amounts of water would contribute to water intoxication.  My child is 3 months old. "
1132,My 7-yrs old daughter asks the same questions everyday at the same time,"Questions like ""you and mom were happy when I cried loud when I was born?"" (because some day we've said that babies that born crying loud usually is considered a sign of good health) or ""what's your favorite color besides blue?"" (because the answer is yellow) and so on.  I understand that a 7-yrs old child likes this repetition thing (watching the same movie again and again and etc) and probably this is related to the way the brain is stimulated to ""feel safe"" when you get what you expect (which may be related to the way the brain does not like ""frustration"" which is not getting what you expect).  I'd just want to understand better why she asks the same question everyday at the same time. Obviously, she knows the answer, but I'd like to know if this is a normal process for this age, if this means she wants to check if some day we're going to give a different answer or if she just want to feel closer talking to me and my wife. "
1133,"Son's girlfriend does not say ""hello"" when she comes to our house. Is this disrespectful?","My 17 year old son has been dating his girlfriend for a few months now, they were also friends for about a year or so prior.  My issue is that she comes over to our house at least 3 days a week, but never says ""hello"" to myself or my husband. They walk into the house, then head right to the basement and remain down there for the entire time she is over. Both my husband and I have told him that we feel that it is very rude and disrespectful that she can't say ""Hi"" to us when she comes over. I don't expect her to come find me in our house, but if I am sitting in the living room or in her view when she walks in the door, I would expect a ""Hello"" would be common courtesy.  I know as a teenager or even as an adult I would have never walked into a friends/boyfriends house with out introducing myself to their parents.   I have tried to make an effort to include her in functions, but they make no effort to interact with us, not even to join us for dinner. My son tells me that we are ""old"" (I'm in my mid thirties) and that ""times have changed, and no-one does that anymore"". My husband has tried talking to her about school and her plans after she graduates, which my son told me she felt uncomfortable and that we were grilling her - we were simply trying to make converstation with her.  I honestly feel like telling him that if this continues that she is no longer welcomed over. Are we crazy? have times really changed? "
1134,When is a change in stool appearance to be expected after starting baby on wet and solid foods,"We recently started our six months old daughter on vegetable purees and solid food, which she likes fine. She will eat a few spoons full, up to about 12 per meal. I read, and was told, to expect a change in stool appearance, frequency and smell, but about three weeks in, only the frequency has changed. The stool looks about the same as before, sort of like cottage cheese, usually a bright yellow color.  We feed her both some pureed vegetables, oatmeal, but also BLW-style small pieces of solid food, such as cauliflower, potatoes, carrots or pasta. Practically every time she poops the food comes out as it went in, usually tinted in the foods color (pumpkin, beetroot, etc). I get that the solids are hard to digest properly in the beginning, but the wet foods?  Is she not digesting any of it? What is an average time until you should expect to see a change? I know the topic is not very exciting, but any input is appreciated. "
1135,1 year old toddler changes pattern of sleep,"I just noticed a recent change of sleeping pattern of my 2nd son, who is now 1 year and 3 month old. To be accurate the change started about 1 week ago.  Before that he used to turn in right away after being fed with 6 oz milk, around 7:30pm, and wake up around 2am for more milk and fall back sleep immediately. If we feed him with water rather than milk out of concern of overfeeding, he would groan in complaints, kicking his feet for 30 minutes but eventually manage to fall asleep again.  Gone were those days. Starting last weekend he refused to sleep after taking the milk at 7:45pm. He refused to stay in his cradle, he was very adamant and keeping motioning me to take him out. After I complied he would happily stumble around with my support under his arms, or play a ball, engaging in all activities but sleep. This could last for hours. Like today, he didn't fall asleep until 10:48pm. He still wakes up at 2 or 3am, but now it takes almost two hours before he sleeps again.   My son seems entering a new phase of development. He just starts learning to walk and speak, yet his mind matures at a faster pace. He starts demanding and his demands are simple yet clear and he refuses to take a ""No"" for an answer, otherwise he would cry at the top of lungs (in one occasion he cried so hard that he uncontrollably threw up). To me he seems tired of being a good boy, or my father's tough gene skipped my generation and passed onto him. :-)  To be serious, what just happened to my son? Why did he become so intolerant all of a sudden? The only circumstantial change is that his mother went on a business trip. But even when she was home, I spent equal amount of time (if not more) with my son and he didn't seem to be affected by his mother's temporary departure. (my wife had a few business trips before) "
1136,Why is technology bad for children?,Almost 5 years ago I have asked this question   Is it too dangerous for my 2 years old son to watch YouTube on the iPad for hours?  and I concluded that (watching) TV etc is not very healthy for the children. However years later social services informed me that they don't like my children to have access to technology in general.  What's the exact issue?  My boy uses the iPad/iPhone to play games. Most of these games are not evil -I assume- as they are developed by BBC and to my knowledge they are heavily regulated. Also I pushed him to use Tiggly Shapes Interactive Learning Games which seems to be a good idea as it a mix between the digital and real world. 
1137,3-year-old boy co-sleeps: kicks and hits us in sleep,Our three-year-old boy who has been sleeping between my wife and me is becoming a problem. I know we need to transition him to his own bed and we will go through that process in the near future. We have been trying for a while but he ends up coming to our bed again. We will keep trying.  In the meantime while he is sleeping or half asleep he kicks and hits us. In some cases he is half awake and will take aim at our faces. Mostly it is random. This wasn't really an issue in the past.  It has become a problem in the past few weeks.  Could this be a symptom of something else? Does anyone else experience this and can they give some advice? 
1138,How to get 16 months baby to drink milk again,"Our son was breastfed until around 6 months and then was put on formula milk. He used to drink well until about 11 months when he started drinking less and less milk, and stopped completely about 3 months ago. He eats very well and drinks juice and tea (we live in Japan, tea for babies is very popular). I also feed him 2 yoghurts a day to make up for the calcium missing from not drinking milk. We tried giving him normal milk too but he still refuses it. I read this question Toddler does not like to drink milk but mine is a bit different in that I would like to try to get him to drink milk again. Would you please share some ways to do that? Or should I just accept this fact and give him substitutes for calcium and Vitamin D? "
1139,Why do babies move this much when sleeping?,"Just to be clear: this is not a big problem, I am just curious about a funny behaviour :)  My daughter is 13 months old now and I sometimes sleep next to her at night. This can happen when for example we spend the night in a hotel were no cradles are available, so we book an extra bed and we put them all together. This way, she has a full grown-up person bed for her.  Then, during the night she will sleep tight but somehow moving back and forth, rolling, twisting, etc. Every time I check she will be in a completely new position, so I may have her foot next to my head but half an hour later she will be at the bottom of the bed.  I understand this like as: if I had a bed on this proportion (4x4 meters with no boundaries) I would move this much, because involuntary movement during the night would not find limits and my body would just go on doing them. But still, I am not sure if this is right.  So: is this absolutely random movement normal during the night? I assume there is no problem on it, but just in case: is it good for her? "
1140,"How to deal with my 13-year-old son's friend, who makes me feel uncomfortable?","I am 38-year-old mother to a 13-year-old son. He is close friends with a boy (let's call him Alex).  I have noticed earlier Alex behaving weirdly before me like complimenting me on my looks, things I wear.  I was uncomfortable and didn't respond warmly to his comments. I avoided them.  Recently, I saw Alex in my room looking at my undergarments drawer (and even holding one in hand). He saw me and he just left, running from there. I was not able to confront him there and talk. I was in kind of a shock myself.  My questions are:   Should I confront Alex and talk with or just avoid him?  Should I let him on our house again? I don't want my son to be friends with a boy like him. Should I tell my son to stop being friends with Alex. Will it work? Should I let them be friends? How do I make sure Alex won't be a bad influence on my son?  "
1141,How to explain to a toddler why she doesn't have siblings?,"My husband and I have decided not to have more children, which would make our currently 10 month old daughter an only child.  While we obviously have our (adult) reasons for this decision, I am wondering what type of approach would be appropriate for explaining the decision to our only child when she will start asking (not sure when that might happen; some input on that would also be welcome).   Any insights or personal experiences? We just want to be ready for it when it first comes. How about later in life, e.g., at around 10 years of age?   EDIT: As it might be relevant what the reason is, I am adding a few details:   The reason is not of economic nature, neither did I get sick. After a fantastic pregnancy, the birth itself was complicated, and then it was my daughter who got sick as a newborn. She is perfectly fine now, but we were literally lucky that she is did not develop complications with long term consequences. Given what we went through, we (the parents) do not feel that we can take any kind of risk a second time (and a pregnancy is a risk in itself to begin with). "
1142,My daughter's friend faked having cancer - our daughter found out via Facebook and is devastated. What do we do?,"Our daughter Angela (not her real name), who's 15, showed us a Facebook message she received from her friend Lauren (not her real name), who's 15, it said basically that Lauren had been faking having cancer, and that it was just a scam to gain money. The Facebook private message was sent on Tuesday. Angela showed us it this morning, we didn't ask her about her social media, she told us directly. She showed us a message from Lauren's mum which basically equated to ""ha ha, we scammed you!""  Angela doesn't use Facebook often, except to communicate with her cousins.  Lauren appeared in our local paper (a small local one) with an appeal to raise money for the cancer treatment.  We know Lauren in person. Lauren goes to the same school as Angela and they were friends since they were 12. We know Lauren's parents and thought they were nice people but now should we be wary of her?  Now our daughter is devastated, and isn't trusting of new people, she doesn't even want to go out to events with us, even though we've got a holiday to Spain booked in the next few weeks. Normally she looks forward to holidays... now she's dreading it. She said she's had nightmares and flashbacks about this since Tuesday.  Me and my husband are worried about this, what do we do next? "
1143,What skills should a 4-year-old have when it comes to counting and memorizing numbers?,"Our 4-year-old daughter just turned 4 and just started Pre-K. She can count to 10 and recognize 0-10 written on a board, with really no issues whatsoever. However, we've been working with her for half an hour to just learn the numbers 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and she still can't do it by herself. Specifically, it's taken her almost that entire time to just recognize what 13 is.  Her sister, 13 months younger, can count to 20 with very little help though. We do all of the same activities together -- so I'm wondering if    this is just normal differences between normal toddlers, she's somewhat behind for her age, or maybe her sister is just a faster learner when it comes to counting.   Anyone else have experience with what skills a 4-year-old should have when it comes to memorization and numbers? We were thinking she should be able to count to 20 with no help, so we're trying to work with her more to get her there. Is 20 too high of a bar for a 4-year-old? (I assume not, since her sister does it, and is a year younger).  Any advice? "
1144,How do you get a three year old to do... anything?,"Get dressed, get undressed, wash their hands after using the toilet, brush their teeth, go to bed, get out of bed, stop jumping on their baby sibling, go to childcare, leave childcare, start moving, stop moving... any of the hundred and one things you need a child to do in order to progress through the day's schedule and stay healthy.  I can think of a few strategies:  Physical coercion  Ceases to work after the child is dexterous enough to, e.g., remove the clothes you just put on them.  Yelling  Unpleasant for everybody, and mostly just results in the child yelling back at you in your own voice at some future point.  Threat of punishment  What punishment? Corporal forms are rightly frowned upon, capital even more so[1]. To imagine my child sitting on the ""naughty chair"" and staying there is to laugh.  Threat to withhold future pleasure  This is sometimes effective, but the ""future"" needs to be relatively soon and the pleasure needs to be something they want enough (...and you're happy for them to have anyway.)  Promise of future reward  ""Star charts"" and such. I know some find this effective but I'm uneasy about the normalisation of extrinsic vs intrinsic motivation.  Am I missing any broad categories, or does anyone have any particular tricks?  [1]This is a joke. Mostly. "
1145,At what age it is psychologically OK to teach child that parents need personal time?,"I have 3 years old twins and I have a problem that I don't have any personal time, because when I finish my job and go home, they ask me to play with them all time I spent at home.  When I go to work, they don't like it, but I tell that it is required to go to work and I have no choice; the same I can tell when I eat or go to bathroom.  But what if I will tell that I need to read book for fun (i. e. that I prefer to read book instead of playing with them at least sometimes)? Will it harm child, and if yes, at what age I can start to explain that I need also personal time and that I prefer to be alone sometimes?  If possible, I prefer answers that have any references to any scientific data sources about this problem (personal time vs parenting); I googled a lot of this topic, but I didn't find any detailed recommendations. "
1146,Am I being stressful to my child by trying to teach them how to be creative?,"I have two children, one being 7 months old and the other on the verge of turning 3 years old. My question is about my way of interacting with the 3-year-old one, but I hope to learn something I can apply to future interactions with the baby too.  My older child is loving, tidy, playful, well-mannered, smart, and generally everything a parent could dream of. We as parents made a point of stimulating our children, not keeping information away (though simpler words have to be used sometimes), showing not just telling, etc. and so far I think we're doing fine.  I've recently noticed that my child gets really distressed whenever I do something in a way I'm not supposed to. Let me explain:     Sometimes I'd be singing a song they know, and I would change the lyrics a bit. Either to fit the current situation (some adults hate that too, I know), or because I learned a new verse, or found nicer words, or just feel like it. This really bothered my child at first: they'd say that the song was not like that and would get very distressed if I tried to go on (sometimes with anger, sometimes with tears, always shouting ""no, no, it's not like that!""). This also happened when it was other people singing it ""wrong"", but with a milder reaction (likely whispering to me ""but the song is not like that!"").   Yesterday we were playing with a jigsaw puzzle of some TV series, and I picked two pieces with the face of the characters on them, and used the pieces like puppets, faking their voices and the like. My child quickly grabbed the pieces out of my hand and said ""no, no, don't do that, they are not puppets, they are jigsaw pieces"". When asked ""but they have a face, why can't I use the pieces like puppets?"" my child just said that the pieces were not for that. I dropped it there because we were having a good time and I didn't want to spoil it.   So I remember reading somewhere that, to correctly develop, children this age have the need to feel some things are ""set in stone"", that some things are the way they are and cannot change, so they feel secure enough to develop their cognitive and social skills. Else they would feel too insecure about everything. Is that right? So my ""being creative"", to them might be like shaking their system of beliefs, like suddenly realizing that maybe nothing is like they think it is. Too much for a 2 year old?  I guess the question is: Am I straining the intellectual and emotional development of my child by doing things that I see as imaginative, but maybe they see as crushing the foundations of their reality?  PS: About the lyrics issue, I've managed to make them understand that songs can have many different lyrics and that it is OK to change the lyrics of a song if you like to; and that it is called ""a new version"" of the song. So now when I change the lyrics they are used to, they usually (not always) just ask me if that's a new version, I say yes, and we carry on.  PPS: English not my first language, please forgive any mistakes. I've purposely tried to make the post gender-neutral, though -- hence so many ""my child""s instead of just a pronoun or a name. "
1147,What are some good food options for a one year-old?,"My child is about 12 months old. He has been weaned from breastfeeding. As of right now, his weight is normal, but he will need to gain more weight eventually. Can I feed him milk, Boost or Horlicks? I will be consulting a pediatrician, but he keeps saying the weight is normal. Can anyone give me some suggestions?  "
1148,How to Handle Multi-Language Situation,"What is the best strategy for a multi-lingual couple to instill both the father's and mother's native languages to the child in a most ""natural"" and efficient way?  My wife and I have been speaking English between ourselves for the eight years we've been together since we met in the USA as international students and until our first son was born two weeks ago. Neither of us is a native English speaker; she doesn't know my native language and I don't know her native language well enough, and we are both pretty comfortable in English (though both not perfect), so we stuck with it; since six years we've lived in a country where her native language, German, is spoken, but I haven't really picked it up as my day-to-day life is in English.  Now that our first son was born we are wondering how to behave, linguistically speaking, around him. Her and I obviously have to keep talking English between the two of us because there's just no other option for us to communicate. When either of us is alone with the child then I suppose we could also speak our respective native tongues to help the child pick it up. But what if all three of us are together, such as at the dinner table? What should we speak?   My wife says we should have a mix where she speaks English to me and German to him, and I speak my native tongue to him and English to her. I feel this is very unnatural since I would like to understand what she says to him, so I feel it's more humane that we all speak English when we are together. But is this going to be harder for my son? He would then be immersed in three separate languages, which I understand makes it harder.  Right now he is still very small, so I guess it doesn't matter a lot yet, but when changing a diaper or picking him up she would speak to him some comforting sentences in German, which is obviously very natural, but if I'm there I'd like to understand those little jokes, funny nicknames and soothing metaphors as well. When I speak to him and she's there I do it in English because I want her to understand as well and then she's rebuking me and saying I must speak my native language. "
1149,Why does my 12-month-old slap us?,"My 12-month-old son has just recently taken to slapping us - the parents. He has been directing the slaps to our faces, chests and arms.  What is causing this? Is there anyway for us to stop it?  "
1150,Does a newborn/infant need to lay flat in a stroller,"I'm on the hunt for an inexpensive stroller to accommodate a newborn without having to buy a travel system and I'm having a really really hard time finding a stroller in any price range that will accept a newborn. The general advice I get from the not so helpful sales staff at most baby gear super stores is that infants need to be flat in the stroller.  This is my fourth child, and my old stroller finally died. I don't want to invest a whole lot of money in any more baby gear because I'm done after this baby. I already have an infant car seat, and I loathe those stupid baby carriers (the ones with the handles that you carry, not the ones you wear) that only exist to dislocate shoulders and ruin backs. So, I don't want a stroller that requires either one of those in order for it to be used by a newborn (under 3 mo).  I have found a few models in both jogger and traditional styles that recline pretty far, but not quite flat. And then I got to thinking about it, and newborns aren't flat in the car seat or those carriers, or in the little bouncy seats (that most of my kids spend the first 8 weeks sleeping in due to problems with reflux).  By pretty far I mean, an incline of less than 15 degrees.  So would almost flat be acceptable, perhaps with head stabilization? Or should I just get an inexpensive carrier to leave in a travel system stroller and hope it stays clean enough to sell on Craigslist once my baby grows out of it (usually by 10 weeks)?  You'd think by #4 Id have this figured out, but, I guess no matter how many kids you have, you never know everything! "
1151,How to encourage children to do their homework?,"I'm pretty sure no children like doing the majority of their homework. As a child, I resented it deeply because I felt that once I'd left school, I should also have left schoolwork. So I have every sympathy even though now, as an adult, I understand that it helps to re-enforce their learning which will stand them in good stead for exams and the like in later life.  Anyway, we have two kids of 7 and 11 and both, in their different ways, have a bad attitude to homework they don't want to do. The 7 year old throws minor tantrums, which can escalate into major ones if there's something more interesting to do or it's a subject that's strongly disliked. The 11 year old rolls eyes and puts in zero effort to get it out of the way as fast as possible.  As well as wanting them to do well at school (which they do), poor homework reflects poorly on the parents. They're at different schools, due to the age difference, and both schools make it clear that they presume parents will help with homework - so they obviously share that expectation.  Now, before coming to SE, I went to look for advice online. Much of what's suggested we already do: there is a quiet downstairs space for them to work, distraction is minimized, parents are available and willing to help but not take over or do it for them. We do not offer money or treats as a reward (online advice suggests not doing so) as we feel it sends a bad message about the reasons for education: knowledge and mastery ought to be its own reward.  We do not have a regular time slot for homework, because this would be difficult for a variety of reasons.   What surprised me though was that a common suggestion was simply to back off. You can't force children to do their homework and the consequences fall on them, not you. Saying ""no"" thus becomes a winnable battle for older children the way that refusing food can be for younger ones.  While this makes perfect sense, it is not entirely true that the consequences fall entirely on the child. Teachers are bound to think dimly of parents who cannot encourage children to do successful homework. I am also dubious that this approach will work prior to senior school, with the 7 year old.  Are my concerns valid? Is there anything else we can try? "
1152,6 weeks pregnant and having trouble eating regular foods?,"My wife is about six weeks pregnant is getting hit pretty hard with morning sickness and food aversions. She says most food smells like ""it's rotting"". So she's been falling back to mostly carbs since that's all she can get down without her stomach turning. I'm getting a little worried as proper nutrition is really important in these first few weeks.   She's been trying some home remedies (ginger-ale, tea, etc.) to settle her stomach and eat. Medicine that her doctor prescribed isn't covered by our insurance.   I'm afraid she still isn't eating enough or getting enough variety in her diet. Are there any liquid food alternatives that are safe for pregnant women that might be bland enough for her to get down to supplement the little she's already getting? If only temporarily until the morning sickness passes?  "
1153,How to teach a 7-year-old that things don't always go her way?,"I've noticed that whenever things don't happen how she expects them to happen, my 7-year-old niece starts crying, runs away, or engages herself with another activity that she has more control over.   For example, if we take family photos and someone says to her to smile, and she doesn't feel like it, she'll start crying and runs away. If we play a game and she loses she says the game is stupid and takes some colored pencils and starts coloring on her own. Or if she does something and someone suggests there is a better way to do it, she drops the thing she's doing and goes watch TV.  After she calms down she will engage again with what she was doing or with people, until something happens that triggers the same behavior.  I live in another town and see my niece rarely, so I though that's it's because she doesn't feel as comfortable around me as she does around her friends and immediate family, but her mother (my sister) says that it happens with them also.   She'll outgrow it in time I think, so I'm not worried that it's an issue, but it wouldn't hurt to work on it. My sister agrees, but at the same time tries to avoid it occurring because of the crying, self isolation, etc.  I think she'll be better if she gets more exposed to situations like these so she has more opportunities to learn, but since I'm not around my niece every day, it's not my place to decide. So what can be done? Should something be done or just give it some time? "
1154,what's typical for birthday parties in the USA?,"We are currently in the US (California) and my son is soon going to turn three. He's somewhat grasping the idea of getting older, and I also think he's old enough to really enjoy having a party. We're planning on inviting some friends with small kids (6 in total, 7 months - 4 years old) to our place. Birthday practices vary widely across the globe and we are new to this continent, so I'd like to have some idea of what is typical here. Just imagine you received an invitation to a three-year-old's birthday party and you have to make a best guess at what time of day it will start, how long it will last, what activities are going to take place...  Specifically, I'd like to know the following:   Is there a time of day that is most typical of birthday parties for this age? For us 11 AM works best (the little guy has a long nap after lunch) but I'm thinking this might be strange.  Should we put an ending time for the party in the invitation? This is not an issue if people typically arrive around the invited beginning time, but maybe they don't?  How long does a typical birthday party last? Is store-bought cake considered OK for such young kids? Or should we be looking for something special?  What sort of drinks are normally served? For the kids as well as adults. Do guests get something from us? (e.g. a bag with a small toy per kid) I know that candles and a birthday song are customary. Anything else? Hats? Is it understood that we will have a plan for entertaining the kids, or is free play more standard?  Do presents get opened in front of everybody? Do they get opened all at once?  Any other detail you might think of.   Just for clarity, we're not trying to mimic the all-American party, I just want to avoid big surprises :)  edit: Maybe I should note that in my country of origin a (1st) birthday involves bbq, alcohol and cigarette smoke in a restaurant, and opening presents - which are mostly envelopes with money - when everyone has left. Later birthdays involve cooking a feast. I know not to do something similar here, but I'm still wary of making really big blunders and was hoping to get some quick advice. "
1155,best age to start a daycare,"If you had a choice to stay with your single baby at home as long as you want to, would you still send him to a daycare to communicate with other babies? What age is recommended for starting a daycare, partial time / full time?  I would put a baby in daycare at 12 months. But many people think that it's too early.. "
1156,how should you deal with siblings or cousins that are sexually active with each other?,"Note: I don't have children myself, nor do I intend to have any, but I think it could be an interesting question.  Suppose you have 2 children (gender is irrelevant for this question) within 3 years of each other, and both older than 14 (so it's not statutory rape because of R&amp;J laws) who for some reason are having an incestuous relationship, and you found out about this. How should you handle this? And should you handle it differently depending on the legality of incest in your jurisdiction? "
1157,"dad jobless, scraping by","Similar to the question from: Working mother but unemployed father  except I'm 21 and will likely work full time in engineering after I graduate to support my parents. Anyways, my mom is constantly criticizing my dad for being jobless, and they argue a lot. Mom (and I) are making barely enough money for all of us. Dad is IMO a genius but is bad at English, in his 50s, and got his PhD in atomic and molecular physics from China so obtaining a job related to his research in the US is virtually impossible. Should I convince him to get a job completely unrelated to his work? Or stay out of this altogether? I feel like my mom is getting stressed out; if she were to loose her job... Plus, pop's extremely unwilling to go into anything not research related. Quite a nerd! "
1158,Any video baby monitors with multiple receivers?,"I am looking for a video monitor for an infant. If possible, I want to have multiple receivers for one camera, so it isn't necessary to carry the receiver around everywhere.  Summer Infant offers the Baby Touch Wifi; it comes with a receiver, but the camera can also be viewed on an iOS device using the SummerLink app. This solution is not acceptable to me because I find the app unusably bad.  Summer Infant also makes the Dual Coverage, which is the only dual-receiver video monitor I have seen. Given my unsatisfying prior experience with another of Summer's products (and many hours of experience with their customer service), I am hesitant to try this monitor.   Are there any other video baby monitors that can be used with multiple receivers? "
1159,Is there an age before which you should avoid the concept of death or dying?,"This question specifically addresses how to talk to a 5 year old, but I'm curious about younger kids.  I'm not talking about situations where death has become an important event in a child's life and something must be said (like the death of a parent or close relative).      But my toddler occasionally gets into a conversation where I can probably escape the topic, but the only honest answer involves death:     Where's your grandpa, mommy?   or      How come we never visit Uncle David?   So, my question is this:  Are there recommended ages before which the idea of death (or levels of it - animals, people in abstract, people you know, etc.) should be avoided?  Obviously, all kids are different in their intellectual and emotional progress, but I'm trying to get a sense for what average ages, if any, are appropriate for different levels of discussion. "
1160,From what age should I require the child to complete her homework?,"She started getting homework when she was 2 years 3 months old. How to encourage a 2 year old toddler to complete colouring a sketch?  Now she is 3 years 2 months old. Now she gets the homework of tracing lines and alphabets. Her daily homework constitutes of tracing nearly 24 lines on an a4 sized page.   She and I do the homework together. She traces one line, I trace another. I do NOT hold her hand while she writes. After tracing 10 lines she tells me that she is bored. I do NOT force her to complete her remaining homework.   Whatever homework she does, I ensure that she does it properly.  This means that I constantly require her to hold the pencil properly, keep the paper in a proper angle, stop at short distances and then start again so that she gets the time to see what she is tracing actually and whether she's going off track or not.  Well, doing homework properly requires patience from the child. And I can very well understand that tracing lines or alphabets 24 times can be utterly boring.  So, from what age should I require her to complete her homework even if it is boring?  P.S This is the same child who colored the goat blue. At what age should I tell my child to colour within the lines?  P.P.S She doesn't color with me at home at all now. "
1161,What's the cleanest way to change a diaper on an airline flight?,"I've gotten the technique of changing a diaper in a public restroom down fairly well if there's a counter or changing station.  But recently we took a flight and I discovered I have no idea how to change a diaper on a plane.  There are, I believe, three options:   Go to the lavatory and struggle with the impossibly tiny space, Change the diaper from your seat (ideally a bulkhead row), or Wait until you reach the ground to deal with dirty diapers.   We were fortunate that option #3 was available because our children waited until final approach.  But I wondered (and worried) about what would happen if that were not the case. Would it have been better to tie up a lavatory for the extra time needed to do the job with a squirming infant?  Or does the obvious necessity make stripping a child naked in public and exposing seatmates to the smell acceptable?  For a few hours a flight manifest becomes a sort of ad hoc community.  How can a parent change a diaper with maximum efficiency and minimal embarrassment for all involved? "
1162,Mom as kindergarten teacher of her own child,"Due to some conflict situation with previous kindergarten owner, we were forced to pull our 2 y.o. from this. In the middle of the year, it's a bit difficult to find new place for a child, but for our luck - my spouse is working as a teacher in another baby day-care. Kindergarten owner approved that she can go to her group until end of year (3 months from now).   We're pretty sure about the ethics of this deal - like caring same of all children in the kindergarten, but the question is, how to deal with boundaries - how to explain to a kid that mom at home is mom and at kindergarten she's a teacher?   Also, a good addition to the question: how mother can handle it? "
1163,At what age should a child's self-involvement begin to decrease?,"I can recall the first five or six years of my life being glorious, well, what I can remember of them anyway.   From what I recall, to me, the world was all about me. I was the center of it and I knew it, especially since the adults around me tended to reinforce that. Being an only child is something I'm certain contributed to my prolonged sense of entitlement as being more important than anything I saw. It diminished, rather quickly, around the age of 10 from what I can remember and conversations with my parents.  Is there an age where complete self-involvement begin to subside, as a child naturally begins to think of others with and before themselves and their needs? At some point, a child's idle conversation should strive to be more engaging of others, rather than self-narrative, right around the point that a child realizes that stating their immediate needs or desires might not be appropriate due to the circumstances at hand.  I know that being an only child has quite a bit to do with this. When you're the oldest, and a new sibling comes into your life, you get less attention and that's just something you have to deal with. Being born already having a sibling makes this just something that's always been the way it is.   Still, at what age (only child or not, though I suspect it might differ) should I be concerned that a child is still excessively self-involved and indulgent, and what can I do as a parent to help them to a healthier level of it? "
1164,Should I try to protect my son from hearing that his father wants nothing to do with his two boys?,"My ex husband, who was near 30 when we had our first child, and 33 when we had our second, hasn't seen his children since 2008..  We broke up when the youngest was 6 months but as his girlfriend was quite a bit younger, he never had time to see them..  Since we broke up he stood the kids up 56 times in the first year (I kept records) and then only saw them once a year for the next two years.  Since my oldest was 5 we haven't heard from him (he is now 12).  I have done all I can to protect them.  I don't talk nasty about him as they are half him, but all I can say is their father is selfish...    My oldest called his dad, and quite rightly, was upset and angry but the father hung up on him and then proceeded to send his son a text saying never attempt to contact me again..  So my son attempted to meet his side of the family by calling his grandparents who proceeded to blame me for it all..  When my son said don't try to pull my mother into this, his grandfather got angry so my son hung up.  Now says, I know what they are like and I am never contacting them again.  Have I done the right thing by letting my son contact them??  Or am I not protecting them enough?? "
1165,18-month-old kicked out of church nursery,"Our 18-month old was kicked out of our church's nursery where we send him during worship services &amp; church classes. He's kicked out unless one of us are in there with him, which makes it difficult to attend church with my spouse; we can’t have him into the worship center as he loves to scream and roam around the room, even when we bring toys and food to try to keep him busy. I’m the first to admit that is a wild toddler. He likes to throw toys, touch/push other kids and pull their hair, scream, etc. We do not condone his behavior.  He was kicked out for:    pushing kids and throwing toys (sometimes at the kids) trying to push over babies in baby carriers trying to bite other kids and babies (based on his behavior at home, I would guess this one is the least frequent of the issues)   The nursery staff reports that it happens so much that they are having a hard time caring for other kids in the nursery. We have a five year old who does like to ""play rough"" with him, but we have tried to calm that down because we fear that may be part of what's causing the problem. He does not attend daycare.  Does anyone have advice in these situations? The church nursery coordinator emailed us to officially tell us this information and also told us we were welcome to continue to go to the parenting class we were taking, but again if one of the two of us stayed in the nursery with him during class or found other arrangements for child care. We could listen to sermons at home, but there’s something about being in a community at church vs listening in your own home. And yes, we could hire a baby sitter, but that would get expensive. My parents love watching the kids, but they already have to do it enough that we can’t ask them to do this every week.  Our church pastor in his sermons always apologizes for peoples bad experiences at churches for others that have been turned away from the church from how they were treated in the past. I feel like we’re being treated the same hurtful way, but we do feel for the other kids in the nursery as well. Part of the problem I think is that their nursery space isn’t big enough and they for some reason refuse to hire any more bodies (it’s a large church with a large staff already). Sometimes there are 2 people watching around 10 kids including 3 babies. Ironically, we just had a sermon regarding the “lost sheep”, which is exactly how we feel.  Any advice on dealing with our child or our church? "
1166,Is school punishment for mediocre test results reasonable?,"My daughter is 9 years old, she's just started grade 4. We've had her in a school for gifted kids since kindergarten. It's been great so far because they understand the challenges that gifted kids face and tend to treat those challenges with a bit more empathy and compassion.  Yesterday I got an email from our daughter's new teacher saying that some of the children performed poorly on a geography quiz and it was ""not reflective of their true potential."" As punishment she made them write an apology note explaining the reason for the poor result and that they will study harder in the future while the rest of the class got to go do a fun activity.  The test and apology note were sent home for us to sign. She had scored 63%, which doesn't seem like a huge deal to me, especially for a kid that loves school, love learning, and normally does well. When we talked about it, my daughter said that this situation made her feel angry because she was excluded from classroom fun and ashamed of her performance.  My gut reaction is that this is a pretty severe punishment for what I see as non-event. This is the second time since starting grade 4 that we've received an email from the teacher over what I consider a mundane occurrence. I'm worried that if this continues that my daughter will start to develop negative emotions to school, start thinking of herself as a failure for not being perfect, or begin to withdraw entirely.  Overall, I've been pretty happy with the school in general. They seem to understand her emotional needs and are patient as she progresses. Emails we've received in the past seemed acceptable and lead to good teaching opportunities at home. My spouse and I are going to speak with the teacher in person next week to try to understand better why this is happening. In the meantime I'd like to get some other perspectives. This is the first time I've really felt like something was out of line and that's part of why I'm asking for other viewpoints.  Is this a reasonable approach for this teacher to take? Why or why not? "
1167,"How can we explain our ""cry it out"" strategy to people who oppose it?","My wife and I have had success with a form of the ""cry it out"" strategy with our three children.  I know it's not for everyone, but our household has gotten into some healthy sleep patterns without long periods of crying.  If it's possible for anyone to be successful with the technique, we have been.  So we have children that generally sleep through the night and a bedtime routine that works well for us.  But occasionally relatives come or we visit them, which inevitably disrupts the routine.  As a result, our infant twins have difficulty falling asleep and cry more than usual. For one particular relative, even a few minutes of fussing is beyond endurance and she will want to comfort our babies until they (or she) falls asleep.  That would be fine with us if it didn't mean another 2 or 3 nights of readjustment.  Most of our visitors are understanding; our babies cry a little more than usual when we have company.  But other people assume our children cry much longer than they normally do as a result of something akin to observer effect. How can we explain our technique to people who believe it is wrong or cruel to even temporarily withhold comfort from a crying baby? "
1168,9 year old son brought a toy gun to school – how can we get him to understand this isn't just about bringing a toy to school?,"My well behaved, bright, popular, naive 9 year old son brought a plastic toy revolver (the kind with the bright orange barrel to indicate that it's a toy) to school yesterday. He snuck it into his back pack because he wanted to show the girl across the street while they rode the bus to school. He had to sneak it because he knows that toys are not allowed at school.  I know he knows this because he was scolded two days before when I found toys in his bag, which I confiscated.    Obviously, he got caught with it. Another child saw him showing some friends and told their classroom teacher about it once they got to class. This child is probably the only one in my sons class that doesn't get along with my boy. I am not excusing my son's behavior at all, but the dynamic between these two boys is important to this situation.    My son has trouble understanding that he should stay away from this boy. He is, in my opinion, a liar, a back-stabber, and an emotional bully. My boy wants everyone to be friends, and so he continues to hang around this kid despite my warnings and having experienced multiple betrayals. Until now. He is, for the first time, very angry at one of his 'friends' and is struggling with it.  Per school regulation, my son was suspended for the rest of the school day, the ""weapon"" was confiscated, and he was interviewed by the principal, school psychologist, and a police officer. The school chose not to press charges, thankfully. His intentions were not even remotely malicious, so they were lenient.   I am struggling with how to punish him appropriately for this. On one hand, his principal told him today when we met for his reinstatement that ""it's over now, and we 're moving on. Let's put this behind us now and learn from our mistakes"" and so perhaps I should echo the tone and be forgiving and lenient, chalking this up to at worst a big mistake? On the other hand, my son is not exhibiting any real signs of remorse or appreciation for the seriousness of bringing a weapon to school (even though it's fake) and being suspended, or the sneakiness, or the fact that he deliberately disobeyed me and that makes me think I should come down pretty hard on him to drive the point home.  After all, isn't his lack of awareness (or respect for) the rules the reason we are in this mess?    I have told him that he is to be on his best behavior for now, and I've removed his electronic privileges while we think what his punishment should be. He's already shocked that there could be any more punishment besides losing the iPad and the 'ordeal' (his words!) at school. This is more evidence that he doesn't get it.   Here's where the other kid comes in: when I can get him to talk about this, without rolling his eyes or making jokes, his biggest problem with all of this is that it's ""not even my fault!"" Since the other kid told on him, after he touched the toy gun and praised my son for being so ""bad ass"" for bringing it in and then pretended to be an innocent, frightened witness, my son completely, thoroughly, blames this other kid. I secretly partially blame him too; for being such a two face I really can't stand him, but I bury it and correct my son; it's my sons fault alone that he is in trouble because when you do bad things you get caught and you get punished. He won't stop obsessing about the ""tattle-tail"" and I really think it's blocking him from seeing the truth here. I suspect he's blinded by the anger and hurt he feels by this kid's betrayal (although they never had any trust, my son falsely believed it was there.)  How can I help him to:   Accept full responsibility for his actions.  Nip the ""blame game"" in the bud.  Stay away from this other kid for good.   Punish him with the right balance of harshness for the seriousness of the offense and leniency for the lack of ill intent.      Everyone is on eggshells here at my house, any advice would be appreciated.   By the way, this is the ONLY toy weapon we've ever had, it was purchased by my mother, and it is long gone. We are not that sort of family where violence of any kind is tolerated, witnessed, or promoted. We don't even have local network television in the house, or violent video games. He wanted the cap gun because he likes the smell of the caps. Honestly. He's that naive to guns and what they mean. We've got real guns in the house, he knows this, and has no interest in them whatsoever. This event really came out of the blue. It is very unsettling however.     UPDATE  We ended up taking a middle ground approach in regards to punishment. Our first instinct, before I even put this question out for answers, was to remove the biggest distraction/infatuation of the moment so that he would be forced to focus on this. Minecraft went bye-bye. I did take DanBeale's advice though, and he got the iPad back almost immediately (sans Minecraft of course). We allowed him to reinstall the game after he wrote 2 letters of apology and thanks to his teacher for vouching for him and also for claiming he had a ""dentist appointment"" in an effort to shut down the rumor mill, and also to the principal for leniency.  He also had to purchase the game with his own money this time.    After that, we let the issue of the gun rest (at home) but I did request the school psychologist speak to him about WHY everyone freaked out about the gun. I went this route because my husband kept veering towards making jokes about all this and I just wasn't confident the message would be delivered in such a way so that it would hit home.  That's an issue for another forum I suppose.  My son has finally accepted that this other boy is not trustworthy, and is therefore not a good friend. I think he finally understands that relationships come in many shades of gray, not just super BFF's forever on one side and sworn enemies on the other. He has decided he'll still be nice to the boy, but won't purposely sit next to him at lunch- a shade of grey closer to the enemy end of the spectrum in 9 year old social circles from what I can tell. I never realized how difficult it is to explain trust and how important it is to a child until now. I think he gets it, but only time will tell. Thanks for the great answers. "
1169,How to encourage children to 'reign-in' their enthusiasm + socialness,"Our 8 year old (boy) is a rather socially vocal about things that interest him, or anything that grabs his mind, what I mean by that is that he will (at length) talk to anyone around him about his current interest subject (right now it's fishing) or his life (and our family) history, regardless of whether they've shown any interest or not. He will often random start conversations with people who have started an unrelated passing conversation with us (cashiers, random people on the bus, family members e.t.c) about these things, when it's clear (to us) that they are completely lost about what he's talking about.  We've tried explaining to him on numerous occasions that not everyone enjoys being subject to an half hour long conversation about fishing or Minecraft or Egypt or whatever the flavour of the period is, but it seems to not be getting through. It's gotten to the point where a lot of his school peers have started actively ignoring him when he approaches them because they're just not interested.  Obviously we don't want to squash his enthusiasm for these subjects, or any subject, to stop him exploring his interests, but we feel that he's going to have trouble finding friends if he doesn't recognise other peoples interest (or lack-of).  How have other people handled this (or similar) situations?  Personally I feel that some of the cause comes from him trying to establish himself as a clever child, as a lot of the children in his class seem to have a rather high opinion of themselves, but he is a clever child - just when he exerts himself. He also seems to be suffering from some confidence issues - he refuses to apply himself to things which he can do, he just doesn't think he's able to (but I'm thinking this is normal behaviour in children?) "
1170,My one year old daughter keeps waking up same time every night screaming and crying,"I am very confused and concerned - My 13-monthld daughter wakes up between 1:30 am and 3:40 am screaming and crying in her crib. I have tried giving her a bottle of milk, cup of water, cuddling her, rocking her, covering her, and singing to her. At this point I'm worried. It started about two months ago and hasn't stopped or gotten any better. She takes two naps a day and she goes to sleep between 9:00 pm - 9:30 pm. Am I doing something wrong?   She has three meals a day with several snacks throughout the day, she wears a teething bracelet and necklace, she drinks a sippy cup and a half of water a day, she plays happily and is fine all day with minimal tantrums, we go for walks, watch movies, read books, cuddle and babble to one another. Am I doing something wrong?  I want the best for my little girl and I am confused as to what to do for her right now? Is it me or is it a stage of some sort? Is this normal or should I schedule an appointment with her pediatrician? I don't know what to do and I want to help her through this. It is stressing me out and making me get no sleep. "
1171,When to introduce a half-sibling?,"My wife and I divorced. Ironically, our relationship now is better than before the divorce.   We have a son (5) who lives with my ex. He is not entirely aware of our situation. We split when he was just 18 months so for most of his life I was the Dad who lives far away (after the divorce my ex moved to our country of birth while I stayed as an expat in the UK).   My ex did not explain to our son our circumstances - she has been just saying to him ""Dad is working in another country"". We see each other on Skype every other week and I visit him for a few days every 3 months or so. Despite these relatively spaced out visits our bond is strong - he is looking forward to our time together (as I do myself). He seems to get upset when I leave (which breaks my heart).  In the meantime I met someone and we had our baby son (10 months). My ex is aware about it and has accepted the fact.  But now the question is - when to let our son know about his younger half-brother?  It is a delicate situation. As I have been away from him most of the time he may start to think that I have somehow abandoned him in favour of some other child.   I have recently moved to the same country with my new family. My hope is that I would get to have more time with my older son and, hopefully, would be able to integrate him with my new family. My new partner is supportive of that.  My ex went to a psychologist and was told that it is advisable to let our son know about his half-brother as early as possible while he is relatively young so that he comes to accept this situation as something ""normal"".  My current feeling is to delay. First, his brother is too young and probably not very interesting to him to play with. My feeling is that once his brother becomes more interactive (can speak, play, run) than, potentially, my older son can perceive him as a play mate.  What would be your advice? "

1173,Five-year-old fever: what's the cure?,"Five-year-old fever: that's what her teacher calls it.  I'm calling it (IN MY HEAD) the ""F*** You Fives.""  Apparently this is something that almost all of her peers are going through; if I had a nickel for every time I've run into another parent who exclaims ""OMG I thought I was the only one!"" when they relate their horror stories and I commiserate...  Apologies for the wall o' text below.  tl;dr: how do I get my 5-yr-old past these daily tantrums?  So she's having daily tantrums.  Usually at night, but not always.  And they are full-blown ""I hate you! I want to punch you in the face! I wish you were dead"" scream fits.  This is not language we use in our house, btw, and the kids never watch anything other than toddler pablum like Thomas and other cartoons, so this stuff comes from another environment (school, most likely).  The one thing that's in common for every tantrum is not getting her way: if her cousin can't come over, tantrum.  If her brother doesn't want to share his favorite truck, tantrum. If we refuse to allow her to eat candy before dinner, tantrum.    What we've tried:    We've taken away all electronic media and toys indefinitely, for both kids (and are definitely seeing an improvement in the 3-yr-old; going TV-free has been a boon for him, regardless of how this turns out).   She gets between 11-12 hours of sleep a night and we TRY to ensure she has a good diet (she's very picky and we're vegan, but last visit to the pediatrician (about two months ago) her blood tests were just fine, even for B12).  So yes, the doc says physically she's fine. We've cut out extra-curricular activities other than piano lessons, so she doesn't get too exhausted (we noticed an uptick in tantrums on the nights after tae kwon do, even though we were home 90 minutes before bedtime). When this happens, I do my DAMNEDEST to remain calm and unemotional, and try to talk her through this. ""So where would you go if you didn't live here?  Oh really?  How would you buy a house? Where would you find food?"" etc.  If she's mad because someone didn't do something she thinks they should have (or vice versa) I try to ask her how she would feel if the situation was reversed (this discussion happens after the screaming has dwindled down). I will take her to her room if she's just out to scream, but that rarely works well; she pounds at me and kicks the whole way, and either comes blasting out of her room the moment I close the door, or trashes her room to the extent she's able/willing to (last time she threw her pillows on the floor, and some rocks she's collected).   We do have a (to my eyes, at least) rather tight schedule; the kids have to get up in time for one of us to take them to separate schools (no bus comes here, since she's in a magnet school), and she has homework (even in Kindergarten) most nights.  We try to do a big chunk on the weekends, when she has time to focus, and she sails through it.  She also has to read every night, and she balks at both those strenuously.  (She doesn't like reading very much at all yet, unless she's in my lap at night, and for several reasons that doesn't always happen.  Especially not THESE nights.)     Either I'm missing something, or I just need to find my own peace with this stage.  Any ideas? "
1174,How do my husband and I get over our fear of having another difficult baby?,"We are first time parents. Our daughter is 16 months old and we've had a really rough time since she was born. We had no idea what we were in for.  It really has just been a combination of difficult factors, I had a complicated birth, she was a colicy baby, we later discovered she had multiple allergies we didn't know about (We discovered at 11 months she had a dairy allergy, and 15 months she's allergic to wheat, peanuts and egg too), which caused constant discomfort for her and guilt for us for not knowing what was wrong, family being far away with little outside support, difficulty with our mental health, sleep deprivation, lack of her weight gain, repeated infections/antibiotics, hospital stays, etc.   The vast majority of the issues have been sorted out. We are in regular contact with our family doctor and paediatrician, dietitians, etc. We're getting mental health help and generally feeling better supported. We're finally starting to feel like we're not drowning and are getting enough sleep.  All that said, we really can't imagine having another child and doing all this again. We both wanted to have multiple children and this has just completely dashed our dreams of a big family. We really just can't face going through the past 16 months again. I see people with more than one kid and wonder how they do it.   I wonder if everyone goes through this and I'm just weak and bad at coping. I really want to have more children down the line and I'm just so worried that we won't be able to do this again. My husband really is adamant he doesn't want another child, and I am grieving the loss of our dreams for a big family.   How do we get over the bad experience we've had and have other children? How do other people do it?    I've seen some comments about us disagreeing on having more children, or me not respecting his choice, and I just want to clarify that this isn't the case at all. We both wanted to have multiple kids, and we are both reacting to this situation very differently. I am respecting his choice and if it remains that way in the future then so be it. Now is not the time for more kids or fighting over how many we have, and we both know that.   This question really is just about my feelings, coming to terms with what we've been through, and working through our fears so that they don't drive our decision making regarding more children. The relational side of things is not really an issue at play here. "
1175,Are there any studies about effects of microwave ovens on human breast milk?,"With all due respect to passionate parents who type in caps ""NEVER HEAT MILK IN MICROWAVE"" is there any verifiable scientific study on how bad it is to heat refrigerated milk for 15-20 seconds?    Or is it just an expression of fear against unknown? On one of the forums I've read that microwave ovens emit ""sound waves"" that destroy ""atomic structures"" that lead me to believe that it could be just one another urban myth that was spread by the media.    Two main points against mircrowaving I've read:   Microwaves destroy proteins and vitamins. Does it? Destroy into what? Would not proteins be destroyed in the stomach anyway? Would conventional heating destroy it as well? Why is destroying bad? Would it destroy bad things, too?   Microwave heating is uneven and it could make a super hot spot that could burn the baby's mouth a bit. Is there a research of the risks? It does not create a super hot spot in my bowl of pasta if I mix it after heating for 2 minutes. I understand that fat in breastmilk is not homogenised and that fat can retain heat for long. What if I shake or swirl the bottle for 10 seconds? How long the hot spot could exist?     A few studies from the 90s I have found: [website][same website link] - same, no difference in B1/B6  if compared to stove top heating [website]Is there anything else? I would appreciate hearing your opinion on the matter but a link to a relevant research would be way more trustworthy.   "
1176,Baby Girl Stretching,I am a first time mother and I have a 4 month old baby girl. She stretches so severely and intermittently. Could this be normal? What could be the cause? 
1177,Does eating onions while breastfeeding adversely affect the flavor of the breastsmilk?,"This is something my wife's aunt, who is a nurse (but not in any maternity or pediatric field) advised us on. She said we should avoid giving onions to my wife (who doesn't like them usually anyway) while she's breastfeeding, because it can make the milk taste funny and thus make the baby fussy about eating it.   The main question is in the title. However, if it's a yes, to what extent is it true? Does onion powder or dehydrated onion have the same effect? Does fully cooked onion have the same effect? Does raw onion have the same effect?  "
1178,"What can I tell and what can I ask of a 2nd grade teacher, about my child's health?","My son is 6 and in second grade.  In general he is quite healthy, but he has illness induced asthma.  In other words, his asthma is essentially dormant unless he gets a cold or the flu, at which point it can become quite severe.  This morning he has a cough and a cold, and my wife and I decided he was well enough to go to school.  I would like to email the teacher to explain the situation and ask her to keep an eye on him; sending him to the nurse or the office if his breathing appears labored, or he appears to get more under the weather.  I don't know if this is appropriate, and if it is or if it isn't; are there any guidelines about what I should and shouldn't ask of my child's teacher?  She's a great teacher, and I'm fairly sure she would agree to whatever I asked, but I want to be respectful of her existing requirements and challenges while also honoring my responsibility as a parent.  TLDR;  What is okay to ask of from my child's teacher regarding his physical health? "
1179,How to make my 11-year-old boy more responsible?,"My 11-year-old boy seems irresponsible. I understand that he is still young, but I would like to have some advice on how I need to deal with him when he makes a mistake. For example, he damaged his phone, his school tablet, his own tablet and finally he just lost another tablet at school.  Other things I have trouble with are that if I tell him to ask his teacher about grades or something he never does. I have to email the teachers and keep up with his grades, but he never tried. When I ask him if, ""Did you tell your teacher?"" or ""Did you ask your teacher?"", he says, ""I forgot.""  He is doing well at school, but just because I'm looking over his shoulder and tracking his grades. I'm punishing him, like taking his iPad and computer from him, so he will not play games or watch YouTube. It looks like he is only thinking about his games and no interest in anything else. "
1180,What standard questions should one ask when interviewing a nanny?,"Obviously, depending on what your specific needs and concerns are, you'll need to tailor your questions to that situation.    But, in my experience interviewing candidates for different types of jobs, I've learned there are a number of questions that are much more effective in assessing candidates for a given role:   For any job requiring initiative, I ask the candidate to tell me about something they get passionate about outside of work.  (If you can't get passionate about something you love at home, you won't likely muster it at work). For any job requiring self-organization, I ask candidates for examples of things they've done in the past to stay organized. If I care about how much someone will prepare for a given work situation, I ask them their strengths and weaknesses (which are crap ways to learn someone's strengths and weaknesses, but anyone without a well-thought out answer has done roughly nothing to prepare for typical interview questions). When you're considering a surgeon to work on you, the key question is generally believed to be ""how many times have you done this specific procedure?""   Etc.  What are the key questions that one should ask a nanny or full-time babysitter? "
1181,"My baby screams all day long, non-stop, as loud as he can, and he finds it extremely funny","My baby boy is 19 months old, he screams while he plays, while he sits in his high-chair, while he is in his cot, while he has time-out, whatever and wherever he screams, screams, screams and does not stop.  It isn't a normal screaming either, he does it as loud and horrible as he possibly can, and his favourite trick is to do it right inside our ears by surprise, making us jump and go crazy.  Does anyone else have this experience, is it normal, what should I do about it?  We have been trying the time-out technique for many weeks but it has no effect.  After time-out, of any interval - minutes or hours, he just smiles and laughs and starts again to scream.  During time-out, either in his cot or high-chair, in the same room or in another room, he just screams like usual, it seems he doesn't care about it at all.  Is there any way to teach our baby to stop this or an alternative non-violent discipline technique to time-out?  How can we find out the real reason our baby is behaving with this extremely bad and stressful way?  It is ruining our lives.  After hearing that screaming, it has disturbed our minds, we cannot think straight or concentrate on anything at all. "
1182,Is there any reason to change diapers even if there's nothing in them?,"I work in a daycare. It's a chain of daycare centers staffed mostly by seasoned and educated professionals. I've been told by my boss and colleagues that we should change diapers regularly even if there is nothing in the diaper at all. For example, before a daytime nap or before a meal. I've been intending to ask them what their reasoning is, but I'm now doing some research online first.  My initial assumption prior to this advice was that there would be no reason to change the diaper unless there is urine or excrement in it. Or perhaps, unless it's hot and the child is very sweaty.   I guess my assumption may well be wrong, and therefore I'm asking this question.   I guess it could be something with comfort. Do diapers get less comfortable as they are worn, even if the child doesn't urinate or defecate? Or do they risk irritating the skin?   I'm primarily taking about disposable diapers, as cloth diapers are virtually never used in my part of the world.  I have searched the web for this question, and I have been unable to find anything that really answers the question. "
1183,"Should I tell my 10-year old son, how screwed-up Cinderella is?","My 10-year old boy recently told me that he likes the Cinderella fairy tale.  Some fairy tales including this one, have several layers of meaning and sometimes they guide people's life decisions.  Let's look at Cinderella from a realistic point of view: The stepmother humiliates Cinderella for a long time, while her father is watching and doing nothing about it. Her father is the first man she knows.  It's totally reasonable that she holds a grudge against him (for not preventing the attacks of the stepmother), and because she doesn't know other men, she is likely to project this concept to other men as well.  In her family she didn't have a chance to take revenge for her sufferings.  This changes when Prince Charming enters her life. It is likely that Cinderella will vent her anger on him and he won't fight back because he is noble and such.  Unfortunately, real life is full of stories when Cinderellas either   tolerate intolerable behavior from bad men/criminals and reject all those people (men and women), who treat them well.   I fear that if I don't tell my son about these hidden meanings, he may get the wrong impression that it is easy to be together with a real-life Cinderella, i.e. that you can improve the life of a ""broken"" woman without investing enormous amount of time, energy, love, money and sometimes major sacrifices in lost career/business opportunities. A real-life Prince Charming would need - besides a genuine love to Cinderella, which borders on insanity - a couple of decades of intensive work to heal Cinderella's wounds (based on my experience).  I also fear that he might have the wrong idea on the probability of success: Lots of men waste their resources on Cinderellas because the latter don't want to be saved (to lead a normal life without daily humiliation and/or violence).  Is there any possible harm if I tell my kid now about the hidden meaning of Cinderella?  Update 1: Re-formulating my question:  Can there be any harm to my son in   telling him that there are many ways to look at that fairy tale and explain to him, how I interpret it (and why I don't like it)   at this particular age?  In other words: Isn't he too young to learn about the existence of these unhealthy relationships? "
1184,How to help my child that has OCD with Sexual Obsessions?,"I have a son that is 15 years old.  He has Tourette's and ADHD and they have been managed well by my wife and I and his teachers at school.  He also has Auditory Processing Disorder.  Some of the problems we deal with on a daily basis are constant movement, fidgeting, and vocalizations.  He doesn't understand body language, many social norms, sarcasm, among other things.  He is in a Collegiate High School and has A's with a few B's.  On top of these problems that have become normal in our household, he recently started having problems with OCD.  It emerged and escalated very, very quickly.  In a matter of 1.5 months he went from what was his normal day to day to his constant fixations, ruminations, and the need to talk to us about them all the time.  He will fixate on something that disturbs him and he can't let it go.  He started doing things like rubbing his hands together until he got blisters.  He is not intentionally harming himself, he is just doing things compulsively to deal with the obsessive thoughts.  Then the OCD took a serious turn and his obsessions become sexual in nature.  And he will see someone, and the thought comes to him, ""why did I look at that person"" or ""I just noticed X body part"".  He then questions why he looked and if he is attracted to it.  It includes members of the family including grandchildren.  He is extremely disturbed by this and one of his compulsions is to constantly want to talk to us about what is bothering him.  He is in our bedroom first thing in the morning, he talks first thing when he gets home from school, and every night before bed.  We have explained to him that it is the OCD, that he isn't attracted and that articles we have read and printed for him explain that because they disturb him he isn't thinking about it because he is attracted.     Sexual Obsessions and OCD explains what he is dealing with to the letter. Some portions of that are below:     Sexual obsessions can take many different forms. One of the most common is related to homosexuality. A girl who is heterosexual might   become obsessed with the idea that she is gay. She might have every   reason to believe she’s straight — she has always had crushes on male   movie stars, she might even have a boyfriend — but she starts to   wonder: What if I’m gay? What if I’m attracted to that girl — does   that mean I’m gay? Kids with this obsession might try to “test”   themselves by looking at pictures of pop stars and trying to evaluate   whether they find them to be attractive or not.      Or a child might worry that he has done or will do something sexual   without consent. This can be something as small as worrying that he   has offended a peer by inadvertently brushing against her in a crowded   hallway. Or he might be plagued with worrying that he might commit   rape. He might have zero desire to actually commit rape, but the   possibility that he might is terrifying to him. He might walk with his   hands in his pockets and keep a larger distance than is normal from   people, to lower the risk that he might do something inappropriate.      People with sexual obsessions might also worry that they have taboo   sexual desires such as pedophilia or incest. Just as in the other   examples, they don’t actually experience these desires, but they are   disturbed by the possibility that they might. These kids might avoid   being alone with family members, or avoid being alone with children,   at all costs.   And     “Like other obsessions, the difference is when kids have them they   cause a lot of anxiety and distress and avoidance of the situations   that cause the thoughts,” explains Dr. Bubrick. “Pedophiles actively   seek out situations to be alone with children and like those   experiences, whereas someone with OCD who has those obsessions will   feel extreme guilt and shame. They’ll avoid those situations and feel   horrible about themselves just for having the thought.”   He starts therapy next week, and I have a psychiatrist appointment for him in two weeks.  The question is how do my wife and I deal with him on a daily basis?  While we understand the condition it is getting increasingly difficult for us to hear him say the disturbing things that pop into his head as he continues to fixate.  Mind you, these are thoughts that include kids from school, church, and people in his immediate family.  It is constant and relentless, we feel so badly for him, we are very worried.  We spend at least 2 hours a day talking to him. It is affecting relationships all around.  It is draining us and we are almost to a breaking point, which he won't deal well with. "
1185,Does expressing or pumping breast milk during engorgement affect supply?,"According to some websites, it does not affect your milk supply if you express breast milk during engorgement, so long as you only express enough to relieve discomfort. Even this medical foundation website  gives this information, but there are no citations on it or the others.  Is this information true or untrue? Why or why not?  Note: A lactation consultant can and will be consulted for all of my family's lactation needs. However, I don't expect such a person to be able to quote to us specific studies or articles on the subject (even if they are able to!) We'll trust their judgment, but I still want to know the basis for that judgment. "
1186,How to use Band-Aids for childhood injuries?,"I'll use the term Band-Aids, despite it being a brand name for adhesive bandages. I know they're not used solely by parents, but this question came to me because of parenting. My son is reaching an age where he's started to scrape up his knees and shins, so I'm sure he'll be wearing plenty of Band-Aids in the near future.   Do Band-Aids do anything more than protect the skin from debris or irritation? As in, do they decrease healing time or reduce scarring?  Are there negative side effects to using them? Growing up, my mother would often tell me not to wear a Band-Aid on cuts and scrapes for the whole day, because my wounds ""needed oxygen"". Is there any basis for this? These days, I assume that it's really about keeping the area dry, but I don't know if there's more to it.   Can the adhesive cause side effects, such as clogging pores or instigating skin allergies?   Is there any purpose to the different sizes and shapes other than giving coverage of the wound and contouring the body? For instance, butterfly bandages are designed to hold deeper cuts closed.   Are there times when it's definitely better to use a Band-Aid instead of just cleaning the area and keeping it dry and clean?   While this is many questions, what I'm really asking is: What's everything I need to know about using Band-Aids in regard to common, minor childhood injuries? When to use them, when not to use them, potential risks, potential benefits. Anything that clears up any common misperceptions (if there are any), would be excellent.  "
1187,At what point should I choose to have a c-section?,"There is a good history of obstructed births in my family; something to do with pelvises apparently. My grandmother had problems, my mother wasn't able to have any of us 4 without c-sections after labor (which nearly killed my younger sister) and a 1st cousin recently needed an emergency c-section for the same reason.  I don't know if I'm affected by the same genetic condition, and won't know until the day.  Interestingly I've talked to the midwife about this twice and she doesn't seems to think it's a big deal. I don't even think there's a note in my file.   The pros and cons of c-sections are immaterial here, obviously I would prefer to have the child naturally if possible, but I'm realistic. I'd assumed it would be OK to try naturally, and if things start to go at all difficult to opt for a c-section.   I recently heard that it is less stressful on both mother and baby (with faster recovery time) to just choose a c-section rather than to have an emergency c-section.  My question is:      how do I respectfully handle this with the midwife and the hospital? How do I tactfully make them fully aware that I'm not paranoid, this is a genuine risk?   Am I better just requesting a c-section (though I'd rather not for health and hormones)?  Worst case scenario, at what point on the day would I ""pull the pin"" and seriously ask for a c-section?   On the other hand should I just have blind faith in my health care professionals? I want to, I absolutely trust in the profession and believe in them -- but the health of my unborn child is paramount to me and I want to do everything I can.  Despite my pregnancy being ideal so far, after listening to the family horror-stories, I honestly believe there's a good chance I'll be end up on the chopping board. Either way I just want what is healthiest for us and to know what my options and rights are, while having utmost respect for the hardworking professionals involved.    For those curious to the outcome: the baby chose. After 29-hours of labor (having we believe both ""Passenger"" and ""Passage"" complications). She became distressed and it was a painless decision between me, my team and the professionals involved to have the caesarian as soon as possible. After the necessary epidural anaesthetic it all happened like a machine. Overall it was a stressful day, but it usually is. Note that we chose a major public hospital that performed C-sections. The (purportedly ""nicer"") insurance preferred choice wasn't able to and we would have required a (likely unpleasant) transfer. Having chosen to be at a place to perform the operation limited our options, but fortunately the public hospital completely exceeded expectations, with freshly renovated maternity ward with all the mod-cons and many (free) days in hospital to ensure everyone was fine. Everyone is thriving in the end.  "
1188,Why is my 3 year not wanting anything to do with her mommy? (Biological mom is deceased),Biological mom had ALS and passed away when baby was 1 year old.  I’ve since met this woman who my daughter calls mommy.  We’ve been together for 1 and 1/2 years now.   At first she was all over her and now my 3 year is wanting nothing to do with mommy.  Doesn’t get excited when she comes home.  Doesn’t try to interact with her much at all.  Mommy is the disciplinarian and I’m not as hard on her.  I work and am gone 2 weeks at a time.  I don’t understand what happened?  What do I do to help the situation?  When do I start telling her that she has two moms?   
1189,Is it ok to pick up my 11-month-old baby with one hand by the shoulder?,I heard recently that it isn't good for children's hands and elbows to be spun around while holding their hands. So I never even pick up my child by the hand or forearm.  I normally pick her up by putting both my hands in her armpits and picking her up that way. However sometimes I have something in my hands and I need to pick her up with one hand. Is it ok if I pick her up using one hand grabbing her by her upper arm? Can I carry her a short distance like this without causing any damage? Is it ever ok to pick up a child like this? At what age does it start to become ok? 
1190,Raising children in corrupted country,"I live in an under-military-coup-too-much-corrupted-country. There is a big gap between values and reality.   For example, policeman or military soldier should be a model for kids; They -normally- love him or -at least- feel safe while he is around. In my country, it is the inverse, stay away of them as much as you can. So the kids learn from school or TV that 'ask the policeman for help' and learn from us 'never ever talk to a policeman'.  This is just one example  of conflict between values and what happens in reality.  Question: What shall I tell me kids? The reality or the values? "
1191,Swaddle for energetic infant? Or am i thinking this wrong?,"So our girl (5 months chronological, 3.5 months or so adjusted) has a pretty strong tic when she wants to go to sleep. Her arms and legs flail pretty wildly and seems to keep her up.  Why does it seem so? If i do a ""manual swaddle"" and hold her arms, she slowly slowly calms to sleep.  BTW: she doesn't seem to have Moro response any more.  It's warm now, so we use a muslin swaddle cloth.  With the give and stretchy in this, she flails out of this pretty easily.  She runs hot, so a flannel cloth is way too warm for her.  We tried the Miracle Blanket, but with both strength and size she grew out of it.  Same with the Nested Bean Zen Swaddle - she's strong enough to break out of the velcro in literally 10 seconds.  So, how do I help calm a flailing freakishly strong girl? or should we be looking at other calming aids? "
1192,How should I prepare my son for preschool?,"My son has been going to a small, in-home daycare since he was less than a year old.  He enjoys it, but currently there are only 3 boys that are about the same age as him (ranging from about 6 months younger to about 1 year older), and none of three attend 5 days a week consistently (they seem to average about 3 days a week).  The other children are all younger (from about 8 months to 14 months of age) and not yet verbal, so my son (age 3-and-a-half) has little-to-no interest in them.  My son gets along well with others, and has some friends outside of daycare.  He is not at all shy, and loves to strike up conversations with anyone we meet.  A couple of months ago, we put him on a waiting list for a more formal pre-school-through-kindergarten program.  We're expecting a spot to become available late this year or possibly early next year.  Rather than wait until the last minute, I'm looking for tactics and strategies for making the transition as positive for him as possible.  How can I get him excited about it?  How can I keep him from getting upset about leaving his familiar setting?  How can I best prepare him for going from having 2-5 other kids with him each day to having 10 or more classmates? "
1193,How to deal with Encopresis in primary school?,"Our son has Encopresis since many years (the history is described here: How can we potty-train our pre-schooler outside the home? ).   He is now 6 years old and in some phases (which often last 2..3 weeks), it happens 2..3 times a day nearly each day that he has stains of poo in his underwear, sometimes even a large amount of poo. It is already difficult in the Kindergarten to get the different kindergarten teachers on our (and his!) side to support him and help him with understanding ... he just is not able to really clean himself alone in such a situation. He sometimes/often tries to avoid getting cleaned by the kindergarten teachers and hides until he gets picked up by his parents, so it is even more difficult to clean him if it's dry already and he has been running around smelling strongly for some time...  Anyway, soon he'll go to school and the situation there will be even more difficult:  It seems that nobody there feels responsible for such a child:   the kindergarten teachers have asked the school teachers what they would do in school, if he poo'd in his pants: they would call the parents to come and clean him. This would be very difficult, as we are both working some kilometeres away and can not get easily and quickly to school at each time.  Also if I imagine how it would be if that happens 2 or 3 times a day... it's impossible to deal with...    school seems to have proposed that he wears a diaper... that only avoids underwear getting dirty, but cleaning himself will still be a problem (as the bowels are often very loose and nearly fluid in such situation) - he won't be able to do that alone - and he also can not sit in a dirty and stinking diaper in classes for hours ... the other children will probably josh him     I know that this is a really difficult question and maybe there is not ""the"" answer, but I'd like to know if anybody else has similar experience and found a way to get support and help from school or somewhere else to avoid that the parents have to be available all the time in case of such an ""accident"" or that the child is left alone with his problem and the dirt and misses his classes waiting for someone to come and help him...  Finally, encopresis is an illness.. shouldn't there be some help for such children? "
1194,How can you offer other parents suggestions without making them defensive?,"Because we parents spend so much time  complaining to each other   sharing best practices, we often find ourselves in situations where another parent is sharing an approach or technique that we have learned or read enough to know is less than optimal:     ""Hot dogs are your two-year-old's favorite food, you say? And he only eats them whole?""   or:     ""Vaccinations?  Who even knows if those work?  We do know they gave a number of celebrity's kids Autism.""   And those are the easier ones - often it's more like the parents who don't want to ""stress"" their children with any pressure to establish regular sleep routines, but describe a house full of parents and kids who haven't had more than two hours sleep in row for years.  The challenge, and the question I have, is this.  In those rare instances where you feel you really have something important or useful to share:  How can offer people you care about suggestions without either making your friends defensive, or by coming off as someone who considers themselves a parenting expert?  (I am all too aware that the most important job I've ever had is also the one I'm least prepared to handle.)  My instinct is always to start soft, so as not to seem too pushy ""I think I read that hot dogs might be a bit of a choking issue for kids that age,"" but that seems to go badly, because the softening on my part makes it easy for them to brush it off (""My pediatrician told me what to worry about, and didn't mention that - it's fine"").  And at that point, pushing harder is starting to feel like an unwanted intervention.  And I know I can ""mind my business,"" but I see that as a last resort; I'm talking about cases where I care about both the parents and kids, and respect the parents. "
1195,Brandy for Kids,"My son is 4yrs old. And it doesn’t matter a kid is older than 4yrs or younger than 4yrs; some of my family members prefer Brandy even for a kid, if he/she is suffering from cough and cold.  Even I have seen a statutory warning on the Brandy bottle so I am confused.  Is it recommended for kids? And  What can be the negative effects of Brandy, if it’s given to a Kid for cough and cold? "
1196,How can parents bring up children with multiple languages at the same time?,"Have you been bringing up your children with multiple languages at the same time since childhood? What is your result? This means your family has the foreign environment to often communicate each others, not just let your children go to school to learn foreign language but don't use at home. Usually this case will happen if   Parents/GrandParents/Relatives know foreign languages and would like to teach children Family is living in foreign country   According to news from internet, there are some places on the world like Singapore, India etc people usually have been using some languages at the same times since childhood. So this is possible to do, right? And how many languages can be taught maximum at the same times for children, maybe 3-4 languagues? "
1197,Finishing their plates vs eating later,"Sometimes one or both of our kids (boys, 4 and 7) eat very little at dinner, stating that they've had enough. We do not want to force them to overeat, so usually they have to eat at last half of it and can leave the rest.  But sometimes we just know they will be hungry later. If they are, they can get some bread. If there were any leftovers they'll get that. The thing is that we saw it coming.  Should we have encouraged or even forced them to eat more at dinner?  Should we not give them something when they're hungry later, to make them feel the consequences? "
1198,How to teach a toddler to identify colors correctly?,"Perhaps I am rushing a bit but I'd rather ask and get feedback rather than just let it slide. I've recently been working on teaching colors to my 2 year old daughter. She can say the common colors if repeating after me, but when I ask her to identify the color of an object, she always defaults to ""green"".  Is this normal? Is she perhaps confused about what I am asking her at this moment in time and I will see positive results later? When she gets one wrong, it's not like I get on to her or anything crazy like that. I just tell her the actual color, she repeats and we move on...and the next object is green too.  Am I doing something wrong? Am I expecting too much? "
1199,What are the pros and cons of having an advanced student skip a mid-elementary grade?,"At the end of third grade, our daughter's teacher approached us (and our school's principal) and suggested that with her test scores (high-school level) and level academic mastery, we should put her in a private school with a gifted and talented program (our public school system has, for I think good reasons, done away with that), or else have her skip a grade. She felt like our daughter's level was such that differentiation within the fourth-grade classroom wouldn't be sufficient.  We aren't really interested in private school, and were a little concerned about social issues, and eventually a deciding factor was that the ELA curriculum for fourth grade focuses on writing and composition — an area that's always been one of our daughter's rough spots. So, with the help of the principal and teachers, we came up with a plan where she divides her time between 4th grade (homeroom, ELA) and 5th (math).  This has worked reasonably well (she's continued to excel at math and has really caught up in the writing skills), but had some problems as well — the daily classroom switch was stressful, and since our state has mandatory testing, that was done at the 4th grade level for all subjects (she did just fine, but again, it was a stressor). So now, as this year comes to a close, we're evaluating what to do next year — whether to continue the split pattern, to move her entirely into 6th, or even to stay in 5th and work with the math teacher on more advanced / in-depth education this year. (The principal has indicated that all of these are options).  I've read What are the pros and cons of having an advanced student skip Kindergarten?, and found the answers helpful in general, but I think the situation at the start of the school system is different from that at later grades — see for example this answer.  I recognize (and again see the prior question) that social groupings might be a factor, but in our case, our daughter really only has a few close friends in her grade (and we'll continue to be friends with those families anyway), and already has friends in the higher grade as well (from the math class, and just from the neighborhood).  What are other factors we might consider, and particularly, ones that might be especially important at this grade level? "
1200,At what age do children notice the absence of a parent?,"This past weekend, my wife went on a retreat while I stayed home with our 1-year-old twins.  Since they were sleeping when she left, there was no separation anxiety.  The next morning, I changed them as usual, but instead of taking them to our bedroom where my wife normally feeds them, I took them downstairs for milk in their highchairs.  After that a brief moment of agitation, they went through the rest of the day without seeming to notice my wife was missing.   In fact, they didn't much notice anything different unless there was some change to their schedule; who was taking care of them didn't seem to have any noticeable impact on their behavior or attitude.  When my wife returned home, they obviously recognized that she was gone.  When we take them to nursery at church, they notice when we leave.  But as far as I can tell, they don't miss us when we are gone.  It got me thinking: when do children first become aware of the absence of someone important to them?  Are there any studies on when children might start missing a parent who is no longer around? "
1201,How to talk to parents about death?,"My parents have always tried to shelter me from trauma (divorces, illnesses and deaths in the family, and so on) which makes it difficult to broach the subject of death with them. This is more of an issue as they grow older and others in their generation grow ill or die.  What are good ways to persuade them that they can talk to me about these events, rather than continue to try to 'protect' me from them by not mentioning them?  For added difficulty, I live about 7,000 miles and 8 time zones away from my parents, so starting a casual conversation probably isn't as easy as if we were in the same town - anything in particular that can be recommended to overcome this? "
1202,First solids and food allergies,"I started introducing solids to my baby at 4.5 months (by our ped's advice). Here we are, 1 month later, and my baby developed a local rash after 3 out of 5 foods (rice, barley and sweet potato).    How can I be sure its a food allergy, and not another kind of rash? 2 of them appeared 40 minutes after the meal, and disappeared several hours later. One of them appeared in the end of the day and there are still some minor signs 1 week later (maybe its not a food allergy?) If a baby is allergic to cereal, when should I try introducing the cereal again?   "
1203,Dealing with teens and pornography?,Say you know that your son watches pornography and you may or may not have caught him in the act. How do you react to this ? Do you ban him from using the internet/monitor his activities or overlook if you think he watches a little bit once in a while ? Assume that he is not a addict and has a life beyond the internet. Please share your thoughts and/or experiences with me.  
1204,Do you need to boil bottled water,"Is it necessary to boil bottled water before giving it to a 8 month old? Surely bottled water that has a shelf life of a year can't have any bacteria in it, else it would not last a year at room temperature. So, is there any reason why it would need to be boiled before giving it to a baby? "
1205,What could cause my baby's bedroom to smell like bread after sleep?,When my baby is awake it smells normal. But when it sleeps it makes its room smell strongly like freshly baked bread. The room is clean and has no odor when unoccupied. My baby's urine smells normal and the room smells bready when its diaper is clean. My baby's hair and breath don't smell unusual. But morning after morning I wake to the aroma of a freshly baked baguette.  Is it normal for a baby to smell bready? What could cause this odor? 
1206,I am vs my is - when do children develop this bit of language?,"My son can string together some quite complicated sentences.  But he still say ""my is"" rather than ""I am"".  So, ""my is ready!"" rather than ""I am ready!"".  When do children learn this bit of language?  I'm avoiding ages because all children are different.  But I assume language development is similar so what has to be in place for children to move to ""I am""? "
1207,What potty training goals should I use for my son's reward chart?,"We've promised my 3 year old son an aquarium for when he completes potty training.    Progress has not been as good as we'd like (he pees on the potty almost every day, but has only pooped once).  Our pediatrician suggested a chart, with specific goals he could work for, to make it more ""real"" than a nebulous promise of an aquarium when he's done.  We took him to the pet store, and had him pick out the tank, inhabitants, and ornaments.  We're planning on placing pictures of each of the items he picked out on a board, with specific goals associated with each item that he can work towards, and see progress with stars under each item.   For example, to get the aquarium itself, he'd need to complete all other goals, plus go x number of days in ""big boy underwear"" without an accident.  We've got between 10 and 14 different rewards to incorporate.  He picked out 14 things, but I felt that that might be too many (plus I'm not sure we can fit all of that in one aquarium).    We want to start him right off the bat with feeling like he's making progress (so maybe something really easy for the first reward?), and we want to ensure that he continues to be motivated to continually make progress.  What goals should we set for each reward? "
1208,food feeders can be used for baby lead weaning?,"Can food feeders be used as first steps to baby lead weaning (6-7 m.o baby)? Or there is really no connection? If not, is there any benefit in food feeders over puréed foods?   I mean food feeders like Kidsme Feeder or Munchkin Fresh food feeder       This award-winning product allows your baby to enjoy lots of delicious foods without the choking risk. Simply put a piece of fruit, vegetables or meat into the mesh bag and snap shut. Your baby can chew, suck and enjoy all the whole food goodness and taste, with only the tiniest, digestible pieces coming through. Your baby gets great flavor and you get great peace of mind.  "
1209,Are there drawbacks between reading stories from ebooks rather than paper books?,Talking of story books:  The ebooks are much cheaper than the paperbacks of the same title. I am not rich so I am considering buying ebooks for the child and let her read on the laptop rather than the paperbacks.  Are there serious drawbacks with regards to children reading from ebooks verses paperbacks?  Is some age factor involved here?  My infant can't read right now. 
1210,How do you differentiate between allowing the child to disagree with you and letting her get her way?,"From: How to raise a child such that she has high self esteem throughout her life?     Love unconditionally, allow her to make mistakes, allow her to disagree with you (This is not the same as letting her get her way), and avoid movies where the man rescues the princess.   I found the quote enlightening but I can't make out how to differentiate between allowing the child to disagree with you, and letting her get her way? "
1211,"20m Old Baby Is Insanely Cranky + Clingy + Not Leaving Her Mom, We Are At Our Wits End!","My first question here, and here's the situation:  20 month old baby girl. Had a bout of the rainy stomach bug 5 days ago, she was down with a bad fever for 2 days, recovered from the fever on the 3rd day.  But from the last 3 days:   She has eaten like 5 tbsps of rice. That's it.  She's still breast fed, so she's feeding almost every other hour (obviously she's hungry?)  She's become insanely cranky and clingy, not leaving her mother even for a second.  Interact with her with anything, ANYTHING, and she starts crying inconsolably. And we have tried like everything, the only response is crying + submissive behavior.  She's not in pain or discomfort, when we put some of her favorite videos, she will watch them... sitting in our lap of course! She does have a little runny nose, but not like a full blown cold.   We are at our wits end now, how do we resolve this? Is this a phase? She was never like this, always quite independent at home.  How many days can she go without any food? And we have tried ALL her favorite foods, she just keeps saying no to every one of them, as if we are offering her poison, and oh yes, she also starts crying then too!  Help please, this is our second child, and though we are ""experienced"", this is something we are not able to decipher... "
1212,How to encourage a toddler to swallow his food?,"Our three-year-old son is quite picky when it comes to food. He has not been interested in eating fruits and vegetables, but recently he started to dislike certain meats as well. He would munch the food in his mouth, but not swallow it.   Is there anything we can do to encourage him to swallow his food? Or is it something that will pass after some time?  His daily food consumption is something like the following:   07:30 chocolate bread, cheese, 1 milk  10:30 1 yoghurt, 2 biscuits 12:30 rice, pork or chicken soup, eats a lot 16:00 1 milk, 2 biscuits 18:00 rice, pork or chicken soup, eats a little   We have been following the above routine for some time, but I wonder why only recently did he develop this habit of not swallowing his food. "
1213,Should children of incarcerated parents be told the truth?,"On Saturday mornings, I visit a nearby county jail.  Most of the men I talk to are fathers.  Some are serving short sentences and others are awaiting trials that will likely result in lengthy separations from their families. (Longer terms are served in state prisons.) Since I represent a spiritual tradition that many of these men respect, they often ask for my advice on their parenting situations.  One situation that occasionally comes up is whether it's good for the children of inmates to be told the truth of their parent's situation.  For those facing long terms, I feel the answer is simple: tell the truth.  If the father does end up in prison for many years, children will certainly need to know and might resent the deception.   But what about men who are going to get out of jail shortly? Are children significantly harmed by the harsh reality that their father has been punished for misdeeds against the community? Does the nature of the crime and the age of the children alter the equation? "
1214,"I've taken all of my 13 year old daughter's possessions, and she's still disrespectful","I've taken everything except for three outfits, a bed cover, and her pillow.  What is my next step?  I rarely whoop my girls, but my 13 yr old has pushed me 4 times in 3 months to have to spank her!   I give her ways to get her stuff back, but as of today she has lost the chance to earn anything back until she can respect me, and lose that smart mouth!    She repeats every problem behavior my oldest had done, just 50 times worse!   I raised my kids kind of strictly. They have morals, and know right from wrong. They know their manners and know how to say ""yes ma'am,"" ""no ma'am,"" when to be quiet, and when to speak, but it seems like both my girls have to learn things the hard way. They do seem to learn from it, though!   My 13 year old thinks she's always right and knows everything. I don't know the reason she thinks she can tell me ""No,"" or smart-mouth me, but she is sadly mistaken.  My question is: what do you think my next move should be?  I had a strict upbringing as a child, and probably got spanked, but I think it helped make me into a good person, so I am not opposed to the idea of spanking, if it will help. "
1215,Are crib mobiles helpful to infants?,"I remember coming across many suggestions that we add a crib mobile to our crib for our baby.    I believe that they were cited as ""providing stimulation"", and I recall seeing something about bright, strongly-contrasting colors being ""better"" for the infant.  I've also seen suggestions that mobiles may provide overstimulation, or hinder sleep.  Are there any reputable studies on crib mobiles?  Do they say if they are helpful, harmful, or both? "
1216,Talking to a highly defensive young person,"There is a particular young person with whom I have have regular interactions that appears to take every interaction as an attack. Thus if one were say ""I do not wish for you to shove your things in there"" they would ""defend"" themselves and say ""I did not shove them there I placed them there"" and conflict could soon escalate due to the smart arsed answer.  Likewise if approached about her behaviour she would say ""for example?"" Which is leads to drawn out debates in which she ""defends"" the individual points of example. She honestly does not see that what she is doing is passively aggressive and unhelpful.   I know that this particular young person has had a bad history and has her own mental health issues so I can see why such behaviour has developed. For example she is emotionally very immature and prone to taking things far too personally.  What strategies and approaches can I use to speak with her about behaviours that are unacceptable or to tackle topics that might otherwise trigger this defensive behavior? "
1217,Worried that Kumon tutoring is not working for our daughter,"We have enrolled our 6 year old daughter in the Kumon tutoring service for maths since November 2015, and at first she enjoyed it, completing the worksheets well and seeming to really understand her mathematics. We then started her English a few months ago, and again, she started well, enjoying it.  However in the past month or so, she's stopped enjoying it, finding it harder, and losing concentration with it, making silly mistakes in the process. She's losing her passion for Kumon, and it seems to be extending to learning in general. She's also not being actively taught in class, and she recently started column addition, but really struggled, meaning we had to go through it with her.  We try not to put any pressure on her, and only really complain about her results when it seems as if she's not put effort into the work, which recently is becoming more and more common.  We were thinking about stopping it, as if she's not enjoying it, we're worried about the impact it might have on her learning. We've also spoken to another parent that started it with their daughter, and they've now stopped it, because they thought it was stopping the passion and creativity for her, so we think it might be something that doesn't help for some children.  We were thinking it might be better to start a one to one tutor instead, as there's more teaching involved (which is kept to a minimum in Kumon), and it may help keep her creativity and passion for education.  Has anyone used Kumon? And do you think it's better or worse than a private tutor? "
1218,My step son is being treated for ADHD and we are not sure if he should be,"My step son is 7 years old. He lives with his mom and step dad. His dad and I have him every other weekend, summers, and holidays that his mom will allow us.   He gets in trouble at school and mom says he throws tantrums and is just bad at home. He has been treated for ADHD. We didn't agree with the diagnosis mainly because we have never seen him exhibit any behaviors that his teachers or mom describe. Even when we have him in the summer, he's a little hyper but nothing that seemed abnormal to us.   He likes to be active with us and we oblige. Between us, his dad and I have 4 boys. They all are well behaved and polite, they argue and fuss with each other, which to me is normal, but they don't throw tantrums or are aggressive toward me or dad. What is going on here? How can he act so different at our house than he does at mom's? "
1219,Asian growth charts,"The WHO growth standards are applicable worldwide and designed to suit all ethnic groups, but given that genetics play an important part in stature, can parents of Asian children rely on different growth charts that are specific to the growth patterns of Asian kids? In particular, does anyone know of existing growth standards (with percentiles) for Chinese or Japanese children? "
1220,Is walking barefoot bad for my child's health?,"I've heard all my life that walking barefoot on a cold floor would make me (when I was a child) more susceptible to catching a cold and things like that.  My wife keeps saying that to our child.  Is there any evidence (scientific is better) that this is true or false?  Is this some sort of urban legend?  UPDATE (Apr 10th) - I am specifically interested in the correlation between getting a cold and stepping barefoot on a clean, cold floor. "
1221,Inadvertently hurting others' children,"This question may seem a little strange, but I guess it does nonetheless have to do with parenting, or with how to relate with other parents and their children.  Last evening my girlfriend and me were in a club where there was an air hockey table. We wanted to play a round and started to get noticed by a curious little girl, who was the daughter of a couple who also was there. They didn't watch her closely (but hey, who could 100% of the time?). At some point she touched the surface where the disk bounces, and I told her not to do it again, because it was dangerous for her fingers.  I was stupid enough to not warn her that the disk may ""jump"", and guess what happens? In a perfectly fine match (disk never ever jumped away from the field), one time the disk flies into her eye.  Of course, it was not done on purpose, and I immediately felt bad about it. Neither me nor my girlfriend felt able to comfort the girl (it felt out of place for us to do it) and we called their parents to do it. We apologized too. The guy was absolutely friendly and basically said ""things happen"", while the mother took care of the little girl. After a while, I saw the child smile again and noticed she didn't have any ""damage"". I went to her and apologized to her too, explaining that we didn't do it on purpose, and asking if she was well now. I also shook her hand and presented myself and my girlfriend.  The mother was ice-cold.  How do I handle these kinds of situations, and avoid parents' rage? Was our behavior ok with the kid? Should we have comforted her right after the fact happened? "
1222,Strawberry flavor yogurt melts for a 6 month old?,"I know you're not supposed to feed 6 month olds fresh strawberries. But, are cooked processed foods like strawberry flavor yogurt melts ok? What are the rules on introducing strawberries and strawberry flavored items? "
1223,How do I tell my daughter she has a half-sister who wants nothing to do with her?,"When I was young, I'd had a daughter, ""Sam"". She's now about to turn 17. Her mother and I never married, and never considered being together. I pay child support, and communicate frequently, but we have no real interaction outside of emails. Sam doesn't have any real interest in me, or my current family. I do now have another daughter, ""Rene"", who is about to be 11. She doesn't know about Sam. I've not told her because I know how excited she would be to have a sibling, and how crushed she would be to find out that Sam wants nothing to do with her. Taking nothing away from Sam, Rene is an amazingly bright, happy, wonderful child. She's also very sensitive to her own feelings and the feelings of others. I know that Rene would be devastated to find out Sam would want nothing to do with her. And it would break my heart to see her go through that. My question is how do I tell her about Sam? Should I tell her about Sam? Should I have done so already?  "
1224,How to gain weight for one year infant,"Are there any natural home made equivalent recipes for baby formula milk . Is it possible to make natural formula milk at home itself containing all nutrients found in breast milk?  Also  what other natural foodstuff can for a 1 year(9 month) old with the goal to gain weight?   Note: Already we are giving breast milk and her mother is again 7 month pregnant and we forsee that breast milk would stop due to nearing the labour but that is not helping to gain weight as per the Indian standards and the pediatrician did not recommend lactogen or any supplementation except Vit D and calcium but was worried about weight gain for which she asked to take natural food stuffs like mashed potatoes , egg yolk,etc  but this is not helping to gain the weight due to fussiness and we dont want to fall upon lactogen or any commercial feed. "
1225,What to do about the incestuous relationship between my daughter and her cousin?,"I walked in on my daughter having sex with her cousin. They are both 14 years old. It happened in my sister's house in her double bed. I wasn't sure on how I should react but I told my sister and she just ignored it.  This isn't the first time that this has happened. They have had sex on numerous occasions and I have seen them kiss a few times. Me and my sister are the only people who know about their relationship so they only do this when they are either alone or if me or my sister are in the house. They have admitted that during sleep overs they have went into each other's rooms and spent the night there.   I asked them if they see anything wrong with their relationship and they said no. Before their sexual relationship they were pretty close. They were like best friends and I think they have confused that relationship with a more intimate one. They have told me that they love each other and that they want to continue their relationship and one-day get married.   How should I handle this, since I'm concerned about the incest part? Should I encourage their relationship? If not, what should I do from there? "
1226,Is my 2 year old son jealous of his kid brother?,"my toddler son is two years old, one month ago I and my wife were blessed with the birth of our 2nd boy.  My old son seems to understand the situation and welcomed his kid bro at first. Recently, however, my wife raised concerns that he might be a little jealous of the little one.   What she observed were:   he shows reluctance to visit his mother if my wife is with his kid bother; for once he made some unfriendly moves toward his brother, like pinching his legs - not to the extend of real harm, though. he was already little spoiled and now becoming more demanding for attentions, for example, he insists on more hugging and carrying in arms, which I urge my wife and relatives not to do, as he became very heavy now and I am afraid he would become less independent.   I thought my wife was over worried, nevertheless, to be fair, is her concern legitimate? And what should we do if it proves so? "
1227,Single Working Mom Wishes to Homeschool Child,"I'm 14 weeks pregnant and I am seriously considering homeschooling for my child.  How can I learn more about homeschooling in general, and specifically for single moms who have to work? Are any of you single parents who have successfully homeschooled your children? "
1228,6 month old baby sleeps 30 minutes in a stroller,"My baby started to sleep only 30 minutes in a stroller. The rest of the time he looks around or just looks at me. It doesn't matter if a stroller is moving or standing in place.   Can I help him sleep longer? I'm wondering if he doesn't sleep because he is not comfortable in the stroller (it doesn't fully recline - uppa baby vista)? Or he is just too curious about the singing birds, cars and other outside noises? (At home he sleeps from 45 minutes, up to 1.5 hours)  thank you "
1229,How to console a baby who prefers to cry alone?,"I might be over worrying this issue but I have realized whenever anything say like he hurts himself- not bad just during playtime and he starts crying, instead of coming to me for comfort or consolation he will rather prefer to walk away crying and go to his room.   I have to call and follow him so that I can console him, it will take him like minutes before he accepts my consolation. I really feel sad about this.   Is this okay?  I've always seen kids run to their parents for consolation whenever something happens to them. My son doesn't.   He's almost 20 month's now.  Update: no other strange behavior. He surely listens when I ask him to stop doing something - I'm not hard on him, he's still small. The only thing I can say is that he doesn't like being assisted. He's already shown some strong independence traits, can this be the reason. Do independent kids behave like this?  "
1230,Am I making the right decision for my child in removing the father’s choice?,"My daughter (age 5) has ADHD and ODD and a disorder I forget, but basically issues because of her AWOL dad. He has past charges of smoking Marijuana in front of her. This is Pennsylvania, where it's illegal. She knows what ""drugs"" are and told me about a month later. He just got in trouble months back for beating and tattooing another inmate while he was unconscious after the judge gave him a warning to behave. He's been in jail countless times. Paid child support once. Always leaves her with a sitter instead of cherishing his weekends with her. He doesn't stay on the agreements. He has taken her from my home and not given her back into my care until I call the police who say they can't involve themselves even though we had custody in a now-over PFA I had against him.   He is to be released in October. I had to ask the jail to refuse mail and phone calls from him because he threatened me and my husband. He's the smart stupid. He knows as long as he doesn't mention that he can and would harm our child, physically or mentally, or that he will take her and move out of state, that I have no grounds to have his parental rights revoked. He convinces his family into getting my daughter to go see him. They ask her before me so I am the bad guy if I say no. He claims I keep him from being in her life but he kept doing and selling drugs. Showed up to probation drunk a day I was taking her to see him. He is always in and out of jail and even put hot sauce on her tongue when she was two because she ""talked back"". She always begs me to see him and says she loves him. His separation and her knowing too much about him thanks to nosey family has caused her to be unruly and everytime we get her to a positive point he breaks her heart.   I'm currently attempting full custody. Am I right in this? Do I have a strong enough case to want this for her? I never would remove him totally because that's her decision when she is older. But he shows no urge to fix himself and I feel he should not be able to make any decisions in her life. I know he will try to take her when he gets out and is served with custody papers. What precautions should I take legally, if any?   For the record she wouldn't even know him from the guy at Walmart if I didn't keep pushing their relationship the whole time. She thought my roommate's poster of wiz Kalfia two years ago was him, and later thought some guy at McDonalds was. All she knows and loves of him is because I let her have photos and I tell her stories painting him as good. I've recently stopped talking about him all together because he hasn't showed interest in being a real father in five years. I don't want to encourage his fake attitude anymore. I can't keep painting for her. But it's even harder watching him lie to her and crushing her over and over.   He has a history of drugs, violence, guns, and more. My current fiance (husband in 4 weeks) has fathered her for 2 1/2 years. (He was her friend first easing into their relationship). Because of her love for her bio dad she will yell at me and tell me no matter wants to see him because of what he tells her. Am I wrong for taking his choices in her life away? He hasn't proved he can parent at all. "
1231,"What is a healthy, ethical way to deal with a nanny cam?","I know how silly it sounds, but it makes me feel better: I'm asking for a friend.  (We've decided we don't need one, as our nanny appears to be far more capable than we - it might make more sense for her to film us.)  I'm not interested in legal concerns - we know our friend has the right to record video in his home without disclosure (at least in areas without an expectation of privacy for a visitor, like bathrooms, obviously).  It seems like videotaping someone trusted to care for your kids is reasonable in some circumstances - you want to be in a position with enough trust that you don't need to (and we are lucky to be), but realistically, can everyone expect to get enough in an interview and from references to be sure of what happens when they're away?  The question is this:    How do you deal with the notion of creating a video, essentially to test trustworthiness, without risking violating reasonable expectations of trust/privacy yourself?  It seems like taping a room without disclosing it means that you might capture things that really shouldn't be exposed. Someone changing clothes, after your kid pukes on them, a private phone call during a nap, etc.?  What are best practices here?  Note: I'm well aware that we have a philosophy site, but this particular question would seem to have much more personal experience in a parenting community. "
1232,Can too much water lower the level of an important minerals? In 11 months toddler?,My 11-months toddler drinks around 1 liter of water a day. He likes to drink and drinking also calms him down sometimes. He is breast-fed one time a day.   Can too much water lower the level of an important minerals? For 11 months toddler?   ps. I have seen many questions about drinking water and none of them address my concern. 
1233,How to react to a girl's mum inviting themselves to my daughter's party?,"I'm having a 4th birthday party for my daughter, and invited about 8 girls out of 40 or so kids from her Kindergarden class.  Today I received a text from a girl's mum, saying that they lost the invitation and can she RSVP with me.  Problem is that her daughter was not invited in the first place, and they must have found out from someone else, and think that it's a 'whole class party'. My daughter doesn't want her daughter to be there as they do not really play together.    Do we just invite them to make this whole thing go away, or stand our ground and let them know that they were not invited? If so, how to put it gently?  "
1234,Is it okay to leave a 6-month-old with her grandparents to go on a week-long vacation?,"Our baby is almost 6 months old, and we have a week-long vacation booked for 2 days from now. Suddenly, my mom got really scared because a friend told her that a baby left alone at this age (6-18 months) can be scarred for life.  So I'd like some advice, mainly two questions:   Is it true that leaving such a young baby with his grandparents could create long-term trauma? I'd appreciate links to professional articles that both agree or disagree with this claim. Since the baby is not actually 6 months yet (she will be 6 the day we plan to return) - does it change anything?   Update  Wanted to let you know that we ended up taking the trip, and except for the day we got back, the baby seemed to behave exactly the same as she did before we left her. The first day she cried more than usual, I think it was more due to the emotional atmosphere of both my wife being so excited to have her back, and my parent's having a hard time letting her go :) "
1235,How to properly clean the ducks and his friends?,"You know, these ducks.  My little one loves her ducks, some ducks friends, a small manual portable shower, and so on: all they go to her bathtub and we play a lot.  In the end, although I squeeze, shake, dry using a hair-blower, there's always some water left inside. And no matter how I clean using hot water, put them in the boiling water on my stove, after some time I can notice that something (algae?) is developing inside. So I go and try everything again.  How can I clean them after every bath ? Or how can I clean them every x days?   Edit  Those cheaper ducks could be thrown away, but some of the others are hard to find/expensive. And the mini-shower wouldn't have any fun without splashing real water (that we use to bath the ducks during the bath).  For reference: an almost duplicate question but with different answers: Cleaning bathtub toys that squirt water "
1236,Why should I be hell bent on educating my toddler when she's going to learn the stuff anyways when she grows up?,"Considering How to create learning opportunities for the toddler who is already *extremely* interested in books?  I was wondering why should I be hell bent on educating my toddler when she's going to learn the stuff anyways when she grows up?  When she grows up to 6 years of age it will be utterly easy for her to know what is hard and what is soft or about shapes and colours or the numbers/alphabets, then why should I bother her and myself when she's just a toddler?  Authoritative answers requested. "
1237,If and how to childproof USB outlet for a 2-year-old?,"I bought and installed an electrical outlet with USB chargers. Then, I childproof the power outlet and wondered if the USB ports needed to be childproof too? What if my two-year-old toddler put a flat screw driver in to it? Would it be problematic?   Update: I've emailed the manufacturer and they gave a similar answer to what you guys give -- There is no harm to the child but in the case of short circuit we have to rely on the fuse and the breaker. So Thanks every one for the answer.  "
1238,What is the risk of SIDS for babies which sleep on their stomach (no other risk factors)?,"Bear with me, as I'm not very good with statistics. As far as I can tell the risk of SIDS as of 2014 is 1 in 2,500 according to the CDC (obtained by reducing the 38.7 deaths per 100,000 to lowest terms). However, the CDC gives no information about the risk of SIDS for a baby whose parents follow all the recommended guidelines. In other words, the SIDS statistics include parents that smoked and wrapped children in large warm blankets. Is there any information about the risk of SIDS for a child which prone sleeps in a situation with a firm mattress, non-smoking parents, no extra bedding, etc.? It would also be great to know the risk of SIDS for the same baby sleeping on his back too. Please include sources.  The only information I could find on the risks of SIDS without other risk factors is this blog. It states:     Taking this into account, for people who have no other risk factors, here are the new odds (roughly):      — Chances of a prone-sleeping infant succumbing to SIDS with no other risk factors: about 1 in 20,000 (range 10,000–25,000)      — Chances of a supine-sleeping infant succumbing to SIDS with no other risk factors: about 1 in 50,000 (range 25,000–60,000)      (Note — the numbers don’t quite match up with the other statistics quoted above, because the estimates were generated from a few different studies and calculated in a couple different ways.)   However, the author admits that he cannot provide sources but claims that he looked at several medical studies. "
1239,How should the parent respond when a teenager tells about their ended relationship?,"[website]  Or perhaps as a teenager they confided in a parent about the pain they felt regarding a relationship which had ended, but instead of receiving comfort and understanding, they were simply told &#8220;not to worry about it&#8221; and &#8220;things like this happen&#8220;.   Throughout the child&#8217;s life, they constantly craved to be seen and understood by their parents. To be visible. But instead, they were made to feel ignored and misunderstood. Invisible.    What is the proper way to respond in this situation instead of saying ""Do not worry about it"" / ""Or things like this happen""? Why is saying the above statements bad?  "
1240,"Potty training 20 months old, doesn't know when she needs to go","We've started potty-training our 20 months old girl, during a 10 day vacation (from work and daycare). At first she would not sit on the potty, but that improved after the first few hours and now she mostly has no problems with the potty.  The problem is that she doesn't seem to know when she is about to urinate - she will go around the house or play and suddenly start peeing. When she notices this she would start saying ""pee pee"", but we are pretty sure it's from seeing the pee come out or feeling it run down her legs, and not from knowing that she is peeing.  We've tried various suggestion we've read on-line - having her in underwear or naked, praising (and rewarding) every attempt to use the potty (and the few successful hits), playing with a doll that also goes potty, asking her if she needs potty (the answer is always ""no"", even if she would then pee 30 seconds later), sitting her on the potty for a 10-15 minutes, etc. We are careful to have a positive atmosphere, never scolding her about the accidents.  She can go for an hour or more without peeing, both when with a diaper and without one. She also seems to be able hold peeing - sometimes she would pee, notice it and stop. Then pee a little again after 5 minutes. This might go on a few more times, until she lets go a lot of pee.  We're worried that she is just getting frustrated - she seems to understand that peeing is in the potty, but doesn't know when she needs to pee. Is this something that is developed during the potty-training? Or is this something that just has to come with time and we can't really do anything about? Since toddlers (and babies) have been (and still are in various other cultures) potty trained this young and younger, apparently without a problem, we hope that she will soon learn to recognize when she needs to pee. "
1241,Son has roughly 20 lice. Could he got them just yesterday?,"Just got a phone call from other parents where my son played yesterday and they informed me they have lice.  We used the anti lice shampoo and combed out roughly 20 lice, some of them clearly grown up.  Could it be that he got lice just yesterday? I would have thought that he only has a few lice then if he got them just yesterday? So I am wondering if he had lice for longer than just since yesterday. "
1242,My 12 year old daughter just smiles when we're trying to talk to her after she gets in trouble,"My daughter is 12 years old. When she gets in trouble or we(parents/teachers/coaches) are trying to talk to her seriously, she has a smile/smirk on her face. She looks like she does not care what we are trying to tell or her show her. Can it be a nervous reaction or just disrespect? How can I help her to overcome this or teach her this is not the right way to react? "
1243,What to do about my 12-year-old son who doesn't show interest in anything?,"I have a 12-year-old son. In the last 2 years, he has shown no interest in doing anything, not listening, not hanging out with friends, etc. He doesn't like cleaning up behind himself, is just not interested in anything. He goes to school most of the day and does his homework. He likes to cook. On weekends, he sits around and is on his phone or just stays in the house.  I would ask him what he would like to do and he would say ""I don't know"" which is the answer to everything. I took away his phone, but he still acts the same - uninterested in anything. Please Help! What should I do? I try rewarding and taking things away, but that doesn't work. Does he need counseling? "
1244,My 9 year feels I publicly embarrass him,"I understand my 9 year old  is at the age where children are beginning to assert their independence and are about to begin cutting the apron strings. From my experience with his big brother, I understand that, apparently, boys really don't want their moms to volunteer at middle school, for one.. fathers are a different matter: you can be called a mama's boy, but not a daddy's boy, right?  In any case, this is not middle school yet. This is a gifted student program (where everybody is a geek and a mama's boy to a degree and there are no bullies), in a district where parents are known to volunteer a lot and keep a close eye on the kids at school.  So, as a single(ish) mother, what is my role then?  We are at the phase where my son is very affectionate in private, wants to sleep in my bed, can't tell me enough times how much he loves me; he is still OK with me volunteering. However, should I do something that does not meet his strict expectations at school (such as sit where other people apparently don't sit), he has tears running down his cheeks, he shows me his fist, and, worst of all, he is very public about admonishing me and publicly yells at me for ""embarrassing him"".  On some level, I understand what's going on; but, in our culture especially, family comes first and respect for parents is non-negotiable. I don't think this behavior would be OK in any culture though.. he would not think about treating his teacher or principal this way, wherever he happened to sit.  I am certainly going to have a talk with him. What are your opinions about how to navigate this stage? "
1245,How should you deal with (deliberate) selective deafness?,"It's a pretty point blank question. In case you don't know what selective deafness is, here's an example:     Me: ""Hey Timmy, help me carry the laundry?""      Timmy: ""...""      Me: ""Hey Timmy, I really could use your help; there is a lot to carry""      Timmy:""...""      Me: ""Hey Timmy, I just saw the ice cream truck stop outside""      Timmy: ""What?! Can we go!? Can we go!?""   I don't have any children named Timmy but you get the idea. What do you do in those situations? "
1246,Should parents of young children set an example of socializing by using Facebook?,"If parents don't use Facebook, how will their children know how to use Facebook or other social media technology in healthy ways?  Should parents be utilizing these technologies so at least their children will have an example?  I'm talking about infants/toddlers, those who are new to life and technology.  "
1247,Wrist tendonitis from carrying babies,"So, our girl (of twins) really needed to be picked up to be soothed.  Both me and mom have tendonitis in our left hands.  Specifically I was diagnosed with de Quervain's, though mom technically hasn't been diagnosed yet.  I assume others here have had this issue as well (mom's mom had it, from carrying mom's sis when she came out of a second hospital run).  What did you do to get better?  Any exercises, or are the cortisone shots coming fast in our near future? "
1248,Dads and nurseries,"I'm the father of a three year old son who attends a workplace nursery in the UK. I'm together with his mum and admit can be a lazy so-and-so (in life in general, I make efforts not to be) but certainly don't consider anything beneath me, or ""for mums"". Part of that is that I drop off and collect my son from nursery, as well as things like changing nappies, doing bed time, medicine, cuddles, and so on. So far so unremarkable, it's not the 1950s.  Some of the staff at nursery, though, consistently treat me like I'm incompetent, or an idiot who doesn't understand how one human being looks after another, or say things like ""Look, [son]! Daddy's come to take you to mummy"". I'm told everything slowly and multiple times. If both of us (mum and dad) go there for a meeting, I'll barely get a glance. They'll also simply not listen to things I tell them to the extent that I ask my wife to tell them something so that they'll remember. It's not something that tends to happen in the rest of my life.  For a while I thought a mixture of ""I'm just being touchy"" or ""Maybe they're right"", but it's starting to get ridiculous and I can't really sustain that any more. It's really wearing me down, making me feel useless. I worry that if it goes on then they'll start thinking I'm neglecting him. I wonder if it's the way I dress, or my attitude, or something I once said.  So here's my question, is there a way that I can kind of politely and subtly change this? Is there some attitude or strategy to kind of indicate to them that I might not be a complete waste of space when it comes to either being a parent or worth communicating with? Something I can do to seem worth it? (Assuming that's the case and they're not just right). "
1249,7 Yr Old Using Violent Language During Play,"My 7 year old son has started using words like 'kill', 'murder' and 'stab' when he's playing with me or other kids. He's not angry or violent about it. For example we might be playing/pretending to be ninjas and he'll say ""I'm going to murder you"".   His school teacher emailed his mother and I and said that his use of these words had upset some of the other students. I can't help but think it was more upsetting to the teachers than the students since, again, he uses these words in the context of play and has no history of violence. Indeed, he's an extremely sensitive boy and will get weepy when I do nothing more than raise my voice.  His mother is very concerned about this and wants to get him into counseling. I'm less concerned and am more willing to chalk it up to behavior befitting a 7 yr old boy.  Should I be more concerned than I am? Is his mother overreacting?   Thanks in advance. "
1250,How should I respond to a parent who's upset their child wasn't invited to a (small) birthday party?,"For my son's 10th birthday we told him he could invite 3 friends over for a sleepover.  The party was a ton of fun until the next day, ( for me that is!)  I received a text message from the mother of one of my son's friends ( whom was not invited to the party.)   She texted "" so are you going to make me ask or a are you going to tell me?""  I responded with a "" what!?""  She replied, "" why wasn't (my son) invited? ""  I told her that I hope his feelings aren't hurt and that we left the decision up to (my son) and the other reason was her son wouldn't  like having to sleep in the basement and watch a scary movie.( all of which were big problems in the past)   The mother of the boy who wasn't invited told her son that he wasn't invited to the party.   She made the comment that she was more hurt than her son.    The relationship between her and I has been... eventfull.  She wants us to be ""BFF"".  I mean I like her and all but I'm not the type of person who wants to hang out with them every weekend and go grocery shopping together.    My son and her son don't really have much in common.  My son is big into sports whereas he doesn't like sports.  Her son plays video games daily whereas mine is only allowed to play on Saturdays.    Any input on this would help as I'm now upset with her for making this into a big deal and being yet again, more drama into my life.  "
1251,Baby falling backwards when he learn to sit,"How can I save a crawler from falling backwards and hitting his head? If I carry him till his back and neck can support his head weight will he learn to sit?  We keep him on a rug on the floor when he learns to crawl, and I keep pillows on all four sides too. Still he moves and falls where there is no pillow; he moves off of the rug and falls.  I can't sit with him all day and hold him when he falls. How do you save a 7 months from falling? "
1252,Can toddlers be taught to safely navigate stairs?,"We have 14-month twins who are just starting to learn to walk. Our house is a split level townhouse with three short flights of stairs. We have several gates to keep them safe. They're pretty competent at climbing up steps when supervised, but getting down them is a huge worry.   Obviously, we don't want to let them loose on the stairs until we are certain they will be safe. How can we help them learn to climb and descend stairs on their own? What are the signals that they are ready to be alone on the stairs without too much danger? "
1253,What happens when you feed cold milk to a baby?,"I often read the recommendation that milk for newborns and infants (breast milk or infant formula milk) should have body temperature (~ 37°C). Usually, this recommendation is just stated as a fact (without scientific reasoning) or with some useless ""generic"" reasoning (""It's best for your baby"", etc.).  Hence, my question: Will bad things happen if milk is fed at room temperature (20-25°C) instead? If yes, which bad things? If not, why is body temperature recommended?  Note: I do know that milk (breast milk or infant formula) should not be ""old"", due to bacterial growth. That is not the question. I am asking about ""freshly prepared"" milk. "
1254,Is bribing children with cash incentives a good idea?,I pay my 5.5-year-old [tex]1 in rent when she sleeps in our bed.  I've also taken to offering her $1 to pick up her 2.5-year-old brother's Lego messes.  Good or bad?  When should I stop? 
1255,"How to deal with ""no""?","We are near the middle point of age 2 with our first born. At this point, she has learned a few words, which we are excited about since we are a bilingual home. One of her favorites is ""no"". I realize this is most likely just a phase and everyone talks about how toddlers are becoming independent, testing their parents every move. The reason I am concerned is because it has gotten worse. Ever since our second was born, she has said ""no"" constantly and is just generally defiant. I realize she is most likely jealous of the perceived attention drawn away from her and put on to him, but I don't know how to let her know that 1, we still care about her and love her deeply and 2, at the same time, let her know that her behavior is unacceptable. Has anyone dealt with a situation similar to this? If so, how did you approach it? "
1256,Zipper on Newborn Sleeper Gowns,"I've been in the process of sewing some clothes for a newborn coming in the next few months. In looking at designs for sleep gowns, it seems like they almost universally go over a child's head, even though many people recommend avoiding that the first month or two of a child's life and look for something with a zipper or a side snap style - a preference these first-time parents I'm sewing for share. Is there some reason I'm missing not to put a zipper or buttons down the front of a sleep gown? Pros versus cons for zipper versus buttons? "
1257,How can we help children learn to handle online freedom?,"It's clear that children growing up with the internet the same way that my generation grew up with television: it's ubiquitous. Just like my parents worried that too much TV would harm me, it's not difficult to worry about my children being harmed by the 'net. This last week, dana boyd wrote a thoughtful opinion piece for Time Magazine:     What makes the digital street safe is when teens and adults collectively agree to open their eyes and pay attention, communicate and collaboratively negotiate difficult situations. Teens need the freedom to wander the digital street, but they also need to know that caring adults are behind them and supporting them wherever they go. The first step is to turn off the tracking software. Then ask your kids what they're doing when they're online&mdash;and why it’s so important to them.   This is great advice and I wholeheartedly intend to follow it. My 10-year-old son certainly is growing up with the internet and we talk a lot about the things he does online. (Mostly he plays Minecraft and watches instructional videos...about Minecraft.) Checking in on his activities (by asking, not snooping) has been reassuring.  However, he managed to install a ton of adware on our family computer. (I suspect he followed some link claiming to make our computer run faster.) Thankfully, I caught the problem early. When I asked him about it the next day, he was evasive. He seemed relieved, actually, when I mentioned that I had turned on password protection for administrator tasks to prevent problems in the future. I suspect he knew he'd screwed up and was worried about how I'd react.  I'd like to believe that communication between children and parents will make his online interactions safer, but what can be done when communication breaks down? When shame prevents a child from coming to the parent for help, doesn't that make boyd's advice somewhat risky? "
1258,What are the objective arguments against immunizations for infants and children?,There has been a lot of talk lately about the alleged harmful (potential?) side effects of vaccinations/immunizations for infants and children. What are the objective arguments against immunizing? 
1259,Is it common for a toddler to cry when things are not in order?,"For example, our 3-year-old son would cry when   his younger sister was standing when she was supposed to be sitting a door was closed when it was supposed to be open we had not put his socks on before he went to bed his pram was left outside the house, when it was supposed to be inside he noticed his pillow case is changed   We tried to explain to him that he didn't have to cry, but it didn't seem to work. How do we help him not to cry over these things? Is this something that will soon pass as he gets a bit older? "
1260,"Can fraternal twins develop their own ""language""?","I've often heard about twins forming their own ""language"", but I've always assumed that it only applies to identical twins. Is there any research out there on the subject? Does it apply to both fraternal and identical twins? "
1261,Enforcing minority languages at home,"We're a bilingual household in a country that speaks a third language.  I speak Finnish to the kids, my wife speaks Japanese, and I speak Japanese with her.  Our older son recently started going to preschool, so he's picking up English at an expected-but-still-astonishing rate.  He occasionally tries to speak it with me, in which case I pretend not to understand until he switches to Finnish, and my wife does the same for Japanese.  So far so good.  But now he's also started speaking English to his younger brother, who's not yet verbal but will be soon enough.  Uh-oh.  Now I realize that English will be their primary language (as long as we stay here), and I'm totally OK with that, it's my strongest language as well.  However, I would like them both to have a decent grasp of their parents' languages, so I'm not too keen on 'unnecessary' English in the house; unlike this question, my wife and I never speak it at home.  So: should we enforce a ""no English at home"" rule?  If yes, how and to what extent (eg. at dinner table, when talking with both of us, even when it's only the two of them), and if no, why not?  Extra points for links to actual research.  Update: To expand on this a bit, our children have three passports, and it's entirely possible that we'll move to another country (with a fourth language!) at some point.  Our short-term goal is to make them fluent enough to talk with their grandparents; and longer term, that they can realistically study/work in any of those three countries when they're old enough. "
1262,Monolingual parents encouraging language skills early,"At risk of sounding like the over-pushy head mistress from Daddy Daycare....  My wife and I are both monolingual Brits, living Britain, with a four-month old daughter. It seems a shame to waste this early stage (or perhaps the near future stage) when children are able to absorb language skills so quickly. Is there a gentle way to introduce some foreign language skills to our daughter now that would help her to enjoy a greater aptitude for learning languages later in life? I don't expect that our daughter will be fully bilingual, but could there be something in between raising a bilingual kid and not bothering at all? Foreign babysitter? Foreign children's movies? "
1263,Son bites to defend himself. What can I do?,"My 3-year-old son is biting to defend himself. I received a call from the daycare today asking what they should do. My son doesn't bite at home at all, he is only biting at school. For some reason the teacher only sees when my son bites the other kids but not when the other kids bite my son. If I don't tell them about the bite marks they wouldn't know about it.   The time when my son did bite at home was always when another child was bullying/hurting or biting him, so he resolves in biting back. My son doesn't cry when another child bites him and he won't tell on the other child when he is bitten/hurt or bullied. Neither does he want to point out which child it is. He was moved from one class to another to see if that helps, but on the playground they are still together with all the kids. He tends to only bite the one kid...   How do I go about this? I don't want to teach him to not stand up for himself, but to rather resolve it in another manner. But what can I do if he doesn't want to say anything? "
1264,How can I get my 12-year old physically active or into sports when he's never been?,"My son is 12-years old, and he has never been into traditional competitive sports.  I'm fine with this - not all kids are.  He played baseball for a short period when he was 8, but he didn't really care to continue.  He's into things like comic books, reading, drawing, video games (...Minecraft), and recently, computer programming!  Total nerd over here ;)  He isn't overweight, and has always been a skinny child, but recently I noticed he is getting a little chubby around his waist and he actually referred to himself as getting 'man boobs and a muffin top' the other day.  I am getting concerned with the onset of puberty and him possibly beginning to gain weight when his body starts to change.  He wanted to learn how to skateboard, so I bought him a very nice skateboard and gear from a local skateshop (not the cheap Walmart kind, but a really nice deck around $200) - it lasted about a week.  He's actually pretty good, or doesn't fall at least ;), but I'm struggling to get him out there and riding the thing.  I guess I feel like he doesn't really have any motivation to try something new.  Would it be pretty much impossible to try to get him into a sport like baseball or soccer if he were willing?  I mean, in his age group, all the other kids will know all of the rules and be pretty good, while he would be a beginner.  If that isn't really possible, I would love suggestions on other things that he can do that are physically active, that he might be interested in as a nerdy kid - karate?  Fencing?  Those are the only 2 things that I can think of.  I thought about maybe just getting a gym membership and taking him with me and see if he likes any of the kids' activities there.  Boy scouts?  What kinds of things does your sort of nerdy, different kid like to do? "
1265,How do you handle bilingual education in a country where you do not speak the language natively?,"Our 2 year old son is growing up in a different country (New Zealand) than we did (Brazil).   We try to speak to him in portuguese all times, and we noticed that he is learning english reasonably well at the daycare.  Obviously he does not understand that he speaks 2 different languages yet. But, once he realizes it, I am afraid he will lose interest in portuguese, since he only speaks that with us.  For the people who raised a bilingual child. How did you keep them speaking both languages? What were the challenges? "
1266,Why does my daughter smile and start to laugh at me when I am noticeably really angry at her?,"My daughter is 11 years old and has been diagnosed with high functioning austism along with sensory processing disorder.  I am a single father and have raised her alone since she was two years old. We have always had a very close and affectionate relationship as she was a very good natured little girl growing up. We have done everything together, gone on many road trips together, done many adventures as just the two of us.  I remain to be called ""Daddy"" rather than ""Dad"" as she adores me as I do her.  Recently though we have had troubles due to my loss of job last year and our possible eviction.  This has led to many behaviors such as lying, stealing, making up stories, acting out of control, purposely going against my rules, breaking things on purpose, among other issues.  What I've noticed lately as in the past 2 months is that she will go as far as to do everything in her power to push my buttons and get me really angry/upset with her.  And then when I start to look noticeably angry and start to raise my voice, she laughs at me.  I am not sure if anyone has ever has ever been laughed at when you are already furious, but let me tell you it just makes you even more angry.  I've never been violent or hell I've never even been in a physical fight my entire life and I sure as hell haven't hit my kid or anyone for that matter.  But when you are at your most angry and someone just starts laughing at you, it really invokes a lot of restraint on anyone's part. I can't think of a worse thing to do to someone who is angry at you than to laugh at them.  What I have done out of my way of dealing with it is call her a name or something and then go to my bedroom to calm down.  I later regret the name calling and she regrets the laughing bit and I apologize to her and I get the same from her.  I am pretty sure if this same thing happened with a friend that they would physically attack her for doing such a thing, male or female.  As far as I know she only has done this with me so far.  Now the weird part and the part I don't understand is that she claims she cannot control the laughter.  She says that she doesn't want to laugh but she can't help it.  To me I can hear her, but I don't understand how someone can find humor in seeing you angry/upset with them.  Has anyone else experienced this?  And if so, how did you deal with it? "
1267,Newborn handstand pose,"Just few moments ago my 2.5 weeks old daughter when laid on her belly (she always liked it and even slept with hands reaching my neck) started to cry a little bit and started flexing. She stared to raise the whole lower part of her body almost to the position like this one [website]What made me a little bit more nervous is that I tried googling (newborn trying to do a handstand, newborn pincha mayurasana) and to no avail. Maybe I cannot into google as I am not really sure how to phrase the question in my native language.  After being picked up by my wife she calmed down and I haven't tried putting her on belly since -  I don't want to cause pain to my daughter just for the sole purpose of ""debugging"" the child.  I called my mother and she told me to calm down because maybe my daughter is having some abdominal pain and just trying to do all she can not to put the pressure on the belly. And I would be perfectly calm if she would try to roll over. But it's like telling someone that it's normal for a child to start levitating because of back pain (sorry for the exaggeration but I want to you to understand my perspective).  My questions: Have anyone encountered similar situation? Do you think that this is something that requires immediate action (going to hospital) as it may suggest neurological problems or should I wait until next doctor's appointment? This is not a persistent situation so I think it is better to evaluate the situation before going to the hospital (which may cause more harm than good and we still may end up being redirected to a neurologist after classification as not life threatening situation)  Side question: As this is something that isn't easily describable what is the best way to include a video. How to attach/upload it? I want maximum privacy (the less media of my daughter online the better) so maybe some time limited hosting but then if someone else will encounter something like that in the future these is no reference. I want to be decent (I try to be naked for skin on skin contact) so should I use some blur on my lower part of the body or it would still be considered indecent. The blurring is also related to faces (privacy) ofc. "
1268,Toddler Pooping Problems,"My little girl is 3 years old (she will be 4 in July). She is fully potty trained when it comes to peeing on the potty. However pooping is a different story. When we were first starting the potty training, she started holding in her poop making it hard for her to go.   We took her to her to the Dr they put her on Miralax said, ""this will help"" for 1.5 years she was on Miralax, we took her off because she was pooping in pants, with ease, but not on the potty, it was as if she didn't know she had to go, it would slip right out. So we took her off the Miralax and put her on Fiber Gummies, it seemed to work, she was pooping on the potty!   4-5 months go by, doing well, then all of a sudden she starts having troubles pooping again. We will have to start the Miralax all over again. She starts pooping with ease in her panties so once again we take her off Miralax &amp; she is once again pooping on potty with gummies.   One month later, we are having troubles AGAIN. The thing about this ordeal is that her poop is NOT hard and she is pooping just a bit in her butt cheeks but enough to soil her panties. I have tried everything I know! I don't know what to do any more. I have tried talking to her, asking her if she feels if she has to go potty, she won't tell you. We've tried rewards, making her clean her own panties and even taken things away, nothing seems to help. It's not that she is scared to go to the potty, because she will go, has done it before... but when we are having pooping issues, we got through 4-5 pairs of panties in a day for 1-2 weeks then she will start pooping on the potty again.   We have taken her to the doctors over this several times, even to the point where we did a CT to see if she had a tethered spinal cord. All was clear on that. Her doctors do not seemed overly concerned by this, however as the parents of our DD we are and do not think this is normal almost 4 year old behavior! Before she moves up in her pre-school she must be FULLY potty trained!! We are at our last wits end. Has anyone else gone through this? What was done to correct this problem?  Any advice would be much appreciated! Thank you in advanced!! "
1269,How to get a toddler to nap in the carseat during a distance drive,"My toddler doesn't like napping in the car. I have tried to play lullaby music for him so that he can nap as we drive for a long distance, say like 2hrs or less mostly. Most of the time he's just looking out the window the entire drive.   Are there any technics? Or its just fine for him to stare? "
1270,How do I prepare my home for the arrival of my premature baby?,"My son was born prematurely a few weeks ago and is still in the hospital. If all goes well, he will leave the hospital when he reaches the equivalent of 36 gestational weeks, weighs at least 4 lbs, can sustain his vitals (pulse, temperature, etc) outside of the incubator for a prolonged time, and can feed himself orally. He is currently at the equivalent of 32 gestational weeks, so he may be home in a month.  Is anyone aware of any special preparations for the arrival of a premature baby? I am sure the hospital and the baby's pediatrician will advise us on the medical aspects. I am interested in other aspects of regarding his arrival, such as keeping him comfortable, adequate toys, etc.   I am aware that we already covered the arrival of full-term babies in What to buy before the baby is born? so I am interested on suggestions specific to the arrival of premature babies.  UPDATE  Baby is home since last week and is doing great! Your advise has been very useful. Thank you. "

1272,Is construction noise harmful to a newborn and how to protect them?,"We're thinking of moving to a new apartment in New York. It's next to a big construction site, where there will be drilling for another few months.  Has anyone read any research on safe levels / exposures to construction noise and what to do to minimize damage?  Are noise cancellation headphones safe if worn for longer periods of time? "
1273,Established methods to help fussy/picky eaters at late primary age,"Our 8 year old daughter has always been a picky eater - even as a baby we had a hard time convincing her to try different baby foods. We assumed she'd grow out of it, but it hasn't happened and it's becoming an increasing problem.   I guess we should be thankful that the range of foods she's willing to eat does include some healthy options like carrot and cucumber, so we're not as badly off as some. But her favourite things are pasta tossed in pesto, noodles tossed in soy sauce and various kinds of junk. Given the choice, she'd eat nothing else.  We're vegetarian so we're already limited - in fact we've got so desparate for her to broaden her range of foods that we've tried to get her to eat fish, but she refuses. Her mum &amp; I both feel it's important to eat a meal together as a family, but at the same time we're not keen on cooking multiple different dishes for everyone. So we alternate between her pickyness being allowed to dictate the families' menu to a narrow and boring range of dishes, or serving things she dislikes which she will eat while making gagging faces and trying every trick in the book to get away from the table early.  Things she particularly dislikes which are particularly problematic include potato and melted cheese. This means eating out with friends is a nightmare, since other parents and establishments typically serve things popular with children like chips/fries and pizza. So she ends up not eating.  We've tried being nice about it and encouraging her to try new things. We've tried being nasty about it and making her eat things she doesn't like. We've tried carrot and stick by suggesting she could eat with her friends more often if she was happy eating different things. We've tried involving her more in menu planning and food preparation, both of which she greeted with boundless enthusiasm and then refused to eat anything unfamliar, even if she'd helped plan or make it.  Since we've made/encouraged her to repeatedly try things she doesn't like, she has had repeated exposure (yes, more than the magic 10-15 times) to a lot of the things she rejects, to no avail. Is there anything else we can try? Anything with a proven track record? "
1274,Does using sign language really accelerate a child's ability to speak?,"I have often heard that using sign language is really good in teaching a baby to talk. Is this really true, or is this an urban legend?     Related: Can toddlers learn sign   language?  "
1275,What do I do about my abusive father?,"I'm 16 years old and live in the UK. My father has been physically and verbally abusing me for as long as I could remember, e. g. he punches, hits or slaps me. It's only been reported once to the police but in reality it's been happening all my life.   He abuses me, my mother and my sister. My mum is always too afraid to report it to the police. Growing from an Asian family it's hard for parents to show affection for their children and they are extremely strict, but the violence is unnecessary.   I found my father beating up my mother in the morning, it's what woke me up. This was reported to the police because I urged my mother, but because they couldn't find any bruises they're not taking immediate action. I hate talking to the police and am petrified of them.   As my father owns the house he can stay for as long as he pleases, until the police come to interview him. He's been staying for almost three days and I've been too scared to see him so I stayed with my cousins.   Today I wanted to come home so I could do all my schoolwork that is on my computer at home, but I found out my father was still home. I called my mum and asked if she could ask him to leave as I am scared and feel unsafe being alone with him in the house. Instead, she screamed at me and said ""there's nothing she can do?"".  Is it really my fault that I don't want to be alone with my abusive father? This really frustrates me about my mother and it drives me insane.   I really really don't know what to do but my schoolwork is so important to me. I just cannot stand the abuse from my father anymore, when all of this happens the part that I hate the most is that I feel bad for him. He has never done anything in my life but leave bruises on my skin. But I still feel bad for him and hate myself so much for it. "
1276,How do I define 'rape' to an 8-year-old girl?,"If you read news and are aware of international affairs, you'll be aware that something cruel had happened in India in December 2012 that shook the whole nation. For months, this was the headlines of all the newspapers, media channels and even a part of local plays, events and many other things to make girls aware. In fact, schools had several 'self-defense' programs for girls.  During this period, my 8-year-old daughter asked me several times about what all this is going on? In fact, whenever we advise her to be cautious (Indian newspapers, almost daily, have child molestation's news) with an unknown fellow, the first thing she asks is what they do to girls? The same thing she asked for that case of December 2012.   Being in catch-22, I manipulate my answer and tell her that bad people take girls and beat them but you and I know, that's not the answer.   Is there any way to express what exactly it has to do with girls to this little girl?  "
1277,How to help a 2-year-old settle in day care where a foreign language is spoken?,"TL;DR  Our son is starting daycare in a country where the language is (almost) completely alien to him. Can we do anything to help him settling in this new environment? (full story below)  Original story  Our son, who is 26 months old, was born in the foreign country that we're living in at the moment (UK - but the question should be universal), but so far he had little exposure to its language. At home our native language (Hungarian) is spoken all the times as this is the most convenient (both parents are from there), and he only occasionally hears English when we meet friends or the neighbours, or on the playground. He is starting in a day nursery very soon where only English is spoken and we're concerned that he might have a hard time settling in.   The existing questions I found here are mostly focusing on the language development in these situations, however we're not concerned too much about that directly, as many suggests that children at this age can adapt to new languages very easily. Our concerns are more about the initial shock of the new situation and the emotional consequences of settling in to daycare.   Not only he will be left without his parents, which is quite a new concept to him (he never had been left to the care of someone else for more than half an hour and even those were rare occasions), but also in an environment where no one understands him. To make it more difficult, this happens in the age when he had just recently started to speak (he can form some two-three word sentences now, but this is only a very recent achievement, so far he seemed a bit on the late side of the language development) and when he seemingly enjoys that he is able to communicate his desires and can reflect to the world he sees. On the positive side - due to our working hours - for the first half-year he only need to be in day care for two days a week.  The nursery suggested we come to the first sessions with a mini-dictionary of his most commonly used words, so the teachers in his group can memorise them. However I'm not convinced that this is a good idea. Due to the vastly different pronunciation between the two languages there is a chance that they won't be able to use it anyway, and even if they do, I'm concerned this would just confuse him even more, as some of his words will be understood but most won't be. I feel that it would be less confusing if we kept clear boundaries between the languages and the places where they are spoken.   So the question is, if this dictionary sounds like a good idea and is there anything more we can do to help him settling in under these circumstances?   Update  Thanks for the great answers so far. A month has passed since his first sessions and unfortunately he couldn't settle in yet. He is usually crying from the morning till he is picked up, refusing to eat or drink or do anything in the nursery.   Of course this struggle cannot be solely attributed to the language barrier, I'd think at best it's only some addition to the emotional stress caused by the separation from the parents. However the caregivers told us that our son often seems to be completely lost, not understanding what's going on over his head. Other children try to play with him in his better moments but sooner or later they start to talk to him and when he doesn't answer they leave him alone. We noticed he became unusually shy amongst other children when we're out on the playground too.   So beyond the well-discussed general settling-in advices I'd be still interested in ideas on how to address the language barrier issue.  We changed a few things in a hope these will help:   started teaching him the language at home by playing some role-plays in English printed a set of pictures of the toys they are playing in the nursery and ask him what they are in English trying to spend more time in play groups which are similar to the daycare environment but with parent's supervision  "
1278,How to help a 4-year-old who is afraid because she doesn't know yet what she will do when she's grown up?,"I have a 4-year-old daughter. Yesterday, when I was changing my daughter in her PJ's to get ready for bed she started crying out of nowhere. This was very surprising because we don't get that very often with her.  When I asked what was wrong she answered: ""I don't know what to be when I am older!"", and the crying intensified. I picked her up and cuddled her, telling here it's going to be fine, and there is no shame in the fact that she doesn't know that, that in time it will come to her, and it's more important to be happy than to be anything else. It took me a hour to get her to calm down! She seemed scared of the fact of growing up.  Now, our daughter is not your typical daughter, she was making 2~3 word sentences when she was 1 year of age, and adding and subtracting about the time she turned 2 years old (already talking with full sentences by then). Now, her intellect is about 6~7 years of age, but her emotional needs are still those of a 4-year-old.  How can we make it clear to her there is no shame in not knowing what you want to be? Can we give her options to trigger her imagination so she will not be afraid of it. Could making her visualizing it (something she likes to do, like taking care of animals on a farm) take the fright out of the situation? "
1279,Is it normal for a 3.5-year-old child to get sick every month?,"My son is now 3.5 years old and had recently started going to play school. Ever since, he had been getting sick approximately at a rate of once every 4-5 weeks. Each time it is the same story, he gets fever, cold (sometimes cough as well) and we take him to the doctor and he prescribes some acetaminophen based medication and he gets better. He is up to date on all vaccinations and my child's pediatrician says it is normal and happens when a child is first exposed to an outside environment like daycare or school.   This has been happening for the last 4 months. Is it normal? Has anyone else faced this problem when they sent their kid to school for the first time? "
1280,"If my 5yr old is an exceptional liar, should I expect that she will continue lying as she gets older?","I have a gorgeously adorable 5 year old daughter who over the past 6 months or so has developed a bent towards lying. Adorable + lying = bad recipe for a pushover dad (I'm really not, I may be mushy but not a pushover. honest.).  I get that all young kids lie and I get that my daughter probably isn't the worst of them, but nevertheless she does lie, and often, and in very believable ways (legit tears and pleas of, I promise, I really really promise), over very minor things. Her goal in lying is naturally that she either (a) doesn't want to get in trouble,  or (b) wants something (mommy said I could have candy - no. she didn't.). Lately, the issue has been when we ask her if she's done a specific thing we've told her she's not allowed to do. The answer is always ""No"" -- we know (or at least highly suspect) she's lying at least some of the time, but we have no real way to verify which times are truth and which times are lies. (this isn't really my question, but to try and cultivate truth we've expressed that the main thing isn't disobeying, it's lying to us about it. If you just tell the truth, we won't even be that upset at you.)  So, my question is for those of you who've gone through this stage with your kids in the past -- does it get better? I know that I need to encourage her in truth, but I mainly wonder just as a personality trait in general, can I expect her to ever do a 180 in this? My wife and I are committed to honesty, regardless of consequence - we want our daughter to be, too.   Can any amount of parenting shift her desire to lie for her benefit?  note: I tagged both pre- and primary-, because she's in Kindergarten, but only met the age cutoff by 2 months. "
1281,Our 4 year old won't fall asleep until 11pm,"Our 4 year old doesn't like to sleep. I know that sounds like what every kid says, but let me clarify. She doesn't cry at bedtime, she just won't sleep.  We start to get her ready for bed around 8pm. By 8:30 she is in her bed, and the lights are off. Come 11pm when we go to sleep, she is still awake! Again, she isn't crying and as far as we can tell she isn't afraid (she does like the hall light on and the door cracked, so we do that).  Only occasional will she come out of her room, and it is usually for a sip of water or to go potty. Most of the time she returns back to her bed without a problem.  We find her in there playing with toys or looking at books. If we take all that away she will stay awake playing with her fingers or talking to herself. It doesn't matter if she was in the house all day, or played outside for hours on her bike. She just won't fall asleep. She always tells us she isn't tired.  We have tried soothing music but that doesn't work. If we try to stay with her until she sleeps, she just tries to talk to us. We don't talk back to her; she just tells us everything she wants to do tomorrow.   We thought it was because she would take a nap during the day, but we even stopped that. She doesn't sleep in late, and is up by 9:30 every day.  Is this normal? Do you have any ideas on how we can get her to sleep earlier? Do some kids just require less sleep? "
1282,Why do infants like stitting at the table?,"We recently noticed that our 4 month old LO likes to sit on our lap at the table. We talked about it with some friends and they confirm it, their LOs also liked that. My wife recalls reading a blog entry which also said something like this.  Do you have similar experiences? Why do you think infants like to sit at a table? "
1283,"Why do my children ask ""Are you happy with me?""","For the past few months, my children, 2 and 3, have been asking me ""Are you happy with me?"" Of course, I respond with ""I am very happy with you! The most happy!"" But they still ask on a daily basis!  I tell them I love them every chance I get. I am happy with them no matter what -- is it normal for the kids to ask for constant validation? Should I be doing something to make them feel secure?  Usually they'll ask the question randomly, but lately I have noticed that they'll ask this when they have done something wrong. i.e. hitting each other, etc. When they do that, I'll usually respond with ""Hey! You shouldn't do that, that's not right. It really hurts XYZ."" They sense me being upset with what they did and will immediately ask, ""Are you happy with me?"" I have started to respond with, ""Yes, I am happy with you. But I am not happy with what you did.""  I wanted to know if other parents have this happening to them too or if there is something I am doing wrong with my parenting which is leading them to wonder if I am happy with them. I don't want my kids thinking I am not happy with them (or do I?). I am very proud of them! "
1284,Breast milk looks curdled . . . what happened?,"My wife pumps and puts the milk in the fridge if it's not time for a feeding. We have to supplement with formula because the baby drinks about 4 more ounces a day than she makes. Feeding from the breast never worked out.  Anyway, the problem is, sometimes, we get the breast milk out and heat it up (running hot water over it or just holding it in warm hands) and the milk looks curdled. We just throw it out and grab a different bottle of breast milk whenever that happens out fear that it has gone bad.  Why does that happen? Is the milk still safe? It's never in the fridge for more than a day or so and we make sure to rotate them and even have some contraption where the new milk goes in one side and the oldest milk comes from the other side. "

1286,Taking a 5 month old on swimming vacation,"We are taking our little 5 month old girl on vacation on the coast in the North of Spain, near Barcelona. Our little girl loves her baths and we want to introduce her to joys of swimming. Thus our vacation will consist of a lot of swimming, both in the hotel pool and the Mediterranean Sea.  We've thought of things such making sure that she has a hat, sunscreen, and a whole body UV-swimsuit to protect her from the sun, and we'll avoid swimming in the hot part of the day. Naturally, we won't be letting her swim on her own, though we may encourage her to float on her own or even go under the water.  What things should we be concerned with when taking our girl swimming in a pool and in the sea? With the chlorine/salt be bad for her eyes? What about her ears? Are there any precautions we need to take? Any medicine we should bring with us just in case? "
1287,How do you address sibling rivalry?,"My children (7&amp;9) always seem to be trying to get each other into trouble. The frequent sniping, digs, put-downs, and exclusion cause me concern. Many times the fighting comes down to a control issue: who is allowed in whose bedroom, authority over toys (""that's mine and I didn't say you can play with it""). Sometimes the argument starts to get physical, at which time I intervene.  I want them to be friends. Do I let them sort things out for themselves? How can I get the competitiveness and fighting to stop? How do I foster their friendship rather than rivalry?   I am looking for advice on how to proactively avoid sibling rivalry because not everyone grows out of it. "
1288,Is behavioural optometry a real thing?,"My 5 year old son was having some trouble concentrating in class and it was recommended that we see a behavioural optometrist. A standard optical test showed his eyes were not perfect but within normal range for his age. The optometrist then ran some further tests with some special glasses that showed his brain was struggling to process the visual signal - thus causing tiredness and lack of concentration. To aid this, we got a pair of mild prescription glasses that he now wears in class and when doing his homework.  My feeling is that this has helped. He now reads longer and more accurately at home. However, since then I've come across articles this and I'm wondering if this is just wishful thinking.  Has anyone had any practical experience with behavioural optometry and has it helped in your case? I understand that there is a dearth of peer reviewed scientific research, so I'm happy with personal experience.  Extra information:  I took my other child to a normal optometrist today just for a routine check-up. During the tests, I noticed her running the same tests as the behavioural optometrist; she said she was testing for eye divergence. I then related the story of my son and asked for the validity of the assessment. She said that mild prescription glasses is a valid course of action and would his reduce eye strain since they so not have to work so hard to counter his eye divergence. In the short chat we had she supported behavioural optometry. "
1289,"My husband, who is my teen daughter's step father feels bad that he can't have a closer relationship with my daughter","Four years ago, I divorced my ex after 26 years of marriage.  He was extremely manipulative and abusive. He kept track of every mile I put on our vehicles and had to explain if I was ten minutes longer at the grocery store than he thought I should be.  He also cheated on me for most of our marriage.  He often told me that if I left him that he would turn the kids against me. For the last four years, he has tried to do that with no success.  He is a terrible person and I still have to share custody of our 16 year old daughter with him.  I have since married a wonderful man who treats me and my daughter like gold.  He loves my daughter like his own.  He supports her with her financial needs (dates, sports activities, insurance etc.) He has not missed a single volleyball, basketball game, or track meet that she has played.  He has never raised his voice to her.  My daughter is very happy and has never caused me or my husband any trouble.  She is a great athlete and an honor student, and I often hear from teachers, coaches, moms of her friends what a good girl she is.  I'm very close to her, and we have a great relationship.  What I am struggling with is my daughter will not allow herself to get very close to my husband, and he gets his feelings hurt, which I can understand.  She is polite and respectful of him, and sometimes tells him thanks.  When me and my husband are in the same room, she will walk by and tell me thanks or good bye without acknowledging him. He is a teacher at her school, and all of her friends talk to him and get a long great with him, but she barely acknowledges him at school.    When my daughter goes a few weeks without having to spend a lot of time with her dad, then her relationship with my husband is great.  I know that my ex is still manipulating her, and cannot stand the thought of her having another man be a father figure to her, even though he doesn't support her or behave like a father in any way.    I am at a loss as to how to make it easier for my husband.  He does all the father stuff, and my ex gets to be the one who dances with her at prom, and all those father/daughter activities.  One one hand, I think we are lucky that things are as good as they are.  I have friends who are in a similar situation, and there is a lot of drama between the kids and step-parent.  Is my husband expecting too much?  How do I make him feel better about the sacrifices he is making for my daughter?  My two adult married kids love him and are so happy that I married him. "
1290,Preventing toddler from climbing up the stairs?,Our apartment has 2 floors and a wooden staircase between the floors and we are planning to install a gate to prevent the baby to fall down the stairs in an unobserved moment.  Is it however also necessary to install a gate downstairs? Is it realistic to assume that a baby might climb up several stairs and hurt itself? 
1291,"Buying a kids table/chairs for 4-6yo, what to look at?","Our 4yo has grown out from her table and we are thinking about buying that a bigger one.   Other than ""table should be sturdy, no sharp edges"" - what should we check before buying?  How to make sure that the table and chairs are of the right size to make the seating/activities comfortable. What should we measure to make sure the table / chairs will fit well?  She has been sitting at her current table since she was 2yo, is it realistic to expect that the new chair will last (until she grow out of it) for another 2years (from 4.5yo to 6.5yo)?  I am asking to many questions because now she is spending more and more time doing her education activities at the table, so it is very important to get it right.  Thank you very much. "
1292,Developing creativity and out-of-box thinking among kids,A teacher asked my 5 year old son to draw an apple and colour it. He draws a large apple and coloured it in purple.  This is not a usual behaviour though. Many times he has drawn fruits of the real colors.   One of the teacher's comment is negative  and she says that it shows unrealistic colours and  shows lack of observation.  While the other teacher says that its creativity and it encourages out-of-box thinking (although she could not provide any research reference).   I want to know what should be the most appropriate response and the feedback to the little artist based on any modern authentic research.    My idea is that we should adopt a middle path where we explain the kids what are natural colours of apple and at the same time tell him that you have discovered an entirely new variety of an Apple(thereby encouraging him for out-box-thinking). But I want to know the views of experts in light of established research.   Which of these teachers should I trust and under what circumstances and why?   Of course I need a scientific evidence for each choice. Also as parent how should we respond to the kid?       
1293,When do children become aware of time?,"The child is 2 years old.  When do children start understanding the concept of today, yesterday, and tomorrow? When do they start understanding that the days are passing? "
1294,Raising a bilingual kid. How to speak to my daughter in Spanish (my primary language) when also wanting to perfect my English?,"I have an almost a year old daughter. My husbands only speaks English (although understands Spanish very well) and I speak Spanish (my native language) and English (which I learned mostly as an adult). We only speak English to each other. Also our social circle is 100% English speakers.   We have the goal of only speaking Spanish to my daughter at home (this would be mostly me), so that she can grow learning how to speak Spanish. So far we are doing everything as planned.  The problem is that I also want to improve and perfect my English, and since I did not grow up in the US, I see speaking and reading English to my daughter like the perfect opportunity for me to fill up many gaps in my English and American cultural knowledge.  I am also afraid of not speaking enough English during the day, since now we don’t go out as often as we did before having my daughter and I only speak Spanish to her. (I do speak English at work and with my husband everyday though).  Any tips or recommendations to help my daughter with Spanish while also filling up my English gaps? Am I being selfish?  "
1295,How can I reduce back pain from lifting or holding my child for too long?,"I have a 2-year-old son and he is bit heavy. For some months, whenever I carry or lift him, I feel severe back pain.  I've found many sources that claim that this is normal. My doctor also says that this happens normally.  Are there ways to carry a child to minimize backache? Whenever I lift my son, I bend backwards slightly to counter-balance his weight. Can I improve my posture to lessen the back pain? "
1296,How often should I defeat my children in games?,"I love my children very much, but I sometimes I have to teach them a lesson. I'm afraid if I always allow them to win them, they'll turn out to be spoiled and rotten and have a sense of entitlement when they grow up. But if I beat them too often, I'm afraid they'll have low self-esteem and not very much self-confidence. Ultimately, I feel that beating them is very important and that it teaches character.   In a similar question, this answer suggests:          If you're playing a game where you win more than 50% of the time, it's not actually a fair game. You have every advantage, because he's FOUR. Effectively, you should be handicapping yourself down to the level where you're struggling to win.      While I like the idea of handicapping myself, I'm still concerned about the win/loss ratio. If I start losing too much, they will miss out on learning about good sportsmanship and may fall victim to the Dunning-Kruger effect later in life. If I win too much, they won't want to play anymore.  What is a good ratio for winning and losing games? Or am I thinking about all of this the wrong way? "
1297,How to get an infant to burp?,How does one get a 5 weeks (and older) breast fed baby to burp ? At the moment the baby just burps randomly. Holding the baby so the chin is on my shoulder while I rub the baby's back gives randomly very good results but not all the time. What are the ways I could get the baby to burp ?  
1298,Is a (classic) GameBoy appropriate for my 1 year old son?,"My son is very excited in using technical devices like our printer, our tablet or our wireless phone. I'm thinking of buying him a classic, black an white GameBoy (the grey one with big nobs), so that he can play with his own device and cannot acidentially make phone calls, etc.  Do you think a GameBoy or similar can be too much for him? Is it appropriate for his age?  I'm thinking of one or two games (Tetris, etc), so that pressing a button will do something on the screen. Of course he will not be able to ""play"" Tetris, but he likes pressing button on the printer so much. "
1299,Restarting baby-led weaning after an actual choking,"My daughter choked on mango one month into baby-led weaning (and yes, I do mean choked: reddening, wide-eyed, silent).  We banged the mango out and she was fine.  I however, am far from fine.  I have been sliding back into purees since.  She feeds herself (pincer or spoon), but the food is still chunky, over-the-counter puree; soft lumps like rice or grits; or baby fingernail size bits like cheese.  I have been unable to get passed this fear of a choking encore.  I am frustrated trying to find support for my particular case.  The ""official"" BLW sites go on at length about the difference between choking and gagging, so it's hard to separate good information on ""how to prevent choking by appropriate sizing"" from all the noise of ""that's NOT choking"".  Seriously people, if you can hear it, don't fear it.  You will know choke face.  So here's the deal. 11 month old, who has choked once, who still has no teeth, who shoves as much as she can in at once.  Exactly what shape and consistency should ""sticks"" or ""pieces"" be?  Can I get concrete examples of banana, avocado, gourds, chicken, and any other foods you think would be good? "
1300,How will my toddler pick up one language which seems harder than the other?,"Our 16 month old son is just starting to talk. He understands a lot and he's lately saying a number of simple 1 syllable English words (cheese, shoes, pea, cat, dog, duck etc). However, my husband and his close relatives are Indian so we would both like our son to also know Hindi. My husband speaks to our son only in Hindi.   Our son hasn't yet said any Hindi words but when we count up his English words he says somewhere between 25 and 30 words, mostly nouns. Nearly all of them have only one syllable. When my husband thinks of the Hindi word for these things they almost all have two syllables.  Our son does seem to understand well when my husband speaks to him but we are worried that the seemingly more complex nature of the words in Hindi will make it more difficult for him to pick up and that he'll be much behind in his Hindi compared to English. He's already at a disadvantage in Hindi because we live in England with not many people around us who speak Hindi.  Does anyone have experience of bringing up a child with two languages where one seems to be more difficult than the other? Might we be worrying unnecessarily and once he gets the hang of words with more than one syllable, he'll start saying more Hindi words? How can we encourage him to speak more difficult words when he has the option of something simpler? "
1301,"Do children start believing in fairies and magic after being read from a book? If yes, then how to respond to ""but the book says it is true""?","Do the children start believing in fairies and magic after being read from a book about how fairies solve/get everything magically?  The child is 2 years old, so at this age it doesn't really matter and even now since I don't want to lie that the girl turned into a pumpkin and frog turned into a man, I just haven't bought any such kind of fairy tale books for her.  Fairy tale books such as above are available here in abundance. Even when the child is of 4 or 5 years old, I do NOT want the child to think that such fairies and magic actually exists and works.  Here's an interesting link: [website]What if the child say: ""But the book says it is true"" - How should I respond to that if that happens? "
1302,Visual stimulation videos for infants - good or bad?,"There are many visual stimulation videos on youtube which most infants would love to stare at.   Does this help in cognitive development?    I have read in some journals that, on the contrary, for young children visual games etc.  may be responsible for cognitive impairment.  So how safe it is to show these high contrast weird videos to infants?   Are there any studies on this topic? "
1303,Should I force the toddler to speak the words and sentences which she is finding difficult to speak?,"Hindi is the native language and English is a foreign language where I live. The toddler (2 years old) gets sent to the daycare. They speak Hindi there.  I speak English at home with the child and the other person too.  I have found that child is more comfortable with Hindi words rather than the English.  Example:  Child easily says:  ""Paani"" rather then water.  ""De Do"" rather than give.  ""Aao"" rather than come.  ""Dekho"" rather than look.    I do force the child to say these English words and she does comply. I can feel that it is not easy for her. When I ask her to say give, she says pig. I ask her to say look, she says took.  She can say thank you, please, mole, eyes, nose, hands, snake (with not so correct pronunciation though.).  She speaks tortoise, monkey, and money correctly.  She is NOT hard of hearing. She does understand what I say. She does understand the long English sentences I speak to her.  Should I actually force her to speak these/the English words at this age (by repeatedly asking her to speak)?  or   Should I continue talking in English and pretend to be deaf and let her learn at her own pace when she grows up?  or  Is there a third option? "
1304,Chai tea latte ok for toddler?,Is it ok for two year old to occasionally sip on a chai latte? Or should it be avoided altogether because of the caffeine? 
1305,Do I need to space big changes? How much?,"We're moving house (within the neighborhood) in early August. In September, our 2-and-a-bit year old moves to a new daycare. But at the same time, she's also at a stage where she's getting big for her crib (as in ""can probably climb out on her own""), and also seems pretty ready for potty training (which it'd be nice to do in the warm months...).  So: moving house, new daycare, new bed, potty training. Do we need to space these out, or can we do more than one at once? Roughly how much time should we allot for each one, and how long do we need between these big changes? "
1306,Is getting an oval nipple from breastfeeding indicative of a problem?,"Our baby was born last week and my partner is struggling with soreness from breastfeeding. One thing we have noticed is that the nipple (not the areola) is left out of shape post-feeding; it's oval shaped, it's not sloping off to the sides etc. so it appears the baby is centred on the nipple, but the shape is consistently that the wide points of the oval line up with the corners of the mouth, and the narrow points of the oval between the nose and chin. She is also describing spells of a sudden and hard biting/chewing type of sensation during feeding, and there is a bit of clicking noise as he suckles.   Is this oval shape indicative of a particular problem in the process? If the latch is good should the nipple come away from feeding rounded? "
1307,Can I fit a coccoro combi car seat on an Uppa Baby stroller cruz?,My son outgrew huge Uppa car seat so we bought a Combi. Can I fit that on my stroller?  Or am I going to have to buy another stroller? 
1308,Breastfeeding and a Job Interview,"My 4-month-old is 100% breastfed. I am currently looking for a new job and have a job interview in two days.  The problem is that it is a full-day interview. I cannot go 8+ hours without pumping, but there are no breaks in my schedule.  So I have a dilemma: Do I tell them I need time to pump or do I try to discretely squeeze in some time to do it? I am told that it is not good to reveal that you have a small baby during a job interview. What do I do?  Surely other mothers have been in this situation. Any advice? "
1309,21-month-old crying for hours starting at the daycare door,"My question is similar to a previous one in that my 21-month-old boy cries miserably at the door of his daycare room every morning. The difference is that the crying continues all morning—at least until mid-day nap time.  If he sleeps, sometimes the afternoon is then OK.  Once or twice he's had a miserable afternoon too. This has been going on for about two weeks.  He has been going to this daycare from the age of 3 months. He was OK in the infant classroom, then, several weeks ago his initial week in the toddler room was reportedly great (at least, someone told me, ""as great as it ever can be when you share a class with [insert name of disruptive child who upsets everyone]""). Then there was a break of nearly two weeks, during which there were also some staff changes, and when we resumed... misery.    What to do? My instinct tells me to try to minimize the drama (we try not to make a big deal about going to school and always talk about it positively) but then power through it so that he has an opportunity to learn to be less sensitive to whichever aspects bother him (the separation? the problem kid? the new teachers? ...?)  My wife has endured this up to a point, but has now started taking him home again and staying there with him when it gets really bad (a couple of days so far). I worry both about the inconsistency this presents to him and also about the message it sends that crying gets you out of things you don't like.  Consultation with the daycare director seemed like a good way to get more insight. We were reassured that this is probably a natural ""bump"" and a frequent occurrence and it'll work itself out. Without disagreeing with this outright (it might be right, for all I know) we tried to get more detail/advice but were rapidly treated as if we were the problem and the wagons started defensively circling as if we were complaining (which we were not) unreasonably (which we are not).  So probably nothing more constructive can come from that avenue.  Help? "
1310,"What's a healthy, non-perishable, keep-it-in-the-car-and-forget-it snack for a toddler?","I would like to offer my 1.5 year old toddler snacks while we are in car and its snacktime or she is hungry. Currently, I rely on goldfish crackers but these are not much healthier than potato chips, especially with the salt and fat.  Is there any non-perishable snack, homemade or store bought, that is healthier? meaning less salt and fat, possible more whole grain, even veggie or fruit based, and with less added ingredients?  "
1311,What to do about our 2-year-old attaching to another parent?,"Our 2-year-old child just started preschool and is attaching to other kids' parents.  Stuff like: Wants to hold the other parent's hand, but not ours; gives the other parent a hug at pick-up from preschool, but not us; following around other parents at the park, keeping distance from us.  If the other parent in question is present but unavailable (hands full, paying attention to their own child, talking with the preschool staff), our child melts down.  Generally the other kids' parents involved are also at the preschool, and usually good family friends.  So avoiding other parents entirely is not an option.  We're feeling like our child prefers other parents -- sometimes, any other parents -- to us.  How do we address this behavior?  (What is a good term for this behavior?) "
1312,"Daughter not saying ""mom"" even though she can","My two-year-old daughter has said ""dad"" for long time, referring to me. She has already said ""mom"" couple of times in the past so we know she can say it and knows the meaning of it, however no matter how hard we try to make her say ""mom"", she will do one of these things:   Silent treatment. Say ""dad"" with a glare as if to show us who's the boss. Just smile and laugh at us.   I know it's not a big deal as she's totally OK with both of us and actually spends more time with her mom than me, however I'm still curious: is this a common or known thing? Does anyone know the meaning behind this, for example maybe she takes her mom for granted thus does not feel the need to call to her? "
1313,When should I transition a 2 year old toddler from the cot to a bed?,"My son turned 2 today, and we have been considering for a long time to transition him to a bed. Specially since he already sleeps in a bed at the daycare.  I am afraid that he will not want to stay in bed once he makes the transition. What was your experience? When did you switch?  edit: I am looking for your experiences, and learn from them. As with everything related with children, every experience is different and will help forming your answer. This is not a math question. :) "
1314,How do you encourage a toddler that you suspect may be gifted?,"Related to this question, what do you do if you think your child may be gifted?  My son is very advanced in a number of areas (most notably speaking in 5 and 6 word sentences, and having a tremendous vocabulary, by the time he was 18 months old), and while I understand that it is too early to determine if he's actually gifted, or if he's just ahead in some of his milestones, I don't want to risk missing opportunities for helping him reach his full potential.  At the same time, I absolutely do not want him to be pressured, or pushed into performing beyond what he is comfortable with.  I also do not want to facilitate any rifts between him and his age-appropriate peers (something that, should he prove to be significantly gifted, I fear may happen eventually).  In short, what is the right balance between encouraging possible giftedness, and avoiding ""hothousing""?  Are there specific steps that I should take now? Or do I wait until he's older (he'll be 2 in September)? "
1315,What are your remedies for baby acid reflux?,"My 9-month baby suffers from moderate acid reflux since she was 3-month old. Our doctor put her on prescription, but we also tried the usual solutions like keeping her propped during sleep (I use a wooden board under the mattress) or avoiding acid foods. All this has helped, but she still sometimes wakes up at night crying.  Is there something else you have found to be useful? At what age, in your experience, reflux mostly disappears? "
1316,What are the differences between a child who was born vaginally versus via caesarean section?,"My son was born by caesarean section, although my wife and I really wanted our son born vaginally. My wife's friend has had two successful vaginal births. She wants the third child to be born by caesarean section. This is just because delivery by caesarean section is simple.  This situation makes me very curious about what the differences actually are between a child who was delivered vaginally and a child delivered by caesarean section. I heard from others that children from vaginal births have more resilient bodies and are smarter than children who were born by caesarean section.   Are these claims scientifically proven? Are there really any differences? Good references would be helpful. "
1317,Do wireless phones and computers harm babies?,"There is some discussion about the harm of electromagnetic radiation (EMR) emitted from mobile phones and other wireless devices. Is there reliable evidence? How does the distance of a baby to a wireless device affect the influence? I am not interested in anecdotes, assumptions, or dubious research but in hard, reproducible facts. "
1318,How to help my newborn pass gas,"I have a newborn (10 days). She seems to struggle with a lot of gas several times a day (first question, is this too much!?). How do we help her pass the gas more quickly and easily? She does get it out eventually, but we feel kinda helpless. We have tried moving her legs and pressing them against her abdominal muscles, but that doesn't seem to really do the trick. Any tips? It seems to cause her a bit of pain. Oh, and for more info, she's breastfed and her stools are mustard yellow and not really very solid. She has several stool diapers a day as well as wet ones. "
1319,How to make my toddler stop biting his nails if at all?,"My son is 2 years and 4 months old. He is very smart. Lately, he began biting his nails, so his nails are always short. I do not know whether he swallows the cut nails or not, but I rarely see the remainings. Should I try to stop him or not? If yes, how to do that? "
1320,How do I help my cousin solve puzzles with me without being upset?,"I'm 25 and I babysit my cousin occasionally. I like puzzles (a good deal) and I have since I was a child. My cousin is old enough (6) to know this too.  My older brother sometimes looks after my cousin and will sometimes be stumped by the puzzles my cousin will present him (more like riddles, I guess, like ""What gets wetter as it dries"" kind of stuff), so my cousin often presents him with new puzzles every week. My brother doesn't seem to mind too much since he can answer most of them. My younger sister is not a fan of puzzles at all (she says they're too conniving, which I can't disagree with) so if he presents her with a puzzle, she actively does not solve it and encourages him to tell her the answer instead of solving it herself.  On the other hand, I've been doing mental gymnastics since I was a kid, and if he hands me any puzzle, I immediately know the answer (he's getting his puzzles from books I used to own). When he was younger, I would only solve the ""hardest"" puzzles, i.e. if he came at me with a puzzle rated with four stars our of five, I would solve that one, and if he came with one with one or two stars, I would encourage him to tell me the answer. That's how my dad got me into puzzles when I was young.   I do not ever solve puzzles without walking him through the steps (unless he tells me the answer first and the answer is correct). It worked for a while, but he caught on to the ratings really quickly and now he only brings high rated ones.  But I can't get him to do the puzzles himself (or sometimes I can't get him to work on an easier one that would help him learn to solve the hard one). For example, he came to me with a 5 star puzzle that I could water down to a 2.5 star puzzle. I changed the puzzle to be as follows:     Sophie: ""Someone ate my cookies! I wanted that for later! Who was it?""      Person A: It wasn't me!      Person B: It wasn't A or D, I saw!      Person C: But I didn't eat it either!      Person D: Person C is telling the truth.      Only one person is lying. Who ate the cookies?   The problem I watered it down from had about ten people (and altogether is really long so there's no point in posting it). This puzzle is something he can absolutely solve on his own, but he won't do it. Instead he complains that I'm not being fun or I'm not helping him. If I solve the puzzle he gets annoyed that I'm not helping him and if I walk him through the steps he complains that I'm not letting him think. If I ask him ""What do you think we should do first/next/now?"" He says, ""You already know the answer, so it doesn't matter.""  For the above puzzle, he knows (and has stated) that the key to solving it is that only one person is lying. But if I ask him, ""Which person is telling the truth?"" He says, ""You already know so it doesn't matter."" But he doesn't seem to be saying it in a happy way, like it's a joke? He seems upset. He'll happily solve puzzles with my siblings or my parents, even though my dad is more of a puzzle beast than I am.  I really do love my cousin and I'm glad he likes puzzles too, but I can't get him to solve them on his own if I'm around. I think it's because I know most of the puzzles in his books, but even buying him a book that I didn't once own hasn't changed this behavior. I don't want to stop solving puzzles with him, but he seems to just get more and more stubborn about not solving them with me. Is there something I can do to make him feel more comfortable solving puzzles with me? Or should I stop solving puzzles with him altogether?  (I put the answer to the puzzle in a spoiler tag if you're interested in it.)      Only one person is lying. If A is lying, then B is also lying. If D is lying, then C is lying and if C is lying, then D is lying. And if B is lying, there is more than one cookie eater. That means the liar must be Sophie.  "
1321,What are some milestones a child should reach before learning programming?,"I am going to buy a PC for my kid as a birthday present, so I'm thinking how to use it educationally. Of course, an obvious choice is teaching him how to program.  I'm not asking what age should a kid be to start learning programming. I wonder what he should be able to do, in order to learn programming efficiently? What is the proper level of development for a kid to learn programming? "
1322,How to fit 3 children car seats into the back of a car,"My 3rd child was just born and I've discovered fitting the seats for all my children into the car is a real problem.  My oldest child is using a booster, my middle child a car seat and the new baby is still in an infant carrier.  My car is a large compact (Citroen C3 Picasso), and the 3 seats only physically fit in the car if I use the seat belt (and not the ISOFIX/LATCH system) to secure the car seat - even then the 3 seats completely cover the entire car back seat and there's no way to get to the seat belt for the booster.  I've also tried with my parent's car that is a roomy family car (Hyundai I30 CW) and have the same problem.  We tried putting the baby carrier in the front seat but this didn't work because we need to also fit two adults in the car (and putting the 2nd adult in back between 2 seats isn't practical)  So, what's the standard solution for this problem, how can I get two adults and 3 children into the car safely, reasonably comfortably and legally?   Are there special narrow car seat models? I've seen seat belt extenders on the internet, are they safe? is there anything else I'm missing?  Let's assume I don't have the money to get a bigger car right now. "
1323,What's the difference between baby clothes that say X months and clothes that say X-Y months?,I have clothes that are 3 months and I have clothes that are 3-6 months. Are they equivalent? is there equivalency between sizes that are given as a single number vs ones that are given as a range? 
1324,How to teach my son that winning is not everything and to lose graciously? My son cries when he loses and quits playing the game,"My 5-year-old son cries when he loses a game. He gets impatient and throws tantrums and beats me when he loses. The same thing happens when he plays with his friends also.   I have tried to teach him by playing games which I myself and my son lose/win alternately, but to no avail. The moment he loses more than once, he cries badly again.  I even tried losing continuously and throwing tantrums and the following dialogue ensued:     Me: I will not play with you since you always win.      He: It's OK, you should win on your own and don't cry.    The moment he loses a game he quits.   How should I teach him sportsmanship and teach him losing is OK? How should I teach him it's OK to lose and losing graciously? "
1325,How to deal with the story books which indicate stealing to be okay/good?,"   Jack and his mother then live happily ever after with their riches that Jack stole from the giant. - Jack and the Beanstalk      Putting the jewels into their clothing, the children set off for home. A swan ferries them across an expanse of water and at home they find only their father; his wife died from unknown causes. Their father had spent all his days lamenting the loss of his children and is delighted to see them safe and sound. With the witch's wealth that they found, they all live happily ever after. - Hansel and Gretel   If I were poor enough not to be able to feed my children, I would have definitely broken into someone's house by now. I don't see anything wrong in stealing if you don't have a job for some reason, and just can't earn money right now and your child is about to die because of hunger.  So, I wish to know:   At what age were you introduced to these kind of books? What was the book's impact on you at that time? How did your parents deal with these books? How do you deal with these books w.r.t your children? Do you explain them when it is okay to steal or lie and when it is not? What's your children's response? At what age such books should be introduced to the child?  "
1326,When should I allow a child to swear?,"Disclaimer: I do not have kids of my own yet, so this is more of a curiosity question.  I'd met some kids via online gaming who were ages 13 or so, and swearing quite skillfully. I think in appropriate situations swear words enhance the language, and my fiancée and I tend to use rather colorful expressions. However, I also find that hearing small children curse without full understanding the meaning of the words is disturbing.  When should I allow a child to swear? How do I know they understand exactly what they're saying? What can I do to ensure they're aware of the offensive meaning and will not use the language where not appropriate?

1327,How to store breastmilk?,"I am a working mom and I intend to express milk at my office say by around 11.30 and by 2. I am staying in India, Bangalore.   Now, can I mix the milk expressed these two times if they both are at room temperature? Can I refridgerate this combined milk after coming home (by around 3 pm)? Can this milk be used to feed my baby the next day when I am out to office again? (before 36 hours of time of expressed milk)  "
1328,Parents that do not allow outlets for stress,"What if a kid wanted to dedicate a portion of a room of an apartment to installing Judo-like padding, and perhaps even boxing bags, to go to and take out the stress of when parents shouted at them? What if when they did this parents shouted at them even more.  I hate my parents. They stress me out, and do not accept my need to have a stress relief space within the house, nor do they accept pouncing or kicking, but then again, if I were not blind they could probably not accept reading either.  What to do? "
1329,When do you encourage your children to move out?,"I recently met a guy, age 40, still living with his parents. In the gossip circuit this was considered inappropriate. But is it really? And if so, when does sharing a household with your grownup offspring becomes awkward? "

1332,When can I cover my baby with a blanket in her crib?,"Once our girls figured out how to kick their blanket loose so they were no longer swaddled, while they were sleeping, we were told they shouldn't sleep with a blanket anymore because the blanket can be a choking/suffocation hazard.    We live in a colder region, so during the winter, we keep the thermostat turned up pretty high so that they stay warm in their crib.  When it is okay to start covering your baby with a blanket when you put them to bed?  Are there some good guidelines? "
1333,Discipline hyperactive 3 year old,"I have a three year old son who is just awesome.  He is advanced intellectually,  loving, and he seems very empathetic.  He does extremely well in daycare (it is at least an above average daycare), and most of the time at home at well. However, there are times when he becomes - for lack of a better word - unreachable.  He'll start climbing on his mothers head; run around the room; throw things; etc - and all this would be tolerable to some extent if:   There was any way at all of getting him to listen. He responded to requests to stop. His behavior was not accompanied with what sounds like maniacal laughter.   A typical episode plays out something like this:   He starts being disruptive beyond what I will tolerate. I go through various stages of firmness in disciplining him as his behavior continually worsens. I  threaten him with the loss of something (I always keep my promises) to no avail. Eventually I take him to his room.  I stand outside holding the door as he tries to get out (he doesn't know I am holding it). He starts throwing anything that has weight at the door or kicking the door or opening and slamming his trifold closet door.   Eventually I realize that unless I intervene, his room / stuff / body will be damaged and I go in the room. Usually I still haven't lost my temper (but I'm getting close), and I go in.  I sit on his bed with him, and hold him as gently as I can while attempting to keep him somewhat still (I hate this and it seems wrong but I see no alternative) while he alternates between laughing and crying hysterically to let him go, ""you're hurting me"" (I'm not), and if I let him go, well - one time I said 'if I let you go, are you going to hit me?'  He looked at me with a twinkle in his eye and said, 'Yes!'  (I regret to say I was not able to stop myself from laughing)...     This all continues for a long time until he gives up sort of - and I do my very best to have him get why he was put in his room in the first place and that daddy loves him and is not mad and it is not ok to do x, etc.  And his behavior has greatly improved in many aspects - until he becomes unreachable.  Whatever happens over their with him when he is in that space seems beyond my powers to interrupt.  Any suggestions for having this become workable? "
1334,Should I let my 3 year old play educational games on my iPhone?,"There are some great educational-type games for smart phones.  Our daughter was able to navigate my iPhone pretty early on.  She seems to learn a lot from the games she is playing - letter sounds, colors, etc.  She would also play it all day if we would let her - she asks to play a lot even though we limit her time on it.  Is it okay to let kids play education games (or even non-educational games on occasion)?  There seems to be some advantages, but I don't want to get her hooked on technology at too young of an age (I don't want to stifle creativity).  What are your thoughts on when is a good age to let kids play educational games on a smartphone? "

1336,Is teeth grinding bad for my child?,"My one year old daughter will occasionally grind her teeth together for a few seconds.  She has four teeth on top and four teeth on bottom, and she will grind them back and forth when she is walking around or playing with something.  It freaks me out—it sounds horrible and gives me the shivers. (I'm squeamish as I'm writing this...)  My reaction is to distract her, and usually because the sound is so appalling to me, I distract her a little too loud or sudden (don't worry, I don't yell at her).  Now, I just try to plug my ears and ignore it, but then I started wondering if it should be stopped.  Is teeth-grinding bad for her teeth or is it just something I need to deal with? Are there ways to prevent it (does it need to be prevented)? "
1337,What are some ways to get an older sibling to give a younger sibling a little space?,"We have 2 daughters - a 4 year old and a 1 year old.  Our 4 year old daughter will not leave our 1 year old daughter alone.  It is nothing malicious or intentionally mean, but it feels like we should be protecting the younger one.  I actually believe the older one is doing it because she loves the younger one so much.  Some examples:   Overwhelming the 1 year old with toys.  The older one will bring the younger one a toy.  The younger one starts playing with it, and 5 seconds later the older one will take the toy away and give a her a new toy to play with.  This goes on until we tell the older one that it was nice she gave her sister a toy, but she should just let her play with one toy.  The older one is doing it to be nice. Hugging for too long.  The older one loves to give the younger one hugs, and the younger one is fine with a quick hug, but the older one wants to hug for 5 seconds or more.  After a 1-2 seconds the younger one starts screaming because she wants to go play.  The older one is hugging her because she loves her, but we can't get it through her head to do a light, quick hug and then let her go. Getting in her face.  When the older one wants to talk to the younger one, she will get 2 inches from her face.  She wants to put her hands on her cheeks and talk to her.  The younger one hates it (who enjoys having someone talk to you a couple inches away).   There are a few other things like this, and these things happen many times a day.  I honestly believe her intentions are good.  We always tell the older one that it is sweet that she loves her sister so much, but that she needs to give her some space.  This has been going on for a few months, and I'm not sure we are going about it the right way.    We have tried gently demonstrating to the older one how hugging for too long or constantly replacing toys is not fun for the receiver (the 4 year old hates it when someone does it to her, but she just can't associate it with her sister).  We don't want to get after the older one all day long (like watching a sporting event when the refs blow the whistle every few seconds - just let them play!), but at the same time it doesn't feel fair to the younger one - or maybe that's just part of being a younger sibling?  Does anyone have ideas of things to tell our older daughter or ways to teach her to give her sister some space?  Or should we just leave them alone and let the younger one learn to fend for herself?  Thanks in advance! "
1338,What is a safe but useful temperature to set your hot water at?,"As you know, modern hot water systems allow you to set the maximum temperature of hot water coming out, either by using less gas/electricity or by mixing the hot water with cold water to the set temperature.  We have baby (our first) arriving in 2 weeks and we probably should revise our hot water setting down from 50°C (which my husband likes to leave it at for doing dishes of all things!) All the books and anecdotal baby advice recommend utilising the temperature setting on the hot water system to avoid children, especially babies, accidentally being burned.  I've read conflicting advice for the right, kid-safe temperature. At the low end, one book suggests 38°C, which is basically just body temperature. At the other end, my husband and I like to shower at around 44°C (which we do by turning on a cold tap and manually mixing which is probably stupid). Apparently it takes a couple of minutes for a kid to get badly burnt at 50°C but just a couple seconds for third degree burns at 60°C so some kind of tradeoff might be in order below 50°C. Would 44°C be safe? What would you set it at?  Answers in °C preferred. "
1339,"Is breastfeeding success possible when baby has ""bubble palate""?","I am having trouble breastfeeding my fourth baby. I have successfully breastfed two of my other three kids, so I am confident that my technique is not to blame. To confirm this I saw a lactation counselor who told me that my baby has a ""bubble palate"" in addition to a possible submucosal tongue tie and a lip tie. She said that an ENT would be able to give me an ""official"" diagnosis, so I will make an appointment ASAP.  In the meantime, she gave me some direction as to how cope until she can be treated, but, she also said that ""no one does anything about a tongue tie like that, but perhaps you can find someone who will."" She said nothing about the ""bubble palate"" other than it might get better when the lip tie is fixed, and/or when the baby gets bigger (she's three weeks old right now.) For now, my baby is getting enough to eat, her weight gain is fair (within normal, if a bit slow compared to my other children), and my supply is holding steady, but, the LC did say that by the time she's a month old, my baby might not be able to get enough and my supply will most likely suffer. This breaks my heart-I can't bear the thought that my baby might go hungry and the solution will be to quit bf'ing.   I have been looking for more info about ""bubble palate"" and have found nothing of any substance or credibility, just a bunch of ""stay strong, you can get thru this"" and ""just give baby a bottle"" on chat forums. I found one pdf of a paper written by a dentist that had pictures of cadavers with bubble palate but no info such as a medical/scientific name for the condition, how to treat it, long term effects, or methods of dealing with the feeding difficulties associated with it. I can find so much about cleft palates/lips, and tongue/lip ties, but nothing about this other defect.  I am at this point fairly well informed about the lip/tongue tie problem, and will pursue correcting it, but there's still a big ""what if"" in my mind regarding the palate: ""what if fixing those two isn't enough?""  So, to sum up my actual questions:   What is ""bubble palate""? Can it be ""cured"", resolved, corrected, or outgrown? What are some strategies to overcome feeding issues if there's nothing that can be done?   are there any other effects besides the trouble with breastfeeding (speech, solid foods, oral hygiene, tooth alignment, etc)?    Also, related question:   What is the likelihood that correcting the lip (and possibly tongue) tie will be enough to overcome the difficulty we're having- making the ""bubble palate"" a non-issue?   Besides research/scientific info, I'd certainly be interested in other parents' experiences/strategies.   We need help.  Some additional info:  Baby was born full term, healthy, vaginal delivery w/o drugs/intervention. No complications during labor, delivery, or pregnancy.  No family history of defects.  The ""bubble"" is located on the hard palate behind her gums, and feels like a baby pea-sized indentation when I let her suck on my finger.  My pediatrician sort of dismissed my concerns, since, at our appointment to discuss all this he gave her a bottle and she took it. She dribbled milk out of the side of her mouth like she does at the breast, so she's not getting good suction on an artificial nipple either. For this reason (and, bc breastfeeding should not so easily be given up on) I don't accept his ""solution"" which is to just bottle feed her.  I realize this borders on asking for medical advice, but I'm hoping someone has more info than my dr and the LC (who is a nurse) provided.  I am not so pro-breastfeeding that I'll pursue it to the detriment of my child, but I do think it's worth fighting for.  "
1340,Teaching children how to fight back,"When I was growing up, my mom taught me that if someone hit me, I was supposed to fight back with all I had, and there was no such thing as fighting fair. ""Don't stop until an adult pulls you off of them,"" she would say. Luckily, despite being a pretty nerdy and solitary creature, I never had an encounter with the ""school bully"" outside of words exchanged.   But since I was also pretty skinny and not particularly physically adept, this actually gave me a bit of confidence about a conflict actually happening; I might not be able to get someone to stop by punching them in the nose, but damned if I wasn't going to scratch, bite, jab, and gouge as much as I could muster to even the playing field.  Of course, I was also taught to ignore bullies in general and tell the teacher when possible.  Now that I'm older though, I'm wondering if there's a better, perhaps less violent lesson I could teach my kids one day. What are some people's opinions or personal experience about teaching children to defend themselves? I know Karate and such is a good extracurricular activity, but what about for kids that simply aren't interested? "
1341,What do I do about my mom setting her expectations too high?,"I recently turned 13, I'm in 8th grade, and my life is going pretty well. I'm getting straight A's in school, along with possibly getting a paper published in a legitimate mathematics journal. I also have a pretty active social life, but not the kind where I go to parties all the time.   My mom, however, seems to find everything wrong  with me. For example, whenever she catches me on my computer doing a programming project (sometimes things I actually earn money for, so I'm not just ""wasting time"") or something that I find really fun, she starts yelling* at me for spending too much time at the computer and saying I should be doing homework, even though I work the free time into my schedule after all my homework is done.   She also gets mad at me for even the tiniest slip up at school. For example, I recently got a 91 on a spanish quiz. It's my lowest spanish grade so far and didn't really affect my grade at all, but I got yelled at for almost 30 minutes for it and she always brings it up whenever I come home with a 100 on a test.  It's the littlest things. I have a pair of socks on the floor, it triggers a rant. My backpack is heavy, it triggers a rant. I don't understand why, but I've learned that arguing just makes it worse so I just kind of let it happen. She's an awesome mom otherwise, it's just that I think she has unreasonably high expectations for me in every facet of my life. My dad is pretty chill and gets mad at her when he sees her yelling at me for something small, so that just kind of snowballs and creates more stress.   What can I do  to get her a bit off my back and make some mistakes without her intervening constantly?   *Well, not really yelling. You know that ""I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed"" catch phrase? It's like that, but she is visibly mad.  "
1342,How can I teach my child to be careful about carrying potentially dangerous objects?,"My 13 month old, who is a new walker but fairly steady on his feet, loves pens and markers. I want to encourage his writing and exploring, but I am worried about him walking around with these objects. I recognize the danger of him falling, and implore him to keep the pens out of his mouth, especially while walking. I feel like taking the objects away while he is walking confuses him, because I permit his use of them often. I see pictures and discussions of very young children in other cultures using things like knives, and I would very much like to be able to allow my son this freedom with his markers, the same freedom he enjoys with his other toys. I try to explain to him the dangers, but I'm not quite sure he fully understands.  By allowing my son to walk around with markers, am I being a bad parent? Even under close supervision, I may be unable to stop the hazardous fall. How can I teach such a young child to be aware and safe with the tools he is holding? "
1343,Is it common for a 3 month old baby to drool and suck their fingers?,My son has just turned 3 months old.   Recently I have observed him drooling and sucking his fingers. He usually drools more after feeding and sucks his fingers almost all the time.   Is this common or abnormal behaviour?   What might be the root cause and how can we break his habits? 
1344,Is having a sibling better for a child?,"We have several friends who have two or more children, while myself and my wife only have one. Often when we visit them, it seems that the conversation always turns to, ""When are you having your second?"", and when we suggest that we only want one, we are often met with incredulous reactions, often followed with statements like:   Shame! Poor child, he'll be all alone when you two are gone. Shame, he won't have someone to talk to about issues at home. It's much easier to have two or more, they can play with each other. He'll develop much better by learning close bonds only siblings can give. Isn't that a bit selfish, you should think about your son, he'll be better off with a brother/sister.   And so on.  Our reasons for just wanting one are primarily economic ones, but we also think we can give our son a much better environment in terms of attention and support. Truth be told, we find demands of everyday life and the demands of parenting just one child to be quite demanding already, so we think having a second may impact all our lives negatively.  There really does seem to be intense pressure to have a second child, and after such conversations, I do often feel guilty that we are happy with just our son, and that maybe we are being selfish. I've read a bit online about the subject, and there seems to be quite a lot of arguments to suggest having one or more siblings matters/doesn't matter, but I'm wondering what real, concrete evidence there is one way or the other? Is a child really better off with a sibling? "
1345,How strict should we be with our 14-month-old boy?,"Our baby is really sweet :)  Generally can be considered as a good / easy going baby. There are times though, when he gets totally out of control.  I've had a discussion with a child-psychologist who stated that it is crucial, even for the first months, not to let the child to do things that are not appropriate, by just changing the tone of the voice. That way you set boundaries to the kid and he supposedly learns not to cross them.  For example, there is this bookcase full of books and magazines, where we usually let him play  with the magazines. Many times though he grabs and throws books from the upper part, which is not desirable by us, most importantly because some of them are heavy and he might be injured.  So it is now understood by him, that messing with the books is not an action we are happy about, and some times he's even looking around, to see if we are watching him.  But there are times where he will keep taking those books, even when we are watching him, without listening to us at all.  How much we should insist to not letting him doing such a thing? It seems that he knows pretty much well what he's doing (something that's not appropriate), but there are other moments though were I think that we should not be so strict, and just let him... throw these books (with care of course) :)  Taken in mind that he's 14 months old, should we keep insisting that this is an unaccepted behavior, or we should loosen up a bit and let him... go wild?

1347,At which age does it make sense to see a professional when suspecting Asperger?,"We noticed that our 3.5 year old child begins showing signs of Asperger. Each of these signs, by itself, could be explained with age, but in sum it appears noticeable.   I'm not going to list the signs and I'm not asking for a diagnosis.  At which age is it even possible to diagnose Asperger (or the lack thereof) with confidence? And, assuming our suspicion doesn't fade, at which age is it worth it given that there is not much that can be done about it? "
1348,When can I start to let our son play with his friends unattended?,"Our son is 2.5 years. He has a high interest in cars and going outside of the house. Every day, whether it is in the morning or afternoon, he always ask us to get out of the house. If we have time, we let him play outside and accompany him. This is usually once per a day. But sometimes, we never let him play outside. I am wondering when we can start to let him play outside the house with his older friends without being accompanied by us. Is there any minimum age? Or any other qualification? Our son cannot speak properly yet and is sometimes hard to understand. "
1349,How can we make the most of Parent-Teacher consultations?,"We attend parent-teacher consultations once a term and we sometimes come out feeling as if we've just received the the boilerplate script. Little X is doing fine, reaching all appropriate milestones etc. If we ask what we can do to at home it's usually ""keep doing what you are"" or ""keep encouraging them"", pretty vague.  I'm sure it's hard for teachers to come up with novel, useful feedback when they're doing a dozen kids' parents in an evening.   However, has anyone got any tips for how to maximise the usefulness of these 20 minute sessions? What kinds of things can we do to get the teacher to open up a bit more? What are the ""killer"" questions?   Kids are currently in first school. "

1351,"How do I deal with my mother who is not supporting me, probably because of her grandchild?","I think sort of related: How to handle a mother who is becoming unkind to the adult child?  My grandparents live out of country (We live in Indonesia), and they decided to support my brother's college studies. My mother told my brother that after he gets a job, he should help me also get to college, and my brother agreed.  After four years and getting a degree, my brother is still trying to get a good job. I decided to defer my enrollment for next year. In this time my brother got someone pregnant and is now having a family. Now I do not have anyone to support me for my studies.  It has gotten worse because now my mother is totally ignoring me and pouring all attention to her grandchild (who lives in our house most days). This is not jealousy, but mere pragmatism. She does not do chores anymore, and spends most money for my niece (her grandchild). It has gotten to the point where we (my father, I,) out right miss dinner, because nothing is prepared... (at this times we just cook for ourselves)  We can't not have her not have the money (example we budget my father's salary) because she receives still considerable money from her parents. (my grandparents told me that they are willing to help me out on college, but only at unique times and not monthly commit compared to my brother, because they were disappointed too)  I am very stressed and sad right now. Now my mother does not want me to go to college (She says she should just keep the money for her old age). She is always telling me to look at my brother who got a job unrelated to his degree (he is now teaching singing).   I am mainly sad because it feels that my mother is not supporting me both financially and morally.  I have big dreams and I do believe I am a hard working. In the one year of my deferrment I tried to work and even got a job (even though I was 17 at the time.) With the money I earned and saved everything I was even planning to buy my parents a cheap car. But because of our argument (about that I should not go to college) I am having second thoughts. In fact I am feeling a bit suicidal because it seems that my dreams are crushed.   My mother is always telling us not to have s-x with and support our family first. But with my mother's actions I am now feeling that my brother did the right thing - he now has a family, a degree, a moderately good job. And my mother's favor. While I am left without a plan, no support (even small things like having food prepared), and my dreams/actions constantly being shoved down at me (she says- if you have such big dreams why don't you go to college without my parent's help?)  It is not even that expensive to make me go to college  because I have a full-blown scholarship (as I've said, I have big dreams and am academic. there would have been no way I got accepted to Google Summer of Code if I was 'mediocre', and the college I got accepted at was the top university in my country. I am not taking this to my head, but still, I have dreams)  Is there an ideal course of action for me? What should I do? "
1352,Sleeping and eating issues at night for a 3 month baby,"my younger boy is 3+ months now and he eats regularly throughout the night, like, 12am, 3am and 6am, and fell back sleeping for 3 hours at a stretch, that's a good night. sometime the interval is 2 hours and he wakes up crying and demanding for feeds.   I would say he is a decently good sleeper though, meaning that he falls asleep quickly and cries only for food, except for occasionally being fuss.  The pediatrician warned us that he might be a little overweight and suggested reduce the feeding amount (for now, we feed 6oz of formula each time he wakes up).   That puts us at a struggle if we should feed him or let him cry through? Is he sucking the milk because he is hungry or just an instinct? We learnt from other parents that some infants just sleep through the whole night - is it a result of training or just that babies are different?   My first born (now is 2) used to have similar issues as his kid brother does too.  Any suggestions are welcome. "
1353,What to do about our 8-year-old boy getting in trouble at his new school after having been taken away from his mom?,"Our 8-year-old boy is now living with us, taken away from his mom due to abuse and now living with his dad, new home and new school. He spent his first 7 years with his mom and dad had weekend visits twice monthly. When living with his mom he was late to missed school 34 times in 2nd grade.  His mom drank a lot and took him around lots of boyfriends. He was left with his grandmother a lot.    We have had him here for 6 months now and he is getting in trouble at school several times a week. Talking, knocking cups out of students' hands, running in the hall, acting silly, reading while the teacher is teaching... He says that he is trying to make friends or that they are not paying any attention to him when he raises his hand.    His dad thinks they might be picking on him.  We have him playing soccer and martial arts. He didn't get to do any of that while with his mom.  We have him going to see a therapist twice a month for the last 5 months. I know it's a lot of changes. I would like to know what discipline actions should be taken at home for the check marks at school? At first we were taking away his tablet and grounding, but there have been so many more check marks that he would stay grounded always.  He is good at home, he is a pleaser. He has to keep his room clean and feed the dog. He receives check marks on his conduct folder and he has to fill out a form to what happens and why and how to correct to make sure it doesn't happen again, the teacher signs it and the parent. There have been a couple of times that I have being talking to him about the issues at school and he starts to get louder and swinging his arms, I bring that to his attention and tell him he needs to try to stay calm and not be so upset.       His dad has said that mom was loud and wanted to be the center of attention and that is how he is acting.  What to do? "
1354,How much sun is too much for a child?,"My three months old son really likes to sit or lie in the spots where the sun shines through our windows unto the floor. I guess he likes the additional warmth.  Currently it's winter in Germany (from a temperature perspective) so the sun isn't that strong, but I'm afraid in spring and summer eventually the sun will get very dangerous for the delicate baby skin.  I could not find any concise advice on this matter, some say ""no sun at all"", some say ""sunlight is good"", some say ""sunlight only to a certain degree"". Obviously this highly depends on the geographic region and the actual age of the child.  Are there any rules of thumb to decide how much sun is too much? Is there any typical behaviour or reactions to watch out for which indicate too much exposure? Or is it better to play it safe and avoid direct sunlight under all circumstances?  EDIT: I'm interested in both indoor and outdoor exposure, because all children will be exposed to sunlight both indoors and outdoors. (Except for some places in Africa perhaps) "
1355,"Impact of frequent change of childcare, and how to minimise","We are a family with parents from two different countries living in a third. For family reasons, we want to move to my native country. The little one is two and a bit.  For my wife, lengthy (1+ year) residency permit processes are required before we can move. She now has the opportunity to transfer with her company to a neighbouring EU country, which would work great for us from the perspective of my family situation. Had it been only us two, we would have jumped at the opportunity to be a few hundred kilometres from my family.   It is, however, a different country. We worry about another transition for the little one: new daycare, new language and new friends, especially when we know that within a year or so, there will be another new daycare situation when we finally do move to my native country.  Assuming a loving family situation with its concomitant stable child-carer bonds, what impacts could frequent childcare rearrangements have? If the only stability we can provide is that we both will be there, what can be done to ameliorate the situation? "
1356,My girlfriend has mentioned disowning her 14 y/o transgender daughter,"My girlfriend's 14 year old daughter came out to me as a girl on a bike ride when her mother wasn't there. I fully accept her and gladly refer to her by her chosen name ('Emily' for the purposes of this question) and pronouns. Emily told me she hadn't told her mother yet and she felt more comfortable telling me first. Overall, we have conflict-free, loving, pretty great relationship. She told me not to tell her mother and of course I agreed.  The bike ride was on 9/11, and Emily finally came out to her mother on Friday night (5 days ago). I don't know what exactly happened, I got home late from work and they were in a heated argument, but it ended with Emily going to her room and refusing to come out.  Later that night, my girlfriend referred to her own child as a ""degenerate"". She's mentioned ""sending him to a camp"" and ""disowning him"". She has made other similar comments as well as creating an unsupportive environment by misgendering Emily and referring to her by her former name at every opportunity. She's become even more strict about Emily's clothing, hair, accessories, etc. I would have understood if she were shocked or in denial, if she thought it was a phase, etc. but to be honest, she might well bully her own child into suicide at this rate.  I have tried to talk to my girlfriend, she only responds that I am ""taking his side"" and ""promoting that lifestyle"". I tried everything from telling her about the high suicide rates among trans teens, I showed her studies on how trans teens start doing so much better (in terms of mental health, in school, etc) once they start treatment 1, and others but she is not budging. There is the added issue that Emily is not my kid, so my girlfriend feels I have no say (and to an extent, I agree).  My question is, how do I best protect Emily not only from bullies outside the home, but from the bullying she's experiencing from my girlfriend? I don't want to get between Emily and her mother. Emily's father passed away before she was a year old, so her mother is her only surviving parent.  Also, if it's relevant, Emily is the only child in the home - I don't have any children and she's my GF's only child. They moved in with me about a year ago, we've been together for 3 years.  Second question: My girlfriend's talk of disowning or sending Emily to a horrific ""conversion"" camp has me wondering if I should be taking steps to become Emily's legal guardian (if she agrees). How do I discuss this with her and what are the benefits of legal guardianship in this situation?  1 Emily told me she wants to see a doctor about getting on testosterone blockers. She'll be able to get counseling as well, since extensive counseling is a given when considering transition. The trans-friendly clinics/hospitals in our area have mental health professionals on staff and require their patients to undergo counseling before and during transition. "
1357,How much should a 26 y.o. adult child assist their parents?,"I have a friend who is a 26 year old single guy who makes a good amount of money, not six figures but a close amount. He bought a 3 bedroom house and has a solid career, and on top of his apps and open source projects he is branching out socially.  But his parents, who gave everything for his private school education, have been underemployed for a few years and financially struggled. He has helped them here and there with money but did it selectively and carefully, as he learned the hard way they can get too dependent on him. But finally his Dad got a fulltime job, making a modest white collar salary again. They're short on cash, but their house valuation nearly doubled.  Coincidentally, his Dad is moving to the same city as his son. The son gave a few thousand to help his cash strapped parents get the house on the market, and the parents promise to pay him back. But while the house gets sold, the son reluctantly agrees to let his parents and younger brother move in temporarily. His only worry is the sellers market is so competitive that his parents may struggle to buy a house. Not to mention, he despises the petty family drama and more than once told his Dad to stop the  attitude or find somewhere else to live.  I only post this because I'm close to this guy and can relate to his experiences. Its so backwards to the typical narrative nowadays. Most kids in their 20s live with their parents and rely on them for help, not the other way around. He came to me for advice and I do not know what to say.   What rules and boundaries should be established in this kind of situation? Financially and socially, What can he do to balance his own life and seeking his own family while helping his parents? Is there things he should have done differently to balance expectations more optimally? "
1358,Alternatives to using food coloring for kids activities,"We do a lot of activities that seem to use food coloring in our house - making play doh, playing with colored vinegar and baking soda, etc. Food coloring seems to be pretty pricey in our local grocery stores, though - [tex]5 for one of those little boxes with the 4 colors.   What other choices do I have? How can add color to things without expensive food coloring? "
1359,What are effective strategies against social phobia?,"Our 5 years old (in a month) daughter has excessive apprehension about being immerged in new environments with people (especially children) she doesn't know.  Basically, she will cry her heart out when we try to leave her in such an environment, then she will stay away from the group, near an adult if possible.  I feel there is more than just timidity, I guess this qualifies somehow as social anxiety disorder ?  It has already reached a bothering level, because we cannot always prevent such situations to happen (e.g. during summer we can't afford to keep her at home so she had to follow a holiday camp, it was like sending her to Guantanamo every morning…), and because she is starting to miss fulfilling opportunities (we are cancelling a music and dance initiation program because she doesn't want to attend the class, despite her loving the topic and liking the teachers).  This is less an issue in school because she already knows most children from the last two years (and she has good friends with whom she knows how to behave quite excited), yet teachers seem moderately concerned by her lack of involvement in group activities.  She went to a child psychiatrist last weeks, but he didn't help much, beside saying she was quite anxious (which was actually the reason for which we sent her to him, she is constantly and litteraly eating her fingers) and a bit egocentric, but had no strong issue (I guess he was only looking for some psychiatric disease).  What can we do to help her dealing with this issue ? "
1360,Ideas for a poster helping kids deal with an emotionally abusive environment,"My wife engages in a lot of emotionally abusive behaviour, including yelling, calling names, and the more dangerous stuff like the passive aggressive silent treatment, gaslighting, projection of her own mistakes on to others etc.  We have two small children, and so far she has done less of this with them, but as they grow and begin to challenge her authority I can see her doing it more and more.    I am learning to set boundaries and am in the last stages of trying to either change this relationship or leave (please do NOT give me advice on the relationship - that's not what I'm looking for).   I've made a small poster and want to put it up in the house to both help my kids understand and to reduce the amount of self-blame if she begins to guilt trip and use the silent treatment on them as well.  So I came up with these points for the poster:   If I'm angry, it's my job to tell you calmly, and your job to listen calmly. If I feel like screaming or hitting you, it's my job to calm down, and your job to let me calm down. If I call you bad names, it's my job to stop, and your job to not believe what I say about you. If I do something wrong, it's my job to say sorry and try to make things better.  If I honestly do that, it's your job to stop being angry.   And it's our job to love, to care, to build our dreams together.    Would these be ok?  Do you think I should change them or add anything?  Please also note that my wife will, definitely, reject anything I propose, so please do not suggest discussing it with her, as at this point that will not help.  EDIT: Here is a revised version, based on the very very helpful comments from @anongoodnurse below. Explanation for revisions below this.    OUR FAMILY FIGHTING RULES  Repeat after me:   If I'm angry with you, it's my job to explain why, calmly and clearly. If I feel like screaming or hitting you, it's my job to calm down.   If you're telling me what you're feeling and why - angry or sad or happy or lonely - it's my job to listen and to care. If I'm calling you names or saying you're a bad person, you shouldn't believe what I say about you, and it's my job to stop. When I do something wrong, it's my job to say sorry and try to make things better.  If you do something wrong, say sorry, and try to make things better, it's my job to forgive you and stop being angry.  Whatever you do, it's always my job to care for you.   Because we all make mistakes, and we all need forgiveness, because otherwise we can't do our main job - to love, to care, and to build our dreams together.  Reasons:   To avoid the impression, that was pointed out, that any one ""job"" depends on the other person doing theirs To include the explicit point about negative self-images The last two points in @anongoodnurse's list seemed like they specifically were aimed at the person being abusive - so putting them in seems like it would make the poster seems less universal, since as he/she said, the key is to make these rules that clearly apply to everyone.  Those could be communicated elsewhere?   NB: In case it might be useful, I've put up a poster version of these rules here. "
1361,Is screaming a phase?,"My wife picks up my daughter from daycare at the end of the day and goes home to get dinner ready and do some chores as she waits for me to get home. My daughter is 7 months old. When she gets home she changes my daughter and feeds her a bottle. When my daughter is picked up she is happy as a clam. When my wife puts my daughter down in the same room or in a different room she just starts screaming. It has gotten so bad that my wife has gotten overly frustrated and I have had to give her some time to herself to de-stress as I arrive home an hour later and she stops. She only does this at the end of the day. My wife can't hold her everyday after work, nothing she needs to do or wants to do would get done. Is the screaming a phase? We do leave her to play on her own periodically depending on what is going on in a different room or in the same room and she is fine. It seems that this week things have gotten a lot LOUDER with her. Anything I can do to curb this behavior or save my wife some sanity till I get home? "
1362,What do you do to help an ADHD kid get along in the classroom or with school work better?,"Rather than always trying to change the child, what are some techniques for ways to help a ""wiggly kid"" function in the classroom better without it just being about ""sitting still""?    The methods I used with my middle school kids were to allow them to stand if they wanted to, offer fidgets, allow for noise canceling headphones when independent work was being completed, offer up hands on and active lessons (more labs than lectures - nature hikes, field trips as often as possible, dramatic presentations to illustrate a process. . . etc.) I also made sure to include a wide variety of assessment styles (presentations, writing of papers, quizzes and tests, they could write children's books or a song. . . etc. whenever possible)    They generally worked well.  Do these same things work as well in elementary school?  What have you done that I don't mention here? "
1363,How to teach bike riding with a balance bike,"We got our son a balance bike (small wooden pedal-less bike) for his third birthday. These seem to be the modern way of teaching bike riding.  At the moment he sometimes will 'walk' the bike for few feet, but generally show no interest in using the bike.  He's not super interested in his tricycle either. Maybe he too young (36 months)?  What are the steps in teaching riding using a balance bike? Where should we start? "
1364,Should I let my kids father back in their lives after 8 years of not being there & being in & out,"My older kids are 11 &amp; 9. Their father has never been there for them. All ways in &amp; out never constant. It seems every time he gets a girlfriend he's got something to prove to her so he'll talk to my kids on the phone for 2-3 weeks then he's gone again, then in a year or 2 he'll try to contact them again.   This has been going on for 8 years now. He's never once paid any amount of money towards them. Most years he doesn't even call for their birthday's or Christmas. The last 6 years I've been with my husband and had another baby with him, he treats my older kids as if they were his. He shows up for games and practices, school events and is there when they just need their daddy.   My son takes it especially hard. He's in therapy and after he talks to his bio father on the phone or whatever my son acts out starting the day after he speaks to him, he talks back, he's disrespectful &amp; doesn't listen or follow the directions of his teachers or myself. He can't focus and has a difficult time staying on task. He has meltdowns threw out the day. By meltdown I mean crying so hard he can't catch his breath, he clings to &amp; asks things (to daddy, the man that stepped up) like are you going to leave me like Albert, are you still going to be my daddy, are you still going to do stuff with me the stuff we do, are you still going to come to my games &amp; practices?   My kids should not have to go through this but some how he makes me feel like the worse person in the whole wide world. I told him that if he truly wanted to be a consistent with them &amp; be apart then he can find a family councilor and first appointment him &amp; I will go to hash out whatever needs to be hashed out that the kids don't need to be a part of &amp; if that goes well then him, I &amp; the kids can go and the more progress him &amp; my kids will determine the next step. He doesn't want that. What should I do, am I wrong? Help pleassssssseeeeeee!!!! "
1365,"What to do if you are poor, have no house, no parents and pregnant?","I do not know where else to ask for the advise. I need someone to point me what to do. My situation:    I am pregnant, ~ 3 months. I did not know about this pregnancy because I was taking contraceptions - mini pill for many years and I did not have periods since I started to be on a pill. So until now I did not have any special signs that ""smth is not right"", besides occasional nausea and sickness. I am Phd student in US, I earn very little ~$1900/month which is enough to cover living and food. I have debts from my BS/MS degree (~ 50K loan) and I have no savings. I am not a US citizen, just international student from Belarus.  The father of the baby is visiting student from Turkey. He does not want to do anything with this baby, he just stopped replying on my calls. He will leave US in 3 months to go back to his country. He will not marry me, will not help me in any way. He made it very clear. I do not have family. My dad left the family when I was 2 years old, so I never knew my father, and my mother recently died. I have no siblings, nobody else to help me. I am 32 years old.   It seems that it is too late to think about abortion. But what will I do with a baby? I have no money, no home, nobody to help me, at all.  I will not be able to give my baby for adoption. I want to keep him/her, but I need some years to finish Phd and find a job to be able to provide housing and food for a baby.  Are there any government facilities that help women in such situations? Like could I give my baby to some temporary orphanage with the requirements that I will take my baby back in 5 years or so? Also I want to visit my baby all the time. I just cannot provide anything for my baby now so I need a help. I need to study/work, make money, so I obviously cannot sit at home and watch out a baby. And I cannot leave baby alone.   I do not know where to go and what to do. But I will not be able to give my baby away for adoption. I just won't be able to do it... But how how on earth can I deal entirely on my own??? Where to seek help? "
1366,"How to keep the ""Question asking"" nature of your kid?","I am a father of a two-year-old girl, and as she speaks more and more from day to day, I am already impressed by some questions, like ""why does it rain?"". Of course, she does not ask me this with any physical ulterior motives, but maybe in some years.   As I read about teenagers, this ""interest"" fades away. What is sad, because IMO asking questions, being interested in things, is the fundamental of learning.   My question  How can we keep up this (seemingly) natural interest in our environment?  "
1367,How to deal with a pre-travel conflict with my mother about overpacking?,"I am 22 years of age and living at home while I finish my degree. My upcoming trip (with family) begins to take shape. I will be travelling with my mother for roughly 2 1/2 weeks (the first half of the trip), and then alone for about another 3.   There's one thing I'm still dreading: packing. My mother is an overpacker-in-denial, and she projects that onto everybody around her. Regardless of whether she's going on the trip or not, she'll pressure everybody who is going into packing 3 times as much stuff as is actually necessary, and packing time for any trip is always rife with arguments and fighting because my philosophy is less ""be prepared for any possible scenario"" and more ""travel light"" (it wouldn't be a problem if I didn't live with her).  How do I deal with the inevitable conflict between what I want to do (especially since I'll be travelling alone for a good part of the trip) and what she wants me to do? And, preferably, do it without yelling at each other nonstop for a week? "
1368,How can one tell if an infant is developmentally advanced?,"How can I tell if an infant is developmentally advanced?  For example, in a 10 month old baby boy: he likes to play the piano and drum; he is always making sounds or noises with his mouth or toys all the time'  he looks concentrated when listening to music; he moves his arms as if he's dancing without any reason; if he wants something he will pursue it relentlessly; he hs a tantrum just for few seconds if he can't touch my iPad/iPhone or the TV remote control; he throws toys on the table/floor just to watch how they fall and sound; and he will bother us until we share our food with him. He shows signs of separation anxiety.  He is already starting to walk independently.  Are there certain actions at certain ages that indicate that an infant is developmentally advanced?  If so, does early acquisition of skills in infancy have any bearing on gifting later in life? "
1369,How do I handle an absentee parent wanting to build a relationship later in life?,"One of my parents (parent 'B') was consistently unreliable in terms of emotional support and educational development when I was growing up; they never wanted to spend time with me and I often felt like I was a burden to them rather than a son. During college when my parents divorced 'B' put my other parent, (parent 'A') whom was always there for me and whom I cared deeply about, into a major bind and filed for bankruptcy, which placed 'A' with all of our family's debts. Furthermore, because 'B' filed for bankruptcy, and 'A' was buried in debt, I then had no way have a co-signer for loans, and I thus suffered many difficulties in college: at times I became malnutritioned, and I was intermittently homeless. Now I have just graduated with dual degrees in Mathematics and Physics, and I plan to pursue a PhD at UCLA (which is very well-funded by fellowships/scholarships). Now 'B' wants to reconnect and seems like they actually want to be a parent, but I don't have any interest in connecting with them. How should I handle their approaches? For instance, 'B' will call me weekly, but I haven't answered for the past 3 weeks and either just cancel their call or let it go to voicemail, is there something more productive I can do?   One obvious idea is to tell 'B' how I feel, but I don't even feel comfortable sharing any feelings with 'B' because of how they have neglected me in the past.   "
1370,Can I learn another language alongside my 3 year old son?,"Me and my wife come from Poland, but live in the UK. Our son was born here, and is with British child-minder since around 1. He'll be 3 this December. We speak both Polish and English to him, and Polish between ourselves. I can see that he favours English as a 'default reply' language and struggles with Polish words, but understands most of what is being said to him in that language, and sometimes try to reply in Polish too.  Now, I want to learn another language - French - for myself, and I think it would be good to introduce my little one to it, too.  My question(s) is - is that at all possible, since I don't yet know the language? How would I go about it, if I want for both of us (maybe all three, if my wife decides to join us) to learn French? Should I learn first, and then - if/when I feel proficient enough - introduce my boy to it? "
1371,How can I teach my son to behave nicely in the playground when other children make it hard?,"I've been trying to teach my 3 and a half year old son to treat other children nicely and to try and resolve all conflicts without aggression, by talking. We've been talking about the issue and agreed on a couple of rules. Namely, that he should always wait for his turn to play with things and that instead of fighting his way through a conflict he should talk to the child he's arguing with.   Once we get to the playground, I can see him trying to follow those two rules, but he fails each and every time. Even if he waits for his turn to play, others in front of him fight over who gets to go first. If he builds something and somebody is messing up his thing, he first says that he didn't like it and then, when it doesn't help, he slaps them or hits them with a toy.  For example, the other day he was digging a large hole in the ground when some other boy came up to him and started filling the hole up with sand again. My son tried telling him to stop and that he didn't like that, but that boy ignored him and continued filling up the hole. So, my son ended up hitting him. I have always disapproved of such behavior, but I keep thinking that it is tough for him, because I cannot really think of a reliable way of resolving these types of conflicts.  If I'm telling my son not to fight and to try and resolve conflicts by talking, what I can I do if other children either don't listen to him or show him that fighting is perfectly normal?   How should I teach him to react if other children ignore his efforts to resolve conflicts peacefully? "
1372,How to deal with young child's apparent fear of embarrassment,"Cultural background: my family and I live in the Midwestern US.  My wife and I have a five-year-old daughter who seems to have a morbid fear of 'other kids laughing at (her)'. Previously she would mention this whenever she was feeling shy, but since she's generally a sociable and out-going child I've never overly worried about it.  But lately it seems to impact her well-being every time she has to do anything in front of a crowd. She recently graduated from pre-k and the kids did a little song-and-dance routine, she just stood there with her head down. Although she's been in karate class for a year at the latest session she was very uncooperative. At church this past weekend she was happily playing with the other kids until it was time to sing their song and dance and she just stood there. Six months ago this child was belting out the Frozen soundtrack at the top of her lungs for the entertainment of the neighborhood kids. When asked about these issues she replied with her ""I'm shy because I'm afraid people will laugh at me' line.  I don't know where this is coming from, because to the best of my knowledge she's never been laughed at. Asking her why she thinks anyone would laugh at her when no one has done so does not yield any sort of answer (part of irrational fears is that they are just that: irrational). I can only assume that she picked it up from television where snarky dialogue and personal embarrassment are par for the course.  As the question title and background I just gave may indicate, I'm a little skeptical that this situation is a legitimate fear as stated by the child. Is she really that socially anxious in certain situations (but her usual cheery self with small groups of adults and other children)? If not what's going on? If so, how do I assuage her fears?  Most of what I could find online about social anxiety was (unsurprisingly) geared towards teenagers with their greater emphasis on peer relationships, not five-year-olds who still more or less orbit their parent's star.  Thanks for any help!  UPDATE:  Thanks for all the great answers, wish I could accept more than one! "
1373,Is assisted crawling with an infant safe?,"I play with my daughter on a bed - we roll, tickle, ""fly"", laugh. I also started crawling with her. I'm not certain she enjoys it - she seems more intrigued than happy when we're doing this. She does not cry though, has no bruises or any other signs of being hurt or unhappy.  Is this safe? Can I keep doing this? Will this help her learn to crawl? "
1374,Do babies *have* to be weaned from breast milk or infant formula on purpose?,"My daughter is 15-month old. She has been breast-fed and bottle-fed since the beginning, interchanging between the two. Since 10-month we have started feeding her more ""adult"" food, such as vegetables and eggs. At about the same time, we have also started limiting breastfeeding to bed time, when my daughter craves for it the most.  I think she is one of the luckier children in Hong Kong to get such a long period of breastfeeding.  My wife is thinking of stopping to breastfeed because she can't keep up with my daughter's appetite. Plus, my daughter has already developed 12 teeth, so sometimes she accidentally bites and it hurts my wife.  My wife's interests aside, is there any real need to wean a child from breast milk or infant formula on purpose? Do children lose interest in breast milk and infant formula naturally? "
1375,Tricks / acitivities to make a toddler stay in one place for a while,"My 18MO toddler is very active. When she's not running, she's walking, and when she's not walking, she's picking things up, and otherwise she's climbing, sitting on stuff and standing up.  What tricks can you use or what activities can you come up with to make a toddler stay in one place for a longer while? Or at least be immersive enough to keep the child in one room in more or less the same place? "
1376,Does feedback from a baby monitor result in hearing loss?,"I plan on making an appointment with my baby's pediatrician but before I do, I wanted to get some feedback on my concern.  Earlier this evening, while at home, our baby monitor was too loud resulting in feedback ""high pitched"" noise. Our new born (1 week old) was in the other room and woke up to the noise. That said, what is the DB level on a baby monitor's speaker? Should I be concerned that my child may have suffered hearing loss?   Any answers would help. Thank you. "
1377,"How to encourage healthy skepticism, whilst discouraging pessimism?","I am not a parent, nor will I be for a few years at least, but I am certain that I will be one day.  I have some personal demons that I'm struggling to resolve at the moment, which have had an impact on my outlook on many aspects of life. As well as this, I already had a generally cynical and pessimistic personality.  In the scenario where I now have a child, I appreciate that my own opinions and attitudes may not be the most constructive ones to pass onto said child. I believe that a certain level of skepticism is important, as it helps to build critical thinking and encourages the formation of one's own opinions rather than following the herd.  However, I am aware that I can sometimes go overboard.  My personal opinions may conflict with those of most other parents on certain issues, but I do not want to be one of those embarrassing parents who kick up a stink and dominate school council meetings and the like, as that can be damaging to a child. How can I encourage my child to healthily question things, and think for themselves, whilst discouraging outright pessimism? Should I sometimes withhold my true beliefs about a topic when my child asks, and give them the 'proper, parenty' answers? Or should I be honest in the hope that my child will develop a healthy balance on their own? Any help is appreciated, and this is my first question, so feel free to edit/migrate this however you see fit!  "
1378,Should I forbid my 10 month old boy to touch/play with anything that is harmful/dirty?,"We are pleased with a powerful sense of his curiosity in our 10 month old son, but his curiosity makes ​​him want to touch/play everything, including items that are dangerous or dirty.  When he touches or plays with something we consider harmful or dirty, we often forbid him to play with it and we move him and encourage play elsewhere.  When we ban the play or item in words it doesn't work.  He just turns around and smiles, but he's still touching a dangerous or dirty thing.  The idea to limit his play area with a fence has been discussed, but we worry that will limit his creativity.  We want to implement a self awareness for our children, so they can learn to distinguish between safe and unsafe, dirty and clean themselves. Since we have this goal, should we let it go and if later on something happens to make him cry, will he learn and understand the cause of his discomfort?  Can this kind of learning style be applied early on children? If not, at what age can we implement it?  And is there any other recommendations regarding self-awareness education? "
1379,Is it a good or bad idea to let my daughter visit her mom in jail?,"The charge is a check fraud charge and it is a seven month sentence. My daughter she seems to be handling it fine. I told her right away about it and she reacted pretty calmly. I told her mom did the wrong thing and is rightfully serving her punishment. They have a good relationship.  The main problem I have is she will see her mom in a jail jumpsuit and see guards and other inmates that could be intimidating. Is that ok for a 15 year old to see? Actually my daughter does not seem scared but instead seems excited and enthusiastic to visit. This is strange to me. Do you find this normal? My daughter seems to find the idea of her mom having to wearing a uniform, sharing a room funny. I wonder why she would think it is funny.  My wife says bring her if she would like to and my daughter says she would like to but I don't know if it is a good idea. She hasn't gone yet so we can still discuss it together. "
1380,1-year old cries when denied the things he wants,"My 1-year-old son sometimes wants to play with sophisticated things such as a laptop, headphones, a mirror etc. If I deny him those, he starts screaming and crying. Is it a good idea to subside and give him that with supervision? If not, what should we do? "
1381,How do I help my wife be more engaged with our child in the mornings?,"My 3-year-old child wakes up after about 6-8 hours of sleep which I think is normal. I get up around that time to pick up the house, study for school, and then I head out to work. When he wakes up, his mom is still sleeping, so he climbs up into her bed and tries to wake her up and asks to breastfeed. She tells him:   Feeding is only before you go to sleep. It's too early, go to sleep. Raise her voice back at him irritated, and they both have this argument. Combination of 1, 2, 3.   I'm not sure what to do right now. I always wake up instantly when my child wakes up. I feel horrible sleeping in. I'm always tired too. But when I started exercising, I had a lot more energy, so after I wake up now, I recover faster, and I'm quickly energized.  The question would be how do I approach my wife without offending her? There could be a number of factors making her so tired, but she has always slept in though. Here is what I know:   Breastfeeding drains all her energy Not exercising for 4 years has put a toll on her, thus her energy level declined She's under a lot of stress from school that's why she sleeps more She needs a break that's why she's quick to snap   Every person has a varying threshold for stress. I try to remind myself I'm going to school like her, working at our job, then after I come home, I spend the rest of the day with my child, so she can decompress. It's 12+ hours a day. I'm completely drained, but I remind myself how exciting learning from my child is to keep me going.  I do admit I spend less time with her, but I make sure to spend at least 1-2 hours a day with my wife. I know this helps her know that I care, and I do love her. But maybe this is one of the reasons? I make sure she and I have at least a day to ourselves most of the weeks. She always comes back home looking more energized when she does.  I'm looking into different approaches, but if anyone knows of some practical advice specifically for this, please share your experience. I want to know how to talk to my wife about the situation and not offend her for not waking up early or quick to lash out at our son.  PS: I noticed one thing that helps out a lot is when she and I are reading parenting books. It always refreshes what we don't know and keeps us on our guard. I picked up another parenting book, and I am reading it and explaining to her different ways to go about the situations. I know when I do, I can see her chance dramatically. I know she wants to do the best for our son, that's why when I read about parenting and share what I learned, it reinforces what her and I should be doing and eases everything. Bottom line, I think the frustration stems from not knowing what to do in the given situation and expecting our child to be able to comprehend given his 3 years on earth what had took us over 25 years.

1382,How can I move my toddler's interest from toys to playmates?,"My kid is 2 years and 9 months now. For a year now we've been in USA and we were buying him electronic toys (buttons, music, lights, shapes, numbers), so he is very sharp at those, he can say number up to 40, he can sing 10s of rhymes. So far all is well.  But recently we are noticing that he is preferring toys over interaction. Only if toys are not noticeable, he will interact with persons who attracts him, specially females. We did get chance to watch how he interacts with other kids in USA as almost all kids were busy if not they were carrying toys which makes my kid grab that toy.  So my question is, how to reduce my child's attachment to toys, and what type of child activities can we use as replacement?   It looks like no child shows interest in my kid. Is it okay to ask some one's child to interact with mine? Or ask their parents to help me out on my child's interaction with theirs? "
1383,3 year old not even close to being potty trained,My son will be 3 in a few weeks and I am concerned about his total lack of interest in potty training. He refuses to sit on the potty (the big one and little one). How will he possibly train if he won't even sit down on the pot? Do I have reason for concern? Will he just do it one day when he is ready? 
1384,At what age is it inappropriate to take your opposite sex child into the toilet with you,"I was at the airport and saw two women (mother and daughter I guess), traveling with a young boy (about 9 or 10 years old). The two women both went into the ladies toilet, and the boy went in with them. I thought it a bit strange that they would take such an old (clearly independent) boy into the women’s toilet.  Is there an upper age limit at which it is no longer appropriate to do this? What about men taking their daughter into the men’s toilet? Do the same rules apply? In this example if 2 men took a 9 to 10-year-old girl into the men’s toilet would it be any more or less appropriate? "
1385,Microwaving supper for the children in a filthy microwave,"This is a hypothetical question, but I could see it happening to me one day.  A father uses a public microwave oven to cook supper to feed his children. The microwave is technically clean, but he is nervous that the ""fumes"" from other dishes previously cooked in there will ""contaminate"" the meals of his young ones. After realizing that he wants his kids to eat healthier, he decides that he wants to take action. He wonders if it is safe to double-wrap the food in saran wrap or possibly some other material. Should he do this? It might be unsafe and would release plastic toxins into the food if not cause a fire in the microwave? However, if it is safe, then what is the best material to use for the wrapping? "
1386,Should I make a particular effort to present great women of history to my daughter?,"I always had my heroes as I grew up. I always liked to read about great people, and of course this more often than not meant read about great men. On my time as a child very rarely important women of history were in the books I read or the documentaries I watched.   I've heard more than once from female colleagues while in college that if more female models of success were presented to them as a child, they would feel better about their career choices and overall position in society.   I kept thinking about it for a time, and now that I have a baby daughter I was thinking if it would be good for her if I made a particular effort to talk about the life of great women and give her books about it as she grows up. In one hand, this would perhaps make her less anxious about choosing her path in life. On the other, she might feel that I'm trying to tell her that I will only admire her if she becomes as successful as the women I'm talking to her about.   What do you think about it? Should I tell her about Hipatia, Cleopatra, Zenobia,  Boudica, Florence Nightingale and Marie Curie, the same way I was told about Alexander, Julius Caesar, Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein?   I know there's much more about history (and life) than great people of the past, but they seem to be powerful educational images. What do you think about it? "
1387,Can I clean the fabric from my stroller in a washer and dryer?,"The seat cover on my Maclaran (Quest) stroller is pretty filthy, and it all unsnaps, but the Maclaran site doesn't seem to have any info on whether you can machine wash it (or how to wash it at all).  Anyone have any guidance?  If the washer is safe, does it work? "
1388,When should kids be allowed to walk/bike to school alone?,My 9-year-old is asking to bike to school without adults. He is generally responsible. So far I have said he needs to find a friend to go with him.   What can children do to convince their parents that they are capable of going to school on their own?  What factors do you think are important? 
1389,How do I prepare my child for a sleepover?,How do I prepare my kids for their first sleepover? What should I do if they want to come home? 
1390,What is the best way to transition away from co-sleeping?,"We are co-sleeping with our son. At some point in the future, we will need to transition him out of our bed. What is the best way to do this? Cold turkey vs. gradual? Specific age vs. signs he's ready (and if so, what are those signs)?  Other things we should consider? "
1391,My 11-year-old daughter's temper is getting out of control,"I need help with my daughter.   She screamed in my face, she tries to block my way when I try to leave the room, she's tried to pull my hair, and she ripped a shirt I was wearing trying to keep me in place when she doesn't want me to leave.   I've tried to talk to her several times and tell her how she's hurting me and how she is hurting our future relationship. She will not listen. She always says she's sorry and she will turn around but it hasn't stopped. It's getting to the point that I don't want her around me because it's so  painful.   I have been separated from her father for over seven years, for the first four years she lived with me the majority of the time.  It's only been within the last two years that he wanted shared custody of her. Her father has extreme anger issues that he is now on medication to control.  He displays all signs of Narcissistic Personality Disorder. He has displayed his anger with her in the past to the point she did not want to go to his house.  But thanks to a program called ""For the Sake of the child"" he has her 50% of the time.   I want to take her to counseling but I need his signature to see a counselor with her. Did I mention he is a control freak that will use anything he can to make me look bad in front of her? He's also trying to get total custody.  I am truly at my wits end and want things to get better.  I love her so much and I don't want to see our relationship deteriorate to the point we can not talk to each other when she gets older.  She does not do this at her father's place. She does not do this with her friends, or anyone but me. She talks about the frustration she feels with her friends and family including her dad.  She is the most loving and caring child most of the time, but if I look at her wrong or say anything she takes offense and she shows a state of anger that alarms me.    I've tried talking to her tell her how she is treating me is wrong and that she is actually being a bully, but she turns it around on me that I'm always blaming her and that I take no responsibility for my actions.   What can I do? I need help. "
1392,Toddler is ignored by other person/child. Should I let her learn the lesson or should I step in and entertain her?,"I have a 2-year-old toddler who is happy going and social.  Our maid's 10 year old son came with her and sat in the drawing room. Toddler was playing nearby. I told her to say hello to the boy and play with him. She agreed happily after being told the same a second time.  She started pointing to him and saying ""Bhaiya"" (referred to a male elder to you but younger than your father), repeatedly. He didn't respond.    She kept on showing him her toys. He didn't respond. She wanted him to come over the other room to show (introduce) him to me. So, she repeatedly said ""Bhaiya come"" to him, and kept on running back and forth to him to see if he's coming or not. He didn't respond.  I was observing all this from the other room.  On seeing the plight of my daughter, I jumped in the scene and started talking to her and paying attention to her so that she wouldn't feel ignored. I told her to pick up certain toy and show it to the boy which she did. Boy responded by just holding the toy. I kept on continuously responding to the toddler so that she didn't feel that she was talking to walls.  The daughter started crying when the boy left. The boy is a villager and was shy. He is not to be blamed.  My question here is that in such situations should I:   pretend to be deaf and blind and let the toddler learn the lesson that everyone may not be friendly towards her even if she is towards them?   or   jump in the situation to heal the toddler's hurt feelings?     Clarification:  I am not very keen on knowing how to deal with that boy or how to start a communication with that boy and my child.  Reason is that that boy was just one case. There can be cases where the person with whom my toddler wants to interact may not be interested in interacting either because they are tired or they are busy or they are not interested or shy or uncomfortable or whatever.  Her father is usually busy in scrolling Twitter. He doesn't respond before the child yells at him minimum 4 times. Even when he responds, he says ""Haaan"" and continues scrolling Twitter.  Creating an interest in the other person is not my problem, I think.  I need to know how to deal with my child, not with the other person. "
1393,My 4-year-old refers to himself as me,"Literally.  Sometimes he will ascribe himself properties I have, and make me the child--he'll say ""I'm a grown-up"", ""You can't sit in the front seat [in our car], it's not safe, I have to sit in the front seat, you have to sit in the back seat.""   ""This is my office.  Sorry you can't come in I have work to do.""  That's cute perhaps but other times he will say ""My name is [Eric's Dad]"".  Last night, he told me that his name was [Eric's Dad] and that he had a four-year-old baby named Eric, who was crying.  Eric himself had been earlier.  So he is in some way projecting himself onto me.  Is this indicative of any kind of dissociative issues?  Or is it just 'cute'? "
1394,How do you handle grandparents who spoil your children?,"Our parents suddenly don't apply their rules in our upbringing to our children. On the contrary.   How should we deal with this? Do we just let it be, or should we discuss the matter. I understand that a grandma role is different from a parent, but still it could undermine our authority or not? "
1395,How to respond if my child is picked on by other children?,"What can I do if other children pick on my children? Obviously I can't perform any disciplinary actions. Reprimanding might make my child look like a ""mama's boy"" and doing nothing might look like a betrayal of trust to my children. Additionally any of these possible actions might lead to full blown mobbing in the future.  What can be done in such difficult situations? "
1396,"How to help a 13-year-old, who has no motivation to learn and shows signs of Asperger's, to succeed at school?","My friend's 13-year-old child is suspected of having Asperger's syndrome. He shows lots of signs of it, but doctors aren't sure. They say he's rebelious or has ADHD. He doesn't take changes well. For example, if you disappoint him by changing the time of a meeting or do something else than he expected, he'll make a fuss. He has very narrow interests and doesn't get that he hurts people by being abusive - it's their fault, e. g. he can be such to a disabled person. His mother has MS, by the way, he doesn't seem to catch this, for him she's healthy.  He really does badly at school, he has a huge backlog in learning, especially in math and languages. Average teenagers can be lazy but they can manage ""around"" their laziness somehow and have decent grades. As a poor student, he doesn't make any effort on his side to change it. He doesn't seem to be motivated to learn at school. He says that learning doesn't make sense. If he did, he would be at least average.  When one does his homework with him, he often gets distracted, furious, hysterical or even wants to make you do his homework for him. Spending time on TV is making things worse. He also doesn't believe he can succeed, it's hard to convince him that he's smart (but he is). It sometimes seems he doesn't comprehend any of the subjects we go through, he sometimes doesn't get the question. It feels more like he doesn't want to, because it doesn't make any point to learn.   It's strange that one day he does well and the other day he does really bad doing his homework. Same with grades at school - he sometimes does well and sometimes badly. Some people (e.g. his psychologist) say that he's manipulative. He may play a role of helpless but in fact he doesn't want make any effort because learning bores him.  He is a bit addicted to the internet and TV. He watches silly movies on youtube and from there possibly he took an unrealistic view on life. For example, that it doesn't require hard work, because on youtube he can't see all the boring preparations to do an awesome trick. The kid knows car mechanics very well, but doesn't get fraction and math overall.   Is there a way to help him go through school? It gets really bad, I have no idea how to get him out of this. How to make him believe that learning makes sense, while everyone tried most of the standard arguments on him, from money to ""being able dreams come true""? "
1397,"Why does my 2.5 son not sleep at all when he's with me, but sleeps all night with his father? (We're divorced)","I have a 34 month-old boy. His father and I have been separated for a year, and my son lives half the time with his father and half the time with me and my partner, with whom I'm expecting another baby. We are regularizing our situation through advocates and we've already had our ""precautionary measures"", which state that the mother gets to see the kid two days, then the father two days, then the mother five days, and the father five days, and then we start over with two days, etc.  The thing is my son hasn't been sleeping well (at all?) for about 10 months. When the kid stays with his father, he tells me he sleeps all night. When he stays with my mother, they tell me he also sleeps all night. But when he stays with me, he doesn't sleep. It takes about 45 minutes every night for him to fall asleep, and I need to lie with him so that he can fall asleep. He (unconsciously) moves, he flinches, he kicks, and it looks like he wants to fall asleep but can't.  He goes to bed everyday at 8 or 9, and at 1 o'clock he wakes up and comes to my bedroom saying he wants to sleep in my bed. I return him to his bed, stay until he falls asleep, and at 2 he comes again. And so on, for about 4-5 times each night. And most of those times it takes him from 30 minutes to 1 hour to fall asleep again, because he can't stop moving.  When he's with me, it's all the time mama this, mama that, mama come here. My mother says the issue is he wants to spend more time with me when we're together, and that he wakes up repetitively to check I'm there. When I return him to his father, he cries and cries, saying he doesn't want to go, although I know that he's ok when he's with him.  How can I help my son with this? I've tried everything. I've put him in my bed but he just moves and moves until he falls asleep and then keeps waking up a thousand times during the night. He says he hates sleeping, and he's anxious to wake up when it's light outside. Is he just a nervous child and has a hard time falling asleep? Or is there a deeper psychological issue? I am quite sure if he were with me all the time, he would sleep all night, but of course I can't do that. I no longer know what to do so that we all can have some rest. "
1398,Is Fatherhood natural among humans?,"I read in a book and have heard this argument by many social scientists that Fatherhood was an invention by humans during the time when we first started living as societies. This was presumably in order to strengthen the grip of males on human society and provide patriarchy a stable foundation.  I do not seem to agree with this. As a male aged 15 I have strong urges to become a father and really love children. If fatherhood is unnatural and not a product of our evolution how is it possible that males have an urge to father children and feel a strong, genuine love for their offspring?  The argument that Fatherhood is rarely found in the animal world as it is primarily the mother who rares and cares for children is valid, but then again human beings are so much different in other respects from animals, too.  Is it then not possible that the love a human father feels for his offspring is just as natural as the love a human mother feels for her offspring?  Here is one research I found: Origins of Fatherhood  (Note: I asked this question in the philosophy section but got no encouraging response; so I am re-posting it here.) "
1399,How do you cope in the first few months?,"How do you cope with the sleeplessness, the stress, the fear in the first few months?  Our baby just came home yesterday. He was five weeks premature, so he was in the NICU for two weeks. The stress of doing things ""right"" is overwhelming. I've taken time off work to help my wife, but after two weeks I'll be back at work during the day, and I worry so much for my wife's forbearance too.  How did you cope in the first few months? ""This, too, shall pass""? Or something more? "
1400,The human moments - the bigger picture,"Not a specific situation, but how do you help your child with the moments in which either 1. You've made a mistake, or        2. Someone else in their life has, that affects them. Again, not about the specifics, but as a few examples of those moments  -when you've lost your temper and regret something you've said or done -when another significant person in their life has  -when relationships end (not romantic per se - when friendships change)   How do you apologize without rehashing? How do you help children understand that things change in ways bigger than they can understand?   I realize this is a fairly vague question, but life keeps going and we keep being human long after children. This is what no books seem to address. "
1401,4 year old being hit in school,"For the last few days my four year old daughter has been coming home and telling me that she has been hit, and hurt, at school by a couple of boys.   We don't hit in our house and she has no siblings or close family to squabble with so this is all very new to her - she has been telling the teacher but nobody from the school has said anything to me about it.   I'm pulling her teacher to one side in the morning to talk about it with her but I'm so annoyed with it that I'm so tempted to just tell her to fight back, however, she is known at school as being a very sensitive and caring little girl and she always looks to see the best in people so I obviously don't want to change her outlook and encourage her to do something that she knows is wrong.  So I've been wondering, what do you tell your kids to do when they get hit? Have any of them been hit in school and how have they dealt with it? What was the fallout with other parents? How would you handle this? "
1402,Me too! My two year old daughter want to drink and eat everything I do!,"I have a lovely 28 month old daughter who talks and walks very well for her age. Currently she is in the phase that she wants to have everything I or my wife grabs out of the fridge or storage. If I grab water, she wants water, if I grab a coke, she wants it too. I do not believe at that time she is actually thirsty but just wants it ""because"".  How should I deal with this behavior? Should I discourage it by simply stating that she wants it because I have it? Should I ignore her? Should I give her simply the same as I have at that moment? "
1403,Helping a preschooler be a good friend,"My almost-four year old boy has been expressing concerns recently that some of his close friends don't want to be his friend any more.  While I'm aware this sort of drama is perpetual in childhood, I think he has some specific concerns that we need to help him address.  1. Being Pushy  He's a very pushy child.  I don't think most children his age have a fully developed sense of empathy1, and most are still fundamentally selfish, but he's definitely more pushy than most other children his age.  He tells other children how to play, and complains when they're not doing it right.  He wants to play with a certain toy and gets very mad when someone else is playing with it.  Occasionally he'll grab toys from others, although we've mostly worked that out (or age has).  There are a few other children who are probably innately as pushy as my son, except for one thing: he's quite big.  He's 42"" or maybe a bit taller now, which puts him for a 4 year old in the 95th percentile.  This means that he's physically able to dominate the other children around him that are his age, and it also seems to give him the confidence to do so.  If he wants to take a toy he can do it.  He's faster than most of them, he's stronger than most of them. 2  2. Being selfish  In addition to being pushy, he's definitely still quite selfish.  We set up a playdate the other day, and he liked the idea, but he also said that he didn't want [friend] to play with his trains.  (He has maybe a hundred wooden trains.)  I tried to talk about it more, and he just didn't seem to get that his friend would want to play with trains and it would be rude not to let him.  I tried my usual tactic - asking how he'd feel if he was at his friend's house and couldn't play with any of his toys - but it didn't seem to get through.  When the playdate did occur, the friend basically parallel played with my 2 year old's toys (who was at daycare).  The Question  All of this adds up to the fact that the selfishness and pushiness means he doesn't completely understand why his playmates don't want to be friends with him.  He's noticeably sad about it - enough so to tell me, out of the blue, that he was sad about it - but he doesn't really get how to fix it.  How can I help him fix it?  What can I do to help him understand what he needs to do to be a better friend?      1As a side note, this is the same preschooler from this question, and we've worked on it some in manners similar to what @anongoodnurse suggests.  That's seemed to help, so it's possible more of that is what's needed.  2 Playing with older children seems to change this dynamic dramatically, which is part of why I think his size matters (though it's not the only difference, of course).  He plays very well at the park when he finds a random five-to-six year old (in particular, a girl) to play with, and will clearly limit his pushiness and usually follow the child around to some extent.  Some of this could well be emotional maturity - either the ability to cope with pushiness, or the knowledge  of how to overcome it. "
1404,How do you moderate a teenager's obsessive or excessive behavior?,"We're not dealing with teenagers yet but I would really like to avoid this kind of outburst.  How have parents with teenagers been able to find/establish a balance for their children to not be so dependent and obsessive about something you think takes up too much of their time (e.g. Internet, video games, reading - yes, my cousin loved to read so much he refused to sleep)? I'd like to know what is more effective, rolling with the punches or establishing ""ground-rules"" before teenage years? Sometimes I think if the rules are too much, it's more reason for them to rebel. "
1405,Is punishment necessary?,"I'm a young parent, and still have a lot to learn, but I have been wondering a lot about whether punishment needs to be a part of parenting. Maybe I'm being too optimistic here, but are there any cultures where child punishment is not widespread? Have any parents tried 'no-punishment' with any degree of success/failure?  I feel that a downside of using punishment as a way to encourage a behavior is that they may find it harder to grasp the real reason that that behavior is deemed 'good'.  What actions do you feel require punishment? Will I become afraid of the uncertainty/effectiveness of reinforcing reasonable (logical or emotional) explanations, while knowing that punishment is a tried and true method for deterrence or rehabilitation, and ultimately resort to it? "
1406,15 months old toddler reacts strongly to cough,"I have a fifteen-months-old nephew who reacts strongly when people around him cough or make unwanted loud noises (i.e. sneeze). His reaction is often staring at the whoever made the noise, screaming protesting and crying, even if his mother does that.  Should we be worried about his mental health? or is there anything special we should do to prevent future problems? "
1407,Is an expensive stroller worth it?,"Strollers seem to come in all ranges of prices. From [tex]1000 (sorry for the US-centrism, but I'd guess it is the same in other places).  Given that this will probably be something that we use all the time for the next few years (or more, depending on how many babies come), I'd be willing to spend a lot of money, but I'm afraid of just being taken advantage of if I buy a product that is just as good, at double the price.  Is it worth it to get an expensive stroller like, for example, the Bugaboo Frog (starting at $600)? Or is a mid-range or even a cheaper one just as durable and easy to use? "
1408,How to help parents cope with me moving out,"Let me preface by saying I'm not entirely sure if I'm asking this in the right place and I'm very emotional right now, I apologize if my post is in disarray or if this question is not within scope of this site - I hope you will all understand.  I am 22 years old, I graduated from college 5 months ago, and I'm currently working. For several months, I've been planning with my twin sister and several of my friends to move out and live in a rented house. We recently got approved for a house and signed the contract so my sister and I broke the news to our parents. My dad has been silent but my mom is incredibly upset, and I'm afraid we're permanently damaging our relationship with her.  To give further background, I am first generation Asian-American. No one in my extended family has ever moved out of the house. All my cousins live at home - even if they go to college away from home, they'll move back in immediately and won't leave until they get married; I have two uncles who still live with my grandmother. So, one of my mom's main grievances is that I don't care about my family anymore and that I value my friends over my family. She also thinks our living arrangement will be awful because there's going to be 5 girls in one house and we're gonna ruin our relationship with our friends.  Her second grievance is that she thinks I'm ruining my financial standings by moving out. I make roughly [tex]17K in savings. I do not have a car right now and I will need to buy one when I move out. The rent I'll be paying will be $100 more than what I'm paying my parents right now. She thinks that I am making a mistake by not staying at home and saving money, which to be fair, yes, I understand that it would be technically cheaper to live at home especially since I'm lucky enough that my parents feed me, do my laundry, and pay for utilities.  My motives for moving out seem very Western, but I just want to be independent and not treated like a child. I still have curfews and all my actions at home are scrutinized and monitored, and I just feel like I can't be my true self while living at home. I don't hate my family and I have no intentions of abandoning them; I'm not moving that far away from home and still want a relationship with my parents after moving out. I know that I'll have to grow up by managing my finances carefully, cook for myself, take care of myself etc etc.  I guess my question is how can I communicate to my parents my motives and help them cope with the idea of me moving out? Considering my background, is it really so wrong for me to want to move out? Am I really not in a situation to be moving out? Am I really such a terrible daughter for wanting to move out? I'm sorry, I'm just so terribly upset - I technically wasn't the one who broke the news to my parents but my sister; I was taking a nap and had awoken when I heard my mom scream at the top of her lungs that she would kill herself and I'm worried that my decisions are hurting her and that I'm an awful person for doing this. "
1409,Teacher called my sons statement racist,"My son is in class with 2 people named Matt. He was trying to get one of the Matt's attention. They both were talking to my son. The conversation likely could be paraphrased like this:     Matts: Which one of us are you trying to talk to?      My Son: The brown one.   His teacher overheard that and gave him a small speech about how he was being racist and he should not talk like that. The specifics would be lost via second hand information. This happened a few days ago and there was no note in the agenda that talked about this (which is normally where I would find correspondence from the teacher).   My information does comes second hand from my 9 year old son however I am confident that he is telling the truth.   While his statement is less that tactful I believe it to be a correct observation. I recall reading something a long time ago that talked about how children are colour-blind in that they see other children and not other children of different heritage etc.   My question is kind of 2 part.    Could my sons statement be seen as rasicm or racist? I do not think talking about skin colour is inherently racist. .  Assuming my assertion is true I should say something to the teacher because while I can educate my son, mostly on tact, I do not think called his statement racist is teaching him correctly. What should I say to the teacher? My son could have twisted the words.   I do not think this is something I want to let go as it could give my son the wrong impression of how to deal with other people. It is not a question of it being rude or inappropriate as it definitely was. I think is it a question of if it was racist.  "
1410,How do you handle a child who enjoys getting others into trouble?,"How do you deal with a primary-school age child (range 5-7) who enjoys getting others into trouble? Is actually alert for minor wrongdoings and likes to set other people against each other? Can be other children, siblings, and even adults.  It's a distressing to observe because    it's despised by society in general - English has many derogatory words for this such as ""snitch"", ""sneak"", ""stirrer"", ""troublemaker"" and because you fear it's indicative of low self-esteem, as in the child needing to feel big and important through this mechanism.   Any advice?  "
1411,Is there any research on the effects of PG cartoon violence on small children?,"Our son is now at the age where we let him watch a moderate amount of children's videos to entertain himself -- all firmly G rated stuff.  I have also been allowing him to watch some recent animated features such as Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs (PG) and Megamind (PG) and the Incredibles (PG), with mild levels of cartoon / action violence.  I also rented some classic ""Looney Tunes"" and ""Tom and Jerry"" cartoons, remembering how much I enjoyed them as a child. But after auditioning a few, I was kind of shocked how much actual, real cartoon violence they contain, and I quickly backed off those. You see where Groening got his inspiration for the Itchy and Scratchy parody from, it's shocking how violent old cartoons really are!    However, even at the MPAA PG level, I am worried that I might be exposing my son to too much cartoon violence, and I am concerned what effects it might have.  Should I be concerned? Is there any research documenting the effect on children in the 2-4 year age range of watching a moderate amount of G-rated children's videos versus a moderate amount of PG-rated children's videos?   (Note that I am not asking for the effect of no video, just how risky is it, per any published research on the matter, to deviate from moderate amounts of children's videos at G versus PG) "
1412,What kind of bottle can I use to make a heavy duty sensory calm down bottle?,"My boy is on the spectrum, he needs a sensory calm down bottle/jar. I have tried a ready made one but he broke that in no time as he loves to bash it on the floor in order for the glitter to mix.  I have tried regular water bottles but he loves to open the lid and pour the water on the floor, also the plastic breaks easily.  Any idea if there is a heavy duty see-through bottles that I can use for similar conditions?   "
1413,Is there a maximum temperature for mixing formula?,"Standard formula advice tends to say something like:        Fill the kettle with at least 1 litre of fresh tap water (don’t use water that has been boiled before).   Boil the water. Then leave the water to cool for no more than 30 minutes, so that it remains at a temperature of at least 70C.    ...      (Source: NHS)  I am aware that you need to put the formula powder into the water when it is at least 70C so that any bacteria in the formula will be killed.  But is there a maximum temperature?  Is it OK to mix the formula immediately after the kettle has boiled?  Should I wait until the temperature has dropped below 90C?  80C?  I've failed to find any advice about this.  (Also, why is it 1 litre when I'm only making 200ml of formula?) "
1414,Using experience as a reason for correctness,"Although I haven't used the ""because I'm older"" or ""because I'm your dad"" argument before with a child who questions my reasons, I know many adults who do.  Is this harmful in any way?  I have taught my children that age is never a reason why somebody is correct, and people need to be able to back up their arguments.  I have studied some psychology, and have read about the Milgram Experiment and I'm scared that my kids will develop this kind of blind obedience to authority figures.  TLDR Is age or experience an acceptable ""argument winner""? "
1415,What to do when neighbor calls the cops claiming abuse?,"My child recently started school at the age of 3 and has had a rough transition. She has started acting out and throwing a lot of tantrums.  The other day as we were getting out of our car at home she started crying and flailing. As I was carrying her home from the car, I walked past a neighbor. I smiled at her and said pleasantries. Shortly afterward my wife was going out and the neighbor told her that she called the cops because she suspected abuse. My wife asked why and she said it was because my child was crying a lot.  Of course the parents among us know how ridiculous it is to suspect abuse simply because a child is crying. But ridiculous or not, the neighbor had in fact called the cops and the neighbor's attitude suggested that she'd continue to call them as she saw my child crying. The cops didn't do anything but I worry that if they receive multiple reports, these reports will go in a file that could be used against us later.  Do the neighbor's misguided reports pose a credible threat? What consequences could there be? And is there anything we can do to protect ourselves against them? "
1416,How do you reduce feelings of guilt for leaving children for a date night?,"We have two children, 3.5 and 1 years old.  My wife and I rarely go out on our own, I can count on one hand since the oldest was born.  We have never left them alone all night, they have always woken up to at least one of us in the morning.  We have the opportunity for great responsible and well trusted child care, both family and close friends.  They in fact ask to baby sit, and we usually say no thanks.  My wife and I are not the type of people that need regular date nights, we are closer than ever right now.  We certainly don't need or even want a weekly or monthly date.  But it would be nice to do it a little more often, more than about once a year.  We just can't get past the feeling of guilt to leave them.  We are talking about a weekend away, but we just can't pull the trigger.    How do other parents deal with this struggle?  Any suggestions? "
1417,Superlight equipment to carry an almost 4y old pre-schooler during a hike,"I am planning a hike with the kids, but the youngest one (almost 4 years old) may become too tired at some point and may need to be carried for a while. It is unlikely that this will be needed, so we are looking for a superlight option, which might not be super comfortable for long stretches, but is good enough for a mountain trail. Moreover this hike is planned for only one day of a longer trip.  Usually we used a rucksack carrier, but is is way too bulky for this case. Are soft carriers comfortable enough for kids this age? Are there even lighter options, like dedicated superlight carriers or using a sling?  Note that we are not planning for our kid to sleep in the carrier. "
1418,How to deal with homework/studies frustration?,"Our kid has been going through some fallback in school scores recently, and as a result, I've been monitoring and helping him to do his homework.  Usually, everything goes smoothly, but sometimes, when he faces an exercise he doesn't understand at first, he gets terribly frustrated and tries to evade doing it as much as possible, even if I try to help, constantly arguing that ""it's too difficult"", or even that I'm wrong (he is also in the mood of thinking he knows everything and his parents don't know a thing, so maybe it might hurt him when he is proven otherwise?).  I've considered the possibility that he would be just trying to ""play me"" to stop doing his homework, but I'm not fully convinced. It really seems to me that once he gets frustrated, he gets into a blocked state and all that remains is to be stubborn and drop the homework.  What would be the best approach to go in such a situation?  Thanks in advance  EDIT: he is 13yo. He changed schools about 1 year ago, and yes, homework has been getting harder proggresively throughout the year, but this has been ongoing and pretty consistent. Talking by heart... maybe once every week.  EDIT May 8th: Thanks all for the answers. I really do appreciate all of them. I will take very good note of them, and try to applying in the best way possible to overcome this challenge. "
1419,Limited Access to My Child (Separated Parent UK/EU),"We married in May 2014 in London where we lived at that time. In November 2014 our son was born there. 18 months later (in April 2016) we split.   My ex moved out within London initially. Then in June 2016 she left the country with my son. She used a written permission I gave her before we split. Originally she continued to work from abroad (EU) commuting each month to London. During this time my son stayed abroad. She explained that this arrangement makes it easier for her to take care of our son due to the presence of her extended family. She also wanted to stay close to her mum as she has been battling cancer. Originally I had sympathy and understanding for this arrangement and did not object to it even though the written permission I gave her expired in October 2016.   However, it became increasingly difficult to have a contact with my son. My ex would cancel arrangements on a short notice. She would also make it difficult for my son to visit my family. It went like this for more than a year. What can I do in this case? I have, basically, no idea as I wasn't expecting that it will come to this. I just googled a bit and it seems there is thing called CAFCASS. Is this the route to go? What would be your advice?  I basically would like to be able to see my son for at least a few days every 3 months. I also would like to alternate the holidays (Christmas, Easter, New Year Eve, his Birthday) between me and my ex (e.g. one year my son spends Christmas with her family, one with mine). My ex says that she may agree to the visits every 3 months (although so far she often changed her mind on a short notice so I can't trust her word on this) but she would not agree to alternate the holidays. Can I do something about it? By the way, my ex has British and other EU nationality - same like my son. "
1420,Child suddenly saying things like I'm not his friend,"In the last few days my 3yr has suddenly started saying things like ""Your not my friend Daddy"" and ""Your naughty"" and ""I'm telling on you Daddy"".  At the moment it's not necessarily nasty and he soon forgets he even said it after a bit of distraction etc  However we have never said these things to him and I'm wondering if he picked them up from day care or if it's just a natural progression of language and communication?  If it's picked up from day care, it just got me worried as it means other kids are saying things like ""I'm not your friend"" to him which I worry could be hurtful to him?  Or it could just be natural playground interaction.  I'm not sure. "
1421,What is the appropriate age to tell my daughter that her biological father doesn't want to be a part of her life?,"I had a beautiful daughter with my very first boyfriend at the age of 16. He was 18 at the time and he was very careless about the whole situation. He was a high school dropout, selling and using drugs at the time as well. For that reason, my mother forced me to end my romantic relationship with him before our daughter was born. Surprisingly to my mother, I was not reluctant at all. I understood that he was not fit to run a family or a household and I wanted something better for my daughter and I.  He was very upset about my decision. His reaction didn't bother me. I was determined to finish high school and go to college to give my daughter the future that she deserved. My mother was my greatest support. One month after our daughter was born, my stepfather got a promotion at his job and we all had to move to another city 3 hours away.   Within my daughter's first few months of life, I was informed that her father got arrested for selling drugs and was going to be in jail for a few years. Fast forward 3 years, he gets released from prison. Within those few years, I have already graduated high school, attending college, married with someone else and about 4 months pregnant with my second child. I found out about my daughter's father's release from a mutual friend about a month after he had been released. He hadn't tried to see his daughter in a whole month. I brushed that thought off and I spoke to my husband about it and we decided that I should take the first step and contact him. I asked around for his phone number and I called him to try and see if he was ready to see his daughter and begin a relationship with her... that didn't go well.  He became very upset at the news of my marriage and new baby on the way. He said that I had replaced him with someone else to raise our daughter, I assured him that I was not trying to replace him as her father. He said, ""It's too late, you already gave her a dad and who am I to stand in the way? You all are a happy family."" I kept insisting that she needed him in her life but he just kept turning himself into the victim somehow. He walked away from his responsibilities, just like that.  As my daughter got older, my husband made sure that she never felt ""fatherless"". He made no difference between our own children and her. She stopped calling him by his name and began calling him ""daddy"" when our son began to speak and call him daddy. It was like a natural thing. He was the father that she knew and he demonstrated love to her everyday. Over the years, I never stopped contacting her biological father. Maybe about every 6 months or so. I was voluntarily sending him fotos and updates, asking if he would like to see her and not receiving any type of response except maybe ""I'm too busy these days."" Sometimes I could actually talk him into visiting her, especially if we were in town... conveniently enough for him, he would accept to see her. She has probably seen her biological father about a handful of times in her entire life. She is twelve years old.  My husband and I never hid the fact from her that he was not her biological father. In a way that a child could understand, we explained it to her and she always knew. We also never spoke ill of her biological father to her, never. When she asked where he was, we told her that he was ""working a lot and living very far away.. and that when he had the chance to visit her, he would."" We told her that he loved her very much and she believed it.  Fast forward to when my daughter was about 10 years old with a 7 year old brother and a 4 year old sister, my husband and I got divorced. He was a wonderful father to all 3 of my children, but a horribly unfaithful husband. I grew tired of his multiple affairs over the years. I decided that enough was enough and I couldn't forgive him any longer because it was just eating away at me and making me miserable.  We have been divorced for two years now and he has just been the best co-parent a person could ask for. He is and always has been a wonderful dad. I have just remarried but this has in no way changed the kind of dad that he is to the kids. We made a child support arrangement without the court/legal system involved. He pays consistently and always on time. We made visitation arrangements on our own as well, that we are both happy with. By the way, this all involves my first born. He willingly pays me child support for her and he takes her too. There was never a question about it. He says, ""She is my daughter and she always will be. I raised her and I love her with all my heart. She was my first baby."" My new husband and him get along well. My new husband tells me that he really respects my ex husband as a father because only a real man would do what he does for my first born. The kids watch the way all of us treat eachother and they see that we all respect eachother. That makes them happy because they just love us all, even my new husband. They approved of him on the very first day that they met him and they let me know it.Haha!   This is what I hate... Just a couple of days ago my oldest came to me and randomly asked me if I have heard from her biological father lately. I responded, ""No I haven't, but he has probably been busy with work."" Then she asked me send him a picture of her in her cheer uniform (because she recently became a cheerleader at school). I said ok and she literally watched as I sent it. Hours later she asked if he had responded anything and I said he hasn't. Note, he never responds to anything I send him of her, but she doesn't know that. So she asked me to send him a text to make sure it is still the correct number for him, so i did. Hours later he responded ""Yes this is still my number."" My daughter's face just dropped when she saw that he had not given a response to the photograph of her. She said, ""That's it??"" I told her that maybe he was driving or doing something that didn't allow him to text more than he wanted to. She didn't look too convinced but she let it go.   I was so angry that my daughter felt ""looked over"" just because that idiot couldn't even say something as small as ""Wow she is beautiful"" or ""She is growing so fast"" or even ""Good luck with cheerleading"" SOMETHING! I started to text him back asking him what it is that he wants me to tell his daughter when she asks about him... the photo attached is his response to that question.  Now, my question is when will it be appropriate to show these messages to my daughter? Because I have more messages from him that I have printed out years ago where he is saying that he simply doesn't want to try to be her father... etc. he basically passes the baton over to my ex-husband in these messages. I saved them because I thought that one day I'd have to tell her the truth about her biological father's lack of interest in being a part of her life. I also thought that it would be proof enough to show her that I have tried very hard to include him. In case he ever tries to tell her some fake story about me secretly pushing him away behind her back etc. Would it do her more harm than good to show her these heartless things that he has written in regards to her? Should I maybe just tell her about it right now since she is only 12 years old? Show her the messages later? Should I wait longer to even say anything to her about the person that he really is? I don't know if is the right time yet. If it is, I wouldn't  know what to say. I wouldn't want to say too much. If I do say any of it to her, I am afraid of what it will do to her. Please help! "
1422,19 month old emitting short bursts of high-pitched screaming when frustrated,"I know there are a lot of posts on here about screaming but I feel like my situation may be different. Feel free to mark this as a duplicate post if not...  My wife, my mother-in-law, my 19 month old son, and I are on a vacation.  This has obviously been a difficult adjustment for our son and we've tried to make it as close to our routine as possible including:   Bringing lots of familiar toys. Trying to have him nap/sleep at the same time as home (despite being in a different time zone).   eating similar foods that we know our son likes.   Despite that, he seems to have recently picked up a habit of high-pitched screaming when he doesn't get something he wants. I don't recall him doing this before our vacation.  An example would be a tendency to ""run wild"" in public areas (e.g. aquariums, ice cream shops, bookstores, pools, malls, plane flights,  etc).  I realize that he's a kid and needs some measure of safe independence but eventually we need to ""wrangle"" him in and continue with whatever we're trying to do (continue visiting other parts of the aquarium, stay in the safe kiddie pool area, wait in line behind other folks at a store, etc).  When that happens, he tends to unleash a ridiculously high-pitched scream. Sometime it's multiple short bursts. Other times its lengthy.  During these episodes, he's clearly frustrated and admittedly, I'm not at my own personal best -- I usually feel mortified and immediately aware of the inconvenience (or perceived inconvenience) this may be causing others. I realize that's not the best perspective and am trying to work on that. I wish I could just shut the world out and deal with my son one-on-one.  In terms of addressing our son, I've tried a variety of things including:   time outs if a quiet area is available. offering hugs and trying to comfort. trying to distract with something else. trying to give advanced notice if something is changing ""OK david, in 5 minutes we're going to be leaving..."" although I doubt he has a concept of time yet.   I'm not sure if anything is really helping to prevent future episodes so I can't tell if what I'm doing is making things worse.   Since he's 19 months old, he only knows a handful of words and can't really articulate how he's feeling through spoken word. I understand that's part of why he's screaming -- he's frustrated and trying to communicate during a tantrum.  Is this making any sense? Is there anything I can do? I'm honestly and sincerely dreading the 4.5 hour flight back home next week and feel like everything I'm doing now is just making things worse. :-( "
1423,Are prenatal ultrasounds safe?,"I recently expressed concern to my midwife about the use of prenatal ultrasounds. She scoffed at the idea that they could do harm and proceeded to use a Doppler device to monitor our baby's heart rate.  After which, we did a bit of digging and found some resources that cast doubt on the idea the ultrasounds are safe and that the use is justifiable.  Would you be able to read the following articles and provide comments as to the validity of the statements? Any additional comments or resources are very much appreciated.

So I assume that once they're in highschool, I won't have a choice anymore.  My question has two parts:  How long should I wait before I stop limiting or preventing access to caffeine?

What approaches are most effective in teaching safety and marksmanship to young firearms users? "
1428,How to teach children the difference between pets and vermin?,"My 16 month old daughter just witnessed her grandmother chasing and proceeding to bash a mouse to death. My daughter was within 4 feet of the death site. She was pretty shocked and asked to pacify after. She didn't cry but she was a little upset. I told her that ""mice are very dirty"". She has helped me find and kill flies and mosquitoes around the house before.   She is very fond of animals. I want her to be compassionate to animals but how do I make sure she isn't in an episode of Hoarders later on because she can't find it in her heart to remove mice from her home? This is along the lines of a previous question asked: How Do I Teach My Toddler Not To Abuse Animals but how do you make the distinction between compassion and cleanliness? How do you teach the difference between pets and vermin?  Edit: We don't have pets. Our relatives don't have pets either. She has been to homes and even spent the night at homes that have pets though.  Edit#2: We were watching Hickory Dickory Dock on YouTube and when the mouse ran down the clock, she was bashing it with the remote... :/ "
1429,What is a positive way to handle a boy who acts like a girl?,"My 3yo regularly plays and acts like a girl. For example, he likes to take his arm out of one sleeve on his shirt and pretend he's a princess. He loves to dress up in his mom and sister's clothes. He asked for a dollhouse for Christmas. He often compares himself to his little sister saying, ""I just want to play with her, because we're the same"". He'll also make comments about how things are pretty and beautiful, and likes pink and flowery things. Even his body movements and facial gestures are very feminine in nature.  He also frequently refers to things as the mommy and babies, both animate and inanimate. For example, if he see's a big and a little animal, he'll refer to the mommy and baby animal. But he'll also refer to a big and little pillow as the mommy and baby pillow.   To be honest, we have no problem with any of this. He's my son, and I love everything about him and the way that he thinks. This behavior may or may not be an indication that he will have homosexual tendencies in the future, but that doesn't matter to me, because I support how he thinks and who he is.   His personality and tendencies are obviously different than what society deems typical or normal. We've tried to maintain a neutral standpoint on everything: not ignoring the situation, but also not discouraging or encouraging one behavior over another.  The question is: what is the best way to handle the situation?  What types of things should we be discussing with him. How should we approach those conversations? Any help from someone who has a similar situation or has worked with childrens' sexual identity issues would be greatly appreciated. "
1430,When should an infant stop sucking on her hands?,"My little girl about 3 months old and she already mouths quite frequently on her hands.

1431,Will treats after a fall promote self-inflicted injuries?,"My daughter had gotten a bump on her head and I read online to ice it and give them a treat while you are icing their head to distract. I didn't do a treat because I didn't want her to think that to get something unique/fun, she had to hurt herself for it. Do you think I'm denying her comfort by not providing a treat? If so, what would be an appropriate treat for an injury? "
1432,Too many car trips with toddler,"My wife and I live several hours away from the rest of our family and they complain that we do not visit often enough and never get to see our 20-month-old son.  He does great on long (3-5 hour) car trips.  We have noticed though that too many of these trips and he begins to freak out when we take him to the car.  We currently try to keep at least 6 weeks in between trips.  Are there any sort of guidelines for-   How many hours a month a toddler should be in a car? How many days with normal daily routines should be in between days with abnormal routines?     After days of reading dozens of articles I am pretty sure this problem is from disrupting his routine too much.  The professionals all seem to agree that toddlers are extremely sensitive to this, and recommend some sort of travel routine to minimize this effect. "

1434,Arguments for/against same birthday for siblings?,"My son is born on October 1st three years ago. My wife is pregnant again and the calculated delivery date is October 22nd. Both children are boys, 3 years apart. We might end in a situation where the delivery is earlier, for reasons irrelevant to this question.   I believe that around their birthdays is the only time in the whole year that the actual date matters. It really does boil down to practical considerations around patience (gifts) and planning. I think that if there is, say, a week or more between the birthdays then it's easy to separate but if the difference is only a very few days then it gets complicated, and that's the situation I'd like to avoid.  I know from friends that having the same birthday makes events easier to plan, from the parents' perspective. It would also remove the unhappiness of a small child saying ""why does he get presents today and I don't."" Being a twin, and married to one, I know that there's nothing problematic in sharing a birthday as long as both get their fair share of attention.    What are practical arguments for, and against, choosing the same birthday for the second child? What considerations apply when the second child's birthday is only a very few days after the elder sibling's?  "
1435,Have I lost my daughter?,"She's currently sixteen and I feel like I have lost her. When she was younger she used to be a sweet, caring and understanding girl, but then she entered middle school and everything changed. She didn't like anymore physical contact (she is disgusted if a member of the family touches her, but she can tolerate her friends' contact), her grades fell down and she would always listen to music to ignore us. It got worse during her second year of ms; she was always thinking, she looked sad and mad and when I'd ask her what was going on, she always said ""nothing"". That's when she seriously started to think about moving to another country when she finishes college (ever since she was a kid, she had said that she doesn't like Argentina and that she would move to USA or Canada, but I didn't think it was for real).  Three years has happened since then and during these last years she started to look happy, and would let me hug her o kiss her... but now she is going through that phase again. Her grades are great now, but the only reason is because she is going to apply for a scholarship so she can move to another province with her friends). I know she doesn't love or like my family, she has always showed discontent with my parents and my siblings and their families. And honestly, I don't think she loves me nor her dad. She only cares about her friends, and she has said that she only loves them. Two months ago we had a fight and I told her to leave the house and she did it but came later to home even though she could stay with her friends. I can remember what she said when we saw each other after the fight: ""you are just giving me more courage to leave you to die alone"". Since she's my only child, her dad and I are divorced and my parents are really old, I know it's true that I will die alone if she cuts me out of her life. The worst part of it is that I know she can do it, I know she has the courage, but I can't do anything to change it. I don't know if she hates me, but I know she has never liked me.  When she was going through that phase 3 years ago, I talked with her dad and both agreed to try to find out what was going on.    Bullying? We talked with her teachers, classmates, friends and boyfriend, and everybody said she has never been bullied. They also said she was normal with them.    Her boyfriend also told us she said she doesn't feel her family as family, that she feels disconnected.  All made sense. She's an only child and doesn't have cousins of her age, so since she was little she laid on her best friends and always said ""family is not your relatives, but those who loves you, supports you and try to understand you"". My relatives has never given to her what she's looking, but her friends does because (and i  quote) they are going through the same.   The day I kicked her out of our house she and my brother had a fight. They have a really tense relationship and always end up fighting, but this one was really big. Both screamed at each other and she was, literally, shaking of anger. Both loses their temper easy, but I didn't want to fight with my brother so I just stayed quiet. That's when appeared the angry tears and she screamed to her uncle ""Who the fuck do you think you're? You are not my father and this is my house, my money, and I can do whatever I want to do here"". It freaked me out and that's when I kicked her. Once she packed her things, took money and slammed the door, I felt terrible. It made me realize she was right that I never stand up for her.  That's what makes me think I have lost her. I gave her a reason to not like me and look for love in people she's not related to, I gave her a reason to just not tell me anything about her life.  Update: she has been visiting a psychologist for the last two months because she has showed symptoms of ocd since a young age. according to her psychologist, it might be a reason of why she started to avoid physical contact.

1436,Encouraging older brother to play with younger brother,"I have two children, 33 months and 14 months old.  They're both tall for their age, very physical types; climbing, running, etc.  They both like to play with vehicles of all sorts, balls, ride on trikes.  That all sounds like a great recipe for kids getting along - except that the older one resists playing with his younger brother, because the younger one isn't able to play 'properly' yet, and just breaks the train tracks, throws toys, etc. - all things you expect a 14 month old to do, really, but not something a 33 month old can handle.  We still want them to play together, though, and are trying to think of ways to help them play together at this age such that they can both enjoy it.  Sometimes reading books together works, although the younger one resists that some - he wants reading time to be him-only, as older brother will otherwise take over.  Playing at the park ends up in parallel play, but at least it's nearby.  Other than that, though, in terms of in-the-house stuff there doesn't seem to be much that works.  What strategies can we employ to help older brother cope with the difficulties playing with younger brother can pose?  What kinds of activities might be more successful? "
1437,Can the Phil and Ted Strollers accomodate an infant and toddler at once?,"We have friends who need help finding a stroller that can hold a newborn and a 2-year-old at the same time.     We found the Phil and Ted Navigator, and dot, which seem to have endless setup options with the bassonet add-on, but I cant seems to see any that allow for a newborn to lie flat with a toddler on board (toddler sitting, not on a clip on scooter or the like).    Does anyone know if those models can do that?  If not, are there other ""stacker-style"" ones that can? (They can't use a side-by-side like the bugaboo donkey for some reason). "
1438,At what age or developmental milestones is a child capable of critical thinking?,"I am interested in pursuing a non-authoritarian approach to educating my son and I do not know at what age (or prerequisite milestones) the focus of education should switch from telling him facts to mainly using (guided) research of primary sources and direct experimentation to learn. Ideally, I'd like for him to be able to critically examine a claim and compare it to what he knows or think of ways to falsify it before I focus on this method.  Has research been done on this aspect of development? If so, is their a way to gauge if the complexity is within their grasp? For instance, ""once milestones A, B, and C have been achieved, most children are able to critically examine a five predicate claim"". If this research is not availbe, your experience as educators can provide an estimate. "
1439,"Should I let food be a way out of a ""time out""?","My 16 month old has always been very willful and it is hard to get her to drink a lot of milk that is not from breastfeeding. I have read that ""time out""'s are timed 1 minute per year of age, rounding down so hers is a one minute time out.   Is it okay to offer that if she finishes her milk (or any food for that matter), she can get out of ""time out""? Or should food not be associated with ""time out"" at all so there is no negative association?   *I realize that a minute may not be long enough to finish food and she may just figure out to wait it out. "
1440,Typical frequency of discplinary issues for a 5-year-old?,"My 5-year-old son just started kindergarten a week ago, and has already committed two infractions serious enough for the teacher to bring to our attention:  once throwing a serious tantrum, and once biting and spitting on another child.  Tantrums we are still working on at home.  Biting hasn't been a problem at home for a couple years now, and I've never seen him spit on someone.  Is this normal behavior for adjusting to a completely new social situation?  Is there anything we can do to help him adjust?  If it helps to know his reasons, the tantrum was because he thought he was being punished for talking too much.  Although I have no doubt he has been told off by his teacher for talking, he wasn't being punished.  The thing he thought he was being denied simply wasn't on the schedule that day.  The biting and spitting was because the other child wouldn't stop talking.  We knew that keeping quiet in a classroom setting would be difficult and stressful for him, if you recall from my question last year.  He has gotten marginally better since then, but still needs quite a bit of time for ""release,"" which I've been trying to give him at home.  What else should we try? "
1441,"How important is ""at night time"" as part of a newborn's feeding schedule?","Now that we have conquered jaundice, our doctor has shifted our breast-fed two-week-old daughter's feeding schedule from ""every two hours; wake her; no exceptions"" to ""every two hours; wake her; you can go up to four hours at night time.""  I am not questioning the validity of our doctor's orders. I am confident that there are good reasons to stick with this schedule and wake our daughter accordingly. What I do question is the importance of the 4 hour period specifically occurring at night.  As often as not, our daughter's only session of staying asleep for more than a couple hours is in the afternoon. At night time, she tends toward two hours on the high end, and sometimes wants to cluster-feed (last night, for instance, there was only one between-feedings period over an hour).   The shift towards longer breaks sounds great as it will help my wife to get actual sleep, if-and-when we can take advantage. But those opportunities may be few and far between if they are only allowed at night time.  One option we've considered is to allow up to two anytime 4-hour breaks if our daughter and my wife are both sleeping soundly. Is there a strong reason that these 4-hour breaks should only be at night? What could go wrong from us allowing them during the day?  It seems worth it to let our girl have her days and nights stay mixed up a bit longer if that is what it takes to provide her with a well-rested mother.  Edit: After a day or two, we were lucky enough to see her long sessions of sleep shift to the 8pm to midnight timeframe. That has largely made this a non-issue. In retrospect, I still think that 4 hours during the day would have been fine if that was the only way to provide sleep to my wife  "
1442,What is the smarter way to position 3 carseats on my car?,"My oldest child uses a booster (Maxi-Cosi Rodifix), my middle child uses a carseat (Maxi-Cosi Priori) and once my third child is born he will be in an infant carrier (Maxi-Cosi Mico).  I drive a 2011 Honda Pilot and it does fit all three carseats on one row.  From experience, what ways would you recommend to place their seats?  My first choice was to put my oldest in the middle. She can buckle her seat belt by herself and it would be easier to attach and detatch the infant seat from the side seat. I would buckle my toddler from the other side as well. Or should I use the third row and send my oldest all the way to the back (I never use that third row)?  How safe is it to have a booster on the middle seat?  All ideas welcome! "
1443,Is it possible to give adult milk powder or powder of higher age group to toddlers?,"I wanted my little ones to grow stronger, faster and smarter. So, is it recommended to give toddlers or little ones milk powder of higher age group or adult milk?  e.g. For my kid of age 5, is it recommended to give them milk powder belonging to age group 7 to 10 or even adult milk?  "
1444,What age to teach a child about fairness?,"At what age do you or can you teach a kid about fairness?  I helped my cousin watch after her 17 yr old and 11 yr old.  I had to pick up the 17 yr old from softball practice.  She hinted she wanted to get a tapioca drink so I took her to get one.  I didn't think about getting the 11 yr old a drink (stupid me) and he started having a fit when I went to pick him up from the library and he saw his sister had one but he didn't.  I apologized but he was still crying, stomping, kicking, etc.  I was going to tell him about about life and fairness but since it's not my kid, I didn't think it was appropriate.  This brings me to the next question.  If I have kids one day, when should I teach MY kids about fairness and that it's ok that someone can get something but they might not?  What age would they understand the concept and lesson and not miss the learning moment b/c they were so caught up over what was ""unfair"" "
1445,Can a father use his son's first name as a pseudonym to publish his writing?,"I have a friend. Let's call him John Smith. John Smith has a son. I'll call him Robert Smith. John, their family and Robert's friends all call the child Robert or Robby. No one calls him Rob.  Now, in his free time John writes novels. He wants to publish them under a pseudonym, and the perfect pseudonym he came up with for his writer self is Rob James Ford. (I'm still making up all the names, but the principle of similarity is the same.)  John Smith is a bit worried how his son will feel when he grows up and discovers that his father has ""appropriated"" his own name.  Little Robert is eight years old today and knows quite a few other Roberts, among them one of his best friends, so he is used to the fact that his name is not exclusive to him. But he also knows his father by the name John and that Rob is one possible short form of Robert. When he reaches adolescence and has to find his adult identity -- possibly accompanied by conflicts with his father -- he might feel that his father has been transgressing into what is rightfully his own by using his name for himself. It might feel wrong to Rob Smith that his father calls himself Rob Ford.  What do you think?  Is it unproblematic for John to call himself Rob? After all he does not call himself Rob Smith but uses a different last name with a version of his son's first name, so there is no mistaking Rob James Ford for Rob(ert) Smith. But at the same time Rob is the name of John's son, and they both recognize this.  What should John do?  John found his pseudonym through a painstaking process and has been unable to come up with another pseudonym that feels just as right to him. Giving up Rob as part of his pseudonym would be a pity. "
1446,What is cranial osteopathy?,"Some of our peers have recommended we take our 10 week old daughter to see a Cranial Osteopath, due to some sleeping issues and general crankiness.  I've tried searching the web for an unbiased scientific explanation of the benefits of this therapy, but am finding many quasi-medical shill sites which leave me skeptical.  Is this technique 100% safe for very young babies? What is it, and why how is it supposed to help? "
1447,Returning to work quickly - how does feeding work?,"My partner is looking to return to work soon after giving birth. We both work, so we'll need to find someplace that looks after baby whilst we are out all day. The question we have is how does the feeding work? Do we supply bottles of breast milk to the daycare or do they usually insist upon giving formula? Should my partner continue expressing throughout the day at the office or can she just do that before/after work? It is my understanding that expressing should be happening every few hours, but perhaps this is not correct.  Thanks for any advice.  EDIT: We are in the UK  EDIT: Thanks everyone. "
1448,How do you manage an aggressive child?,"He's 2. He keeps hitting adults for fun. How do I teach him that this is wrong and should not be done? How do I teach the concept of ""this is good, this is bad"" to a 2-year-old? "
1449,Bed time stories for a 6 year old boy,"So I have a 5 year old boy, turning 6 in 2 months. We've been reading Harry Potter as bed time stories, and it has been great. We've gotten to book 5 now and it has started to be more grown up, I think. He doesn't really understand most of it anymore and it's getting pretty dark.  So, we want to find something else to read. This is challenge though, as most searches I make, find ""kids"" stories for that age. I want something where I can read for 30 (or so) minutes every night, on the same story, and he can immerse himself.  So, what are you guys doing? Any recommendations?  We are considering starting with the Narnia books but I have no idea if he's old enough to grasp that (I never read them myself). "
1450,Any dangers associated with learning piano too young?,"I have read:   How do I motivate my 8-year-old to practice the piano regularly? How do you teach a toddler rhythm and melody? How do you determine when to start a child on music lessons without pressuring them?   But I still don't have an answer.  Are there any dangers associated with starting a child to play the piano at too early of an age? My daughter is 6 years old and some friends have told my wife that learning piano before age 7 can cause problems with the child's heart, somehow relating it to finger movement.  I've searched elsewhere and have yet to find any reference of any health-related dangers. Are there any that I simply have not found yet? "
1451,Is it common for a toddler boy to wiggle his fingers in front of his eyes?,"Our three-year-old son has a habit of wiggling his fingers in front of his eyes/face. Is this common for a toddler?   I previously asked whether arranging toy cars in a line or crying when things are not in order is normal, and I gathered that they are both normal and common.   I am wondering whether wiggling fingers in front of eyes is as common. To clarify, I am not asking for a diagnose, as in why my son is doing that, but would be happy just to know if people here have seen their children did the same thing.  "
1452,What is the minimum amount of structure and rules that a child needs?,"My wife and I have very different ways of handling our children (almost 3 and 5 years old). We agree about the rules we want to set, but we are complete opposite when it comes to implementing the rules.   For the last three to four years, I have been fighting to get my wife to implement the rules we agree upon and to be extra careful with implementing the rules myself. This has caused our relationship to be close to a breakdown and it is severely affecting the feelings I have towards my children. I look upon the time I spend with them more as work than as pleasure, because I have to spend so much time trying to get the children to enforce rules. The kinds of rules we are talking about are things like putting on clothes themselves, sitting at the table while eating, eating diversified food, staying in bed after they have been put to bed, not hitting, kicking, biting or throwing things at each other.   I consider my attempt to get my wife to enforce the rules in a similar way to mine as failed. And I believe it to be a high risk of our relationship breaking down if I continue to try this path. I don't believe that a broken relationship will improve the situation in any way, but only reduce our ability to solve the problems. Therefore, I am asking you whether I could just let go of most of the rules and still have children that turn out well. Do they need to sit at the table while eating? Can they fall asleep in front of the telly every night? Can they learn conflict resolution on their own?   They are both in kindergarten now, where they are functioning reasonably well, but they have both had periods where the kindergarten have had to dedicate one employee almost exclusively to the child for a few weeks. This happened with both around the age of 2,5. "
1453,"How do I deal with acute cases of ""stay at home envy""?","Summary:    an older child (in school) is 99% of time OK with the fact that sometimes he gets to go to school on days the younger child stays at home. This includes 100% rational agreement from him that there are good reasons for that. Sometimes (rarely) on those days he would have a major meltdown and refuse to go to school when it's time to leave, specifically because the younger one stays home.   What's a good way to handle such meltdowns?    Details:  We have 2 kids.   Older one is in elementary school. They have only a limited amount of days allowed for absences in school year, all of which we usually use for sick days.   The younger one is in preschool (meaning there's no such restriction).  Moreover, school and preschool do NOT share 100% days off.  In practice, it means that:   When the older kid's school is closed and younger isn't, we keep them both home (for good reason[1]) When older kid's school is open and younger is closed, younger one stays home but older one isn't.   On some of the latter days (not all), the older one has major meltdowns right when it's time to go to school, and refuses to go.  What's a good way to handle such meltdowns?  The meltdowns are extremely impactful, because being late for school costs him tardiness points (that detract from his available off days); AND there are health risks to leaving for school after meltdown for him.    Important notes:   100% of time outside those meltdowns, the older one is 100% in agreement with us that it's correct thing to do. He knows very well all the reasons for it, can recite them back and agrees with them. He never voices any issues until it's time to dress for school on those days. As in, we would have a conversation 1 hour before about it, and he would calmly reconfirm that yes, he knows the younger one will stay home, and he's fully OK with it. He almost never has before-school meltdowns on OTHER days (when they both have to go). I'd say ""younger stays home"" account for ~80% of meltdowns before school. It's not simply about ""we have to separate instead of play together"", because he never has issues when attendance is reversed (he stays home and she goes). He has some sibling rivalry and jealousy issues in general, but they aren't endemic. But he's very receptive to reasoned arguments over what is and isn't fair.     Footnotes:  [1] We get to pay less for preschool for that; AND more importantly it saves whichever parent stays with them ~1-1.5 hours of commute time.. "
1454,"Is it normal that a 2½ year old omits any ""s"" in the start of words?","My son is not quite 3 years old yet. He's doing great in terms of speaking except for one detail: whenever a word begins with an s he will just skip that sound. For instance he consistently says top instead of stop.    When the s is in the middle or at the end of a word, he always says it correctly.   He's being raised bilingual (Danish and German) and can say rather long sentences clearly enough that strangers understand him. Clearly he has no problems with learning to speak in general -- it's just this s that's weird.  Is this common? Is this a symptom of something to address? "
1455,How can I tell if my son is big enough for a car booster seat?,"My son is getting close to 4 years of age.  He's pretty big for his age.  My cousins have some extra booster seats, and we plan on taking some vacations with them next year.  Rather than lugging our own booster seat onto the plane, we were hoping to use their seats when riding in their mini-van.  My son is in the appropriate height range found in this answer, and he is close to the weight range.  Assuming that by the time he is four, he is both within the height and weight ranges listed for booster seats, is that all that is needed to ensure that he'll be okay in my cousins' booster seat?  They asked if I thought I'd need a seatbelt extender, but I'm not sure what that means.  Are they necessary?  If so, when?  How can I tell?  Can I tell if my son fits in the booster seat safely just by looking at him?  I remember seeing a video showing something about the position of the seatbelt relative to his chest, but I can't find the video anymore. "
1456,Are there any health risks in earbuds for pre-teen children?,"Are there any health risks in earbuds?  Assuming moderate use (say, no more than 1-2 hours a day) of music that is not overly loud - e.g. no heavy metal but some classic rock on their MP3 players - is there any health related reason to force children to listen to music from a speaker vs earbuds?  Just to clarify - these are their separate personal earbuds at home; so there's no hygienic concern at all.   Merely physical effect on the ear from the earbud being there; or effect on hearing. "
1457,Delegating godfather responsibilities to atheist brother,"I have two siblings: a younger brother ""Todd"", and an older brother ""Jack"". Todd is a single father of three (realtor; lives in Canada; wife left for Europe and hasn't been in the family's life for 5 years now). Jack still lives in Canada (Toronto) with his wife and two kids, and is a wealthy civil engineer. Jack had a falling out with a lot of the family years back when he started college, since our entire extended family is deeply religious (Catholic, Greek Catholic, etc), and when he ""came out"", most of the family ""disowned"" him (i.e. parents took him out of the will unless he ""repents"", most family members save for a couple in-laws ignore him, etc). Since we're all ""family"", he visits every second Christmas/Easter/Thanksgiving, brings overpriced gifts for Todd's kids and whatever nieces/nephews he gets to see, etc.  I have a big problem: I was the only person around who could accept the role of godfather for Todd's kids, and he's suffering from terminal cancer. I travel between the US and Europe a lot, and don't even own property in Canada. I'm in no position to take on three young children as a surrogate parent.   Jack and his wife told me privately that they would assume responsibility for the children provided:   Half of Todd's assets and (eventual) inheritance from our parents goes into a trust fund for Todd's kids (tuition, down payment for a house later in life, etc). The other half of Todd's ""wealth"" goes into a trust for Jack and his wife to cover additional living expenses for the kids. If the fund is ever exhausted before the kids hit 18, Jack and his wife cover the remaining expenses (toys, clothes, summer camp, etc) out of pocket. If any funds remain at that point, they get deposited into TFSA/RRSP for the kids. Only one dollar is given to Todd's ex in our parents' will, to avoid her having a way to claim she was ""forgotten"". The ""tough"" part: Jack has no intention of raising the kids catholic. He intends to debunk it gradually with the kids, and even insists he'll pay for their private school/college fund out of pocket if it means they go to a secular school to ""break the cycle of sickness"" (he really despises religion).   How can I convince Todd and my parents to delegate rearing Todd's kids to Jack? I imagine Todd and my parents will flat-out refuse the idea. Is it possible to ""send"" the kids to live with Jack and his wife after I've assumed the role of their legal guardian, or is there a ""bad faith"" element there (no pun intended)? I can't take care of these kids, my parents are too frail to watch them, Todd's dying, and no other relatives have stepped up to the task. I don't want these kids winding up in a community home because of Jack and our parents being stubborn over ideological differences. "
1458,Should an adult child live with parents?,"In India, it is a common practice for adults to live with their parents. Why is it frowned upon in USA? Is it a good practice? "
1459,Why there is so much social prejudice against adoptive single fathers?,"Being single adoptive father and living in three countries (chronologically, Moldova, Russia, and Italy) I very often listen to such comments. About full adoptive family: “Well done! They’re very brave!” Single adoptive mother: “Oh, well… maybe she was very lonely. Good luck, anyway”. Single adoptive father: “WHY? He definitely into black market organ trade, or pervert, or some other sort of mad psychopath”.  Until 2015 I was thinking, that it is just some sort of anachronistic feelings in purely conservative ex-Soviet states (both Moldova and Russia were Soviet), but after moving with my children to developed nation, Italy, I found that situation is... well... better, but not much. Why?  P.S. Please, sorry for my English. It's not my native language. "
1460,Settling in toddler in daycare,"We've just started daycare for our 2 year old toddler, and on the first day of settling in, he cried so bitterly that he made himself sick (puked) and we were advised to take him home. And on the second day, he did the same thing, but this time, I asked if I could wait in with him, and he seemed perfectly fine for the remaining hour.  What I would like to know is, what is the normal process for settling in? (I'm in the UK/Glasgow in case that matters). Our nursery recommended that we leave the child for 30 minutes and gradually increase the amount of time that we leave him there. However given that he makes himself sick within 5 minutes of crying, I was wondering how this would work? And is there any other way to settle?  He has been looked after by either me, my wife, or grandparents. He has never spent much time in the company of other kids, though he does get along with visitors to the house well enough. And he has only every made himself sick once before while crying in the 2 years at home. "
1461,What is considered to be a safe age to be a babysitter?,"One option for a babysitter is finding an older child (teenager) in your neighbourhood. The benefits are obvious (you get to know the family, so there's more trust).  But is it truly safe to leave children with someone who isn't considered by society at large to be mature enough for many decisions?   Specifically, my question is: Are there some sort of statistics/studies on the relative safety of using a teenage schoolkid babysitter vs. a professional adult one?   Yes, I know it depends largely on a person, and there are 16 year olds more responsible than a large set of 20 year olds. But I'm interested in the overall trend. "
1462,"What to do about my 6-year-old son with listening, focus and behavioral issues?","I have 3 boys, one a 6 year old. My husband and I are very positive people and try and do a lot with our children, and give each child equal attention. The concerns I have with my 6 year old son are based on his listening, lack of focus and most recently the following bad behavior.   Over the past two years our oldest son has had trouble listening and focusing when you would speak to him. I know it sounds typical; we would joke that he has ""selective hearing"". But if we say something simple to him (with eye contact) then ask him to repeat, his response is ""I don't know"" or ""umm... I forgot"". When you need him to stay and focus on something he would have to do something else quickly because he can't help it.   Unfortunately, he is the same way in school. Example: his school has a fire drill and the kids are to stay in line. My son sees an ant hill and has to walk over to it and check it out. The teacher tells him to get back in line but then a second later he does it again. The teacher asks him why is he disobeying what she asks and his response is ""I don't know"".  My son is a good boy, but unfortunately also has a problem with following bad behavior, which is our biggest issue, from particular children in his school: he likes to do things that make people laugh. Like being silly in a fun way, or doing something inappropriate (like making noises with his mouth).   We've recently gotten emails from his teacher saying ""he has been very disruptive in her class, following others' bad behavior and makes many inappropriate noises."" We try to remind him every day that it's rude and disrespectful to act that way. We ask him if he likes getting into trouble? Does he like copying the bad kids (he names the bad kids on request, which we are aware are the trouble makers)? Does he like it when Mommy and Daddy get upset? Do you like to have fun and do fun things, because bad behavior doesn't deserve fun? Do you like when Mommy and Daddy talk to you in the morning about being an awesome boy and have a great day? We try not to sound negative and try and speak calmly but we get to a point were we feel like when we speak to him, while he says he cares, we don't feel that he does.   We've done time outs and daily good behavior charts. We've awarded little prizes on good behavior. We've tried so many options and it's just making us sad and scared for the boy he'll become. We know he's a good boy; he just needs to show it more and stop copying others' wrong doing just to get a laugh.  We recently called his pediatrician to see what we should do about his listening, focus and behavior thinking it's related with ADHD. I was referred to have a Neuro Sociological Evaluation done, which I'm still waiting to get through.   I'm sorry for the request on so much info, but we're coming to a halt on what to do next. I'm open to suggestions. "
1463,Who is lying about throwing away a slice of pizza?,"I found a (seemingly) perfectly good slice of pizza in the trash. I became curious. So I asked both children if they did it. Both denied it. There is one other adult in the house. After questioning, I eliminated the other adult as a suspect. I know I did not do it (because it is not the type of thing I would do and I'm 99.9% certain I would remember doing it if I had). So that leaves two remaining suspects. Both children. (Ages 10 and 13). Both deny doing it.  Obviously, my concern here is not over the pizza itself but over the fact that someone is clearly lying to me. I questioned both suspects separately, then together, then separately again for approximately 30 minutes hoping one would ""break"" and confess. Neither did. I suspect one more than the other (call it 80-20) based on intuition and prior history (he lied last year about homework). But he vehemently denies throwing away the pizza to the end; neither suspect cracked an inch.  Also, a goal here is a learning experience. For example, there might come a time in the future when I have to determine which child is lying to me. So, I am searching for any ""tells"" or other behavior patterns that might be helpful in the future as well.  Has anyone else experienced a situation like this before? If so, how did you handle it and what was the outcome? Other ideas and/or advice is also welcome. "
1464,"Lazy Eye in Infants, Preparations for Seeing a Specialist","My youngest (14 months) has started showing signs of either strabismus or ambylopia (both commonly referred to as ""lazy eye"", where one eye seems to track differently than the other when the child is tired or isn't focusing).  We're going to see an ophthalmologist once the pediatrician weighs in and recommends one, and I'm interested in suggestions for what I should look for in an ophthalmologist, and in what we should do to prepare for the visit.  Particularly, how important is it that we find one that specifically mentions these conditions as things they specialize in?  They're fairly common conditions (affecting over 4% of children), so I would expect most pediatric ophthalmologists to have as one of their main purposes helping to diagnose and treat lazy eyes; but many do not mention them in their list of specializations.    And, in terms of preparation, do we need to keep track of time or length of lazy eye bouts?  Should we take any videos?  Our pediatrician hasn't noticed this in her periodic checks, but I suspect that he's more focused during these visits (a person he's not that used to, who is talking a lot to him).  I worry the ophthalmologist will have the same problem - not be able to diagnose because of lack of presentation during the visit.   "
1465,Should I rinse cloth wipes once baby starts solids?,"Once a baby starts solids, do I now need to rinse the cloth wipes? Before solids, it was only breastfed poop and the cloth wipe could just be tossed in the diaper pail. Can I still just toss it in and it will rinse out in the wash or will I need to spray it off before putting it into the washing machine? "
1466,An Adult Child and a Difficult Ex,"My biological son, 26, will soon be graduating college and my wife (his step-mom) and I are throwing him a graduation party.  My wife and I have had a very difficult time with his mother and her husband.    We ""enjoyed"" a very Jerry Springer like moment with them yelling and screaming on our front lawn a couple of years ago.  His mother refers to my wife as ""the incarnation of evil"".  Given that the divorce is old (13 years ago) and all financial obligations were over, to the satisfaction of the court, over 4 years ago, my wife and I were hoping the angst would die down.    But it hasn't; his mother still feels a great deal of hate for both my wife and I.  While I understand that there are strong feelings behind this rage/hate I am not sure what I can do to mitigate them.  And really how much control can one have over another's feelings?  In most ways I could care less.  I would love to be civil with the mom and step-dad for the sake of my son.  But given their past behavior, I just don't want to be around them.  I don't want to pay to entertain them or even be in the same room with them.  If it was just a public place, I would just leave.  Any advice on how I would broach this subject with my son?  Update:  I did have the talk with my son, and he let her know she was not invited to the party.  As an olive branch I encouraged him to spend time with her after graduation but before the party, and they did.  They also spent the night before together, and they could then use the excuse of getting back to their home (8 hour drive) to not attend the party.    She is also a ""Shiite Christian"" (my son's words) very religious.  We had the party at a brewery which would also give her another excuse for not attending.  In the end it all worked out okay and they even refused to say hello to us on graduation day.  My son started law school and we are closer then ever.  "
1467,How to improve my 5 year old son's behavior in pre-kindergarden?,"My oldest child (5 year and a half son) has been more agitated lately in pre-kindergarden and often will make other kids laugh or disrupt activities in class.  We have been getting more feedback like this lately (from his teacher) and it is a bit discouraging for me and my girlfriend as I am unsure how to tackle this and we are afraid this behavior is going to carry on in kindergarden.  I have talked to him a couple of times already about the fact that it is not acceptable to disrupt classroom like he does (or talkback to his teacher). However, as much as he seems to understand it is not fun to get distracted like that (I made him relate to the fact that he doesn't like when his two years old sister talks during the time I read them stories for instance) he keeps doing it.  Background information:  He goes to pre-kindergarden twice a week (during the morning). My girlfriend is a stay-at-home mom and we also have two daughters. We get weekly report cards from the teacher and they used to be positive but, as stated above, lately he has been ""losing stars"" on his cards. He knows he's going to school soon (in September) so we are thinking it might be related to anxiety (new stuff tends to makes him anxious but he breaks the ice quite easily). For the last two or so weeks, he started crying when my girlfriend leaves from the pre-kindergarden class. He will sometimes hug her leg, just like little kids do when they are younger (again, separation anxiety?).  Additional information:   He's always happy in class and participates a lot, he just seems not to listen to instruction or disrupt activities. His teacher told us that our son had talked back to him (ex:""Let's do activity A"", (him) ""No I won't""). And sometimes just laugh at instructions given to him. This is something I realized we had a problem with a while ago. I used to let him argue with me. However, I have tried to eliminate that. He is a smart kid, and has got a whole lot of stimulation when he was younger. During diner, he often talks on an on. Out of my 3 kids, I would say he is the one who requires the most attention still. I have an anxious personality. While I try to control myself and not let it show to him. I am afraid he can still sense it sometimes. I would not say, him going to kindergarden is something that makes me anxious however.   While I do not see this has a huge problem (since this is pre-kindergarden) I don't want it to snowball. I also do not like the fact that he might be bothering other kids or be impolite to his teacher. Could any of you shed some light of what we might be doing wrong or what we could be doing to help the situation?  Thanks in advance.  EDITED To Add: Nothing new or odd is happening aside from the from the fact that I think he is more aware that school is starting soon. It's good to note that we had remarks similar to the one above from his teacher before (or other play groups), but it just wasn't a common occurrence. At least to me it was more normal. As far as discipline; it's normally time out alone in his room if he's too agitated or if he hits/hurt he would go in the corner. We do use the reward system from time to time (grid with sticker, etc). I've stopped arguing at home by simply letting him know that no means no. For instance if he asks for the tablet and I don't want him to, I used to argue on the reasons of why he could not have it with him. Now I will tell him, for example, ""you can't have the tablet because reason X"". If he try to argue about it, I will ask him ""what did I just tell you?"", to which he will repeat what I just said for instance, and I simply let him know that my answers stays the same. "
1468,Three year old able to poo in the toilet but still pees in his nappy,"Our 3-year-old son has shown signs of improvement lately in using the toilet to poo. He is still wearing nappy, but he is able to take his nappy and shorts/trousers off and then climbed onto the toilet by himself to poo. (He does not want to use the toilet trainer seat, but he would instead squat on the toilet. He has never used a potty.) Normally he would tell me before if he wanted to poo, and I would supervise him until he finishes. Today, he didn't even tell me beforehand, did all by himself until he finished, when I heard him calling.   When it comes to peeing, however, he has not been able to do it as good as he does pooing. So far he would only pee in the same way he poos, straight after his bath, while still naked. Other than that, he would pee in his nappy.  What is the next step I need to take so that he can pee in the toilet, just as he poos? When should I stop putting nappies on him? "
1469,"How should I handle ""he/she told me to do it"" excuses from siblings?","Sometimes (too frequent for my liking) when questioned ""Why did you do this 100% prohibited or simply boneheaded thing"", my 6- and 8-year-old kids' response is ""he/she - pointing at the sibling - told me to do it"".  At that, BOTH of them fully and immediately agree that they BOTH knew at the time that they were explicitly prohibited from doing whatever was done.   Is this sort of behavior dangerous? To me, this projects to the future as being more susceptible to peer pressure in negative situations, AND as a major sign that parental opinion and authority is held pretty low (""Didn't we discuss yesterday that when mother tells you one thing and your sister the opposite, you listen to your mother?"" ""Yes"". ""So, why did you do it when she asked""? ""I donno"") What are good strategies to curb that pattern? I would estimate that they get up to no good at least 2-3 times more often when they are together than when they are alone.    The interesting thing is that it's not ALWAYS younger or older following the other's bad ideas. They both do it. "
1470,How to react when two toddlers fight over the same toy?,"Your children are playing happily. Suddenly, you hear them yelling and notice that they both grab on to the same toy and fight over it.  You don't know who ""had it first"" and, thus, has some kind of ""moral right"" to play with it. They both can't talk yet (or have just started to talk), so you can't ask them what happened.  How do you react? Take away the toy (which might be unfair to the child who ""had it first"" and played with it)? Force them to play together (how, with toddlers)?  (Let's assume that it is not possible to get a second copy of the toy in a feasible amount of time, i.e., in the few minutes until their attention shifts to something else.) "
1471,Fear/interest in thunder and lightning,"My almost-three year old has the strangest love/hate relationship with thunder and lightning.  He will often react with fear when he sees lightning or hears thunder, and will talk about ""I am scared of thunder"", ""I don't want there to be thunder"", etc.; but then when we walk out into a thunderstorm, or look out the window, he will be incredibly fascinated and say ""I love thunder"", ""Daddy can I see more lightning"" (when there is not some for a while), etc.  Will it be helpful to him overcoming his fear of thunder (which often means sleeping in our bed at night when there are bad storms) to encourage the 'love' side of things (I tried taking him outside during the last one, which included some small hail, and he loved it and was sad when the hail stopped)?  Or am I making it more likely for him to have nightmares about thunder?    Intuitively it seems like it should help to give positive associations, but he also had very significant negative reactions that night (as bad or worse than before).  I realize things don't change overnight, but I don't want to be making things worse. "
1472,Why is the due date different in France than in the US?,"There are several ""due date calculators"" out there, and they all pretty much seem to give the same due date ... except in France!  See a striking example: [website]It calculates the due date to May 26.  Then go to the French version of the SAME site: [website]It calculates June 2nd.  Same goes if you go to a French doctor vs a US doctor (or Israeli, where I am).  This is science, biology, right? Why would there be a difference? "
1473,How do you handle poor sportsmanship from other parents during your child's sports events?,"Crazy sports parents.  How do you deal with them?  I've heard of everything from parents screaming obscenities at players on the opposing team, their own team, or even their own kids, to actual fights breaking out between parents.  Comments like ""my 4 year old could do better!"" or ""don't sub him in; he's terrible!"" seem to be becoming more common  coming from the stands during youth sport events.  Verbal, or even physical, abuse, aimed at the referees and coaches seems to be even more common?  If your child is playing in a team event, and some other kids' parents start criticising their play, how do you respond?  What do you say to your kid?  What, if anything, do you say to the offending parent?  What about if the abuse is aimed at another kid, or even a coach or referee?  "
1474,When can I introduce different music?,"Right now, whenever I take my daughter somewhere in the car, we listen to CD's with children's songs (The ABC Song, Twinkle Twinkle, Open Shut Them, etc). While these songs are good, the CDs have been played quite a bit and sometimes it seems like she's bored with them. When is it OK to introduce non-children's music? Does it really matter?  Now when I say non-children's music, I'm referring to G-rated pop, soft rock (Train), or folk music (Bob Dylan). I'm not referring to gangsta-rap or death metal (not that there is anything wrong with them, a toddler is just not the appropriate audience). "
1475,Is it a good approach to have a policy of apologizing for yelling at a kid?,"A couple of times I encountered situation where people had a following policy      If a parent yells at a kid out of frustration with no meaningful reason (e.g. the kid just got on their nerves but wasn't actually doing something punishment-worthy), that parent MUST shortly apologize to the yelled-at child.   Is that considered to be a good approach? What are the pros and cons?  Please note that the discussion of the concept of yelling at a child in general is out of scope for this question. "
1476,Does good cop/bad cop work with children?,"My wife and I have descended into the toddler years with our first. Along with that, she is getting that classic toddler attitude. We understand it's a growing phase and tantrums and outbursts are normal, but they still need to be addressed so she can get a beginning understanding about what is appropriate when expressing her frustration. We have always been on the same page with each other whenever we correct bad behavior or instruct her on why a type of outburst is inappropriate.   So this begs the question, will she feel like we are always ganging up on her? If we are both constantly correcting and instructing in tandem, is that bad? Should one parent act as an advocate while the other is tough on the rules? Should there be a good cop and a bad cop? "
1477,Two Year Old Being Intentionally Disobedient,"I have a two year old who is occasionally intentionally disobedient.  She's quite well developed for her age and understands instructions given.  But at the dinner table she is often quite disobedient, particularly with throwing food around.  Usually what will happen is that she will grow bored with her dinner and pick up a piece of vegetable and throw it across the table.  We will tell her not to do that and in an act of defiance she'll pick another piece up, look straight at us, smile, and then throw the new piece of food, as if to say ""what are you going to do about it""?  We have tried time-out discipline and also threaten to not give her dessert (which is a threat we have followed up with on a number of occasions).  What else can we try and why is she doing this? "
1478,"Paternity Leave, How much does the Father need to be home?","I'm trying to collect some opinions on this, because I'm a first time parent and most of my friends don't have kids. Basically, I'm trying to work out how much I will be needed at home during the first weeks and months of the baby being born. Don't get me wrong, I'd love stay home with the baby the entire time but its a comprise between supporting the girlfriend, raising the baby and work/money commitments. I'm trying to strike the right balance.  Just to outline the situation  My girlfriend is due around November this year, and I am planning as much as I can in advanced. I've been talking to HR at work, trying to decide what the best arrangements to make for work are at the time of birth and directly after.  To be it into context, it just so happens that I am the main bread winner in the relationship and my girlfriend will be stopping work a couple months before and staying at home to look after the baby. She will then looking for a new job after a duration (6months? undecided as of yet). So my girlfriend will be the main carer for the baby (9 to 5) initially.  What I'm entitled to  I am entitled to 2 weeks paternity leave, at statutory pay; which is significantly less than my usual pay and makes a huge impact to our finances. I also have flexible hours, some holiday available and the opportunity to work from home some days of the week.   My current plan  First of all, I'm assuming everything will go ahead as expected and there will be no complications. If there are any, I'll need to change plans anyway so if it happens I'll rethink things.  Roughly the week proceeding the due day (or the point where it looks like it might be any minute) I will work from home, and be able to spring into action straight away and drive her to the hospital. Its worth noting that the mother-in-law is very local, and very helpful so she'll be on standby to help throughout the birth and the months after.  After the baby is born, I will take a week of paternity leave and the odd couple days of holiday to bridge across the nearest weekend or if we need a extra day of so.  After the initial paternity leave period, I will go back to work and work from home ~2 days a week flexibly, depending on how I'm needed at work and home. I'm an engineer, so my time is split between working on a computer (anywhere) and working in a lab (in the office). I would keep working from home a couple days a week for a month or two, probably up to Xmas.  In the New Year, I would look to going back to work in the office full time. I have flexible hours, so I can work different times to work around baby commitments as needed.    So I'm wondering, how much will I be needed during and after the pregnancy. Is just over 1 week dedicated, plus working from home for 2 months after enough? "
1479,What are good strategies to deal with a child getting distracted during meals?,"It's already been discussed how to handle a nursing baby who gets distracted instead of eating: What works to get a distracted nurser to eat during the day?.  But what strategies can I use to help a child of preschool or elementary school age who exibits the same pattern? Eats a bit and then gets distracted by... well, pretty much anything. Talk to whoever is around them (on any topic), think about stuff, play with utensils, look at the stuff in the room, sing/hum.   This seems to be an issue of distraction: they exhibit the same even when eating their favorite foods, but sometimes (rarely) given sufficient motivation they can breathe through exactly the same meal in 15-20 minutes instead of the usual 60. And the meal goes a lot faster if there's an adult in the room CONSTANTLY reminding them to concentrate on food (like, every minute).  "
1480,Two Year Old Won't Toilet Outside of Home,I have a two year old who is still in nappies and she will not do a poop outside the comfort of her own home.  This is despite spending two days a week at daycare (she loves going to daycare and sometimes asks to go when it's not a daycare day).  She's not toilet trained yet (though we have begun some work on this) and this has been happening for at least six to twelve months.  Is this normal?  Is there anything we can do to help her feel comfortable enough to poo at daycare? 
1481,Is it dangerous to microwave formula if I swirl the bottle and test the temperature afterwards?,"The overwhelming consensus online is that microwaving a babies bottle can be ""dangerous"" because microwaving formula can produce hot spots. However, if you simply swirl the bottle you can even out the heat distribution and eliminate said hot spots. The amount of bubbles produced by swirling is minimal and heat redistributes very easily in liquid. That being the case, if I test the formula's heat and its a good temperature, and the heat is redistributed, whats the big deal about microwaving the bottle? Is it just that people can't be trusted to swirl the bottle well and test the temperature?   Edit:   Unfortunately, I don't have access to the full articles, but for what its worth, here are a few articles which discuss the nutritional effects of microwaving formula and/or breastmilk (thanks to @bestander);   [website][website][website][website][website]"
1482,My 21-year-old adult son hates me,"My adult son, who is 21, expects me to do everything he wants.  He takes no responsibility for his actions, instead always finding a way to put the blame on me and or others.   For example, he brought a dog with him when he moved back in ""for a few weeks"" (right). Recently I asked him to clean up his pup's poop from our hallway (his pup is house trained but was ignored.) His response: ""Can't you do it? You saw it first.""  Then  he followed this by saying he would after he finished his cigarette and game.   I explained to him when he moved back home (completely free) that he had to tend to his dog when he's not at work.  Oh, he was fine with it then.   All my son's childhood was a struggle for me. A struggle for respect which I never got (he says I must earn it.) And he says not to piss him off because if I do, be prepared for his rage; he will stop at nothing to bury me.   He will tell lies and make it all about me, and in the end he will move out and all of it will be my fault.   Edited to add:  I will admit I've become a push over, but in the past I was not. I've had him arrested at 16 for shoving me into the wall outside of our house. When caught doing wrong by the police, I was told it wasn't bad enough to arrest (though he was cuffed at the time!)   I have called the cops for him setting fires in my garage; they just told me to beat his a##. I did the whole ""if you do this you will lose (example his games)"", so he walked in his room, bagged it up, and handed it to me, saying, ""You're gonna eventually take them so here.""   He's very intelligent and plays the polite role in front of others. The last time I called the cops in June, he immediately called them as well, stating I was suicidal and that he feared for my life. They came and spoke to us and did nothing, so I left the family member's house where we were and the cops asked, ""Are you just gonna leave him here?"" I said, yes he's 21 and an adult, and you can't force me take him with me.   I know I have to stand up to him but it's exhausting. Also my husband (not his father) finally had enough and put him out for his disrespect and abusive attitude towards me.   I guess I need to be the one to change and stop trying to apologize for things I didn't do even if he believes I did. For example, he blames me for being an ""absent parent"". I had a normal job, was gone during school hours.   He acts very entitled and dosen't respect boundaries at all. He has treated his ex wife this way as well. It seems to be towards women mostly.   I just want him to grow up and have a happy and healthy life. I'm not here to place all the blame on my son. I'm here to gain knowledge about what I can do to change myself, and hopefully help my son help himself.   A little background information: I was 15 when my son was born he was conceived through non-consensual sex (just once). His father was 21 and not a nice person. He was violent towards me physically, mentally, and emotionally through my 13 to 16. He has not been involved in my son's life since his first year. My son had no knowledge about how he was conceived; I hid that from him because I thought it might hurt him. My son was diagnosed at age 5 with ADHD.  I notice that my safety has been mentioned a lot in comments and need to clarify that he is no longer in my home. My husband had enough; my son left but not before pushing my husband (well trying to anyway.) My son's leaving never goes smoothly; it's always a 2 hour or more event full of verbal attacks, usually all towards me unless someone speaks up for me (then they become part of his attack as well.) I'm afraid one day he won't know when to stop. "
1483,What are lightweight/mobile options for safely transporting an 11-month-old in a car?,"We have an 11-month-old child. She's reaching the upper limit of a baby car-seat. We rely on taxis for transportation. This means that when we go somewhere, we have to take the car-seat with us - we can't leave it in the car while it's parked.   So far we've managed with a baby car-seat that mounts on a folding stroller, but as our child outgrows that, I'm unclear on how we can safely transport her in cars and be able to be mobile at our destination: are there car-seats for infants / toddlers that are compatible with strollers? Or is there another approach that I'm overlooking?   "
1484,"Are there any benefits or downsides in ""flexible"" food time?","Are there any benefits or downsides in feeding the children (around elementary school age) on the schedule of ""I'm hungry now"" as opposed to scheduled meal times?  This is of course assuming that the nutritional content remains the same, e.g. it's not like they demand a piece of cake 1 hr before lunch and then don't eat soup or veggies because of that.   An example would be: they ask for food 1 hour before usual lunch time and get a fruit salad (that they would otherwise get at snack time) because they aren't yet hungry enough for full lunch. Then they eat lunch 1-2 hrs later. Then then demand what would have been dinner during snack (but eat less of it) and then finish the day at usual dinner time with something light like an extra Yogurt. So they get 1 extra meal, with a mild increase in calories[1], and no decrease in useful nutrition.  My main concern is lack of stable food schedule induced by indulging such demands.  Is that a valid concern as long as I manage the total nutritional input in a sane way?  One of the things that worry me is that during school days they obviously don't have such flexibility for the first 3 meals.    [1] - The specific kids in question have decent metabolism and are stably UNDER the average weight, so extra calories are NOT an issue. Confirmed with their pediatrician. "
1485,What are the good approaches to gamify for kids of elementary school age?,"Obviously, the kids of, well, my age are suckers for reputation points and badges.  What are the good approaches as far as rewards for kids elementary school age if you want to incentivize them via gamification?   Star stickers seem a bit too 3-year-old (though may be if I call them rep points? :) Incentivising via edible treats seems like a REALLY bad approach to me (they are humans, not puppies). Incentivising via parental attention seems like a bad idea as well. Kids should never feel that parental attention is a thing to toy with.  Incentivising via toys stops working when they accumulate too many toys or parents run out of money. When you have 20 different matchstick cars, 21st one seems to be... meh.   So, what are the GOOD approaches? "
1486,Is this strange behavior for a 5-year-old?,"I am asking about my stepson.  I don't have any children of my own, but to me his behavior seems bizarre.    He talks constantly and will say the same thing several times using different words.  For example: ""That building is really old.  Look at that old building.  That building looks really old.""  This happened during a walk recently.  We acknowledge and respond to each statement, but after that third time it gets kind of redundant.  Also, he needs specific instructions.  If you ask him to get dressed and do not tell him to take off his pajamas he will just put his clothes on over top.  He checks out mentally a lot.  You can send him into the bathroom to brush his teeth and find him standing there ten minutes later, staring into space, not yet having brushed his teeth.    He also has a very poor memory.  He cannot recall what he did at school or what he ate for lunch.  Basic questions seem to confuse him.  I ask ""what did you do at the park?""  He says "" what did I do?""  Or he will just not answer or will make up an answer.  I guess because he can't remember.  He asks a lot of rhetorical questions, for example, when I am making coffee he will ask what I am doing.  I use to answer but now I say ""what does it look like I am doing?"" where he will respond ""making coffee.""  Other times he is super bright; good coordination.  I taught him to ride his bike at age four.  I just don't get it.    Also it is like he is incapable of being alone or entertaining himself.  He will follow you everywhere and wants to get super close.  If you send him to his room to play he will ask to watch T.V. instead.  If he is told ""no, go play with your toys for a bit"" he usually won't go, he will just hide in the stairwell.  He would prefer to just sit on the steps and watch me wash dishes or his dad do paperwork. "
1487,"If a baby is accidentally dropped by a parent, does the baby lose trust in the parent?","This should not have happened but it did happen. I'm the mother to a 14-month-old girl. We were going for our usual morning walk in our garden. Suddenly I felt something fall on me from above. Without thinking, and forgetting that I was carrying my daughter, I flung my arms out. My daughter fell onto the earth and she looked frightened and confused. My heart sank when I realized what I had done.. it has been a week but I keep replaying the incident in my mind.. how could I be so immature? So irresponsible? So selfish. I'm shocked and disgusted at my behaviour.   I honestly feel like the worst mother ever - I've never heard of a mother dropping her baby for this reason. I picked her up right away, and consoled her. Then I took her to the doctor who examined her and said that there was nothing to worry about physically. But I'm more worried about the emotional effects. I'm her mother, she should feel safe and secure with me, but I've completely destroyed her confidence in me. How will she trust me again? "
1488,For the benefit of the child: what's better - no father or bad father?,"What's best/better for the child in the long/short run - to have no father in his life or to have a ""no-good"" father in his life?  And by ""no-good"" I mean - mentally and financially unstable, irresponsible, irrational and alcoholic (in my opinion - not professionally diagnosed).  After reading the answer to post Sharing parenting/custody duties with an ex-partner, I can honestly answer NO to all those questions. BUT - this is my opinion. And I am sure my ex doesn't think of himself that way.  I am struggling with the concept of my son having a right to have a relationship with his father no matter what kind of a father he is and no matter how damaging I think it might be for my son in the long run.  And.  Keeping my son safe and making sure he is growing up well-balanced, physically, emotionally and mentally healthy child, in a safe and stable environment - which would mean keeping him away from my ex.  Can I tell my son (if his father doesn't seek visitation until then) - that when he reaches 18 years old he can seek out his father and get to know him and have whatever kind of relationship he wants with him. But until then try to fight his request for visitation (if it ever happens)?  My son is 4 years old now and doesn't have visitation with his dad now. He saw him last when he was 2.5 years old. His dad had supervised visitation when my son was 1.5, but only came once and withdrew his court petition for visitation since then. Also I have a restraining order against him because he has zero respect for me and my boundaries and has been harassing me for years.  Thank you.  Edit: I have to add that I do not talk badly about my ex to my son. My son has a right to make up his own mind about the kind of person his father is and my opinions about my ex - have nothing to do with my son's opinions about his dad and I keep those separate.  But, my son is starting to ask about his dad now - things like: where is he, and can we go visit him and why isn't he here. And sometimes he says things like ""my father doesn't want/love me"". And it is heart breaking for me to hear him say things like that. So I reply with ""Your father loves you. Of course he wants you. And he just lives far away and is working and cannot visit"". Which is partly true. I don't want to lie to my son, but I also don't want him to think that he isn't loved or wanted. And I know that my son will always be curious about his dad, and that the response I have will soon get ""old"", and I would need to come up with a better response.  Another addition: The reason this is a struggle for me is because I realize that I am not a perfect parent. That I make mistakes and that in some way I am sure some things I do - will have long term and possibly damaging effect on my son. I hope not - and I try my hardest not to make those mistakes but - I am not perfect and I can only do my best while striving towards a goal of raising a happy and healthy and stable, responsible, compassionate, etc. child.  So - how can I tell if not having a father at all is better than having an unstable father in my son's life? Even if he (the ex) does things that are potentially long-term damaging - isn't the benefit of having a father still outweighs it? "
1489,Is it a good idea to give games that are multiplayer to a younger kid as a birthday present?,"Are multilayer games (e.g. monopoly) a good present for a child's birthday?  Assuming of course that the child is old enough to enjoy the specific game (e.g. elementary school age for monopoly).  What are the possible downsides?  If the answer depends on siblings, assume that the child has siblings who would be interested in playing that game as well.  My own main concern is that the child would feel that the present isn't really for them because other people play it at the same time. "
1490,"At what age should a child be expected to learn to ""hold it""","When out with my 4 year old, we go to the bathroom at EVERY place we go to. I call it bathroom tourism. I don't think he has to go nearly as often as he indicates, but, since he manages to conjure up some poop or pee at each stop its hard to tell if he felt a real physical urge or if he just wanted to check out yet another ladies' room color scheme.   My question is, when is it appropriate for me to start requiring him to ""hold it""? How long can I expect him to be able to wait to relieve himself?  Some history and relevant facts:  He was a bed wetter until very recently; we still wake him at 11:00 to go to the bathroom, just in case.  He has only had one accident (urine) since potty training, and it was because he was holding it and refused to go to the bathroom, despite our repeated efforts to get him to go.  This kid drinks A LOT of water and milk. It's just who he is; we had him tested for diabetes, etc since his thirst seems excessive, but all tests indicate he's normal. Obviously, because of this the volume that he puts out is more than the average kid.  He stands up to pee.   He doesn't have any problems with constipation. "
1491,Taking a 12 week old baby to the swimming pool for the first time,"We are taking our 12 week old daughter to the indoor pool tomorrow. We have:   1 disposable swim nappy A splash about happy nappy A neoprene baby warmer Towels, change of clothes etc.   We were just going to test putting her in her gear and hold her in the water. She was born in a birthing pool and likes baths so we think she'll enjoy this, but what else should we do/not do? Should she stay above water? Does she need to be bathed afterwards as it is a standard chlorinated UK public family pool? "
1492,How to handle the father of my 11-year-old son who just met him for the first time in our son's best interest?,"I have an 11-year-old son. His father wanted me to abort him. Now, he has seen him for the first time on Saturday. The father has never seen him prior or reached out to ask about him or try to see him. The father even said ""I love you, I always have"" to my son. A complete stranger does that to him. That pissed me off! Now he says he hadn't reached out sooner because he couldn't/can't afford it, then why reach out now!?  I am worried I am going to protect him too much, where my son will get mad at me. Any suggestions on how to handle this man/father in his life? "

1494,What do you do when neighbor children that you don't know start coming over to your house to play with your kids?,"Edit - May 30, 2014  Details on this question can be found below, but here is a summary of my questions:   How do I approach the parents of these children?  What should I say to the parents? Do I work with the parents to set rules for their kids? (I've never had to do that with other parents.)  Should I let kids play with my daughter who seem less interested in her and more in her toys? How can I make it clear to these children that they are not to play at our house (ex: in the back yard) while we aren't home? How can I keep the number of children within a manageable level? I know I don't feel comfortable about having 7 kids over.   Original Post  We have recently started having some strange neighbor kids come over to our house and start playing in the back yard and I'm not sure how to deal with it.  One day we found 2 of these kids that we don't know or recognize playing in the back yard with our daughter and her friend. We didn't say anything, but just thought it was weird. Then there were five, then there were 7. This all happened in two days (literally overnight). We've tried to discourage so many coming over and it has helped, but now these neighbor kids are starting to play with our kids outside toys when we aren't even home. I also found out that these kids have taken toys from other homes. They are all pretty young (probably 9 years old and younger) so I'm sure it isn't malicious, but I'm definitely not comfortable with it. We don't have a garage, so we cant lock things up.  We don't know the parents, but I think I know where they live. They are of Hispanic origin, but I don't know if this is a cultural thing.  Does anyone have experience with this? Insights from Hispanics are especially welcome.  Thank you in advance. "

1496,Should I teach my child a second language?,"I know that raising kids bilingual can be a great blessing to them in the future. I am a native English speaker, but have learned a second language which is rarely used in the world.  My real question is, are there any benefits to being bilingual OTHER THAN simply knowing a second language? If I raised my child as bilingual, I can almost guarantee they would have no use for the second language. Is there some other benefit to being bilingual? Is it worth me raising my kids bilingual even if they never use their second language? "
1497,How do I determine if my child is ready for a specific book?,"Related: Finding Great Books at the Right Level  Of course various books have generic maturity levels. But all children are different, and so are all books; so general guidelines aren't always useful - I frequently encounter content that children theoretically aren't ready for yet, but greatly enjoy.  What are good guidelines to evaluate if your child is ready for a specific book's content?    NOTE: I don't care about the factor of being able to read the text - first, my kids reading level is well above their age, second I can read to them if the book is worth it but they struggle with more advanced text.  I already saw this question which seems like a duplicate, but whose answer addresses the opposite problem - is the child ready for the reading level of the book, as opposed to the content; AND doesn't really deal with specific child's capabilities. What I'm looking for is a process I can use to evaluate a specific book in terms of ""is it too early to give to this specific child"", not ""is there a generic guideline that an average 3rd grader would understand 80% of the book"". "
1498,How do you handle present overload?,"After a large (say 8+ people) birthday party, a child usually has TONS of presents (from party-attending kids; plus from parents and other relatives).  What is a good approach in terms of unpacking and letting a child play with them?  Let them open and play 100% of them the same day? Have them pick and open 1-2 a day? Prioritize the presents somehow (ones from important relatives first)?  What are the benefits and downsides of various approaches?  Ppreschool or elementary school age. "
1499,"Is it a good idea to ask the pre-schooler to donate the old toys if she wants new ones? If not, then how to encourage her to donate willingly?","Our house has some toys with which the child (3.5 years old) does not play. Some of them are broken, some aren't.   Is it a good idea if I make a deal with the toddler that she can get the new toys only if she donates the old ones to the poor children? Can this have any side effects?  One advantage of this may be that the house will never be cluttered because of toys!  I also want her to learn empathy. I want her to understand that many children are poor and if she has surplus toys she should donate so that others can play. "
1500,My 5-year daughter likes to play baby,"My daughter is 5 year old and she likes to play baby.  I don't mean she wet their pants or actually act like a baby. I mean she likes to immitate some baby talk and things like that. Completely manageable.  But I feel she's requesting more attention, maybe because in her mind, people care more about babies, so if she's a baby... I think you've got my point here.  At the same time, I'd like to promote some more independent behavior, like eating by herself, slicing the food by herself, getting a little more responsabilities, learning to be more patient, etc.  I know some of these things are hard even for grown-ups (such as being patient) but, well, someone has to help to start it from somewhere.  So I'd like to ask here: is this ""baby playing"" thing normal at this age? Should I care about it or is it part of a normal process? Do you also have experienced anything like that and how did you deal with it? "
1501,At what age should you allow your kids to go out alone?,"Whether its to visit a friend who lives a few streets away, or going to the park by themselves, or going to the local shop, at what age do you allow your kids to go out by themselves?  And what rules do you set down? "
1502,How to explain to young children what a web developer does,"If you are a web developer parent, will you try to explain to your child your profession before he/she is old enough to understand computer science, e.g. via story-telling?

1503,What walking distance is acceptable for a 6-year-old?,"We had a discussion in the family about how long of a walk can be taken with our 6-year-old daughter. We walked for 18.5 km (about 11.5 miles) and she was tired at the end, but after a 40 minute rest on the train she was full of energy again. Could this cause issues with her feet? Is there some norm for different ages?  "
1504,How could i change behavior of my 12 year's son?,"I have an only child of 12.5 years. He is very intelligent, but doesn't score well on exams. On questioning it's clear that he understands the topic.  When I restrict something, he argues continuously. This arguing and his stubborn attitude makes me stressed.  His habit of arguments and attitude toward leadership makes him seem aloof. He doesn't adjust in any group. His things are scattered in home.  How could I shape his behavior? How could I increase his concentration? What kind of re-reinforcements can be used in daily life to changing bad habits like excessive playing on computers, watching TV, late night waking, etc.? "
1505,How to encourage 2 year old to co-operate,"How do you persuade a 2yo to co-operate more? Specifically I'd like my daughter to get dressed calmly into her pyjamas with my help.  Currently our bedtime routine involves:   Read story while drinking milk (she does this calmly) Brush teeth (most of the time she allows us to brush her teeth well) Change nappy and get into pyjamas. At this point she runs into the adjacent rooms giggling and saying ""I'm running away!"" or hides under her bed. Or she lies on her bed right at the top right against the wall where it's harder to reach her. The problem here is it drags out bed time at the end of the day when everyone is tired.   I've tried asking her ""do you want me to help you get dressed or do you want to get dressed?"" but she just ignores this. She is capable of putting on most of her clothes given enough time.  The only way to get her dressed is to first catch her. This feels sub-optimal and as she gets bigger I don't think my back will support picking her up all the time. All the chasing feels like setting a bad precedent as well.   Threatening to take favourite toys away wins co-operation but I think there may be better techniques out there.  Once she's on her changing mat she behaves well if we talk to her and ask her questions. (""What was your favourite thing today?"", etc).  My wife and I are glad she isn't completely subservient and we'll probably miss this phase when she grows out of it, but calmer bedtimes would be nice.  Any recommendations please? "
1506,Is a laptop a good gift for 9 year old who shows interest in programming?,"I am a engineer. I was recently visiting family and spent some time with my 9 year old nephew. He showed me an app on his mom’s phone he has been using to make games. The app is called hopscotch. It’s a drag and drop app that teaches you some programming concepts. He is really into it; has been at it for a couple months and seems hooked. I want to encourage him to explore programming more. Talking with him, he has the passion for it.   So I am thinking it could be good to get him a laptop. I got my first desktop computer in 1989 at age 8 and it changed my life. It opened up a wonderful career in science and engineering for me. I'd like to offer him the same opportunity.  My concern though is that I never had access to iPhones at his age. I am not sure if he would even use the laptop. Maybe it seems like a strange form factor to kids now or maybe the OS paradigms are too different to what they have become used to?  What do you think? Do you have any experience with modern elementary school kids and laptops? If not a laptop, what’s a good alternative to get him that will let him dig in at more advanced levels? "
1507,"My son wants to bring a present to a birthday party where ""no presents"" was specified on the invitation","My son (3) likes to give presents.  Sometimes he asks to go shopping for presents for his friends (holidays, upcoming birthdays, etc.) using money from his allowance (we designate a small portion of his allowance for things he wants to buy for himself, and he mostly uses it for presents for other people; the remainder is for savings), and sometimes he'll just spontaneously grab one of his own toys, and decide that he wants to give it to someone else.  We love this behavior, and want to encourage it whenever possible.  We recently received an invitation to a cousin's 5th birthday.  The invitation says ""No gifts please!"".  This child's parents have specified ""no gifts"" for other events, as well (previous birthdays, family holiday celebrations, etc.), but the boy still received some gifts (usually from the grandparents, and a few of the mother's family members).  Given this, and our desire to encourage our son's generosity, and the enjoyment he gets in giving, should we honor the ""no gifts please!"" comment on the invitation?  Is there some compromise we could aim for? "
1508,How to handle unending questions that the child can answer themselves based on rules?,"We are trying to get the kids to be as self-sufficient as they can, including mentally.  So for some things, we have simlpe rules, so they don't need to get our approval/permission for every detail.  However, it is extremely undermining to our goals when a child who knows the rules 100% perfectly and can tell you the answer according to the rules at a drop of a hat STILL asks you the questions that rules can answer all the time.  Examples (MANY of these or similar per day):    ""Can I play this video game?"" ""What do the rules say?"" ""Don't play before 10am and only after homework and chores are done"". ""Have you done homework?"" ""No"". ""So can you play?"" ""No"". ""Correct! You know the answer then"". ""Is it OK to listen to music now?"" ""What are the rules for listening to music?"" ""No music when someone in the family is asleep."" ""Is anybody asleep""?  ""Yes, mom's sleeping"". ""Can you listen to music?"" ""No"". ""Correct! You know the answer then"".   What would be the reason for a child who 100% perfectly knows the rules and can apply them - for many years - to still ask when they know the answer clearly? And what can be done to encourage them to STOP asking in such a clear cut situation?  NOTES:    This does NOT appear to be a simple excuse to grab for attention. It's alwasy about a genuine want; and after asking said question, the child is perfectly content to go play/read by themselves for an hour or more with no attempt to contact the parent until the next time they genuinely want permission to do something. These are old, established rules. The child knows the rules for years, and was perfectly able to reason those rules years ago, never mind now. We already try to incentivize by always praising when they reason themselves (which does happen sometimes).  The child has no doubt in their knowledge of the rules. When pressed for an answer according to examples above, they never experience any hesitation or doubt as to whether their reasoning is correct (justifiably so).  "
1509,1-year old has trouble sleeping at night,"I have a 1-year old son that has a lot of trouble sleeping at night. From the day he was born until about 10 months old he had to be rocked to sleep. At 10 months old we sleep trained him using Ferber method and it worked. At bedtime we would hold him for a while, read a book, pray, etc., then put him into his crib. He would cry for a very short time, sometimes less than a minute, then fall asleep. Throughout the night he would seldom wake up, maybe one time at most, and even then he would fall back to sleep by himself.   When he turned 1 year old this method only had a 50-50 chance of working. Now when we put him into his crib he would cry for a long time, could be up to 15 minutes or more. And when he cries a long time, there's a good chance he would puke, and then chaos ensues. During the night he wakes up frequently, 2-3 times, and need to be rocked to sleep again.   Note that he has no trouble at all sleeping two naps during the morning and afternoon. We rock him to sleep at naps, and it's usually fairly effortless.   I do not think he goes to bed hungry. We give him an 8 ounce bottle of fresh milk about an hour or so before bed time.   I don't know what went wrong and I don't know how to fix it. Why did he revert back to previous state? Is there something about night time that scares him now that he's more developed? We have a small night light in his room. Thanks for your help.  "
1510,Mission Impossible 6: Toilet training my daughter,"Background  My daughter recently turned 4.  In December, she was diagnosed with autism.  She is on the mild (verbal) end of the spectrum.  She has communication and social issues, as well as some self care and behaviour issues (tantrums).  Toilet training attempt #1  Shortly before she turned 3, we tried to toilet train her for the first time.  We did this for a few weeks and it became much too stressful.  She never told us when she needed to go, and we constantly needed to prompt her.  The end result was constant weeing on the floor, a couple of frustrated parents, and being put back in nappies shortly after.  Meanwhile...  For most of 2014 we had a few major events (including the birth of another child) which put toilet-training well on the back burner.  She was pretty much in nappies the entire year.  Although, she would often express an interest in going to the toilet (or potty) to make a wee.  We would take her nappy off in these situations and let her make a wee like a ""big girl"".  We would always praise her and do a big song and dance whenever she had a successful wee on the toilet, and she seemed to delight in this.  Toilet training attempt #2  In January this year we decided to give it another go, and with this 2nd attempt we were much more determined to be successful.  So off came the nappies.  ""You're a big girl now, and you don't have to wear nappies anymore.  Big girls go on the toilet"".  She seemed to enjoy this concept.  The only time she goes in nappies now is when she goes to sleep (because we don't want to have to clean her sheets every day).  The accidents still happen fairly regularly.  We keep on telling her ""please tell mummy or daddy when you want to go to the toilet"".  She seemed to understand this, but very rarely tells us she wants to go.  Fast forward 5 months to June...We don't seem to be making a lot of progress, and we're going a bit nuts.  Summary of issues   She very rarely tells us when she wants to go. We will usually start to see signs of her wanting to go (pushing legs together, walking funny) but by that stage it's often too late and she's already wet herself. If it's been quite a few hours since she last went, we'll try to take her but she will refuse.  I have discovered recently that bribery (allowing her to watch a cartoon on the toilet) helps though.  And if I managed to convince her to go to the toilet, she'll make a wee (she clearly needed to go). If she has a tantrum (for whatever reason) she will usually wet herself if she hasn't gone for a while. She oddly seems to be better at kindergarten and has less (wee) accidents - they have smaller toilets there which are more accessible than our home one, which might encourage her to go.  She also mimics other children who are going. We offer both the toilet and potty at home to encourage her to not go in her pants. Dirty public toilets are a no-go zone (understandable, I don't really like them either). Often when we are out (e.g. at a restaurant) she'll say ""I need to go the toilet"".  We get very excited that she wants to go, but then we take her and she doesn't want to sit down.  Apparently she just wanted to go the toilet room, but not actually make anything. She always tells us after she had made something in her pants, just not before she has made it. If she makes a wee on the toilet (quite regularly, when we are able to convince her to go), we always make a big song and dance of it, rewarding her with stickers, stars and rewards.  She enjoys this attention.  Positive reinforcement to the max. She seems to also realise (maybe) that drinking water leads to wees, and doesn't seem to like drinking water as much as she did when she was in nappies.   What about number twos?  That's even more stressful.  In all this time toilet training, she's only made a poo on the toilet maybe once (and that's when she was caught about to make one in her pants).  Otherwise, it's either in her underpants or her nappy (when she's in bed).  She has mostly dropped her daytime nap now, but often she'll tell us that she wants to go to sleep during the day.  She knows we will put a nappy on her for this, and after she goes to bed she'll often call out 5 minutes later ""I made a poo"".  We then change her, and she wants to be awake again.  All apparently very premeditated on her part...  Getting her to makes poos on the toilet is close to impossible.  We have even let her sit on the toilet or potty with a nappy on just so she can get used to the concept of making a poo in that position.  But she still won't do it.  Sorry for being graphic, but when she does make a poo they can often be quite messy ones (not diarrhea but not solid either).  Advice we have received  We have seen a psychologist and occupational therapist who advised the following:   Social stories (provided to us) about toileting, in both book and DVD form.  The book even has pictures of my daughter in it to try to encourage her to do the right thing. Making the environment at home peaceful and non stressful.   We always try to remain calm when there is an accident, but we all have our moments and sometimes it gets a bit much.  Where to now?  They say that insanity is doing the same thing over again and expecting different results, and that's definitely where we're at now.  Anyone have any ideas about how to tackle this seemingly insurmountable problem? "
1511,"Should a newborn be allowed to sleep all night, or be woken up to eat more?","My son is 2 weeks old and is sleeping through the night. I bottle feed. I give him 4oz. During the day he will sleep after his bottle only 4 to 5 hrs, but at night he will sleep all night. For example last time I gave him a bottle at 8pm and now its 5am.  Is it ok to let him sleep all night like he does or should I wake up up for every feeding? Should I give him more then 4oz because after his bottle at 5am he is acting like he is still hungry?  This is my first child I could use some help... "
1512,Using the Potty,"My 2 year and 10 month old started to poo into the potty 3 months ago, he would have a bowel movement once a day since then, but it only lasted for 4 days. He now wants his diaper all the time, and he just ""dislikes"", ""refuses"", or ""hates"" when I try to sit him down on the potty. When I asked/said, ""let's poop"", he hates it!  I started to put just underwear on him yesterday, and of course, he has many accidents, he even poops in the underwear! Should I still put underwear on him? or sit him on the potty frequently? Or should I just still continue with the diapers?  "
1513,How should I inform parents if their children are bothering me?,"Today, on the bus, I was seated a row behind a mother and her young daughter (I guess about 5-6 years old), and the child just couldn't stay quiet: she was singing constantly, saying ""byebye, please come in"" to every car that we came across, even parked cars, being very annoying in general.  Now, I personally am quite quickly annoyed by young children. I have Asperger's, which in my case means it's hard to just mentally ignore noises like neurotypical people can, especially if I don't really have something to occupy myself with. And young children, in my experience, are usually making rather high-pitched noises, often quite loud and repetitive, which really bother me.  I often have this issue on transit, which means leaving the situation, as recommended in How do you handle poor behavior by other people&#39;s children? isn't really an option, since it would take longer to get where I need to go.  Is it acceptable for me to tell a parent that the noises their children make are bothering me? And if so, what is the best way to inform them without making the situation worse? I'm from Belgium in case it makes a difference. "
1514,What advice should I give to a teenage girl who often has lice when she goes to her father's place?,"My step-daughter who is 13, often gets lice when she goes to visit her biological father for a long period (at least a week).  The guy is taking her to his friends's place, the places are definitely not clean and each time, it is the same thing, teenage girl scratched her head and freaks out as she's got lice.  The father is a kid-ult, who does not care about cleanliness, just that his kids get enough food and are okay clean, the okay clean is variable.  I was wondering what can I suggest to a teenage girl to avoid catching lice?  One suggestion would be to teach her to spot dirty places and not sleep there.  Do you have any other advice?   "
1515,What avenues can we give to our 6 year old daughter to help socialize with those outside her immeidate family?,"Our 6 year old daughter is really bright and very friendly and outgoing to those in her immediate family (parents, siblings, uncles and grandparents).  But when she is in social situations where she has to interact with those outside this well known circle she becomes very shy and introverted. If she is among those her age she will never go forward and introduce herself and try to make friends. If an adult tries to interact with her, like Dad's friend saying ""Hi, how are you?"",she will just look down and not even reply. If a waiter brings her a balloon in a restaurant she will not even say thank you.  I think part of the problem is we are currently home schooling her and so she doesn't get much exposure to people outside her home and close family members.  But when we do take her out, how can we give her the chance to interact? Do we point to people and tell her to go talk to them? Someone suggested for example telling her to ask the librarian for a book she likes. Is this the way to go or is there a better way? "
1516,"Is ""slapping a badly-behaved child"" against the law in US?","I heard a violent argument between a mother and her child.   Obviously it was the child's mistake and he said something really really bad that must have hurt mother's feelings. His words made everybody around go ballistic also.  At that moment, the mother gave her bad son a big slap in the face. I believe that normal people would not be able to have good control over their feelings under such circumstance.  Her son, although looks like about ten years old, seemed to at least understand what a lawsuit is. He claimed that he would sue his mother.  Is ""slapping a badly-behaved child"" against the law in US? Will that mother be sent into jail ? "
1517,Teaching perseverance and planning,"My eight year-old has an issue with perseverance and planning.  We thought playing minecraft would help.  If you're not familiar with minecraft, it's a game where you gather resources to build things, while fighting or avoiding dangers like monsters and lava.  He loves the game, understands the mechanics of it very well for his age, and would spend every waking hour playing it if we let him.  The problem is, he's really bad at the planning part of the game.  A typical line of thought for someone his age with his level of understanding of the game mechanics (which I know from observing his cousins) is:   I keep getting killed by monsters. I need to make some armor. I'll sleep or stay somewhere safe at night in the meantime so I won't get killed as much. I need a bunch of leather to make armor. I need to raise cows in order to get leather. I need to plant some wheat to feed the cows. I need a fence to keep the cows from wandering away. I need a chest to keep my stuff safe, so I don't lose everything if I get killed. I will work on all these things, making adjustments as I go, until I have my armor. I will plan the next steps to get more powerful armor.   My son's line of thought goes something like this:   I keep getting killed by monsters. I will spend two minutes making a wooden sword. I'm still getting killed all the time by monsters, and it's too much work making a new sword, so I'll just try to punch them. Wander around not committing at all to gathering resources, because I'm just going to lose them all the next time I get attacked.     I realize this is just a game, but it's indicative of real-life problems he has with a defeatist attitude and a failure to persevere and adapt when things get difficult.  We were hoping the low-risk/high-motivation aspects of the game would help give him a safe platform for learning these skills.  What generally causes these sorts of problems?  What activities can we do in-game or out to help him overcome them? "
1518,What is the correct temperature and humidity to maintain in a child's room at night?,"We have been advised to keep the child's bedroom cool and humid. Are there any specific guidelines on the correct ranges of temperatures and humidity?   Currently, we are using a humidifier and have some concerns about possible mold growth.  Also, is it ok to use a conditioner when the outside temperature is hot? "
1519,Absent Father vs. Father with alcohol addiction,"I was raised with a father who was dependent on alcohol and who was very abusive emotionally but sometimes physically towards my mother. At that time I wished I wouldn't have a father at all. But I know he was there to support us financially and sometimes it wasn't that bad. During the time when he was sober and behaving normally, he was showing affection and love towards us.  Now when I look at it I wonder if it's better to have an absent father or a father with dependent drinking who is present. Is there any study showing that having an abusive father dependent on alcohol is better than an absent one?  My parents' generation tended to stay in a marriage in spite of these problems. But now people advise to get a divorce. I'm wondering which is better for the children? All the studies I found only compare good present fathers vs absent ones. "
1520,"I want more time with my wife in our blended family, but she says no.","My wife and I have been married for about 8 months. We both have two children, each. I moved into her house with her kids. I have my kids twice a week and every other weekend.   I told my wife I wanted to spend time with her during the week after her kids went to bed. She refuses.   In fact, we've gotten into a very heated argument. She won't listen to my reasoning and she claims I'm not listening to her. I disagree and think I am listening. Am I being unreasonable?   She thinks I'm trying to take time away from her kids. I have kept on telling her that it's only after her kids go to bed. I don't know what to do.   I'm fed up with lacking time together with her both during the week and during the weekends we have our kids. The only time we spend together without our kids directly involved (not asleep) is every other weekend when our kids are with each other's ex.   What can I do? Am I wrong?  "
1521,My 1yr 3month old daughter crying every night,"Don't know what could it be but my daughter keeps on crying every night. She's sleeping and suddenly she starts crying. Hungry ? (She drinks her last bottle of milk around 8pm.) Maybe teething? (every night, don't think so) Miss being in mommy's and daddy's bed? (she cries even if she's in our bed) I'm out of ideas, and we are kind of exhausted! Any ideas what might be the reason for her to cry every night? "
1522,How do you choose a first pediatrician?,"While it would be great to be able to just use the doctor we were raised with...  assuming that's not possible:  How does one not merely locate a good first pediatrician, but evaluate them? What are good and bad things to watch for? How do you schedule an evaluation visit? "
1523,What is the best way to evaluate a daycare?,"What questions should I typically ask if the topics don't come up? Also, what should I be looking for that might not otherwise be pointed out, or worse things they may hope as a novice parent I won't notice? "
1524,Potty Training a stubborn 3 and a half year old,"My son has not been willing to potty train at all. He won't even sit on the potty - no matter what incentive we try to give him (candy, tv, etc). We have even taken to telling him that he will receive 1 m&amp;m or a show if he just tries to sit on the potty. We even got a sticker chart (with a star wars movie as a reward - something he really wants) and yet he still refuses to even sit on the potty (or toilet for that matter) or try underwear. I'm not sure what to do anymore. He knows when he has to poop; he goes to a corner of his room and then hides afterwards. Any suggestions?? I feel like he will never potty train. :( "
1525,Am I interrupting my husband's parenting?,"My husband and I constantly have communication problem against parenting. Since I posted here last time about the discrepancies of parenting between us, he was so happy that someone said I should not interrupt what he was doing with kids, and always said that I interrupted him now.  I surely agree and try not to intervene his parenting. But I also feel that either he or I have some misunderstanding about interruption/intervention. And as parents, we should learn to improve parenting instead of something like “so what, this is the way I do it, don’t interrupt me”. I’m not sure about other moms, but I really can’t bear hearing our boy crying. Many times as long as my husband was with the boy, I could hear the boy crying and I felt upset. Why would it be my fault that the boy crying with him (because I did in a nice way that the boy likes?)? Why can’t it be him not doing things properly or not really thinking what the boy thinks? Am I really interrupting him?  For example, early this morning, the kids’ school will have Halloween party and I was kind of late to take the boy to school. The boy ate most of the breakfast but I was hoping him eat some fruit too. So I asked my husband giving him some fruit while I can prepare for something else. Very soon after I left to another room, I heard the boy crying. When I came out, the boy said he wanted mommy to sit next to him instead of daddy. So I said, ok, let me handle it then. My husband thinks I was interrupting him. Later on, my husband tried to put shoes on the boy, but the boy resisted, cried, and asked me to put shoes on him instead. So I said, ok, let me put on the shoes and we leave. My husband said I was interrupting him so I didn’t do it. The boy struggled and cried, grabbed the shoes and ran to me asking me to put shoes on him. So I did. Did I really interrupt my husband? I really don’t want to ruin the boy’s mood in the morning. He already doesn’t like the morning drop-off at school, I don’t want to add any more unhappy mood to make it worse. Actually today he did cry sadly when I left the school and I felt my heart was torn apart. Did I do anything wrong? Is it my problem that the boy favours me over his daddy for most of things, brush his teeth, put his shoes on, play with him, put him to sleep, feed him (he can eat by himself but wants to be fed. I have to admit I didn’t do right about his eating habit at the beginning and should really change), take him to washroom, and change his clothes/diapers etc.?  Once when my husband put shoes on for the boy, the back of the shoes got bended in a little bit so the boy complained, but what he said was “it’s fine” and didn’t fix it, so I did. I can’t understand why it’s fine – we adult would feel uncomfortable when the back of the shoes got bended in, while would it be fine for a kid? My husband said that because he himself was spoiled by his mom he doesn’t want the same thing happens to our boy, but this doesn’t mean we can expect the kids to do something that we ourselves don’t like to do or don’t do! We parents should grow up, change ourselves, and play different roles when the life changes too!  I’m really frustrated. Sometimes I even think it would be much simpler taking care of kids by myself alone. "
1526,When should I take my pregnant wife to the hospital for nausea?,"My wife is 12 weeks along with our first child and we are very excited to be parents next year.  However, since about week 6, she has had quite a few bouts with nausea.  We were quite aware that this is normal in pregnancy and informed that it most often slackens in intensity during the second trimester (here's to hoping that's the case), but yesterday was probably the worst day yet.  She ate early in the morning and then was unable to hold down liquids or food for the remainder of the day.  This culminated in an evening of about 5-6 trips to the bathroom to vomit which made a rough total of about 9 or so episodes of vomiting.  Long story short, I was quite concerned and tried repeatedly to convince her that it was time to go into the hospital (Sunday night so urgent cares and/or doctor's offices were closed) so that she could get hydrated and possibly some nourishment.  My question is was I over-reacting?  If not, what are some ways that I could convince her that the hospital is the best bet?  (The situation was complicated by the fact that she was very tired, both from the dehydration and a poor night of sleep, so going into the hospital sounded like a terrible idea to her).  If it helps with severity of her symptoms she did mention this morning that she probably should have gone in last night.  I just want my wife and my growing child to be safe and healthy. "
1527,What methods improve creativity at an early age?,I have a 10 months old daughter and I have no experience regarding parenting at all. She seems to be very curious about the details of objects. For example when given a toy she always finds the small texts on the back or side of it and tries to touch them. She is also particularly interested in my all text books or any picture that has kind of a pattern. Is this normal for this age? This makes me feel she has the potential to become a smart person. I was wondering if this is true? And if yes are there methods to help her use this potential and improve her creativity? 
1528,What kind of controlled safe scientific experiments can be conducted on a baby?,"I have a 3-month-old baby and I was wondering what kind of controlled and most importantly, safe home-made scientific experiments I can do with my baby to understand his development, his behavior and his learning curve at different stages of growth.   I know this is mostly done by experts, but considering we have been gifted with a baby and that it is such a unique opportunity to learn about little humans we have at home, I wanted to know what other parents do to learn about their kids without compromising their safety obviously.   Taking this one step further, wouldn't it be amazing that parents all over the world could do safe controlled experiments and share the results? It would be like a global, open-source way of contributing to baby science.  Some examples could be: their reaction to music, sounds, moving objects, animals, colors, textures, technology, human interaction. How far they can see at each stage, when they are able to recognize themselves in a mirror (Toddlers And The Mirror Test)?, when can they grab different type of things? when will they begin using tools?, lots of other experiments related to language learning, etc. "
1529,How do you discourage a toddler from hitting people?,"From talking to other parents, it seems like most boys (children?) go through an early stage of hitting at around 1. I have a 14-month old (2nd) son who occasionally hits me in the face, and occasionally hits his big brother in the head with objects. His big brother is very good about not hitting back, and playdates have been pretty well monitored, so we're fairly sure no one is modelling this behaviour.  With the older son (who is now 5), we successfully discouraged this at the ~1-year-old stage by sternly saying ""no-hitting"" and grabbing his hand as soon as he did this. In retrospect, we believe our 1st seems to have been unusually well-behaved at this age (compared to our 2nd and anyone else's child we knew at 1 year old)  Our 2nd is perhaps a more typical boy, and shows much more signs of testosterone/aggressiveness, and challenges us and tests his boundaries much more often than our 1st did. The stern ""no-hitting"" doesn't seem to work so well, even when we follow up with a brief time-out (in the playpen, which is now almost strictly used for this purpose).  We've heard that all kids go through this phase, and that the more you make of it, the longer it lasts.   Does anyone have good advice on what do here to ensure this doesn't develop into something worse? Should we just stay on track with the stern ""no-hitting""/time-outs? Or should we ramp up the punishment somehow?  Or ignore it in the hopes he'll soon grow out of it?  Any research on this topic is especially appreciated. "
1530,What language should I use to talk to my baby?,"I know two languages: My 'mother tongue' and English. I used to speak my mother tongue until I moved to an English-speaking country at the age of 8.  Consequently, my mother tongue is at the level of a typical 8 year old i.e. I'm not very articulate, and I'm unable to express myself clearly and concisely in my mother tongue. When I'm speaking my mother tongue, I find that I use the grammar of my mother tongue, but English verbs and nouns.   Anyway, I have been speaking my mother tongue at home with my parents, and English with my friends, so my baby (fetus) has been exposed to both languages in equal amounts.  Which language should I use to communicate with her once she is born? I'm comfortable with 'baby talk' in both languages, but what about when she is older? My mother tongue feels more 'natural', however, my vocabulary is limited, while my grammar is perfect. With English, my vocabulary is wider, but I still do tend to make grammatical mistakes occasionally.  Even if I use my mother tongue, it will be interspersed with many English words, because I'm simply not fluent enough. With English, I can clearly communicate without mixing languages - My vocabulary is at the level of a native speaker.   In addition, I will be homeschooling her, teaching her to read and write.  I do not know how to read or write in my mother tongue - I don't even know how to read or write the alphabet.  With English, I can obviously read and write.  What do you recommend? I want her to grow up speaking both languages fluently - a true bilingual - unlike me, I feel like I only know one and a half languages, not two languages, if that makes sense.  *The reason that I'm illiterate in my mother tongue is because I went to a 'foreign or English school' in my home country. I've been speaking, reading and writing English since I was 5 years old. "
1531,How do you ween a toddler off of breastfeeding?,"All sources I can find agree that breastfeeding should stop slowly and gradually, and most of them say that it often happens naturally once the baby gets used to solid foods. Well, with our baby it didn't, so we are now when she is one year old looking to get this process started properly.  She eats solid foods and drinks water from a bottle all by herself, but still wants to nurse, especially to go to sleep. It seems to be mostly a comfort thing.  What recommendations do you have for a process to ween her off breastfeeding? Should we start with only breastfeeding during the night? Only the day? Hints for making her less interested in nursing? "
1532,"Does anyone recognize where the phrase ""Dinosaur on the button"" comes from?","Our 3.5-year-old son has picked up a catchphrase/joke punchline from somewhere... but we can't figure out where it came from, his teachers can't figure it out, his daycare teachers can't figure it out, and google has been no help at all. I even thought it might be some kind of mis-pronunciation degradation of something else. But ""dinosaur"" and ""button"" are both very clear, and are words well established in his vocabulary... he knows what they are.     Dinosaur, on the button!   There's a few different ways he presents it... the most common is to get our attention with a ""hey mom"" or ""moooommmmiiieeeee...."" and when we acknowledge him, he tells us, very matter of factly and proudly, ""Dinosaur on the button."" At other times it just comes out like a frustrated teenager trying to explain to the old folks why some concert tickets are an absolutely necessity... with an air of exasperation applied to the ""on the button"" bit. Once or twice, the dinosaur has been on something else... on the sofa, on the window... but it's pretty much always on the button. Dozens of times an hour.  I thought this was a short lived thing, a few days like everything else with toddlers seems to be when they first get it in their heads and are playing with it. But it's not going away, we're easily closing on a month now. I'm not trying to shut it down, we'd love to get into this fascination of his with him and help him explore it... but no clue what it is!  Does anyone recognize this from any kind of toddler media? Books, music, TV, movies? For all I know it's something one of his friends brought into school or daycare in their head and he picked it up from them. (in which case, it would be one of the more acceptable things he's picked up from them.) "
1533,"Kids Website, is it a good idea?","My daughter is just 4 months old. Being a software developer, I register two domains on her name, as soon as her name is finalized.  Now I was looking for some really eye catching kid website template. To my surprise, I didn't find many. Again few of my friends and relatives suggested not to put her website online, at least not too early.  Since I also not found many kids website/templates on net, now I'm forced to think again, if it is a good idea to create a kids website?  Are there any other parents who created website for their kids? If yes, are there some kids website templates available anywhere. Google seems not helping me a lot in this case. "
1534,Child throws things...how to handle it?,My 3 year old son has been throwing things when he gets mad at people. He basically needs a way to express his anger... How do I handle this? How do I discipline him? 
1535,Are boys fussier than girls?,"Ever since we announced we were going to have a second and it came out it was going to be a boy, I was relentlessly told that ""boys are fussier than girls"" when they are a baby. I wasn't inclined to believe such nonsense. It was all anecdotal evidence seasoned with the classic ""everyone knows that..."" argumentum ad populum.   Our boy was born and he is definitely more fussy than our daughter was. At the same time, he is also less colicky than she was. They were/are both healthy babies, growing normally, getting fed, clothed, and changed but it seems like, while she was able to be alone by herself for periods of time while we finished up the dishes or hung the laundry, he cannot stand being putting down.  Keeping in mind that fussy, in this instance, is clearly defined as ""fastidious about one's needs"" and ""hard to please"" do studies exist that investigate the idea that boys tend to require more attention from a parent while girls require less? If they do, what was the conclusion of that study? "
1536,What to do about a 5-year-old girl being violent and insulting?,"I have a 5-year-old daughter and an 8-year-old son. My daughter is normally a sweet, passionate, and loving child. There are no problems in school at all.  Lately, she has started being violent physically and verbally to me when she gets reprimanded or put in time out. I put her in her room and she proceeds to hit the door and scream at the top of her lungs. I have been making the mistake of going in there when she does this. Last night, she said she wanted to kill me. She hits herself in the head (lightly, of course) and also says she wants to be dead. My other mistake is I let this get to me and started crying, she fed off that too.  I realize this may be a phase. I know that when I respond she is getting attention, so if I stop am I just supposed to let her scream and bang the door? My husband is done with everything, he's fed up and has no more patience left. Any advice? "
1537,My child spit water in another kid's face - now what?,"At a Cub Scout event, my 7-year-old slurped water from a fountain and then squirted at another kid, thinking it was funny. The other child told me about it. My son's reaction has been stoical, he offered a half-hearted apology.  Needless to say the other parent is angry with me.  He started at a new school this year and has been acting out excessively. I'm scared he's becoming a loner at school because he plays rough. I'm looking for ideas on:   How do I discipline him for this effectively? How does he make restitution for his offense to the other party? Should I try to make amends, more than the apology I've already offered? What can I do to reach his heart and save him from becoming a future outcast in middle and high school?  "
1538,Assessing behavioural difficulties in toddler,How would a behavioral specialist assess behavioural traits for a stubborn 18 month old toddler who cannot speak yet ?  Will the exercise even get to the root of the problem or even achieve desired results ? 
1539,"What would be a reason for a child with good reading skills to ""pretend-read"" stuff?","My child (6), before she learned reading for real, had a habit of ""reading"" things like toy instructions, or promotional fliers, etc... - we joked that she learned to read from my T-shirts :)  What puzzles me is that now, several years later, when she's a fluent and voracious reader and reading books above her grade level with ease, she STILL keeps several of these faux reading things in her room and once in a while ""reads"" them as a game (they are clearly NOT a source of information - she'd use the same ones for months before I throw them out as too dirty and she gets new ones).  First guess would have been that this is emulating a parent reading a newspaper - BUT we don't have any paper newspapers/magazines in the house, only electronic.  When questioned as to why she does this, she doesn't have any coherent explanation aside from ""it's fun"". Which is good enough for me but still leaves me with a giant ""WHY!?!?!"" in my head.  So, why would a child exibit such a peculiar behavior? When I recall myself at that age, I never ""pretended"" to read like that. "
1540,What do I do when the timeout method isn't working?,"   Possible Duplicate:   What do we do when timeouts are not effective?       My littler girl just turned 2 but is as smart as a whip! I am having trouble with the timeout method.  I am being consistent and doing the steps just like on the supernanny website.  Unfortunately, when I get down to her eye level she is just ready to say sorry and a hug and ready to run! It is almost robotic at this point.  Also, I tell her over and over about nice touches! She knows the difference but she is consistently in time out for the same things over and over all day long! How can I get through to her? "
1541,Gaming for Kids,"My daughter is getting excited to be playing games with my wife and I. My issue lies in the fact that growing up (some time ago) I wasn't allowed to play games very often. Things change and I get that, so my core question is:  What games should I be introducing her to?  And  How do you introduce a five year old to gaming? "
1542,Do some baby's eyes produce water more than others?,"Our 12 week old daughter has watery eyes occasionally, even when she isn't crying. She produced tears from a few days old, which has been remarked on by others as unusual.  It doesn't seem to cause her any discomfort, and I guess it could be because she barely ever blinks, and is constantly staring with wide eyed wonder at this new world of hers. (Or it could be hayfever.)  We are going to the doctors just to get her checked out, but I suspect they will say it is nothing, unless I can provide some suggestions.  Do some babies have watery eyes in absence of an allergy or medical issue? What else could cause this? "
1543,4 months Infant is swallowing hair,We have 4 months baby.  We have recently observed some hair strands. We have noticed that he plucks hair from his hair or mother’s hair and he puts the same hand into mouth for sucking. In this process he is swallowing hair.   This is a bit concerns us. Swallowing hair is dangerous? And how to avoid him swallowing hair? 
1544,1-month baby crying when on floor,"I am a first time father with 1-month old DS. My wife has been exclusively breastfeeding, 20 mins on each breast every two hours. Currently both my wife and the baby are on a medication because they have thrush.  I have some issue with how my baby is doing in relation to the situation my wife and I are in.  I had about two weeks off work to help out my wife in raising the baby. He basically starts crying when he is in unwanted position. The only position in which he would not cry is having his chest up on my shoulder. Everytime my wife and I try putting him on the floor or making him sit or holding him on his back to our chests, he bursts out crying like he lost his world.  It's quite okay for me to hold him on the shoulder but as my leave is going to end soon, I am very worried that my wife would have hard time alone with the baby at home without anyone helping her. (She would have to eat, sleep etc but could not do so without the baby off her body)  An additional issue is that the baby is sleeping for an average of 8 hours a day most of which is through the night which will make my wife's job even harder. (He wakes up everytime we put him to his crib and starts crying) Breastfeeding is IMO quite efficient as there is not much resting between sucks.   Because we also have hard time making him fall asleep at night (wakes up when he lies down), we have been considering to put him to sleep training  So based on the above, the questions are:  Is there anything we could do to make him like other cuddling positions at least?   Is the amount of his sleep okay?   Is sleep training appropriate at his age? There are some methods suggesting Cry-It-Out, but wouldn't it harm babies' growth?  Any advice or opinion is greatly appreciated. "
1545,"Responsibility, Real Choices, and Consequences","How do you best approach (if, at all) teaching children in the late toddler to preschool age groups about responsibility - not responsibility as in doing chores (which we have a good handle on), but as in making choices that have meaningful consequences?  One example of this is that when we go out for dessert, we let our almost-three year old choose to forgo dessert for a small toy (like a car) that is the same cost as the dessert we'd have bought him.  This often works well, or at least without argument, when dessert is consumed at home or when the choice is made at the dessert place (where he often chooses the at-hand dessert).    However, if he chooses the toy and then after that, Mom or Dad get dessert, he often will through a tantrum if he's not allowed to eat a significant portion of said dessert.  The only solution we've found is to discard the dessert at that point, which doesn't really make anyone happy (but stops the tantrum).  Reminding him about the toy doesn't seem to make a difference; he regrets his choice at that point.  What good solutions are there to helping him cope with his choice?  Is this even a good idea at this age (34 months)?  Are there better ways to teach meaningful choices that are more effective at learning?  Or is this just one of the many difficult things you have to do as good parents? "
1546,Are there any concrete citations for the range of expected costs of raising a child?,"Past Parenting.SE questions have asked about the affordability of having a child but didn't provide a specific estimate of what it actually costs.  I found this USDA report, which estimates the cost of raising a newborn child from 0 to 18 by a two-parent family to be around $250,000. But that number doesn't provide much in the way of a range of estimates.  For example, is it likely that my expenses will be between [tex]270,000, or is it more like it'll be somewhere between [tex]400,000? That variability is important -- there's a big difference between needing to spend [tex]400,000!  So, the single-point estimate doesn't tell me much in terms of how expensive it really is to raise a kid. Obviously every child is different, but are there any citations that can provide more of an expected range for whether I can responsibly afford it? "
1547,What language should I speak to my daughter?,"I am a Greek, born, living and working in France, married to an Albanian woman, working all day in English.  I have a 2,5 year old daughter, who lived from:    September 2014 to April 2015 and February 2014 to April 2014   in Albania (11 months, approx. 36% of her lifespan), where people only talked albanian to her.  I speak only French with my child, BUT I only speak Greek with my wife, because she refuses to speak French with me, because she is insecure in French. Yet, my wife speaks Albanian to my child.  These facts lead to the circumstance, that the language development of my child seems a bit delayed, because she doesn't yet make three word sentences.  Though I am a little worried about her language development, I want to know, if there is a problem if I also start speaking English to her on a regular basis, since I heard that children are capable growing up learning different languages.  Is there something like a burnout/depression danger in children? Since I can see it in her eyes that she wants to communicate but is not able to and I can see it bothering her a lot.  Should I cut my communication with my daughter down to only French? Should I cut it down to speaking Greek with her, since this is the language I speak with her mother every day? Or should I just continue mixing everything up? Or can I even start speaking English with her?  I don't want her to struggle to the point of extreme frustration, but if this means that in the end, her language development will catch up to normal kids, I am inclined to let her struggle a bit. So are there any longterm deficits for her, if I introduce English?  Please advice.  George "
1548,3.5 month old wakes up from nap after 30 mins and will only go back to sleep by feeding,"My little guy has never been a great sleeper but we hand him on a pretty rough schedule up until last week. He had to go to the hospital for 3 days. He is well now but his naps are completely off. He is easy to get down, probably because I feed him to sleep (another problem I want to work on) but he has been waking up at EVERY nap after 30 mins. I try letting him cry for a few minutes (never works) going in and patting him, giving him his pacifier, sometimes I pick him up, nothing works. I finally give him a bottle and that sometimes gets him back to sleep. I have to feed him for about 10 mins and try to quickly switch out his paci for his bottle but he usually wakes up and I have to start the feeding process over again. Most days I just give up and end the ""nap"" by getting him up for a real feeding.    How do get him not to wake up after only 30 mins? How do I get him to go back to sleep with out feeding him? He sleeps pretty well at night. We put him down around 8, wakes up at 3, asleep again until 6 so I know he is capable of going back to sleep on his own. We swaddle at naps and bedtime and his room is dark.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!!  "
1549,Non-judgmental all round parenting of a child: Any resources?,"How do you allow a child the freedom to fail and make mistakes while ensuring that they are learning from it. Just because a child refuses to conform does not make him/her a loser/problem/etc. Just because they are doing well now does not mean they will be like that for ever. You will never know when some one could blossom into a butterfly or have a humbling fall from grace. I don’t want to be a helicopter parent, but I also don’t want to be reckless and harm my child’s life and/or wash my hands of what is definitely my responsibility.  Example 1: Suppose they are hanging out with the wrong crowd. Maybe this will teach them a good lesson in life because you never know when someone will come across a character who may have malicious intentions. Learning to deal with such people should be part of life. At the same time, I don’t want my kid to turn into a criminal, getting sucked into something into/witness acts of criminality. I want my kid to know when to draw the line and I would encourage them to have diverse friends from diverse backgrounds.  Example 2: Just because a child does not do well in studies does not mean they can't succeed (in the eyes of the society) at a later point in time. But I don’t want to ignore not doing well in studies because that might be a sign of delinquency and/or lead to criminal behavior. ( I am not saying that there are no educated criminals .. but you should get the idea).  My questions are : Is there a good heuristic/rule of thumb I can use to ensure that my child is not becoming a delinquent/threat to society and maybe lean on being somewhat productive in the eyes of society? I don’t mean that as an act of external validation, but we are social creatures and people's opinion of you matters to a certain degree.  How can I ensure that my love/affection for the child is not letting me see the reality of what they are becoming in case it is something problematic?  Preferably I would want to train my child (because that is my job) to be a self educated person who can handle the stress and surprises life has to offer and that means learning to deal with both success and failure, learning to deal with happiness and sadness.  I would prefer some scientific literature or books/resources based on such literature that doesn't put meaning into every single act/incident and/or overly blames/praises either the child/parent for what they have/will become.  There is only so much you can do after all right? "
1550,How do I resolve a child's anxiety for war?,"Missile warning siren tests are going to be conducted in Hawaii once per month.  Presumably the government will start distributing information on shelters and how to shelter in place, and some schools will add ""Duck and cover"" style training to their emergency preparation strategies.  I recall as a young child (age 7-9) in the late 70's and early 80's doing such training in school, and reading headlines about possible war, and felt some anxiety about it, worrying that war would suddenly break out in our back yard and my family would be affected. I don't believe I expressed that fear to any adults, and simply lived with it for years.   How can I explain the situation to my children without scaring or scarring them? What questions can I ask them to uncover hidden or unresolved fears and anxieties? When, or at what age, should these things be discussed, alternately how should they be approached at each stage of life? What mental and emotional tools can I teach them so they can deal with these worries and anxieties in unfamiliar situations? Where do I find additional resources to help me - in terms of keywords or search terms - for either books, instruction, teaching, or professionals to help me tackle this issue?   I have a large family with children ranging from 1 to 17, so please don't restrict your answers to the hypothetical 7-9 year old I was when I originally faced these fears. Also it's been pointed out that children already participate in a number of other drills, so while I'm focused on war, consider generalizing your answer if the same advice applies to many types of anxiety causing events. "
1551,How should I tell my parents that I smoke?,"I'm a 19-year-old man. I have a job and live with uncle and auntie, because my parents don't live in the country I live in.  I don't plan to quit smoking, at least for now ,because it does have almost the same effect as some medications I would have to take (as it is to calm me down).  Is there a nice way to tell them that I smoke? Or should I wait more? "
1552,How can I help my toddler feel confident in his communication?,"My two-and-a-half year old communicates very well, and we talk constantly about things he sees, or what he's feeling, or just about his toys. However, when he uses longer sentences or words that are newer to him, I occasionally have trouble understanding what he's saying. In these cases, I'll usually cheerfully respond with something to the effect of, ""what was that, sweetheart?"" but then he acts embarrassed and either shakes his head or says something like, ""why are you saying that!"" (referring to himself, presumably) before running off to play with his toys.  Is this common with children who are learning to communicate more complex ideas? How can I help him feel more confident in his communication, and specifically, how can I help him feel empowered to try out new words and sentences without feeling embarrassed? "
1553,How and when should I teach my children how to swim?,"I personally want to teach my children (all under 6yo) how to swim. What readiness guidelines should I use to determine if they're ready to start? What things should I teach them first? Are there good resources (online videos or sites) that teach parents to teach their children to swim?  This is a ""do-it-yourself"" question, so suggesting that I put my children in swim classes is not an answer that I'm looking for. "
1554,How old is old enough for a girl to have her ears pierced?,"Some people like piercing girls' ears at a very young age so that they ""aren't old enough to be afraid of the pain"", while others think that the child should have the option to choose to do this, even if they are a young age that is, arguably, easily manipulated by society to believe that ear piercing is the ""right"" thing to do.    So, what is everyone's opinions on this matter? Should a parent wait until the girl is old enough to at least acknowledge the decision? Should the parent wait until they are at a ""mature enough level"" to decide this in a semi-adult fashion (e.g. 10+ years old)? "
1555,"In case of swallowed medicine, call poison control or 911?","I haven't had to experience this situation, but a story made me wonder what I should do in the event that someone swallows a lot of chemicals- enough to potentially be lethal, maybe.  A specific example: Someone swallows several bottles of pills. I find them and they tell me what they did, or their actions are readily apparent- somehow I know what they've done. Should I call poison control first or 911? Should I just try to get to the ER with them as fast as possible? "
1556,How do you deal with a spoiled niece?,"My 8 year old niece (actually my cousin's daughter) is really quite spoiled. Her parents constantly bribe her to get her to do what they want.  We sometimes take vacations together.  On these vacations, she insists on specific rewards just for going out.  My wife and I refuse to participate in this behavior, and we don't want to give her any presents. Yet if we don't, she demands a present, and then pitches a fit until her parents get her one instead.   We're not thrilled about exposing my 3 year old son to this behavior, but it seems unlikely we'll be able to avoid it forever (and we don't want to cut that part of our family our of our lives; my cousin and his wife are actually quite nice).  How can we mitigate the girl's behavior, and it's impact on my son? Is there a way to turn this into a positive lesson for him? "
1557,My 7 year old daughter is the team cry baby...how do I help her stop?,"My seven year old daughter plays on a soccer team. She loves soccer. She is not the best player and not the worst. She is however, the team crybaby. She finds some reason to cry every single game and practice. She fakes injuries, gets frustrated and cries in front of everyone when she doesn't score a goal, and is the first one to say, ""We're never going to beat the other team.""   Personally, I always HATED that kid on my team, and now I'm that kid's mom. She does love to play and has fun when things are going her way. She's getting too old for this babyish behavior, and quite frankly, it is embarrassing when 10 other girls and their parents are staring at us because she's being a baby about missing a shot, or because she's too hot. I mean, who cries because they are too hot? No one else's kid does. I am not a negative parent.   I tell always encourage her and always tell her when I'm proud of her. I don't say anything to her when she is acting like a baby. I just tell her very calmly to take a deep breath, take a look at the situation, and go from there...sometimes this works and she catches herself, most of the time she doesn't. In every other aspect of her life, she is pleasant, a team player, and a leader. Just not on the soccer field....any ideas on how to stop her from being the team crybaby and to stop being the negative Nellie on the field?  "
1558,How can I help my son develop a social life? How can I prevent him becoming socially isolated?,"I have a 17 year old son who is spends a lot of time programming his computer. He does not have a girlfriend, and seems to have no interest in getting one. He rarely goes outside.  I am worried that he will become socially isolated. I am worried that lack of social activity will lower his resiliance, and make mental health problems more likely.  How can I help him develop a social life? How can I prevent him becoming socially isolated? Is being a virgin at 17 something odd or unusual or something to be worried about? "
1559,What are examples of child-friendly rap?,"My 10-year old son is interested in hip-hop dances. When I asked him about whether he'd like to write rap songs, he said it would interest him.  I want to take a piece of rap lyrics and then show him, how it's structured and how the rhymes are connected to the beats.  The only problem I have is finding child-friendly rap. My favorite is Eminem, but I'm not aware of any of his songs suitable for a child this age.  Are there any songs, which   have the typical rap structure and are suitable for a 10-year old child?   Note: I intend to create something like this video, but without the F, M*F and the B words. I'm not looking for such videos, I'm looking for ""clean"" rap songs, for which I could do such video myself.  Update 1: Mase seems to be clean, at least in this video.  Update 2: As well as Scroobius Pip's Get Better. "
1560,My 9 year old son regards life as meaningless,"My son, who is currently 9 years of age, tells me that life is absolutely meaningless and that ""we're all here to waste time"".   When he first told me this, I felt both angry and depressed.   And no, this is not because I am religious. I am an atheist, but I think his outlook on life is detrimental.  From an even younger age, teachers and I myself have observed that he is very intelligent, mature and highly interested in mathematics and physics since an early age.   One thing that I think is leading him to believe that life is meaningless is because he's very anti-social and often teachers tell me that he never talks in class and remains aloof (in his own world).   Some of his behavioral attributes include:   Was a late talker - didn't talk til he was 6. He spends most of his time alone outside in a forest and the only time I speak with him is when he comes for dinner, breakfast and lunch.  When he's home, he rarely talks to me other than on eating occasions.  I have been since consequently told that he is ""different in a strange way"" by many people.    Somebody suggested that I give him the internet so he could search around, make friends and other things. He only used it three times and told me that ""It's a great place to attain knowledge but other than that, it's horrible.""  After this, I consulted a teacher from his school and she told me that I should sit down and talk with him.   And this is when he told me that life is meaningless. He said,      ""Look. I know what you are trying to do. I know that you're worried   about me. I know that you've been talking to a lot of people about my   behaviour. But why do you want me to live my life the way others want?   Life, by it's nature, is absolutely meaningless. Imagine yourself to   suddenly wake up in a room, knowing of nothing, except the fact that   you'll die within the next two hours. Would you attach importance to   anything you would do during this period? Ofcourse not! All I know is   that I am alive, a son of yours, on a beautiful diverse planet   somewhere in the cosmos, and all I am interested is in knowing why did   we acquire existence. This may be impossible, but I'd rather pursue   the great impossible than spend my life living accordingly to the   sentiments of people!""   He has no friends and nobody that even knows him properly. I feel that he'll go on to acquire mental illnesses as he ages, I don't know why but I don't feel good. Is there anyway to convince my son not to adopt this nihilistic outlook on life?  Edit #1:  After reading all of the answers, I decided to convince him to visit a psychologist to be introduced to a society bearing children with ""interests similar to his"" but he wholeheartedly rejected this and is instead urging for a visit to MIT and spend a hour with some people named ""string theorists"". He is saying that he has ""formulated five logical alterations of general relativity"" but there is a very critical mathematical inconsistency in the fourth. He told me that, ""String theory is a lovely marriage of the quantum and macro worlds and is arguably the among finest mathematical achievements we have seen in years, but it's a little bland and most likely a fluff. Since string theorists are great mathematicians, I think they'll help me sort the issue out. But they're likely to be intimidated and even humiliated, psychologically, by my age and won't take me seriously. But it doesn't hurt to try. If that doesn't work, maybe you can assist me in publishing an article in a science journal. And no, as a son, my love for you is inherent but I don't want to meet some snobby know-it-all children. I am not interested.""   I told him that I'll take him to MIT next month, but I don't think I can really do that. How will I get the scientists in there to talk to my son? Will they allow it? How can I tell them about this? And above all, what if I can't and how will I tell my son this? He was so happy when I told im I'll take him to MIT. Furthermore, I would like to add that he found out all about physics and mathematics by reading from my husband's vast collection of books. My husband was a mathematician with interest in physics and philosophy as a hobby, and he suffered from schizophrenia in his later life and passed away when my son was five.  "
1561,"Are same-gender classrooms better for girls, or mixed-gender classrooms better for boys?","I've heard that girls learn better in an all-girl classroom setting, but that boys learn better in a mixed boy/girl classroom composition.

1562,Question about Diaper lining elastic band?,"I've noticed that the disposable diapers I use on my children have an elastic band around the legs (blue arrow in image below). Sometimes, if care is not taken, the diaper ""flap"" (red arrow in image below), will be folded inwards, such that the elastic band (blue arrow) is not against the skin. Does it matter if the elastic (blue arrow) is directly against the skin? Should I bother to make sure that the elastic is against the skin? I'd like to see an official reference on whether it matters, since I have a disagreement with my wife regarding the matter.  I assert that care should be taken to ensure the elastic is directly against the skin, whereas my wife thinks it does not matter at all if the diaper ""flap"" (red arrow) is folded under, such that the elastic is not directly against the skin.   "
1563,Reading to a colicky infant?,"My 4-week-old daughter suffers from extreme gas pain that leaves her spending very few waking hours in a content, attentive state. Our lives for the past month have literally been about near-constant soothing over 90% of the time she's awake. Through generous application of the 5 S techniques from Dr. Karp's ""Happiest Baby on the Block"" we are able to keep her below the 3-hours-a-day 3-times-a-week qualification to officially declare her as colicky, but if we weren't constantly soothing her, I'm sure that she'd qualify.  I'd like to do everything I can to give her every advantage. One component of that should be reading to her regularly. However, with constant pain and the related crying/soothing there seems to be no opportunities left to read to her. The amount of time she spends in a quiet, attentive state each day measures in a handful of minutes. We're spending those moments talking to her, getting face-to-face time, and occasionally introducing high-contrast visual stimuli.  When should we become concerned about not having enough time spent reading? Is there any benefit to reading to her while she is sleeping?   I'm not so much worried about the time spent right now, but if this continues for 3, 6, or 9 months (as we've heard could be the case), then I'm concerned that the only word she'll know is ""Shhhhhhh"" "
1564,Are modern cloth diapers really cost efficient compared to disposible diapers?,"Are modern cloth diapers such as gDiapers or bumGenius really cost efficient compared to disposible diapers?  It seems the diapers themselves are quite expensive and then you have to include the cost of cleaning them, and have enough on hand that you don't run out.  Do they really work out cheaper in the long run? "
1565,Is it dangerous to swaddle a baby that can roll over?,"I have heard that it is an absolute must that you stop swaddling your baby once they are able to roll over, due to the potential that they could roll over onto their stomach and then be unable to roll back to their back due to the swaddle holding their arms down.   To me, this seems suspect; if they can roll over while swaddled, why would it be more difficult to roll back?   Is it actually dangerous to swaddle a baby who is capable of rolling over? "
1566,Is it better to get an infant car seat or a convertible?,Is it better to get an infant car seat or a seat that converts from one stage to the next?  Is there any benefit to the infant car seat that justifies paying for an infant car seat and a toddler car seat? 
1567,Validity on a study about spanking children,"Earlier today, I got into an argument with someone about spanking children and whether or not it caused them to become more violent later in life in addition to other issues. Eventually, this article surfaced and we debated its merits.      A new book by Murray Straus, founder and co-director of the Family Research Lab and professor emeritus of sociology at the University of New Hampshire, brings together more than four decades of research that makes the definitive case against spanking, including how it slows cognitive development and increases antisocial and criminal behavior.   Is this a valid study?  If not, what are some more reliable studies?  Please do not link this to any of the previous questions.  I would like answers about this study in particular.   "
1568,When/how is it safe to go running with baby?,"My partner is an avid trail runner and before I was pregnant I didn't mind getting out too. At the very least I hope to do some brisk trail walking with baby.  I'd assumed to run with a baby you had to use a ""jogging""-style stroller/pram. But I just read in another question it's possible to run with baby in a sling? Is this correct?   What is ""safe"" for using a baby-backpack? I know you can walk in these, but can you run?  Are there age limitations?  Ideally I'll be able to chuck my partner outside with baby tied to them if one or both of them are sooky with instructions to knock each other out.    Edit: Looking for answers that provide options as to what is possible and what people's experiences have been, rather than flat out ""No, don't"".   ""Running"" in my question refers to the full spectrum of ambulation > walking and I was hoping it would be understood that running involving baby would mean slow even careful jog or trot, by people who are regular, experienced runners. Obviously sprinting and similar is just silly and seems obviously dangerous, I sincerely doubt that we'll realistically have the energy for anything vigorous for a while. "
1569,How do you teach toddlers to defend themselves?,"How do you teach kids to defend themselves, without becoming bullies? I'm talking about younger kids (1.5 to 3yo) who are not mature enough (or old enough) to take self-defense classes.  My son is two and a half, and he's a bit on the small side; he has a lot of older cousins (and younger cousins) whom, for lack of a better word, get physical him.  Having them take his toys or food is ok. But what I'm talking about is when they:   Hit him Hit him hard Bite him (he has scars from one bite-mark) Push him down (especially if he's running and he falls)   What can I teach him to defend himself, but without becoming a bully? In the past, two techniques that worked adequately were:   Leaving the situation (running from biters) Complaining to an adult   However, these are both dependent on a parent being available immediately to assess the situation (and see who's the wrong party), and in the long-term, this will make him dependent on external authority to hold his own.  Looking forward, if he goes to school and gets into a tough fight, I don't want him to be ""easy pickings"" for bullies or to always be the losing end of the (hopefully very rare) fight; I want him to have the skills and confidence to hold is own. Without degenerating into becoming a bully.  What techniques have you used on your kids which worked? "

1571,What are some hacks and gadgets for a soon-to-be dad?,"My wife's pregnant, and December I am going to be a father for the first time. Apart of being happy and exited, I am asking myself:  1) Are there any hacks I could apply to this new life situation?  2) Are there any gadgets/apps that might help me with that?  I am not a gadget type of man. For example I don't even have a wrist watch, but I could imagine having a watch being helpful. I like having processes working in the background, so I don't have to remember everything. Have you heard of this guy who recorded every sound produced by his child, until he(or she) started talking? I don't want to be extreme like him, but I am thinking on a similar wave line.  I am going to extend my GTD to this new life chapter, and I am sure I will find plenty of websites about kids stuff like strollers or toys. This question is more about stuff regular parents don't know about. Home automations for monitoring the environment, eye masks (or blindfolds, I don't know how you call them) for taking a naps, apps on the smartphone... anything. "
1572,What methods are effective for teaching vocabulary to young children?,"What method is effective for teaching very young children vocabulary? I mean that you have a way of continuously teaching them more; you don't just run out. And you can tell it works, because when they identify the item the second time, they can put a name to it.  Most parents start naming household items, which is great (and practical), but you very quickly run out of items to name. YouTube is great for wild-life (different animals, birds, sea life, etc.) but I'm hesitant to stick my toddler in front of a screen for an extended period of time at his age.  What methods have you used that worked? Books are ok too, but run out too quickly. "

Is what the doctor said true?   If she indeed needs to stop we are planning on giving our son soymilk as replacement for the breastmilk. Are there any other good suggestions regarding this?  Edited : Hi guys, until now, my wife is still doing tandem nursing. But we are planning to stop breastfeeding my first son. It makes me very sad actually. But it must be done, because tandem nursing make my wife's healthy condition is becoming worse. When she often breastfeeding my first son, my wife is getting flu.

She has 5 classes in high school, 4 out of 5 classes she does great in. She has all A's and B's in those classes. This one particular class she is struggling hard core. Not because she can't do it, but because she turns her work in late and gets half the grade, which in turn drops her grade extremely low.   We have been dealing with this since school has started this year and it is the only class that this occurs! I try to talk with her and understand why, the only ""excuse"" I ever get is because she does not finish it on time. This particular assignment is due the same time every week, Friday right when class starts.   I have tried grounding, I think she has been grounded since school has started (I feel like). Her grounding usually consists of all electronics are taken away (phone, tv, netflix, etc) She has her normal chores around the house. This is not working and I am at a lose.   I am struggling because I do not want to take a way her social life, she barely has one to begin with. She is not in sports, she does not go to parties, she does not stay with anyone. This is not because she is always grounded, this is because she has 2 ""real"" friends. Suggestions??? Thoughts??? "
1577,How can I avoid ugly arguments with my wife?,"I was recently playing a board game with my 12 year-old son and wife of 18 years. We reached a point in the game where it was my turn to play while my wife could win the game with her next move. Because my son's turn was next, I did not block her, forcing him to block her or else lose the game.  I pointed this out to him, and he, half-jokingly, also declined to block her.   My wife and I wound up in an argument about whether goal is to win, or to enjoy ourselves. Tempers escalated, and son ran crying to his room, etc, etc. We eventually realized that we had a fundamental difference of philosophy about playing games, and we both explained our points-of-view to my son, who seemed to understand our different opinions.  How would you have handled this situation?  Should we have to set the boundaries of whether we are playing ""serious"" or not at the start of the game?  Should I have just let it go?  Any other advice? "

I'd not seen this before. Is it a common thing? ..and is it a good idea? "
1579,How long is breastfeeding effective and worthwhile?,"I realize that this question can have many personal or subjective viewpoints, so the answer I'm looking for is what the best-known data shows us from two perspectives:   Is there an average breastfeeding duration that is found in other mammals? This should perhaps be normalized based on the gestational period.  What does the data say about breast milk providing continued benefit? In particular, is there a certain age or weight after which breast milk no longer provides measurable or worthwhile benefit?

If I ask him for help, he will raise his voice and said why? why I do not ask his brother for help. If I say dinner is ready, he will say, I am not hungry, what's for dinner, I don't like it, why you always cook so bad? If I say it's time for bed....   He has an excuse for everything, he doesn't want to clean his room, today he expend 3  hours cleaning. His punishment are no playing computer, xbox, no tv, or just stay inside in his bedroom. He is not allow to yell, kick or slam the door, but he will do it, because he said he is angry and it is our fault because we punish him.   I also feel that we love his little brother more that him, because we don't punish him. My 5 years boy is so different, if he drip water on the floor on the table, he will say sorry mama I will clean it right now. My 8 years boy, won't notice it, he won't apologize, if I tell my 5 years clean your bedroom, he will say okey mama.   It is so hard for me, I am just getting crazy with my boy, I do not know what to do. I try a calendar of behavior and put color green, yellow and red, but he will so upset when he get yellow or red. We were in therapy 3 years before we put him on medicine. I feel very disappointed of myself, I don't know what to do. I start yelling now, and I don't want to lose my temper. Any help? "
1581,"Understanding the idea of ""fears"" as a young child","While watching the Lion King with my older toddler (almost 3), he asked me an interesting question I couldn't answer.  During the scene with Scar and the hyenas, I asked him if it was scary (as I was concerned it might be).  He said yes, and asked me ""Why is it scary?"".  Further questioning made it clear that he did think it was scary, but he didn't understand why, and I didn't come up with a good way to explain why something would be scary.  How do you explain what ""scary"" is to a toddler or preschooler?  Not so much concerned with how to deal with being scared, that I seem to understand - but I feel like he needs to know what ""scary"" really means. "
1582,"Raising a tri-lingual child, tricky context","I have found many of the topics here very interesting, but would like to share my personal situation, as it is quite specific, to see if you guys have any advice or experiences to share. :)  I am German, and my wife is Hungarian. We live in Sweden (I work in Denmark), and are currently expecting our first child. My Hungarian is very rudimentary, my wife's German is quite good. Nevertheless, our language of communication is English (also the language we work in).  We definitely want to bring our child up with our heritage languages, Hungarian and German. Additionally, there will be a third language involved as soon as the child enters day care, which is possible at age one here. I am a bit torn between Swedish and English as the third language. Normally I would go for the local language Swedish, to enable the child to speak the language of the country it lives in. I really like Swedish as well, and am able to communicate in it at a basic level myself. However, my wife is not that fond of living in Scandinavia, therefore it is hard to foresee for how long we will actually stay here.  English on the other side is generally a very useful language, even if we move somewhere else, as other countries generally have international/English kindergardens or schools. I feel that this decision should be made early on, in order not to confuse the child, or rip it out of a language context and leave it ill-equiped in a third country.  Do any of you have experiences with a similar situation? How did you decide? What challenges did you face along the way?  The last question is a more concrete one: It seems that most parents follow the ""one parent one language"" approach, which to me makes sense. But how do you handle the language spoken between you and your partner in front of the child, if it is a third one? As described, we usually communicate in English. We could however also switch to German, to keep the languages in the house limited to 2.  This question is a bit related to the previous decision: IF we decide to make Swedish the third language (therefore sending the child to Swedish day care etc.), talking English to each other would mean that the child would actually be exposed to 4 languages. :)  Again, I am happy with any advice or experiences you can share.

We started him with some very basic piano lessons (30 min/week) from an instructor who specializes in teaching children and got him a keyboard (Casio) for Christmas.   We're having him practice for a short, 10-15 minute stretch every day. And I sit down with him and instruct him what to work on (based on teacher's homework instructions). He has a very good attention span and can handle this without fuss (usually).   My sister has a niece who started at 10, is 12 now, and is playing Mozart rather impressively.   My sister feels that 5 might be too young, and I've often heard that you shouldn't pressure kids too early with music.  QUESTION: Am I ""pressuring"" him too much simply by asking him to do this? Is this too young to start with a structured approach to music learning? How do you encourage such a young child to practice without ""pressuring""? Can that be done?  I'm not necessarily trying to cultivate a virtuoso -- I would be more than happy if my son ever gets as good as my niece is now. I just feel that early exposure to music is good for the mind and the soul.  "
1584,Step Parent - To be concerned or not to be,"Brief history:  Became involved with a young woman, knowing she had a 5 year old daughter. Biological dad was in the picture til daughter was 2-3, and then left the state. Strangled mother while pregnant, does drugs, all around no-good.   My fiance (young woman) lived with her parents, and her parents generally raised daughter. When I came into the picture, fiance started coming around me more often and daughter grew to love me. However, there was definitely a noticeable need from daughter to be with grandparents and quite frequently.  We became pregnant and had a beautiful baby boy. Now my family consists of Myself, Mother, Daughter, and son.  The mother and grandmother are pretty close I would say and whenever the grandmother wants to see daughter, Mother let's her go. This has, in my opinion, gotten a bit out of hand when all summer (2+ months - EVERY weekend) daughter goes to her grandparent's house all the time.   Now, from her perspective - She was a single child, who inherited a brother. I'm generally gone during the week days working, and she has to fight for her mother's attention with her little brother. But when the grandparent's beckon her, she gets attention from both grandparents and they leave the boy home with us. So she gets undivided attention from two people instead of having to share one person's attention with her brother.  From my perspective. I don't get much time with either child during the week. My only time to spend with them is on the weekends. I expressed my thoughts to Mother - I don't get to see them. I'm trying to blend this family, but every time I have an inkling of time to spend with them together, she bails and goes and gets that 2 on 1 attention. When we are together we are two peas in a pod and vibe really well. I love her and try and do cool things with her and teach her. I've also bought us a new home that fits all of us with plenty of play room and got a new job to support all of these changes.  Now, we have another child on the way and I think it's super important for her to stay with us on the weekends. We are essentially making rules for my boy, and making daughter follow them too because now he looks up to her and does what she does. We are holding her accountable which without a doubt is probably a bit harder on her than when she was an only child, because she is constantly being told not to do something for reasons a, b. But we are explaining to her why we are enforcing these rules...we aren't just hushing her and sending her away. We take the time.  If she continues to go away on the weekends I feel like she will become alienated when the new baby arrives. I feel like she will pick up habits of her grandparents instead of habits of our family. I guess I'm curious if I'm being overbearing here...am I wrong to want her to stay with us? I mean sure get out every other weekend and get some time away with your grandparents (who spoil the heck out of her). But the majority of the time should be spent with us...  So another point is I'm the step-father. I feel like if I start enforcing this stuff with her mother, I will be looked at as the bad guy. I don't want to make either party upset, but this weekend for example she was gone from Friday 4pm to Sunday 5pm. I barely saw her at all. I was a bit upset about that. Do I have a right?  Any advice is much appreciated. Sorry for the length, but this does require some explanation. Thanks in advance!  UPDATE 1: Mother's thoughts - Mother sees things from both perspectives. She has usually allowed daughter to go with grandparents regularly because she, as a child, went to her grandparents regularly. My concern is that her parents didn't really prepare fiance for life and a lot of that fell on my shoulders. So when I raise my concern she sees it and feels deeply for the situation and tries to make adjustments but ends up just telling the grandparents ""OP wants to spend more time with daughter so your weekends are cut off"" Which ends up making them resent me.  Update 2: Questions to myself-  It seems the grandparents have assisted in raising her as some commenters have mentioned. To answer some questions: I do feel like there is a power struggle. I will make house rules, and have a clip down system (taken from her school) so if she's bad three times she will need to go in timeout or whatever fitting punishment at that time. I enforce this. Mother enforces it when I'm gone. When she goes to grandparents she has free reign and no boundaries and comes back with no sense of accountability and does what she wants. Do I feel the need to have control? Yes, I would say I do feel the need to have control. Because of poor choices made in the past, which we are all guilty of, this girl has a void in her heart. I want to have at least a part in making that better, and filling that void as a father figure that loves her mother, and her. Grandparents are coming in as psuedo parent's and when they get two-on-one time it generates momentum in another direction. Then I find myself asking if she even wants to be here? If 9 times out of 10 she chooses to go hang out with them, does she want to live there?   Seems general consensus is to seek family counseling, which we will look into but I guess I am looking for some kind of validation here. If I'm invalid in my behavior and thoughts I can change and I will be the change, but I need to know if I'm way off base or if this makes sense. "
1585,Embarrassing experience with my nephew; Should I tell his parents?,"The experience and my actions at the time:  Three years ago, my nephew was three years old, in the middle of his potty training. After lunch with the family everyone went outside, he and his older brother (who was 6 back then) joined me near the computer like they always did, playing together some classic games.  At some point I excused myself to the nearby toilet room leaving the two of them to themselves with a game they both knew and loved. While I was still in the middle, the three year old nephew entered the bathroom and said he had to use it and asked for my help.  I have seen his parents take him to the bathroom before and under normal circumstances I would have just gone and called them; however I wasn't in any condition to get out of the room. I asked him to go ask his parents or hold a few minutes until I was done but he didn't budge and insisted on immediate action.  Fearing he would mess his pants I got up and helped him through the whole process. He pretty much did everything on his own, probably he was at a stage where he still needed the supervision. After he was done he went out, I returned to the room a few minutes later to find both brothers playing as usual.  I considered telling his parents, asking if I acted properly but was too embarrassed to mention it and it didn't happen again.   My question and debates:   Should I have done anything different? If so, what and at which point? Should I have told his parents afterwards, even if just to inform them?   Now father to a 2-year-old toddler I do realize I might be making it a much bigger deal than what it really was; on one hand parents always want to know what their child is doing but on the other hand maybe such a thing is totally normal. (Potty training has not started yet for my daughter so can't really tell.)  Any insights will be welcome! "
1586,Should I allow my child to make an alternate meal if they do not like anything served at mealtime?,"Should I allow my child to make an alternate meal if they do not like anything served at mealtime?  If a child decides that they don't want anything that is served at mealtime should they be allowed to make a sandwich, or should they go without?  I am approaching this from trying to encourage eating of healthy foods and trying new foods.   I am not always able to include something that the child will like in the meal.   I have searched around but I have not found how anyone else approaches this scenario. "
1587,How to tell kids about divorce when only one parent still loves the other?,"Imagine a scenario in which parents are fighting because one is no longer in love with the other.   They eventually decide to divorce, instead of living together but no longer as a real couple. The parent who's still in love with the other is leaving the household, the no-longer-loving parent is remaining with the kids.  When, what and how should the children be told about it? The children are 5 and 7 years old.  Should the kids be made aware that one parent is still loving the other, who is however no longer interested in the marriage? Or should the boys simply be told that the marriage is in crisis, without specifying the actual reasons?  My fear is that simply stating that the parents do not love each other any more will not be the truth and will put exceedingly the blame on the loving partner. This is a crucial issue as the non-loving partner is facing a personal crisis and partly rejecting the parenting role. "
1588,How should I handle an 8 year old lawyering and quibbling?,"How should I handle an 8 year old lawyering and quibbling?  E.g., anytime he has a rule, or a task, or is told what to do, his FIRST impulse is nearly 100% to find some fault with the technicality or wording and either start arguing based on that, or simply not do and then when asked explain ""Well you said it THIS way"".  Just to be clear - this is on topics where he knows 100% certainty what the spirit of what's being told to him is... he literally does what in adult would be called ""Lawyering"".  This isn't even limited to things he doesn't like or objects to - he simply enjoys the process of finding loopholes. Which would be fine if he was a law student and not an 8YO child who actually needs to do things he's told to do.  One of my problems is that I don't want to clamp down TOO hard - first, because it shows he has good brains and lets him exercise them; and second because later in life it IS a very valuable skill to have, even to a non-lawyer.   But at this point this create actual practical problems - critical things not done, or tons of my times wasted on close supervision of things that he's perfectly capable of doing on his own since age of 3 (e.g. brushing teeth or dressing or eating or cleanup etc...).   My main concern isn't stopping the behavior completely, but limiting it to things that aren't critical/important or time-sensitive situations. He doesn't seem to care when it's appropriate to quibble and laywer and when not.  Examples:   ""I'm Done with breakfast"". ""Did you finish eating?"". ""Yes"". ""OK, get ready for school"". Then I walk up to where he ate and notice he didn't drink his juice milk. ""Why didn't you drink, and why did you say you finish""? ""Well, you asked about EATING. I finished EATING, but not drinking"". Just to be clear, he knows perfectly well (and confirmed it) that what he was being asked was whether he finished his entire breakfast, liquids included. ""Please take all the books you were reading that are now strewn around your room to the bookshelf?"" ""OK"". 15 mins later, find a bunch of books still in the room. ""Why didn't you take these?"" ""They aren't books I was reading, they are activity books"". Again, he very happily confirms that he knows full well activity books are included in ""books"", or that the goal of the excercise was to make his room tidy. ""Please clean up your toys from the floor of the room"". 10 mins later ... ""Why are these 5 things still on the floor""? ""Well, my sister played with them, so they aren't 'MINE'"". ""Didn't you play with them TOGETHER""? ""Yes"". ""So do you think I meant to include them in the cleanup""? ""Yes, you did"". ""Why did you hit your sister when throwing that thing? Didn't I tell you to NOT throw it when she's standing in front of you and tell her to move away so you won't hit her?"" ""Well, she wasn't standing. She was sitting"".  "
1589,What to do about my 3-year-old crying and throwing a fit about going to daycare?,"My 3-year-old girl is really upset about going to our childcare provider. She starts off crying and then she screams, wets her pants, and runs off; it's horrible! She starts the night before by asking her mom and me, ""Do you have to work tomorrow, Daddy?"" I say yes and she starts crying.  What do I do? "
1590,It's winter. How to dress up my 2-year-old daughter for daycare?,"I'm a first-time mom to a 2-year-old girl. This is the first winter when I send her to daycare and I'm really unsure about how to dress her up. Earlier when she was home, we used to step out together. So I was essentially dressing her up for the moment and not for the whole day.  Ideally I want to dress her up such that she doesn't get too warm inside, but is comfortable when outdoors. They don't go out, if it's below 35 degrees or snowing. Also, she isn't very verbal, so she can't ask the teacher to help her take off her jacket if she gets warm indoors. It's impractical for me to assume that the teachers will take off both sweater and jacket so that she can cool off indoors, and then bundle her up again (they have 14 kids.. And I don't want to be 'that' mom).  My questions are:   What is warmer - fleece pants/fleece lined jeans/ good ol' jeans or sweatpants?  Do we get knee length warm thick socks in her sizes? When they go out to play (when it's in late 30's- 40's) is it better to wear one thick puffer jacket or layer with a sweater/sweater dress and a pea coat?  "

1592,"How can I, as a father, help develop my 5-year-old daughter's self-esteem?","I was was distant from her when she was a baby till 1.5 years old because of struggling through my own problems, and eventually separated from her mother for a year. And even though I have gotten extensive help for my issues and have worked to repair my marrige - my now 5-year-old is now acting out to get my attention. Help, how do I help her and I have a healthier relationship?  I know I need to work extra hard to help her feel more secure and valued especially from me. But how do I do that? I had a rough childhood, and I know that I felt unimportant as one of my parents' 9 children, and I do not want to do that to my daughter. I just don't know what to actually do to start healing her and giving her what she needs.   Any suggestions and help welcome. "
1593,Appropriate confrontational behaviour to teach a 2-year-old?,"At my two-year-old daughter's nursery, there's one ""energetic"" boy who is perhaps a little lacking in the empathy or discipline department. What I'm saying is, he occasionally behaves too roughly towards the other children, going as far as hitting them. Now I'm sure it's nothing too extreme - there's adult supervision after all, and I know he's reprimanded when caught - but what I'd like to ask is: what behaviour should I teach my daughter when he's hitting her? I see two alternatives:   Fight fire with fire. Encourage her to hit him back. Obviously, there are problems with this approach. I'd very much like to convey to her that hitting is not-okay behaviour. However, I definitely do not want her to fall into a victim role, and being proactively defiant may help with that. Also, the boy might benefit, when he realizes that there are boundaries that can not be crossed without repercussions. Have her respond verbally: yell at him not to hit her. This is more in line with avoiding not-okay behaviour (hitting), but I'm not sure this will have the desired effect of him not hitting her. Encourage her to ask the adults for help. This is my least preferred course of action, because it is the least self-reliant, and I'd rather she feels self-empowered to deal with these situations.   Are there other ways I could pursue? "
1594,"How to handle 5-year-old granddaughter shouting ""Get out"" (of her room)?","If you walk into our 5-year-old granddaughter's room while she is playing with her dolls, she will tell you ""I want time alone"" and if you do not leave within several seconds she will look at you in a mean way and in a horrible voice tell you to ""Get Out!""  My husband and I will be visiting her in a few weeks.  Do we as grandparents discipline her? How do we handle this? "
1595,How do you choose a pet for a household with children?,"My wife and I are thinking about getting a pet, so my daughter (now 3 months old) can learn about animals growing up.  What factors should influence the pet we choose?  Is there anyway to tell if the child and the pet are compatible?  "
1596,Should we protect our childred from getting ill?,"Nowadays there are very few sicknesses that a toddler or a pre-schooler can catch and that will kill or irreversibly harm him. Most bacteria infections can be treated and there is little real danger. Viral infections are rarely lethal.  Many parents attempt to put the baby in a protective bubble - don't let them get wet, so that they won't catch a cold, don't take them to a pool, because they can get an ear infection, and so on.  On the other hand, since most catchable diseases are curable, we could let our children go and get cold and wet, let their organisms strenghten, and if they get sick, we can treat them accordingly.  What do you think is the correct approach? What is best for our children? What kind of middle ground between the two extremes should we attempt to reach? Or is one of the extremes a good solution?  Is there trustworthy research which proves one way is better than other for long-term health? "
1597,Clean children vs dirty children,"Which is better for toddler/pre-schooler's health? To let them get dirty (play as they will in sand, mud, dust, seawater) and wash them appropriately or try to keep them clean? What impacts do these two different approaches have on children's health? Is there trustworthy research which proves one way is better than other for long-term health?  This question is not about basic hygiene, like washing hands before eating, which is of course necessary; it's about a general parenting approach to our children's level of dirtyness "
1598,Lying to my daughter about her mother's death,"My 10-year-old daughter's mother died last week. She was a masochist and suffered from depression and childhood issues. She, from what I understand, hung herself in her closet from a belt. I'm not sure if she intended to kill herself or if she was trying to ""get off"" and wasn't able to get the belt off in time. There was no note AFAIK, so my guess is it was the latter, I want to think it was an accident but neither would surprise me.  As far as my daughter knows, her mother had a heart attack. She's taken the news really well so far. She gets teary-eyed from time to time when I really try to press the subject of her mother's death but she is otherwise acting like nothing happened.  My brother is a psychologist and a grief counselor. I asked him for advice on the subject and he said she seems healthy but that I should try to evoke a response from her regarding her mother's death as it's unhealthy to hold those feeling in. We wrote her letters and burned them. I try to talk to her about it at least once a day but I never get much of a reaction from her other than teary eyes. She hasn't really vocally cried since we initially told her and even then it wasn't much.   Since her death we've moved into a bigger place, closer to her school. She's excited about having a bigger room and getting to sleep in a little bit. Maybe that excitement is helping to mask the pain somewhat. At least I feel like that's the effect it's had on me.  Anyway, I don't like lying to my daughter but I feel justified in this case, and one day, years down the road I plan to tell her the truth. In the mean time it's been really hard to evoke a reaction from her as my brother suggested. I believe it's important that she cries to get those feeling out and it's occurred to me that if I tell her the truth about her mother's death that might evoke a reaction.  Should I tell my daughter the truth about her mom's death or continue to live a lie, risking that I might slip up and accidentally refer to her mother's suicide or that she might hear me discussing it with church leaders or other family? I feel like this will be a hard lie to maintain. If not, what other things can I do to help my daughter get those emotions out?  Edit.. I think telling her would help me with my own grieving process as well. Maybe that's selfish. I just want to do whatever is right and best for my daughter though.    Update... A few important points....   I've seen people on this site try to ask questions in lieu of therapy. I'm not one of those people. I'm asking to supplement therapy. We are in contact with several therapists - the problem is there is often no consensus among them, so in order to make the best possible decision I'm asking the community as well. My brother is neither my therapist, nor my daughter's therapist. In fact we don't even speak very often as he lives out of state. I only just recently found out he was a psychologist. That said, he has been an invaluable resource to me because he knew me as a child and in many cases I'm learning that he knows me better than I know myself. He's also a somewhat prominent figure in my church, which means he's sort of a one-stop-shop for all my general spiritual and psychological questions... but he is definitely not my therapist nor is acting in that capacity. I told her the truth yesterday and it turned out to be a good thing I did, as it filled in some of the puzzle pieces for her and answered certain questions that she had.   Thank you all for your advice and your opinions. "
1599,Should I really be insisting that my daughter finish eating her meal?,"Like many young children, my 4.5 year old daughter will often stop eating her supper (6 PMish - she has breakfast and lunch at daycare) and say she's not hungry.  My instinctive initial response is to insist in some fashion because that's what my parents always did.  The assumption seems to be along the lines that they're just being picky or distracted, and will get hungry later, and that they need to learn to eat on a schedule.  But regardless of whether she'll be hungry 3 hours later, what if she really isn't hungry now - aren't I doing her a disservice in her development by ingraining the idea that she should keep eating when she's not hungry?  What should I do, just a gentle reminder that this will be her last meal of the night? "
1600,"Is tickling ""cruel""?","At the risk of asking a subjective question, I recently heard from another parent that tickling triggers the same nerves as pain receptors but at significantly lower levels of intensity. Is that true? If so, is tickling considered ""cruel"" and could it affect growth/development?  "
1601,How can I help a child who won't talk to anybody at school? Selective mutism,"Although I am not a parent, I am interning in social work.  I am currently working with a student in an elementary school who does not speak. The parents have explained that she does speak at home (I also witnessed her speaking to her mother outside of the school), but she has not said a word since she began school in August.  I work with her individually and in a group, and she still refrains from speaking in both settings.  We wonder if the cause is anxiety because she's not speaking at school but she is at home.  Have any of you experienced something similar with your children? What can we do as school staff to create an environment that is more comfortable/less anxiety-inducing for her? "
1602,Can anyone give me advice on my son's father?,"I'm having a hard time right now dealing with my son's father. We are both 27 and I met him 2 years ago. I also have an 8-year-old-daughter whose father is not in her life. I raised her on my own and her father told me from the beginning he wasn't going to be around and I accepted that and created a beautiful life with her.  When I was 4 months pregnant (with his baby) I found out he had slept with a 16 year old (he was 25 at the time). In Canada (where we live) the age of consent is sadly, 16. I was mortified when I found out, because it goes against everything I know to be morally right. I later then found out that when he was 19 he dated a 15 year old for a couple of years.   When we were together the first time, I left my son and his father together for a weekend. I came back to lots of porn on the computer, which is attached to the TV in the living room. But that's not the most disturbing part; it's the fact that he watches Youtube music videos and gets off to them.   Now, my daughter likes to watch those types of music videos for the music, and it just highly disturbs me to know he gets off to that, and not knowing where my son was when he was doing it is another thing that really bothers me. I also found that he was watching porn on my daughter's iPad, which I pretty much begged him not to do in the beginning as I don't need my daughter seeing such things. He did his best to delete it, but come on, where are his morals?   Unfortunately, his mother did not raise him properly, and he has such a disrespect for women. He likes things done his way, and if it's not done that way he gets mad. When we were together as well he had a problem staring at women (the young ones with barely any clothing on), I brought it up many times and he said he knows he does it and that he will stop and he never did. He would say things like ""I was never taught to not stare,"" and ""it's harder to not stare,"" and ""I don't even know I'm doing it"". However, he's not abusive in any way towards me or the children.   This relationship left me with zero self confidence but that is besides the point; it's not about our relationship; it's about him and his child's relationship.   My major concern is the fact that he has never gotten help for the way he was raised, the fact that several times he has told me he knows he needs help. He says he doesn't like the person he is, and doesn't want to be that way anymore, but he still hasn't gone to get help.   It worries me that he will one day look at my daughter sexually because of his enjoyment of younger girls, and if not my daughter then her friends.   I also fear that our son will learn his ways of disrespecting women and thinking it's ok to take advantage of young girls for his own sexual wants.   We separated 2 weeks ago. Yesterday he started asking to see the kids. If this goes to court, I can't see a judge taking any of my concerns into consideration as it's all speculation, but I truly do just want my kids to be happy and be raised in a healthy environment.    I in no way want him out of the picture. I want him to be a positive role model for his son, and even though he wants to be in my daughter's life, I have a very hard time with that right now, especially since he has told me twice now that he loves my daughter more than he loves his own son who is now 7 months old. That is not something I enjoyed hearing. He has a massive family too, and I have no family just me and my kids and I just want the best for them.   I guess my question is whether or not I should let my kids near him.   Am I just being selfish or are my concerns actually legitimate? Because I do truly feel he needs help of some sort to not only become a happier person (he never laughs!) but to become a positive role model to his child that can protect him and show him the right path in life. Any help would be greatly appreciated.   "
1603,Check pregnancy,"Is it true that instead of using a home pregnancy test you can you lay on your tummy and check for a pulse on your belly button?

1604,Why does my baby cry when I hold her while sitting down?,"It drives me crazy. Usually when I hold her in my arms, everything goes well if I am standing up and walking around in the house. However, when I sit down (because at some point I get tired), after a few minutes, she starts crying and never stops until I get up and walk again. She is about 6 weeks old.  Notes: I have the habit of often rocking her gently when I hold her while standing up. But I don't think this is the reason because when I sit down, I try to do the same but it is ineffective. It often happens in the evening, before going to bed. Also, I remember one of her older brother (she has two) was doing the same when he was a baby too (and it drove me crazy too).  Why can't I just sit down? What can I do to rest my feet? "
1605,My 8-year-old son is still soiling and wetting himself. Please help!,"My 8-year-old son has been wetting and soiling himself for a long time now. We have been referred to hospital specialist nurses who are helping retrain his bladder. This was over 18 months ago and we are still no further. They told us that he may not know when he needs to go the toilet but can't say this is definitely the reason behind the accidents. They have said they can't do anything about the bowel side of things until bladder problem is under control.   It is occurring everywhere: school, out shopping, family outings, parties, at home, literally anywhere.  He won't tell us until we smell him at bedtime. If he has soiled or wet he will hide his pants and won't clean himself up.   We have tried many approaches: Talking, trying timers, a wobl watch from hospital, reward charts, naughty step, making him clean his own underwear, taking away privileges, stopping sleepovers, making him strip off bed each day when he has had accidents through the night. Honestly the list goes on. Nothing at all is working.   After all these years I'm at the end of my tether. I am getting upset and find myself crying over this when he isn't around. He is now in year 4 and residential trips are coming up which he isn't allowed on if he still has these problems because of hygiene reasons and because of other children who are also on trip. He is being tested for autism through school.   Can anyone help me at all? I need some advice on what to do next. Should I be asking to speak to anyone else? "
1606,My 22mo son stuck a pinto bean up his nose. How should it be extracted?,"We tried plugging the un-entered nostril and blowing in to his mouth and got nothing but boogers coming out. We went to urgent care and they had us repeat the same ""trick"" and nothing came out. They didn't see anything through the small scope thing they use with the disposable cones. They just said to watch for ""pussy looking"" boogers and a fever.  My son slept in short periods but awoke every 30-40 minutes crying and rubbing his nose which is abnormal to his sleeping routine.  Has anyone else had this happen with their kids? What was the treatment?  I guess i'm looking more for other's experience with this and information on treatment more than anything.  "
1607,Co-sleeping with a crawler,"We co-sleep with our little one and it has generally been very successful. Now she is on the brink of learning how to crawl, and we are worried that she might crawl off the bottom of the bed while we are sleeping.  How do people avoid this happening? Will she automatically not do this or will we notice if she does?  "
1608,Should I stop my mother in law visiting when she doesn't respect me as the father figure?,"Sadly these are her words, not mine. Why is this posted in this QA site? Because I can't see how it is good for the children that she (when my wife is not around) shouts at me in front of them; cuts across me when I'm talking to them; and takes them away from me when I'm playing with them, and they don't say no since she generally has some sort of sweet or present nearby.   She claims to be an expert on childcare so anything I say is immediately shot down. I don't know what to do. I can't see that it's healthy for the kids.   If I discipline them and they are sat out, she cuddles them. Is this simply my total lack of understanding of what grandparents are for (as mine were distant to say the least) or what? This has been going on now for four years and includes lies to my wife (which the MIL has admitted to me). I don't want to whine to my wife as she shouldn't be in the middle of this. "
1609,What are some coping strategies to deal with infant allergies?,"Both my sons have had allergies, my oldest has been able to cope and his have not been as bad as my youngest who just turned one.  My oldest seems to just deal with it now, but my youngest seems to be really bad some days.  He has the signs, dark circles under the eyes, runny nose, slight coughing; we think its probably dust and maybe seasonal as my wife and I both have that.  We have central air in the house, which has been outfitted with a UV light on the air return and I use the allergen filters in the furnace, the vents have been cleaned recently as well and we noticed a sudden flare up of allergy with our youngest for a couple days after.  Are there are good coping strategies we can do with an infant to alleviate his symptoms?  With our oldest when we asked about allergies our pediatrician at the time said it was too early to test, so we haven't checked with the youngest.  My wife has mentioned floor vent filters, but I'm not sure if they would work.  I would invest in a HEPA filter, but they seem expensive and if it won't do much I'd hate to waste the money.  Anyone found any solutions that work with infants? "
1610,I suspect my teenager is using illegal drugs; what should I do?,"Beyond the usual teenage mood-swings, my teen's behavior has become unusually erratic.  He stays out late, and seems to go out of his way to avoid me when he comes home.  His sleep patterns seem completely random, and I don't trust the people he's been hanging out with.  Should I confront him?  Should I search his room to see if I can find any evidence?  Should I tell him he can't hang out with ""that crowd"" anymore?  If I do confront him, I have no idea how to go about it.  Any suggestions would be appreciated! "
1611,How to teach a 4 year old reading?,"I tried to start with ""A fat cat sat on a fat rat"".  Is it all about mugging up or is there a proper technique for learning the spellings of words?  Basically now I realize that the my aim is to teach her to read. I thought teaching her spellings will help.   How should I proceed? "
1612,How to discipline our 16-month-old son who stopped listening to us and started to misbehave?,"Our 1-year- and 4-month-old son's behavior was perfect before - he always listened to us. But now it seems that he takes a completely different direction.   For example, we explain to him that touching a socket is dangerous, but he keeps doing it. Or he starts to beat other people and so on...   Maybe it’s a special period? He is teething and has a seasonal cold. How should we behave? How to make our child do the right thing? "
1613,My one year old son doesn't want to eat. What happened to my son?,"When my son was under 11 months old, he ate a lot, but I don't know what changed when he reached 1 year old. It seems like he doesn't like to eat. When we give our son food, sometimes he tries to taste or eat it a little, but then refuses to eat it. I heard from a neighbor that the he may be bored with the food, so we served him different food, but he still doesn't seem to be interested. We also tried to change the way we gave the food to our son, but that didn't solve the problem either. One thing that keeps me a little more calm is that lately he more often asks to be breastfed. Maybe this is caused by his eating less solid food.  I've heard that this phase is pretty normal for all children. What has actually happened to our son in this phase? What makes him not want to eat the food we give him? He has asked for food, but then doesn't eat it. Is it enough that we focus on giving him more in breastfeeding? Because when he doesn't eat as much solid food, he asks for breastfeeding more often. "
1614,Does daycare help to speed up the development of motor skills?,I have heard about studies that show second/third/etc children's motor skills develop quicker in an effort to keep up with their older sibling(s).  Is this also true for eldest children in a daycare setting with older children?  Are there studies to support this as well? 
1615,Does sleep training make sense for a baby with intermittent sleep difficulty?,"We are pretty lucky as far as sleep goes. We have a 6 month old who generally sleeps through the night.  ...except that when going down to sleep (unless she's completely wiped out) she cries and we need to take measures like rubbing her belly in order to get her to calm down and go to sleep. (Although, she does actually use her thumb as well to pacify herself.) After her first 45 minute sleep cycle she may or may not wake up again and need the same thing. And in the process of going to sleep during that first sleep cycle she may or may not wake up and need the same thing.  But after the first sleep cycle, she seems to be out for the rest of the night. Conceivably, she's sort of waking up between sleep cycles I suppose, and getting herself back down to sleep during this time?  Would sleep training (such as the Ferber method or something else) work for us in this case or not? "
1616,Am getting emotionally distant from my mother day by day. What can I do to mend the bond?,"I'm a child and not a parent. I don't understand what to do in the situation I'm describing below.  I have both my parents and a brother.   It all started a 2 years back.  2 years back we were all living a happy life, understanding each other and obviously loving each other. Smiling at each other. Most importantly I used to share everything with my parents.  It was my 10th standard with I joined a tuition class nearby. That Aunty who taught us was (is) a wonderful and a helpful person and so I used to stay after class for about 10-15 minutes daily discussing the new things which I found out in maths (she taught us maths) while hoping to get some more facts regarding that topic. I constantly told my parents how awesome she was*. My parents then decided to visit her place once for the praise.  *but at times I also told that her teaching style didn't suite me well, we never had discussions in her class. Which I don't think was the reason behind my parents' visit, because I praised more.  I don't know what happened that day at her place. But I soon released that it wasn't a good meeting, when my mother asked me: why I disturbed her after classes and tried to ""teach"" her? Soon after my mother started thinking that I wanted to ""show off"" my knowledge in front of her*. I must say, I really had no intentions of doing this. So I started leaving the class before everyone else.   *It took me about a week to completely realise what my mom was actually asking me, obviously she didn't ask me this directly.  After that incident I don't feel comfortable in sharing anything with my mother, since my mother started blaming me for everything that happened in my life, it felt as if suddenly everyone else became ideal humans for her.  This distancing increased when I became busy studying for JEE. I really conversed very less with her,  I and my dad both were interested in tech and science we both talked a lot about latest things happening around the globe.  Probably my mom started thinking that I didn't want to talk to her. This I feel has made her irritate on tiny mistakes of mine.   To add more trouble: my brother is really a smart child, he knows very well how to escape situations* and very good at fooling others. At times I shout at him mainly to make him close doors behind him, to wash his hands and legs properly after playing in the mud (my parents are not bothered much about this but he really comes out of the bathroom in just a few seconds, obviously without touching soup). This shouting triggers response at the other corner of the house and my mother comes running and then starts shouting on me without having a look at his mistakes).   *He initiates the fight and then escapes by doing what I wanted him to do since the beginning, and hence giving my mother a reason to shout at me: ""don't you have patience?"". I'm sure that if the situation would not have turned this serious my brother would never listen to me.   Today I had another serious verbal fight with my parents regarding my brother's irritating actions and his uncleanliness. I think my dad understands what is going on and so every time he controls the situation by making my mother quite without telling me anything, this obviously irritates my mother.  My mother, today told that even the maid working at our neighbour's house has a better life than hers because she is the one who has to listen to my dad.  I believe that the meeting with my teacher has made my mother look at me with a foul vision. My mother now always tries to find my faults*. And our relation is now not so good. Now, I try to avoid interactions with her.   *to such a limit that it made her think that I have so much of attitude that I couldn't ask for another roti myself during dinners. While watching TV with my father and brother, I really didn't see how much of roti is remaining in my plate and so didn't bother to ask for more roti(s). I was so engrossed in watching television that I actually didn't concentrate on eating, and quietly picked up rotis being placed on the dining table.  There have been numerous verbal fights between me and my brother, and hence There have been quite a lot of incidents when my dad has controlled my mother without telling anything to me.  Of course there some more factors which have led to this situation, like to avoid talking to my mother I started watching TV during dinners, earlier we used to discuss what had happened that day.  I am now feeling as if I'm not living with my own family, there is no love, no laughing, no jokes shared. Everyone is very ""serious"" now. No one smiling. There is an imaginary boundary separating us now. We're becoming robots now.  Is there anything I could do now? Ps: I cried while writing this "
1617,When should kids get a cellphone?,"It seems everybody and his cat has a smartphone today. (I'm guilty too.) My son will probably demand his own phone somewhere between the age of 7 and 12. I know I can't compare to when I was a kid because the world is completely different today. So how can I decide?     When should kids get their own cellphone? What factors are relevant for the decision? Smartphone, or plain cellphone? Why?  "
1618,How do I explain to my five year old daughter that I am seeing someone?,"My daughters father and I broke up 2 years ago. I am now dating a wonderful man who I am very happy with, but I am not sure how to explain this to my five year old daughter. She is very good friends with his daughter and has met him before when they've had play dates but she doesn't know that we are now dating. His daughter does not know either. He told me he wanted to tell his daughter, and I agree that the time is right I just don't know what to do. Should we tell them together or tell them separately? Is there a right or wrong way to go about this? Any tips or suggestions? "
1619,"If I want to ensure my kids are bilingual, how should I decide which language to use when with them?","Suppose I have a kid and I want them to be bilingual. Does it confuse a child when you speak two languages to them? If so, how does one avoid this? But I don't know much about how language develops so I'm not really sure how to approach the problem. But I have read numerous times that children become bilignual far more readily if you introduce the languages early during the critical years between roughly 0-5 years old.   For instance, one strategy I thought of was to speak a particular language when in particular rooms in a house. For instance, suppose I speak Spanish when in the kitchen but English when I am in their bedroom reading a book to them.  "
1620,What can I do to help my kid attain a high Intelligence?,"My daughter is 3 months old and has started responding to my and my partner's voices. We talk to her in different languages, play soft classical music, show her how to use her hand, and do all other stuff that keep her interested. While not substantiated, we believe that these activities help her learn faster.  Are there any other tried and tested methods to help my kid attain a high Intelligence? Specifically, are there any toys and activities that have been scientifically shown to be effective? "

1622,How can I get my 5 year old son to be a better listener and have respect for his classmates and teachers?,"My son is 5 years old and started kindergarten this fall. We are almost at the end of the second semester and his behavior seems to be deteriorating instead of improving. Today we got this email from his teacher:      Your son had a difficult day today. Even cried a few times when he didn't get his way. I think he's done learning and just wants a break for now . Most of my younger kids in class are having a hard time focusing last couple of weeks. Totally understandable. Even as adults we get tired of the same routine and work. Please let me know what motivates him. What can I do to get him back on track? I will not give him harder work to challenge him as I feel he will completely shut down. He refuses to do the work we have, so harder work makes no sense. He is extremely smart and can do higher level work but I feel he will act out more. What do you think? Now that he is more comfortable he wants everything to be on his own terms and learning and listening is not something he wants to do. We had visitors today during our presentations and we had to remove him from the carpet to sit at his desk for 5 mins. because he wouldn't let presenters talk. He did great btw! He just had a hard time letting others have their turn. It breaks my heart to have to discipline him.  Any feedback from you is very valuable!   Please can you share some suggestions to help this very energetic  5 year old boy to focus, be a better listener and respect others.  "
1623,"Signs a child is ""over scheduled""?","I read all over that kids like routine but how can you tell if they are ""over scheduled""? But I also read it is good to take your kids out and ""explore"". I have lately been taking my child to story time at various libraries. I don't want to ""over schedule"" her but for my sanity as well, it is good to get out of the house. I am planning a lot of weekend excursions (zoo, parks, festivals) so the thought crept into my head.  School days, when I think about it, are pretty long days, 5 days a week so it makes me think that kids can handle a pretty rigorous schedule. Do the rules/guidelines/old wives' tales change for younger kids (I.e. toddlers and kids under 4) who have less of an attention span? "
1624,How to provide the most support to children as an 'uncle' with only monthly visits,"As a side effect of some volunteering I do, I find myself playing something of an 'uncle' like relationship for some of the children of women I've volunteering with.  I love children and am more then happy to play that role, and of course only do so when encouraged to by the parents.  Some of their kids grow attached to me, and as it is now I currently have at least half a dozen sets of kids that look forward to my visits and their parents encourage me to know and be involved with them, acting in something of a quasi uncle like role with the children when visiting.  The kids vary in ages, though generally all younger then teens.  I only visit these kids occasionally, Level of contact depends on many things but generally after I'm no longer actively volunteering with them I'll still occasionally visit somewhere between once a month to once every other month.    Many of these kids do not have a traditional father.  Most either have a single mother, or two mothers.  The father is usually either completely out of the child's life, or plays a minor, and not always positive, role in their lives.  Most of the kids are still well adjusted, with two parents that care for them, but I think part of the reason some latch on to me so quickly is because I am a male.  Anyways, I enjoy spending time with and playing with these kids.  However, I would love to help encourage the kids in any way I can.  I'm wondering if there is anything I can do as an 'Uncle' to help the encourage growth and positive development for the kids; beyond simply playing with them and making them feel important.  Again, the kids are all generally already loved with good parents, in fact it's pretty much guaranteed that the parents are good parents who would raise the children well for me to know the family to begin with.  The kids aren't desperate for love or emotional support etc; though occasionally perhaps at least curious about having a male role model (though usually I'm not the sole male role model).    Are there things I can focus on to try to make the most of my limited visits with these kids while I'm with them?  Beyond playing and having fun, which is a given, what small things might I try to do to help encourage the children I'm playing 'Uncle' for?  Can I really have any impact on them with such infrequent visits, even if they do look forward to them? "
1625,How do you get a primary schooler to continue doing chores when their friends don't have to?,I am reading the book P.E.T. about communicating with children and there is a question: an 11 year old asks: “How come I have to take care of the yard and take the garbage out? Rey’s parents do not make him do all that stuff!  You're not fair! Kids shouldn’t have to do that much work. Nobody has to do all the stupid things I have to do”.  How do you address this? 
1626,Should I expose them to cartoons of the past?,"I grew up with Tom &amp; Jerry classics (e.g [website]I personally feel that cartoons of today are bloated and dangerous.  So, should I control what cartoons the kids watch? Should I expose them to what I think are quality cartoons? "
1627,How much instruction should be incorporated into a pre-schooler's art activities?,"We've set aside one evening a week as our dedicated family craft night.  That doesn't preclude us from doing craft projects at other times, of course, but rather ensures that my son gets at least a regular minimal exposure.  The craft sessions tend to be short, based upon the project and my son's attention span (he's almost 5).  When we're doing art projects (drawing, painting, gluing, etc.), how much guidance or instruction should we be giving to my son?  I want him to create the things he wants to create, instead of what we think he might want to create, and he's certainly welcome to color outside the lines as much as he'd like (both literally and metaphorically), but at the same time, I want to encourage him to start building up better skills and techniques.  Part of this stems from my recent venture into painting for recreation.  I have essentially no training, and haven't painted anything since I was a kid using watercolors and fingerpaints.  I'm ""learning by doing"", and, by doing so, I'm finding how much technique and practice can be involved in being able to express oneself artistically.  So, should I be teaching my son anything at this point, or just letting him have fun?  If I just let him have fun with it, when should artistic skills be actively taught?  If I teach him now, what types of things should I be teaching him?  Things like ""if you're painting something, make sure you haven't missed spots where you wanted color"" and the basic concepts of color mixing?  Or should I include things like brush techniques, layering, or other, more ""advanced"" tricks?  How do I ensure that these craft projects remain fun while building his skills? "
1628,How to deal with an unsupportive parent,"TL;DR My mother isn't supportive and she doesn't seem to understand me. My family life is miserable and I don't know what to do about my situation. I know I should probably see a counselor but my parents aren't willing to support me in that and a counselor cannot change my parents' behavior. What can I do to improve my situation?  To prevent this from being downvoted into oblivion: I believe this post is on-topic (see this meta post) and I'd ask anyone to please read to the end before downvoting. I've put a lot of time and effort into this post and I don't know what to do about my situation.  Bit of background info, my parents have a successful marriage and we're a family of 7. A 14-year-old boy (me), 12-year-old girl, 10-year-old boy, 6-year-old girl and infant baby, all except aforesaid baby and myself being homeschooled by our mother. I understand that so many children cause stress on the parental units but I don't feel this is an excuse for being hateful.  My good qualities: things I feel my parents should be proud of (but they aren't)   I'm an advanced piano player. I've submitted work to a studio and it's ""likely to show up in some production or other within a year"". But whenever I practice my compositions on the piano I always hear from my mother that it's ""sloppy"" or ""too bangy"". I'm a good runner. I'm a freshman and I'm top 100 in the state of Oregon (out of over a thousand) for Cross Country. I'm 5th on my team and I have a 5K time of nearly 18 minutes. When I get home from a meet my mom usually ignores me and my dad grills me on my run*. I get good grades. I have a 3.7 GPA. I'm taking Precalculus as a Freshman and I ""attend"" an online school (which is said to be more challenging as students have to manage their own time). I had a C for about two weeks - my mother threatened to pull me out of school and homeschool me again. My father threatened to put me in a public school. *To be honest, I appreciate this as it's a good evaluation. But even so...   My less good qualities: Some struggles I have that I feel my parents should be helping me through   ADHD. This is why I don't attend a public school. When I did I talked out in class and distracted the other students. Instead of getting me help, my mother rejected the ""idea"" that I had ADHD (although an fMRI showed that I did) and just pulled me out of the school. Depression. I haven't suffered from this for many years but I attained it when my mother was abusive. In my current situation I'm pretty sure it's coming back because of how terrible my family life has been for the past few months. Headaches/migraines. I suffer from a medical condition that causes constant headaches and the occasional severe migraine. I can't handle loud noises or unnecessary constant movement, such as that from a small child. My 12-year-old sister constantly prances about, singing and shouting as if she's an 8-year-old. When I ""look upon her with disdain"" or ask her to calm down my mother rebukes me, saying I can handle it.   The downright crap about me/us: Severe trials I've gone through in the past   Crimes and court. I don't see any need to go into detail but I made a mistake that got me into the juvenile court systems for a few years. I understand that it was stressful to my parents and financially shaking, but I don't think they understand how big of an impact it had on my life too. It has caused quite a lot of trouble but I got no parental support when I needed it the most. (previous) pornography 'addiction'. I haven't had this problem for a year. We're a religious family in which this is seen as a serious misdoing. I didn't see it on purpose at first but it caused a few years' worth of bad habits. I don't think this has made me a very good person in the eyes of my mother. Abuse. A few years ago my mother was very physically abusive (she isn't anymore). She hit, kicked, pulled hair, etc. I know this hasn't helped our relationship much...   Other possibly useful information:   I do chores at home. I do all the typical chores such as dishes, taking out the trash, and sweeping. But instead of ever being thanked for helping with the family, instead I am criticized about my ""bad job"" every single time. I have an advanced social life. I don't feel spiteful towards the entire world, just mostly towards my home. I have a supportive girlfriend and some great 'bros' that are always there to listen to/help me through my struggles. But after spending a fun afternoon with friends and returning home my parents will always make me feel down again. I don't have much self-esteem. Due to the constant criticism of my mother and bullies at church, I don't think very highly of myself. I don't do self-harm but I don't see many reasons to esteem myself as a great person.   After all this, what I'm getting at is: Aside from counseling (which is no longer an option), what can I do to improve my situation at home? Is it normal for parents to treat me this way? If, in the case that the problem lies in me (as I'm constantly hearing), what can I do to improve my relationship with my mother/family?  EDIT: Thanks to everyone for your help! I appreciate all suggestions given. I accepted the answer I did because it contained the advice that seemed to start the most change in my family over the past few days. Thanks for your support! "
1629,"What does it mean to ""say a few words""?","I have a 17-month-old who isn't talking yet. Our pediatrician says that if he isn't talking by 18 months then they'll do a hearing test. But that can't possibly be the problem since we know he understands us, in fact a month ago we went through the words that we absolutely know that he understands and we stopped counting at a hundred. We know he can hear and we know that he understands a lot. But he's not calling us mommy and daddy. He vocalizes a lot and can repeat what we say pretty well, so if we say ""mommy"" he'll do a pretty good job of that, and things that start with ""d"" he can create a pretty creative vocalization of a word that starts with a ""d"", sometimes accidentally getting the exact word right. But, that's not ""talking"", right?  My wife and I have been assuming that to talk means to use the words to communicate instead of pointing, grunting, or using the his small subset of sign language. What do the books mean when they say ""can say a few words""? What do doctors mean? And how did you define this milestone? "
1630,Does playing classical music for infants and young children make them smarter?,"I read pop neuroscience books as well as science sections on news sites (e.g. BBC, NY Times) and one of the claims I remember reading was that supposedly listening to Mozart music made infants smarter. Google searches on this topic turned up articles as early as 2007, so the idea has been in circulation for a while, even among mass audiences. Reasons given for the varied from promoting language skills to enhancing neural plasticity. But from a parenting perspective (the one I am interested in),  the basic question is     Is the so-called ""Mozart effect"" a scientifically supported, developmental leg up or a media-fueled ""scientific legend""?   In short, does my kid actually gain any advantage?   To answer this, consider the following questions:   Question     Is the Mozart effect a scientifically substantiated fact? That is, does listening to classical music actually make infants smarter and lead to greater intelligence?    I'd like to distinguish this from merely becoming more educated due to studying music. I didn't grow up listening to Mozart and now I compose, so there are clearly many ways to learn music. But the critical claim is, if I take two groups of children and play Mozart for one and not the other, does the Mozart group gain some noticeable enhancement of intelligence?  "
1631,"Are most half-day pre-school programs for stay-at-home parents, or are there options?","At least in my state (Washington), the child care licensing is such that most preschools are only able to care for a child for 4 hours per day. I found a couple of places that do preschool and then childcare on site, but those are very rare. Most small, appealing programs are half-day only.  Does this mean that most of these programs are only suitable for stay-at-home parents? What are the other options? A part-time nanny? Maybe there are other approaches? "
1632,"My two-year-old wets through his diaper at night, what to do?","My two-year-old son has lately been urinating a lot in his diaper at night, to the point that it is completely full in the morning and if we don't change it right as he gets up the urine he's been holding in because the diaper is full will soon come out and wet his pants.  He has also made a habit of, if he is not wearing pants/shorts, pulling his diaper down a little if it's full and urinating.  This morning I was alerted to the fact that my son had woken up because he kept complaining about a ""mess"" from his bedroom.  I went in to his bedroom to discover that, at some point during the night, he had taken off his pajamas and wet the bed.  I don't know if he had pulled his diaper down as well, but it looked like he had adjusted it (perhaps pulled it down a little and then pulled it back up).  This was the first time he had wet the bed.  For a few weeks now my wife and I have been putting on larger diapers (two sizes larger than his normal size) when he goes to sleep to increase the urine storage capacity.  Clearly, though, this effort has not been enough.  What else can we do to    keep him from wetting the bed again while still in diapers? keep him from taking off his pajamas at night? keep him from pulling down his diaper when he doesn't have pants/shorts on?   I know there are diaper booster pads and overnight diapers.  We haven't tried any of these yet.  We've also recently quit giving him any milk right before bed.  The pajamas he took off last night were zipper onesies.  I was surprised he was able to get it off.    Additional, possibly related note: my son has also made a habit of pulling stool out of his diaper if the back opening of his diaper is accessible and we don't change his diaper soon (usually due to his refusal for us to change his diaper). "
1633,Child's sleep schedule vs Parents',"I'm trying to learn the do's and dont's of parenting for when my baby comes along, by watching other parents. I'm able to learn a lesson or form a theory on most things except this one area:  The baby in question is almost 3 years old, doesn't go to sleep till 3 or 4 in the night if he sleeps in the afternoon. The afternoon nap happens sometimes when he's awaken early in the morning or is tired out. And it gives the parents a really tough time when it happens. They have to take care of dinner and other things at night and go to office the next day which becomes next to impossible. So what they do, is try their best to not let the baby sleep in the afternoons, no matter how sleepy he gets. So naturally, he gets moody and cries and yells and throws uncontrollable tantrums. Parents have a tough time with that too, but choose this over sleepless nights.  I was never for constraining the baby too much, be it about sleeping or eating - as long as its safety/health is not compromised with. Sure, build a schedule early on and stick to it so that the baby's body is also in sync with it. But when and how should I start enforcing the schedule? And at the cost of upsetting the baby this much? Parents certainly cant change their schedules and office hours, either.  The question boils down to ""what do i do if the baby's sleep pattern/schedule is different from the parents' even after 2-3 years""? "
1634,At what age will I be able to leave the child alone at home for long intervals?,"I will be a single parent in future, and I will have a 8 hour job (7:30 AM to 3:30 PM) always.  Assuming the school bus drops the kid at the colony gate, at what age can I expect the child to come home and stay at home alone for 6 hours safely, after coming from school?  The child should be able to take out food from fridge, heat it on gas stove, and feed herself.  The child should not open the door even if the stranger pleads to death.  At what age will I be able to leave the child alone at home for long intervals? "
1635,Child with diarrhea: what to do when you think the doctors aren't doing enough?,"My son, who is 2 years old, has had diarrhea now for 11 days. About a month ago he started to have diarrhea. I thought it was just an illness, but it would stop and then start again.   It started to be more consistent on June 23rd. He had two episodes each on the 23rd, 24th, and 25th; 3 on the 26th; 5 on the 27th; 3 on the 28th, 29th and 30th. On Wednesday the 1st, he had an episode in the morning. He woke up crying like he was in a lot of pain, but he ate breakfast and acted fine. Later he had 3 more episodes. Then 3 episodes the next evening. Today, Friday, he has had 3 more episodes.   Yesterday I took in a stool sample to be tested. That came back negative for the most common GI issues children can have, like C Diff.   I took him to the ER today, just to give them another stool sample, now they want me to give him a probiotic medication. The results of the test should be back sometime next week.   They keep trying to tell me it's just a virus, but with this lasting 11 days in a row now, I doubt that it is.   I don't know what else to do for my little guy. When he is getting ready to have diarrhea, he cries horribly. He grabs his tummy and says ouch.   None of the medical staff I have taken him to is taking this seriously. How much longer does he have to be having diarrhea before they finally take it more seriously and do something?!?!?!  Edited to add: I'm not really seeking medical advice. I realize there isn't much else I can do for my little guy and there are no approved medications to give to him. I'm really needing advice on how to get these physicians to actually do something. I mean they have sent out now two stool cultures, but mainly they send us home because he is not dehydrated. I have scheduled an appt for him with a GI doctor, but that is far as I have gotten and that appt is not until the 22nd.  "
1636,How much crying/tantrum is normal for a 2-year-old starting daycare?,"My child had a rough start to daycare a couple of months ago, where he vomited for the first few days and seemed like he would never settle. He eventually started staying for half a day, though he rarely ate or slept there. But through all this he was a happy baby at home.  Now the last 4 days have been full days, and his behavior at home has changed drastically. After the first 2 days he started crying hysterically (and inconsolably, sometimes for more than 30 minutes) at the slightest trigger, or when getting up or going to sleep. Spending the weekend at home made him much better, but by the end of Monday he was just as bad. He has also started lashing out with his hands and feet at whoever tries to comfort him.  He hasn't exhibited any of this behavior before, and it is quite worrying. I'm mostly worried about long term damage rather than the short term inconvenience.  Have any of you seen similar behavior in your kids? And can anyone point me towards any resources or NHS (UK) services that might help?  We are also considering reducing his hours to half a day for a few weeks if we can arrange the time off from work. "
1637,What are the outcomes of highly unusual community outreach to young children?,"I can't think of a way to better title this question.  My question is a direct response to a recent news event. You can read the article online.   Here's the scenario:  A child with a condition socially impairs him, in this case a speech delay known as apraxia, was having a public birthday celebration. The parents, uncertain that anyone but close family would attend, created a Facebook event that went viral worldwide.  In response, more than 300 people, primarily strangers, attended the child's event, bringing hundreds of gifts, with more being shipped via online orders. Much of this is because of the action of the Reddit community.  Responses such as this from the Internet happen occasionally, ranging from raising money for medical bills, sending pizza to children's hospitals, and now making amazing birthday celebrations.  My questions are:  What are the implications of such a large turnout on the psychological and emotional health of children who receive such enormous gifts (if not quite so enormous as this)?  How do you properly guide their expectations about such events in the future, to help them realize, in a healthy manner, than such an occurrence is not likely to happen again?  If you have a child of your own, that may or may not have social development issues, who reads such articles, how do you help them realize that such events are not typical for every child and that shouldn't necessarily expect the same?  I'm hoping there is some base psychology/sociology information that deals with similar events, if not the same events. For instance, I've recently read (still searching for articles) about the negative effects of military parents' surprise public homecomings. Those are also situations that are atypical for children, have a huge immediate impact on the child's life, and may or may not involve a lot of community members.    Update: I've had time to think about the question more, so I'd like to provide the following:    I realize this is given as multiple questions, and am willing to break it down into separate questions if necessary, but I'm really asking one overarching question: What are the short-term and long-term psychological, emotional, and social outcomes of such events on children in unusual spotlights and children that witness/learn about such unusual events? My multiple questions are intended to be guidance towards answering the larger question, not as discrete questions requiring dedicated answers. Although, I suppose there is an implied follow-up question being: If any of these outcomes are negative, how do you, as a parent, mitigate them? "
1638,"Couple separated 18 months ago (irremediably), sharing custody of two children. Good or bad idea to share weekend experience together with the kids?","My brother and his ex-wife separated a year and a half ago. They are both over it and would never get back together. They have a 12-year-old girl and a 10-year-old boy whose custody they've shared without much conflict since then. The kids, while certainly affected, remain fairly happy.  Now, my brother plans to take the kids to a theme park for a weekend. Last time they were at one the family was still complete and happy, and they all had a wonderful time and share a great memory of it. So, inevitably, the idea of inviting his ex to come along with them has crossed my brother's mind, in hopes of giving their kids one more (and probably last) memorable childhood experience shared with both their parents.   But here's his (and everyone else's) obvious doubt:   Is it a good idea at all? Or it would only confuse their kids and create the chance of ruining the experience for all?  Thank you for your insights!  UPDATE (after replies): For the record, finally the mum joined her ex and children, and everything went perfectly well - as it should. So… Success! and no regrets. "
1639,What are good techniques to reduce separation anxiety?,"What are good techniques to reduce/wean separation anxiety?  My child cries when her mother or I leave the room, even to go to the adjacent room, or upstairs to get something. Most disruptively, she cries at night when she wakes up enough to be aware of us leaving the room.  Right now I am trying to comfort, calm, and then leave again, to teach her that crying isn't going to get the overall result she craves.  I haven't really seen an effect from that yet, though.  She's about a year and a half old.  Any other suggestions? "
1640,Should toddlers drink milk during the night?,"My son is almost 2 years old and he still wakes in the night to drink. I know he is not alone.   As I would like to get a full night's sleep, I have been contemplating watering down his formula to get him to stop expecting food at nighttime.  But here is the thing: he gets a bottle at 8 (of which he usually only drinks 120ml - 4 ounces for you at the other side of the big water). If he wakes around 12 that is 4 hours since his bottle and 5.5 hours since his last solid meal. If he wakes between 2 and 4, it has been 6 to 8 hours since he last ate anything, and only a small bottle at that. Some nights he will wake twice to drink, around midnight and around 4 or 6.  Is it reasonable to expect a small child to go for 10 hours without food? I know that some kids do sleep through the night but how common or even healthy is it?  I am a grown up with plenty of reserves, for me it is no problem to sleep 10 hrs if I would get the chance or to skip a meal. But he is growing (fast), his metabolism is fast and he has little reserves.   Maybe instead of striving to cut out the night drinking altogether, I should try to make sure it is only one bottle somewhere between 2 and 4?  EDIT: From the answers I conclude that toddlers can sleep all night without extra milk and that the way to achieve this is to make the evening bottle into a small meal with extra solid food. This leads me to conclude the problem is in the daytime feeding schedule: evening meal is at 6:30 (on daycare days we are rarely at home before 6). Evening bottle is at 8, 8:30. At this point he is not very hungry yet so only drinks about 2/3. Breakfast is around 8. But with all the drinking, he is not very hungry in the morning.  Additional question: When toddlers sleep through the night, how are the following spaced:    dinner  evening snack and/or bottle breakfast  "
1641,Seventeen year old daughter wants to take an international trip to meet someone she met online,"So, my wife and I are emotionally drained.  Our daughter is 17.  We live in Ontario Canada.  She met a girl online that is 16 and she wanted to fly to California over Christmas holidays to see her.  Now my daughter says she is not gay, just bi or whatever it is that kids now are calling it.  It doesn't matter what a person's sex is, it is about the person and that's fine, we have no issue with that.   We had a big argument about it and we told her straight out that she is not flying to California to meet someone.  Apparently the girl in California has ""strict"" parents so my daughter thinks she can stay in a hotel and just hope that this girl can get away to see her.   As some background info, my daughter is a very immature 17 year old.  Yes my wife and I have spoiled her, she is an only child and as a result, she is not very independent.  We take her to school, take her to and from her job, she has never had a serious boyfriend or girlfriend.   So we thought we had diffused the situation.  We have her passport and her birth certificate so she cant fly out of the country, but now last night she told us that she is going to go to California in April when she turns 18 no matter what.    We don't want her to go.  We don't think its safe, my wife is in tears, its affecting us so much that it consumes our days.  We don't know what to do.  We don't even know if this girl is who she says she is.  I have done some checking, phone record lookup, name search, address search.    My research shows 4 aliases on the phone number and 5 sealed court documents which are serious. Some solutions we have thought of, including offering to pay to have the girl come to our house. That would bring things up to speed with her parents.   How do we stop this?..how do we even get through the day?...How do we convince our extremely stubborn and head strong daughter that this is a bad idea? "
1642,Is long-term punishment effective for children under 5?,"A child throws a ball inside the house hard enough to knock over some furniture.  He knows he's not supposed to throw the ball inside, so there's a punishment.  Is ""taking the ball away for a week"" an effective punishment for a child under 5, considering that they seem to have shorter attention spans?  After an hour they'll probably forget they ever even had the ball (unless it was really important to them), so bringing it back after a week will be more like a reward (hey, remember this? You can have it back now) than a punishment..? "
1643,6 year old daughter: a bully? manipulative? sensitive? or just difficult?,"My 6 year old daughter is amazing in many ways - she is smart, creative, likes school, gets along well at school, is independent...on her good days.  However, I'm really struggling with her at home. Her teacher says ""she's a friend to everyone"" at school, but at home, I feel like she is defiant, disrespectful, manipulative and a bully. She basically makes my life a living hell when she does not cooperate.  Specifically, she is defiant. When she is in this ""behavior twilight zone,"" she will ignore instructions/requests to follow rules like ""stop running in the house"" or ""stop screaming like a chicken."" She will yell ""No!"" sometimes, if she feels like being defiant, even for perfectly reasonable things. Trying to engage her in a conversation is infuriating because she won't answer even polite questions about why she won't put on her jacket in the freezing weather. She will do things incredibly slowly (it seems like it's just to annoy me) when we need to go someplace. About half the time she behaves like this defiant demon and the other half of the time, she is motivated and perfectly, independently capable of getting out the door for school, for example. That's why I can't figure it out. Who is this child? Is she a nice, smart girl? or a deeply disturbed psychopath?  I know that sleepiness and hunger can be major causes of this type of behavior in her, but even accounting for that, she seems to behave so poorly sometimes.  Whenever I try to respond to her behavior with negative consequences, she has huge meltdowns. Now, I know you're probably thinking: what child DOESN'T have meltdowns when they don't get what they want? Well, her meltdowns can last hours and she is persistent. She begs and begs ""Give me another chance"" but the whole hour leading up to this point, she was whining and manipulative and then as soon as you give her another chance, it will be another hour of dealing with that behavior (don't worry, I recognize these moments and rarely give in, BUT I'M RUNNING OUT OF STEAM). Also, often during these meltdowns, she will flail around on the floor and make horrible sobbing sounds. She will often tap an arm or leg on a piece of furniture and then use that as an excuse to melt down further. She often drools and lets her snot run down her face for dramatic effect. I know that when she taps her arm or leg it's not serious because I'm standing right there...it could just be a brush against a cup or something that could never in a million years hurt someone, but she uses it to escalate this terrible scene.  To make matters worse, I find that I have an actual physical sensitivity to sound (it is stronger at certain parts of the day) that make the whining and crying and screaming almost unbearable (on top of the regular discomfort of having to listen to a six year old whine non stop for hours).  The worst part, though, is how verbally abusive she is. She says incredibly rude and hurtful things, sometimes without realizing it. However, even when we try to talk to her about it, it's like she doesn't understand that she could possibly hurt anyone's feelings. In particular, she makes comments about my cooking. Every. Single. Night. And yes, we are poor, so we can't afford to eat out EVER and I do actually slave in the kitchen for hours trying to prepare healthy and tasty meals that my husband and children will eat, so it really hurts my feelings when she says the food is ""disgusting."" (It's not disgusting, but just for the sake of this post, if you don't believe me, just pretend you do). Other times, she just talks to me in very disrespectful ways. My husband and I are pretty good about addressing it right away, but talking to her is not working. It is clear that she is ignoring us while we're talking or distracts herself so she doesn't have to listen. On top of all this, we have two younger kids, whom she is often responsible for ""riling up"" by chasing them around the house or starting games that encourage rough housing, etc.   I try very hard to squash this bad behavior right away and my husband tries to do so as well, but some nights I have to check out because I'm so upset and I don't want to also become verbally abusive to her. I will just signal to my husband that I've had enough and go watch tv on my computer alone for hours. Those nights, he has to get them bathed and put to bed, which is something we normally do together.   I know that some of her bad behavior developed after I had the twins (they are 4 years old) and I struggled with depression and anxiety and PMDD for 3 years after they were born, but I have received treatment and therapy for my issues and have always been proactive in dealing with her behavioral issues. I even had her in therapy but she was so well behaved that we were ""discharged"" so to speak. It seems like recently her attitude has gotten intolerable and she has really hurt my feelings a couple of times recently. I tell her that she's being rude and that it's not appropriate but then I end up isolating myself and crying about it and I feel really stupid for that. I'm worried that she is a trigger for my depression and anxiety. To be honest, before I had the twins, she wasn't a super easy child, but my confidence was in tact. After, her behavior has caused me to feel so bad about myself that if she weren't my daughter but just someone I knew, I would cut her out of my life entirely, but I obviously don't want to do that to my own daughter, who I love. I already resent her for some of this. Help me find a way to cope! "
1644,What to do with a teenage girl who won't stop lying?,"I have a 16 year old I am raising...I am 29 and have a 7 year old son. She is my baby cousin...her dad had a stroke and is being taken care of by family in another state. Her mother abandoned her with me to go be with a boyfriend in another state. She has been with me since she was 11.  Since that age she has been acting out. Nonstop boyfriends and lying about them. Last year, she was spending the night at her ""best friends"" house...who turned out to be a boy of course. She made a fake phone number to pretend to be the parent of said boy so I was texting her instead of a real parent.  This year, she stole the car and wrecked it. Lied about what happened until I investigated and found broken glass, etc. in the driveway.   I've grounded her numerous times, taken away her cell phone, etc. NOTHING IS WORKING. I'm 29...I'm at my wits end. No one else in the family is willing to take her in because of all the issues she has. I know it all stems from being abandoned and from having a bad mom...I've tried so very hard to provide her everything she needs...a nurturing environment and also assuring her that I would never abandon her like her mother did. I try to be loving, caring, etc. I don't know what else I can do...  EDIT: It wasn't just her also who came to stay with me...it was her and her brother who is now 18 and out of the house. He acted out also with drugs and lying but improved his behavior, graduated and got a job. He's doing well. Nothing I do is helping with the girl.   My question is what can I do to get her to stop lying? She lies even when she knows I know the truth. How do I get through to her? What do I need to do besides the usual things like talking, taking away things, grounding, etc. "
1645,Angry 7 Year-Old,"My son is 7 years old and he gets angry very easily. When he gets angry, he will hurt himself (like bumping his head).  He has also taken to saying bad words such as f**k.  What can I do? Is this normal for his age ? How can I get him to listen to me? I always shout at him, but it's not working.  When he seems happy he will kiss and hug you. "
1646,How much pressure should I put on my kids to learn?,"My wife just started reading ""Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother"", a book written by a Chinese mother who talks about the pros and cons of the high-pressure and rigid parenting style of some Chinese parents.   In discussing the book with my wife, I started thinking about high-pressure vs. low-pressure parenting. One of the arguments for pressure are that children will often say they are not interested in something, or will be lazy about things such as practice and homework. I've experienced this first hand with all of my children. They are frequently reluctant to start learning something new, but after you force them to do it for a while, they get over the initial hurdles, then it gets easier.  But how much pressure is too much, and how little pressure is too little? What differentiates consistency from pressure?  Also, how do we decide what educational areas should have more pressure than others? Obviously if a child says that they don't feel like learning how to read or how to do math, because they don't want to do homework, you have to follow through and make them do it. Anything else would be irresponsible, because those are mandatory curriculum for any legitimate school. But what if the child makes the same excuse with learning piano. Is it equally as irresponsible to let them quit playing piano because they don't want to practice? Arguably, if your child grows up to be a professional musician, the music lessons are much more important to his/her education than math was.  I realize much of this could be subjective, so I'd prefer answers that have some sort of statistics or studies backing them. "
1647,Should I clean my newborn's umbilical cord stump or leave it be?,Our pediatrician said that some doctors say to leave the umbilical cord stump alone but he likes to suggest using a cotton swab with alcohol to wipe the perimeter.  I am fine with just leaving it be so long as it stays clean and dry. Do you think he suggested that solely for cleanliness or does the drying effect of alcohol help it move along to fall off? What did you do for your newborn? 
1648,How to handle the situation with a 1-year-old preferring dad over mom with her suffering emotionally?,"I am the proud father of a 1-year-old boy.  My wife and I love him to pieces!  A few months after his birth I suffered through a terrible bout of anxiety attacks.  Turns out it was just my way of reacting to such a drastic change in my life and it took me a few months to fully embrace my new reality.  While I was working through this period of anxiety, my wife let me take the lead on most of the activities with our son in the hopes that by jumping into the situation with both feet, my anxiety would lessen.  This was indeed the case and I can now look back on that time as a learning period and feel pride that I am now past it.   For the past 6 months, our son has been showing a very strong preference for me over his mother.  I have tried to remove myself from some of the daily tasks that we do with him and my wife has taken over in those, in the hopes that our son will see us both equally.  While his favouring of me has lessened, it most certainly has not disappeared.  This clearly hurts my wife who only wants to be treated equally and not be shunned by her little boy.  I have mentioned that I am sure that this is a phase and that at some point I may well find myself on the outs with our boy and he will be stuck to her like glue.  While she understands this, it does nothing to help in the present and I hate seeing my wife suffer emotionally.    I have to mention as well that I went back to work full time one month after the birth of our son. My only time with him was at night and weekends. My wife stayed home for a full year and has only gone back to work recently.  Has anyone gone through this type of situation and how long did it take to pass? How to handle it? "

1650,How do I teach my child to speak in sentences?,"My son is 2.3yrs. Right now we keep reading books for him. He pays attention only for some time. We also keep teaching letters and numbers during his bed time or during his bath. When asked he repeats most of them with similar modulation. But, when he wants to convey something he uses only words and some expressions. He doesn't try sentences yet. What is the best way to make him start at least mumbling sentences?  One more thing, I heard alot about Montessori type of teaching for kids. Are there any techniques or tools available so that we can use those at home? We are planning to put in a play school not exactly Monetessori based but something similar they say.   Any pointers/links for best practices for teaching kids will be of great help.  "
1651,How do I accustom my students to interact with children of a higher economic class?,"I recently took my two high school students to a physics laboratory at UCLA where they could work on a lab project with other high school students. My students are minority students from a low-income area, and I feel like they are completely out of place among the other students at the lab who are mostly from a privileged socio-economic standing; the lab was open to all students, but we were the only low-income minorities their that day. How can I help my students to not be intimated by the class/cultural barrier?  Some examples that came up during the lab were as such:   We took the bus 2 hours to get to the lab, while other students were casually speaking about their lavish plans for the rest of their summer vacation to travel abroad. When one of the other students asked my students which high school they were from, and they responded with a low-income school's name, there was some audible discouragement in my students' voices. After the lab, one of my students told me how 'those other kids didn't seem normal', and it was pretty obvious he/she was referring to aforementioned differences. Also after the lab, one of my students seemed discouraged by the fact that some of the other students had already been working on the project for a number of years and that he/she is just now getting involved in research.   I'm really worried that these sorts of difference will end up discouraging my students, what can I tell them to keep their spirits up?   *Note: I use the term ""my student(s)"" because I am not the actual parent but an advisor for a minority outreach science program. "
1652,How to protect my children from cyber-bullying,"Cyber bullying has been a talking point in the news for the last few years, where stories of children being 'attacked' online in social media causing them to go into depression, sometimes forcing the child to change schools, the family to move or tragically an occasional suicide.  How can we as parents help to protect our children from cyber bullying without completely preventing the kids from participating in social media (which may ostracize them from their peers and lead to real-life bullying instead)?  While I'd rather not essentially stalk my children online, if that's the only way then are there any ways to either do so discreetly?  Or can you recommend a way to convince my children to voluntarily allow us as parents to keep a close eye on them?  Further, assuming I am aware of cyber bullying currently taking place, what options are available to stop it from continuing (again, short of removing the children from social media entirely)?  Fair credit, this question came about due to another closed question posted earlier. "
1653,When to adopt a stepchild?,"I have heard of a few cases where a stepparent will adopt their spouse's child from a previous relationship.  When is this appropriate, and what are the consequences?  I know this can be a broad topic, but specifically, I am curious as to the affect this has on the child's relationship with their other biological parent, and whether it effects the ability to collect court ordered child support payments.  Also, should this only be done if the child wants it, assuming the child is old enough to make that decision? "
1654,Is there any health risk from play-sand that's been left wet in its bags for a week?,"I bought some play-sand for our new sandbox on a rainy day, then left the bags unopened on our patio to dry for a few days.  It's been about a week and they haven't dried, and now my wife is wondering if they're growing dangerous mold/bacteria/what-have-you and should be discarded.  So, my questions:   Is this fear justified?  Should we get new sand or treat the sand we have somehow? Are wet bags of wet play-sand actually common and we should just dry them out going forward? Is the sand likely to dry adequately by leaving it in a sandbox for another week with its cover on?  "
1655,What is the reasoning behind encouraging your child not to be a 'tattle-tale'?,"I heard a friend say:     I encourage my child not to be a tattle tale - but encourage them to work the situation out for themselves   Several other parents in the context nodded agreement.   I had never heard this before. I was trying to think through the reasoning.   To me it seems, you want to encourage your child to be at least some degree conscientious, without being self-righteous.   Is the reasoning behind encouraging them not to be a 'tattle-tale' because:   You want them not to be so self-righteous they disconnect from their peer-group? You want them not to run to parents for help for everything, but want to start encouraging them to stand on their own two feet? You want them to start to critique their feelings of conscience, so they can at start to put reasonable boundaries on it?   My question is: What is the reasoning behind encouraging your child not to be a 'tattle-tale'?  "
1656,Travelling when baby is young: bring them or leave them?,"Background: two or three times a year, I travel to conferences for work.  I'm usually gone for about a week.  I can miss some of these conferences, but missing all of them would be very detrimental to my career.  Since I go all over the world, my husband usually comes with me and we turn the trip into a vacation for the two of us.  Problem: I'm expecting my first child in September and I'm not sure how to handle the travel once the baby arrives.  I have two basic options:   Travel without the baby.  Since my husband usually comes along on the trips, this would mean leaving the baby with his grandparents. Travel with both the baby and my husband.   My main concern with 1 is that I'll be the baby's primary caregiver, and I'm not sure if he'll feel abandoned if I leave him with someone else, especially when he's very young.  With an older child I could at least explain why I'm leaving and when I'll get home.  My main concern with 2 is that I'm not sure if travelling with a young baby is safe.  For example, my last trip was to India, where mosquito-borne illnesses are an issue.  In addition, the travel can be physically exhausting -- the India trip took twenty hours of flying and a twelve hour time change.  Question: are there long-term psychological consequences to leaving a young baby with another caregiver for a week?  Is doing so worse than exposing the baby to the risks of travel? "
1657,"If my 4-year-old asks me ""why"", what kind of ""why"" does he mean?","My 4-year-old asks me questions like ""Why is water transparent?"" What kind of ""why"" does he mean?:    What sense does it make for water to be transparent? How is it achieved that water is transparent?   The first question would be more philosophycal and the second question more physical. I don't think I would be able to explain to him the difference between those type of questions. "
1658,How do you teach a child religious views?,"Since a few weeks my 2yo son refuses to pray for his food. His refusal probably has nothing to do with religion; being a 2yo he simply refuses to do anything we don't force him to. Nevertheless, this made us ask, should we force him to pray?   My wife and I are both Christian, so it would stand to reason that we'd raise our son to be Christian as well. However, I don't want to impair his ability to make religious decisions by forcing my views on him. On the other hand, I can't raise him to be an atheist; firstly because I don't hold those views, and also, because that would be no different from raising him to be a Christian.  What's a good way to balance personal religious views and freedom of choice for a child? Should we force him to pray for his food, or at nighttime? Should we pray for him when he's present? Should we take him to church, once he's old enough to stay at home?  P.S. I am aware religion is a very sensitive topic, with strong regional and cultural differences. Please be respectful and per the FAQ: don't provide generalized answers without the proper backing. "
1659,How do you handle poor behavior by other people's children?,"I believe that interacting with a variety of other children at social functions is an important part of childhood development.  However, there seem to be a lot of children who are... how shall I phrase it?  Undisciplined.  Undisciplined behavior in other children can have direct impact on your child, no matter how well behaved.  Poor behavior in other children can serve as a bad example, or it can result in upset, or even injury, for your child (think chronic hitters, biters, and bullies).  Even normally well-behaved children can have bad moments, too, especially when in a group environment where situations can escalate much more quickly than normal.  However, disciplining other people's children is a potentially touchy subject, especially given the wide range of opinions of child raising ""best practices"".  I know some schools of thought advocate ""never saying no"" to a child, and many advocate very different approaches to setting boundaries.  So, how do you handle poor behavior in other people's children?    How do you respond when the child has a parent present who does not respond in a way that you are comfortable with?  How do you respond when you are the chaperone, and there are no other parents present? "
1660,Extracurricular activities for children,"Let me admit that I am not a parent and this question is about my sister.   My sister is 8 years old. With the start of summer vacations, she has nothing to do all day. She has no peers to play with, and her last resort is to spend hours on her mobile.   My parents are both really busy and everytime time I try to bring this to their attention, they just ignore it, saying that she should ""study instead of wasting her time"". But how long can she study? Surely an 8 year old cannot for 12 hrs. I tried to suggest having her sign-up for piano classes, swimming or ballet (she's particularly interested in this), but my parents think its going to distract her from studies. However, from my observation, not doing anything is doing her more harm; its dumbing her down.   So is it true that kids should not dabble in extracurricular activities as it would decrease their interest in studies? Does it affect my sister's development, both physical and mental, not to partake in such activities, or is insignificant? "
1661,How to (or should I even try to) break a zombie fixation for a three-year-old,"I have two boys, one eleven, and one three.  I don't know exactly how or when, but the 11-year-old has decided that it was a good idea to explain the the 3-year-old all about zombies.  Of course he left out any meaningful discussions about death, and dying, and the fear thereof.  The 3-year-old was already afraid of dying (a fear which he is steadily overcoming), and has now become much more attached-read clingy-and is afraid that zombies are going to get him.  I have been a little on the fence with this one, where in some instances, I will go along with it as imaginative play, and he and I will go ""Zombie Hunting"", which seems to help him overcome the fear (and its fun), and in other circumstances, I feel compelled to tell him, ""Zombies are not real, your brother is just trying to scare you, it's time to go to bed.""    I know there is no meaningful way to explain to a three-year-old that monsters and zombies and the like reflect a human fear of death, and of supernatural/unexplained/misunderstood phenomena.    EDIT: adding details in response to anongoodnurse's question:  This has been continuing for 3-6 months, and occurs morning, noon, and night.  There is a close association to darkness, but Zombies could be behind the curtains at breakfast, in the bathroom all day, in any unfamiliar place (or wherever the parents or groups of people are not) and yes they are almost always in dark places.  EDIT: Refining question.  There are some excellent responses and great food for thought.  I don't think the first part of the question has been addressed, though.    My question is two-fold:   Does this represent a fear of death/dying.    Put another way (and with more detail) could this type of fixation resolve to a more general fear of death (which was his preoccupation prior to this, and which he seems to have come to some sort of understanding) that might indicate he really hasn't gotten over his fear or misunderstanding of death?    Regardless of the answer to the first part, How or should I even try to convince him that zombies aren't real?    In response to answers and comments, and after some reflection, I don't think it is practical to try stopping him from engaging in the imaginative play ""zombie hunting"".  Additionally, I have concerns about confusion arising from engaging him in this type of play while also stating that zombies aren't real.  However, isn't the basis of imaginative play entertaining thoughts of things we know don't exist?  (I think I have a new question brewing)  This part of the question then becomes, how can I best support him overcome this fear? "
1662,"Is breastfeeding an infant more ""healthy"" than using expressed milk?","Is breastfeeding an infant more healthy than using expressed milk? With healthy I mean the relative health of mother and child, and with expressed milk I mean milk extracted from the breasts using breast-pumps.    I assume it is more safe to use breast-pumps, since one can sanitize pumps with more intense chemical agents than one would use on a breast. But then again, how intense would cleaning for a breast even need to be? Or I guess one could also argue that the more times some device is touched, the more it can be contaminated, so then the shortest route, breast to mouth, would be better than breast to pump to bottle to mouth.   Or conversely, pro breastfeeding, would the child have a better chance to ""bond"" with the mother when being breastfed? This might be psychological territory, though. "
1663,Is there any point to booster car seats with anchors?,"Our child is ready to switch from a five-point harness child car seat to a car booster seat, and we looked at a couple of models in a store. We saw one model that has clips on it to clip into the anchors that the five-point harness uses.  Is there any point to this? The difference is that a five-point harness replaces the regular seat belts and must be strongly connected to the car's frame. A booster seat just holds the seat belt in a safe position on the child's body. I don't think there's any tension between the car and the booster seat in a crash, so why would it need to be anchored?  Has anyone seen any reliable information on this feature? "
1664,How do you keep up with a toddler?,"My son is 2, and is seemingly a perpetual motion machine.  He constantly wants me to ""play cars"" (we stand at a window sill and smash matchbox cars into each other), play ""tag"" or ""chase me"" around the house, or get down on the floor with him to play with his train sets.  On the one hand, I love it.  Its cute, healthy, and flattering that he so clearly wants me to participate in his activities.  On the other hand... keeping up with him is hard!  Its not just the physical aspect that is difficult to keep up with (although I am constantly astonished by just how much energy he seems to have!).  In all honesty, some of the things he wants me to do are just so boring I have a hard time keeping at it.    There's only so long I can smash matchbox cars together, or push a wooden train around a track, or spin around in circles until we become dizzy, before I want to add some depth to the game, or move onto something new.  My son, however, seems able to do these things for hours on end.  I think its great that he can focus on something he finds fun, and stick with that for extended periods of time.  I don't want to discourage that behavior.  How can I find a proper balance between participating in the activities he enjoys, and wants me to share with him, and my limits of endurance/patience?   Most of the time, I am happy to jump in for half an hour to an hour and a half (sometimes more, sometimes less), and generally he seems quite content with that.  But how do I approach this when I'm feeling particularly stressed/tired/sick, when my ability to do these sorts of things seems much lower than normal?  Is it horrible for me to find myself bored with some of these games?  It makes me feel like I may be doing a bad job as a parent. "
1665,5yr Old Has Trouble With Letters & Reading,"My daughter is 5 years old (will be 6 at the end of February) and lately has wanted to learn to read.  However, I've become a bit concerned because it seems as though she has absolutely no memory for letters or words.  We can point to one letter, tell her what it is and what it sounds like, and have her repeat it.  After doing a second letter and going back to the first, she doesn't know it.  Last night a book we were trying to read had the word ""inside"".  I covered part to make just ""i-n"" and we worked through the sounds to get to the word ""in"".  Then I covered that part and we'd work through the sounds to get to the word ""side"".  Then I'd go back to the first and she wouldn't remember it.  I could switch back and forth repeatedly and she never remembered the word.  The word ""inside"" appears repeatedly throughout the book and she never once seemed to remember it, always having to work through it anew.  In the same book, we worked out the word ""going"" -- the only word on the page.  Turn the page and the first word is again ""going"" but she didn't recognize it and we had to sound it out from scratch.  This has me somewhat concerned.  I know that 5-years is still pretty young but this seems wrong.  What it is not:   She is not ""slow"".  She speaks 3 languages (French, English, German).  She's observant and curious, asking a lot of great ""why"" questions about how the world works. She's not physically incapable.   She rides a bike and scooter, and skis like nobody's business.  Yesterday she was helping me build a tool-box and had no problem repeatedly putting the wrench on the bolts and tightening them up. She doesn't seem to have bad eye-sight.  She had no trouble aligning the wrench with the bolts or reading the small, engraved ""10mm"" on the wrench to make sure she had the correct one. She doesn't seem to have a bad memory in general.  We play games like ""Memory"" or ""Lucky Catch"" (which we lovingly call ""boot to the head"" -- you'll understand if you've played it) and she does quite well.   We're planning to take her to an pediatric opthamologist to double-check her eyes and play a few more games while paying more attention to how she plays.  So...  Any ideas on what this is?  Or am I just reading too much into it?  One last piece of information that may or may not be related...  She claims to be having some trouble at school (kindergarten) when she has to touch an icon and drag it from the top of a big screen to the bottom.  All I know is what she has said -- I've never seen the activity myself.  Update 2014-09-24: My daughter is now 7.5 years and starting grade 2.  When we read together she does quite well; it's rare that she doesn't recognize a world she had to work out just the page before.  Update 2019-05-23: Now 12, she's doing very well.  She reads easily in both English (Ender's Game at the moment) and French and scores in the high 90's on reading comprehension tests.  Her biggest struggle is that she has to understand everything so words that she doesn't know frustrate her and can inhibit her desire to read.  She won't just ignore the word, leaving the rest of the words to communicate the the idea.  This is not inconsistent with the rest of her personality.  :-) "
1666,Why was this c-section necessary?,"In a recent delivery in my family, the lady has to undergo an operation. The doctor initially said that the birth will be through normal delivery, but at a very last stage she said:     We tried our best to avoid operation, but we are helpless as the   baby's head size is much more than the passage for bringing him out.   The baby's head is stuck in between the two bones, above the opening.   The opening is wide enough now (approx 10 cm), which is wide enough to   bring the baby's head out side, but the issue is before that opening   the passage is very narrow as the two bones are very close and it is   impossible to widen the gap between these two bones- shall we apply   force there?. If we force the baby to come out through this passage,   we fear that we might damage the baby's brain. also we cannot wait any   more because the baby is now not in the fluid, we broke that while   trying for normal delivery. so we are going for operation now.   The doctors also gave the lady some injections for giving her pains-induced delivery. The lady said she felt immense pain because of this.  Also the lady had gone for ultrasound several times, and the doctor herself said everything was normal.     Questions:   Why are cases of normal delivery reducing day by day. Till about 10 to 15 yrs back we used to hardly hear about birth by operations. But now this is very common.  Is it true that the doctors might go for operation because it is easier for them (i.e  for doctors), and they can make more money? Up to what extent the doctors argument about the proportionally narrow passage can be true? Is there no way to bypass/avoid/widen this passage? Why such cases were not prevalent 10-15 years back?  The induced delivery pain is more than the normal pain? Post birth the mother and the baby  both are fine. But what are the risk involved post operation, and what best can be done to avoid such births in  future (e.g some exercises?).   I can see something fishy in Doctors arguments (though, I am not a biology student).   Update  One of the argument I am getting from the first 4 answers is: ""now a days bigger babies are born as compared to earlier, while the women hips are not widening at that proportion"" and thus c-section is the only way for delivery in most cases.  Can someone please put some authentic references in support of this argument?    In fact I have read the opposite that 100s of years back people used be taller as compared to now, and they lived longer. "
1667,How Much Hallowe'en Candy?,"My kids have been out for the night and returned each with a big bag of candy.  My wife and I are wondering the best rules for the consumption of such.  In the past we've set limits of letting them have one after each meal but I know some parents let them eat as much as they want, telling them that when it's gone, it's gone and if they get sick, to don't go complaining about it -- might as well learn lessons about over-eating at an early age.  What facts are there to support either of these two policies, or any other policy for that matter?  Follow-Up:  Thanks everyone for all the information.  FYI, here's what we decided:   You can eat as much or as little as you want. You can only eat it directly after a healthy and balanced lunch/dinner -- not breakfast, not snacks. Any eating of candy outside these times will result in immediate and permanent confiscation of all remaining candy.  (My son actually asked, ""Will we get the bag back for next year?"") You must brush your teeth well as soon as you're finished after which no more candy. When it's gone, it's gone.  No asking the other if you can have some. If you eat so much that you get sick or a tummy-ache, don't be complaining about it -- learn from it.   Funny thing...  My kids (boy=8y, girl=5y) are already talking about how they're only going to eat one or two at at time to make it last.  I really love kids!  &lt;tearing up&gt; "
1668,How to teach your toddler to pronounce old words correctly?,"My 2-year-old is now capable of making certain phonetic sounds that he wasn't able to when he first started speaking.  For many words, he's adjusted his pronunciation slightly as he's used them more often, and we've not had to do any training. For other words, he continues to use the old, incorrect pronunciations despite his apparent ability to do otherwise. We tend to rely on repeating back complete sentences with proper pronunciations, or just having conversations where we slip in the target words, rather than doing any explicit correcting.  Specific examples: He calls Captain America ""Cappa Nappa"". But, if I ask him say the words more slowly, I can get a ""Cappin Uh-merta"", which is closer and we're very happy with it.   When he first started referring to the TV he called it the ""Deet"" (a ""word"" he also used for other things). He can now say something like ""Tee wee"" or ""Tee fee"", but now he'll just say ""Watch movie"" or ""Watch show"", opting not to say TV at all.  We know he can pronounce the words better, but seems to be attached to the older pronunciations. This may just be because the older pronunciation is physically easier for him to say, or because we understand him well enough with his improper pronunciation, it's simply habit, or most likely a combination of all of those.  How can I effectively coach, train, and/or encourage my child to pronounce words in a new way, now that he's physically and/or cognitively able to make new sounds?  Or  How can I effectively teach my child to stop using their ""nonsense words"" and instead use the real words they're now capable of saying, when they have a strong personal preference to avoid the real words?  In our case, I feel that our son has demonstrated his ability to do better, but chooses not to because it is more challenging for him. I want to encourage him to try and tackle more challenging tasks.  We're very happy with his language development, and are more amused by or endeared to his mispronunciations than anything. But, I feel there are certain words we could more actively work on. Language is one of his primary learning activities, and I'd like to set the stage so that he's accustomed to having small challenges.  "
1669,How to communicate with tiger parents?,"I know some tiger parents who put extremely high pressure on their children, for example, they applied many extra curricular activities, tutorials for their kids and made them very busy. Their children had lose their childhood and it's not good for their development.  But their parents think that it's good for them, it let them grow faster, know more and pushed their children to their limits.  So how should I communicate with those people?  I tried talking to them but most of them are not open-minded, so it's a bit difficult to communicate.    Edited  When I took a look at the answers, people might think it's OK for those parents as long as their children feels good, yes, I totally agree with that, but here's an example: (Happened yesterday)  Yesterday was the first day of the book fair, and also summer holiday starts, some of the parents used several thousand dollars just to buy exercise books for their kids for this summer, I agree that learning is important and is a must for children, but the problem is: is this necessary to have that much exercise for them?  Another example happened last month:  Some parents have their children applied for many extra curricular activities: e.g. Monday Piano, Tuesday Singing, Wednesday Swimming + Tutorial, Thursday Tutorial, Friday another extra curricular activities and same for saturday and sunday. When I talk to their parents, I notice their children's emotion, he's already very tired and was even forced by the parent to say ""I'm happy"". So I think it's a bit too much for a kid even though I agreed learning is very important for kid.  Also, some kids even started tutorial when they're one year old, they started to learn writing, isn't it a bit early?? "
1670,What's so hard about home made carrot baby food?,"When we were dealing with baby foods, all the books and experts talked about how you could make your own baby food at home easily, except carrots. They all just said ""don't even try"", some even had a warning that ""severe reactions"" would occur, and that it was a risk to the baby to feed them home made carrot baby food. Well I've seen the projectile vomit and horrid diapers that result from trying to feed a baby homemade carrot baby food, so there is clearly something to be said for it. But what's so hard about carrots specifically? What are the big companies able to do that we can't do at home? Can anyone explain this at the food science level? "
1671,"Is it harmful to a child's social development to tell them ""don't talk to strangers""?",Conventional parenting wisdom tells us to drive the fear of talking to strangers into our kids. Is this at all harmful though? Is there any adverse impact to a child's social development by doing this? How can you balance safety against fear? 
1672,How do you discuss a controversial history topic with a child?,"There are many controversial history episodes that are still relevant and actively discussed today. I don't mean cruel or bloody stories, rather episodes that different people have opposite viewpoints about, or episodes that have a dimension that is not widely known to public.   They are, for example, most of Irish history, or slavery in the US, or history of the USSR, and so on.  How to introduce such topics to a child? What is the degree that parent should include his viewpoint? "
1673,Three month old only sleeps 10-11 hours a day,"Our third seems to be way more active than average baby (comparing to the previous two), all and all he hits his developmental goals so far very well.   One thing that worries me is his sleep. He sleeps 8 hours at night like a normal adult. When it turns dark he goes to sleep, and when Sun comes up he wakes everyone up and has no intention of sleeping longer than necessary...   During day he sleeps 4-5 times around 15-30 minutes every time and wakes up not due to noise (most of the time), but by himself (he usually spends some time playing with his fingers or just looking around before making noise and calling us).   His sleep is way under normal 13-16 hours, I have checked some statistical data and he falls near 95% percentile, we are white but live in Asia so I am not sure should I take one hour away. Whole thing is becomming worrisome, since sleep is considered essential in normal development.   What am I looking at? Should I take action?  "
1674,When your child says something embarrassing in public... how do you deal with it?,"So our 3 year old son is both talkative and imaginative, but hasn't necessarily learned all the social decorum that comes with age/experience and social development. There's been a number of embarrassing situations/social faux-pas that we've just about explained away, but sometimes it is pretty difficult.  As an example, we were in the photo printing shop waiting for our prints and my son exclaimed ""Look daddy, a witch!"". As I looked around he was pointing straight at a bedraggled-looking middle-aged lady whose hair was unkempt but was probably just having a 'bad hair day'. I calmly walked him around to the opposite side of the shop, crouched down to his level and said ""I can't see a witch, but there's a picture of a dragon on the wall"". He protested ""no daddy, over there, with the green boots"" (luckily out of earshot). I asked him ""does she have a Broomstick, a Cauldron, and a Cat?"", to which he replied 'No' and accepted she couldn't be a witch, then.  On this occasion, some quick thinking diffused any further awkwardness or upset.  Are there any techniques that you use to handle these types of situations?  ..and have you got a fun story to illustrate your technique? :-) "

1676,How can I teach my daughter to wait to speak?,"I have 2 daughters, a one year old and a four year old. The four year old will often call for me when I am speaking to someone else or watching a news show, interrupting me.  I already tried to explain to her that sometimes she has to wait for talk because I'm talking to someone and she has to wait for her turn, but do not stop interrupting me, sometimes it's really frustrating.  I know it must be a way to get my attention, but I really want to teach her that she has to respect others. Is it just a phase? Or is there any way to make her understand? "
1677,What can a father do in raising girls who will practice abstinence?,"I am a father of 3 beautiful daughters, all of whom are 7 or under. If they are anything like their mom, I know they will grow up to be beautiful women (both inside and and out).  One thing that scares me already is boys. I know based on how my gender thinks that a lot of them, especially in the teenage years, have one thing in on their minds when it comes to their relationships with girls. I don't want my daughters to fall prey to these kind of guys.  Even if my daughters do find a boy that actually cares for them, I would still prefer they remain abstinent till marriage (both for religious reasons and personal preferences).   I found some good articles on how to talk to teenagers about abstinence.   But my question is how can I live my life as a man and a father when my girls are still some years away from getting their first menstrual cycle to inculcate in them that they will not choose sex in those early years?  Should I spend more time with them, should I give them more physical affection, should I speak to them now about sex and boys, should I myself try to practice more restraint and self-control in my life?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated. "
1678,What is a good age to start teaching a child Ancient Latin and Greek?,"I've read a lot on here about children and languages, but they all have to do with spoken language. I am not fluent in any spoken language, but I have taken extensive coursework in Classical Latin and Attic Greek.  Given the complexity of these languages, when is a good age to start introducing children to the concepts of the languages? Since they are not conversational, I'm not even sure what a good place to start would be. I learned starting with declensions and conjugations, but that doesn't seem like a good start for a language with a child. Any suggestions on how to even introduce them to a child? "
1679,Is a cold with a very congested nose dangerous for an infant?,"Noob parent here. I have a 9-mo who's currently pretty stuffed up: snoring, a little wheezing, constantly runny nose etc. I'm not worried about long-term, since it seems to be ""only"" a cold. But when sleeping are there any hazards? To cut to the chase: can he die from lack of oxygen / inability to breathe?  Not to lead the question, but I'm guessing not, considering the human race has survived as long as it has, but I'm a noobie parent and everything is scary. "
1680,At what age should a child be able to dress herself?,"At what age are children typically able (and willing) to dress themselves? Our daughter is two and a half and can take her pants on and off and take her shirt off, but cannot put a shirt on herself. She can take her velcro shoes on and off and can take her socks off, but is hit and miss when it comes to putting socks on. And while she sometimes expresses a very keen interest in ""do by myself,"" more times than not she wants us to help dress (and undress) her.  When should we expect her to be old enough to handle these tasks herself? We don't mind doing it at this age, but we are also of the mind that it is good to encourage a child to regularly try to accomplish tasks themselves without assistance. "
1681,How to deal with 5 year old stepson's view on me?,"I'm glad I found this forum. Maybe you can help me!  I'm 31 years old and have for the past 12 months been living with my girlfriend and her five year old son. I have known them for nearly three years. I moved in with them and then rented my own flat out to a friend.  On paper everything is great. My girlfriend is pregnant and we'll have a baby in February. I can't wait! Her son really likes me as a stepdad and says that I'm the funniest one to play with. I love both him and my girlfriend who is an openminded girl and just everything I have been looking for my whole life.  The thing is that I'm having personal issues with a few things that stresses me a lot and that I don't know how to handle them:  I miss my dad! Sometimes when my stepson is at bed in the evening he cries and says that he ""misses his father"". His biological father lives in another country. They have only seen eachother maybe 20 times on Skype. They don't even speak the same language so my girlfriend has to translate their (very short) conversations. I'm a great stepdad, but I still get the thought of ""am I good enough?"".  Mom only! My stepson can be very ""mom-sick"". He's never allowed me reading him a story before bedtime. Sometimes his mom has to help him with something and DEFINITELY NOT me. These things are very normal for every child (even with both biological parents present), but it still hurts my heart because I really love this kid.  Am I a guest? The other day I heard him say that my girlfriend is the one looking out for him - and not me because I'm looking out for my own family (my parents and sibblings). This hurts because does he just see me as a funny guest or what?!  I feel trapped! I know this is how it is when having a family, but I genuinely feel that a lot is on their terms. I moved into THEIR home, I wake up when THEY wake up, I eat when THEY eat, I can't play video games until the KID sleeps. I feel like their world is perfect, but not mine.  These are the main things that in one combination hurts and stresses me. I really don't know how to tackle it. My mood and emotions can go from top in a whole week to bottom in a few minutes, especially when I get a gentle ""reminder"" of what my place is in the house.  I get in a vicious circle and I see only the bad things!  I have several times spoken with my girlfriend about and she supports me, but mostly I'm just making conclusions on my own and that's not healthy of me because sometimes I don't see the bigger picture. Deep down inside I know that my stepson in time will see and appreciate that I have been a great father to him, but it's hard to give so much love without getting much back.  Thanks for reading! Any advice is appreciated. "
1682,2.5 year old pinches non-stop,"My wife is at home with my son. The biggest problem that we have is that he pinches us (or even himself!) non-stop. I don't understand why this is happening. The worst is that he does this to himself and then others. It's as if he comes in contact with others and then immediately starts pinching.  Is this due to poor communication on our part? How can I teach him that this hurts and it's not acceptable behavior?  [UPDATE]  He usually pinches himself when he's really upset. When he pinches us we say that what he's doing is bad and that it hurts. The pinching started about 1 year ago, but only recently became much more frequent. In terms of development, he reached all of his milestones normally. "
1683,Child will only sleep while being held - 6 mo,"TL;DR: My son will sleep fine on his bed for about 3-4 hours then will only sleep if held. How do I fix this if we aren't wanting to go through Cry It Out?  Loads of context:   my son is 6 months old sleeps on a floor matress in his own room not yet mobile can roll from belly to back, but not visa versa (yet!) sleeps almost exclusively on belly can sleep for 8 hours without nursing   The history: He was sleeping >8 hours on his own and without waking to nurse. Or might wake 3-4 hours in and be easily put back down after being held a few minutes. Both parents caught a cold and my son had a bad sleep night, and we let him sleep on us. Since then (3 weeks) he has refused to sleep unless held when he wakes up. He started waking up after about 1-2 hours, then we discovered he was teething. We have given acetaminophen or ibuprofen as directed but he still wakes 3-4 hours in and requires cuddles to sleep and wakes up upon being put on his mattress. Additional doses of acetaminophen (after 4 hours) have only helped once, allowing us to get him to sleep on his mattress again. Ibuprofen lasts 8 hours, so no additional doses were given.  Questions: Should we treat this as part of teething that he will grow out of, or as a behavior that we have taught him and must train him to change? Or both...  If training, what methods would you suggest, considering that we are not up for pure Cry It Out   Should we wait for teething to be done before sleep training? "
1684,"How do you operate a successful ""Star Chart""?","So, one of the techniques for improving behaviour that you often hear about is the ""star chart"". You put the focus on good behaviour by adding stars (I nearly said ""badges"") for the good stuff and when the row is complete the child gets a reward.  We're going to start one off tomorrow but my kids are between 5 and 8 and so the reward has to be a big one to be meaningful to them and to keep them engaged. So we have this nice treat lined up for when they've filled 15 or 25 stars or something like that.  I figure on listing under the chart the kinds of behaviour which will earn a star (""getting dressed promptly on school days"", ""fighting less"", ""helping lay the table"" and plenty more besides). They're starting to read now so it'll help to remind all of us what behaviour we're looking for.  I guess my question is, how to make the goals concrete for the children? What we're trying to achieve is sustained reduction in fighting, consistently less nagging required at getting dressed time, regular help with laying the table etc. Awarding a star for just a single instance of getting dressed promptly is pointless, since it already happens from time to time. We're not looking for one-offs.  On the other hand saying x has got to occur 10 times or 5 days in a row, or at least 4 times in one week, in order to earn a star, well, it's just too unmanageable. People will lose count.  Any better ideas?  "
1685,Why does my son behave better when he's alone with one parent than with both?,"Whenever I'm alone with my son, we play, have fun, and he even plays alone with his toys for a long time; this also happens when my wife is alone with him.  However, when we are both present, he becomes clingy and doesn't want to play alone. We must be with him almost all the time (at least one of us, not both), even if he doesn't interact with us he wants us sitting in the floor near him. Otherwise, he cries a lot.  He's 1 year and 7 months old.  What could cause this behavior? How can we try to correct it? "
1686,Financial Situation - Second Child,"At present stage, my partner and I have a 6 month old child and are financially fine (not living a lavish life, just getting by). My partner wants a second child, and my only concern is financially if it's possible, and if others have experience in the matter.   Of course, the entire expense of a toddler is beyond me at this stage, as my child is still very young. I have had a look at the finances we currently have and I do not believe it would be a wise decision, but again, these are estimations:  Income   Salary Fortnightly: [tex]38,624.16 yearly)    Note: No Government assistance is taken into account at this stage  Expenses   Netflix (Monthly): [tex]240.00 a year)   Internet (Monthly): [tex]1,188.00 a year)   Rent (Weekly): [tex]18,980.00 a year)   Groceries (Fortnightly): [tex]7,200.00 a year)   Electricity (Quarterly): [tex]1,400.00 a year assumed)   Water (Quarterly): [tex]1,000.00 a year assumed)   Car (Weekly): [tex]5,200.00 per year, not taking into account servicing and parts)   Fuel (Weekly): [tex]2,600.00 per year assumed)   Phone  (Monthly): [tex]1,140.00 per year)   For clarification, I live in Brisbane, Queensland - Australia.  Of course there are things that can be mitigated (electricity, water, Netflix) but there are also a number of expenses not on this; baby nappies, clothes, shoes, doctors, medicine, toys etc. that are under the ""$150.00/w grocery allowance"".   Running with these numbers, I would find myself to be over-expended by [tex]56.00 per week). Running under the assumption my partner would get a part time / full time job would mitigate some expenses further; higher family tax, but also the incursion of daycare.   My biggest concern here is whilst trying to have a second child and completing the family, we're not correctly equipped financially to support our child. The first two years of his life would be quite a struggle as we'd not want him/her in day care by then.   Whilst I understand that logically the numbers are indicative that it should not be done, I was wondering how others are able to do it (if possible), and if they've lived off less an income? I do want another child, and I would of course find a secondary job, but what other factors would one take into consideration with this move?   My partners suggestion would be that it's best to get the second child out of the way, when they're both close in age, and we then work on both chasing our careers once they're in day care. Sounds fair, but that's a hell of a tight budget to accommodate.   FWIW: I did not post this in Finances as it's not entirely about that. I mean, a second job shouldn't be too hard to come by, it's more a question of as a parent, and starting a family, is it safe/a good move? "
1687,What should I expect regarding development of baby born severely underweight with Symmetrical IUGR?," My baby was born at week 38, weighting 4.5 lbs. According to the ultrasounds, he stopped growing on week 34 and he was diagnosed at birth with Symmetrical IUGR. Before week 34, everything seemed normal. and he always around the 30% percentile.  What problems should I expect, if any, in the development of my baby? Is he supposed to advance according to his age, or develop a few months later as his weight?  What are the the long term problems related to this situation? and what are his chances of being just fine and grow up as a normal child?  Thanks, Worried Parent "
1688,Can I teach my 9-month-old child my native language if I only see her for a few minutes at a time?,I am the father of a 9-month-old girl. I am divorced and my ex-wife speaks only Hebrew with the baby while my mother language is Russian. I am also able to speak Hebrew. I see the baby for about 15-20 minutes every two weeks. I would love her to speak Russian but is that realistic? Does it make sense to speak Russian with her or will it just confuse her? 
1689,4 month old waking frequently during first half of the night,"I have two questions. Firstly is it true that baby should have the deepest sleep in the first half of night? My 4 month old baby used to have a 4-5 hours sleep after I put her to bed from 6:30pm to around 11:00pm. She seems sleeps better before midnight and then wakes up 2/3 times from midnight to morning. But recently she would wake up crying every 5 min before midnight. Most of the time from 10:30pm, last night from 8:30pm. Every time she wakes up me or my habby goes in to bounce her back to sleep. She will fall back to sleep very quickly(she seems to be very sleepy) but wakes up again in just a short time. We try hold her and rock her after she's asleep and that can only get us for up to 10 minutes sleep. (I rock her and hold her for all her naps, she won't sleep on the bed during the day) She will keep waking up and cry. It feels like something bothering her. I thought it might be teething pain or gas pain or too cold or warm. But after midnight she can sleep for three hours in one go. And a bit more peacefully. Is there any particular cause for baby wakes up only first half of the night?    Some background information, She's having two night feeds at 12:30 and 3:30am. She has three to four naps a day. The naps are from 50min to 2.5hrs. In total she naps for 4-4.5hrs. Her bed time normally around 6:30pm to 6:30am.   Second question is after midnight if she wakes up completly for some reason(I didn't attend to her in time when she wakes up hugry) she won't settle back to sleep for an hour! She will talk to herself or moving around or sucking her feast. If I try bounce her back to sleep she will keep moving and talking. She just won't sleep. If this happens around five it can last for even longer. Is this because she sleeps too much? I tried different bedtime. I found her happily go to bed at 6:30pm. If it's too early or late it takes a lot longer to settle her. Also I found if she wakes up before 6:30 she will look tired and catnapping whole day. I tried to lengthen her waking time during the day(currently around an hour) but she will be shutting and cranky if I don't settle her to sleep.   Please help.  "
1690,Son screams in crib at the top of his lungs until Mom comes in,"My toddler son has recently discovered how to scream at the top of his lungs, it seems.  It sounds like he's being murdered or something.  When he cries and wants something, he does this usually now.  He's about 16 months old and this started about a week ago.  Also about the same time he started waking up constantly at night when nobody is with him.  We've actually had him sleeping in his own room in his crib since he was about 8 months old and it's never been a big issue (occasional wake-ups, especially when teething, but nothing major).  We did a little traveling right before Christmas time, so he slept in the same room as us in a crib provided by the hotel.  I'm not sure if this has anything to do with his sudden attachment to having us in the same room.  As of 2 nights ago, he only will be quiet and lay back down if his mother is the one who comforts him.  I used to be able to, but not any more.    By ""comfort"" I mean, just be present in the same room as him.  As soon as he sees either of us (well now just her) he would lay down, close his eyes and go to sleep.  This makes me think that he's not in pain or sick or anything, but I could be wrong.  I've never gotten angry with him, but last night I found myself yelling at the top of my lungs partially out of anger and frustration but also just to get my voice over his and I finally had to just walk out of the house.  I don't know what has changed with him.  We had a few nights back in town (since traveling for xmas) where he was fine by himself in his crib.    summary / tl;dr; in the last week my son developed the following annoying behaviors:   Screams at the top of his lungs Needs someone in the room with him while he sleeps (and has an uncanny ability to detect when we're not there and wake up) The last 2 nights he has only responded positively (by shutting the h*ll up) when his mom is the one to enter the room.   A couple other things to note:   We noticed him tugging on his left ear today during the day.  I thought possibly it was an ear infection, but I haven't noticed him doing it at all at night while this mayhem is occurring.  I think he might be teething (he seems to always be teething and it's usually pretty manageable with some Tylenol - but that's not preventing him from waking and screaming his head off) I haven't gotten angry with him besides tonight, and I can't think of anything that would have changed that is making him demand Mom only.  We usually take turns but the last 2 nights it's been her only because if I enter the room it's just as bad, if not worse, than before.   Anybody know what I can do to calm this behavior?  Or what I can do to help my wife?  Or what could be causing such a behavior?   Btw, it's 7am right now and we've hardly slept more than an hour maybe tonight.  He's screaming as I type this and somehow my wife has slept through it (pure exhaustion is my guess), but if I go there it changes nothing.  At worst, he was waking up about 5 minutes or less after she leaves the room.  There was one point tonight where he maintained his sleep for about 1.5 hours straight but he just woke up a few minutes ago.  Thank you "
1691,Should I push my parents to divorce?,"My father suffers from depression, my mother and I constantly try to help him. Five years ago my grandmother, that is his mother, unexpectedly died, and my grandfather's Alzheimer's became evident.  His disease got considerably worse this year, to the point he talks no more, seemingly remembers nothing, doesn't follow a conversation and stays most of the time at bed. Heartbreaking for anyone, let alone my father.  He hadn't been able to accept his situation and her death for a while, but now he kind of has. However, he does try to ignore death, for example he let my mother go to a funeral instead of him, even if the not too close relative was actually his, and asked her nothing when she came back.  After what happened, he is experiencing a strong fear of loss.  Of losing me, now that I moved to a big city to study.  Terrorism added to the mix (we live in Europe), and when I went (regardless of coming back very often and texting and calling every day), he fell into depression, losing weight too.   A year passed and perhaps he's better physically, but he is still very anxious, still doesn't have a reasonable picture of reality. He still hardly laughs to jokes. He still doesn't live well. And obviously it's hard for my mother too. Some months ago we managed to convince him to see a psychiatrist (how hard it was!), though unfortunately it seems the dosage might not be adequate. Well, I hope it's a matter of dosage.  Apart from the juvenile infatuation, I remember that when I was a grown up kid they never were a lovely couple, often argued, but sometimes they had fun together.  With his depression, things got worse. They certainly haven't exchanged the words ""I love you"" for years, no kisses either. He pretty much has lost the will to do stuff, to enjoy life. He lives in his own world where he has a terrible job (false), makes terrible sacrifices (false) and has to anxiously check if I'm right. My mother is being left out. He almost never makes compliments to her and almost always nitpicks about things.  He even forgot her last birthday! In the evening he noticed she were grumpy, and she told him why. He apologized, sure, but obviously he should have remedied his mistake the day after with some special thing, and obviously he did nothing! Unfortunately I learnt about this with their latest argument.   It started because of a related TV promotion, when she stimulated him about necessity of enjoying life, and he rapidly got mad, saying once again the world is too dangerous for not being anxious. After a while my mother made her suffering clear, mentioning her birthday, and he dismissed what she said and replied that was an unimportant mistake, and that she is awful for not forgiving him. He proceeded saying he had never forgotten before (which is true, but didn't get a decent enough present for her 50th two years ago) and that she shouldn't tease him, but be nice to him and help him not to be afraid.   Seeing he didn't recognize her patience and her help, she reminded him the very last time she encouraged him to keep calm; my father got mad as if she were accusing him of having been too worried that time, while he allegedly was just making sure of things. Moral of the story: he didn't recognize her care.  In 3 months it's been at least 3 times my mother told him the situation has become critical, with them being unable to understand each other, and said they should not remain together if nothing is left but suffering. He always replied giving her ""freedom of action"". But they have been together for more than 25 years and they have me, it is a very hard decision.  Deep inside I think she still loves him, and she definitely cares for him, she feels compassion for his situation.  But she's starting to cede. On the other hand, he probably doesn't love her anymore, and his depression minimized his affection. They might have divorced, had I not been here. I'm quite confused.  Should I talk more insistently to my father even if he doesn't listen to me, or should I push my mother to divorce? Or should I wait for the dosage to be increased? "
1692,Guilt as a natural consequence of bad/wrong behaviour,"We all know that natural consequences is the best tool when dealing with inappropriate behaviour. However, one of natural consequences of doing something bad to another person is feeling guilty for what you have done.   My intuition tells me that guilt cannot be used as discipline tool, so my first question is: am I right? I have an impression that using guilt as a form of punishment leads to children having pshychological problems, and even neurosis. But I have never seen proper studies about it, so I would be grateful, if you could recommend me some, if it's really true.  My second question is more practical. How can I help a child to overcome the feeling of guilt? I don't say the children don't need to feel guilty at all, but there must be a moment when they get over it, and an adult should be there to help.  Note: this question might seem a bit too abstract, because I am asking it in advance. My child is only three, so it's still unrelevant to her. But I feel that the answer will be useful for me in future.  Edit: I am very grateful for the answers explaining the difference between guilt and shame. Don't you think that these feelings are mixed in a child? I am also concerned about sensitive children, those who do not need to be told twice and tend to analyse their behaviour a lot.  I also doubt the effectiveness of feeling guilty to prevent repetition of bad behaviour, as it doesn't fade of quickly enough and one can get used to it.  "
1693,Tandem nursing make my wife condition becoming worse,"Since two months ago, my wife is pregnant and decide to keep breastfeeding our first son. This tandem nursing make my wife condition is becoming worse. My wife is having a flu for this two months. When my wife increase the frequency of breastfeeding, my wife's health is worser, the flu is getting heavy, plus a cough. This situation make us planning to stop tandem nursing. I am afraid that when the fetus is getting bigger, my wife body can't handle to do tandem nursing. I did search and read articles related tandem nursing. But i haven't found that tandem nursing has probability to make mom conditions is getting worse, just like what happens to my wife. It seems that my wife body cannot handle to do tandem nursing.  Does anyone have ever face this situation? How do you handle this situation? Any good references would be appreciated too. "
1694,How to deal with tantrums in an 8-year-old child?,"We have three boys aged 4, 8 and 10. The youngest and eldest seem to be fine and no issues, but the middle child is quite willful and having tantrums. It's like he never quite grew out of the terrible twos. Small things the other two have no issue with can upset him and set off a terrible tantrum. He seems to have trouble co-operating with others and getting into rows with other children and teachers.  How should we deal with tantrums at this age? How do we help him improve his ""emotional regulation""? "
1695,How can I persuade a preschooler to wear a suit?,"A few month ago, I asked: Can I avoid nice clothing being a source of argument? That was mainly focused on my eight year old, and now I have a related question... but about a preschooler.    Our youngest (three and a half) only wants to wear about five shirts, all t-shirts with dogs on them. Any other t-shirts (e.g. dinosaurs, trains) are rejected as ""too fancy""* and are only worn after a lot of arguing or negotiating. An actually ""fancy"" shirt (with a collar, either polo or button-down) is rejected and leads to incredible tantrums if we try to push the issue; I once suggested he could wear a tie and he nearly exploded.  Since he's a preschooler, this has not yet been a major problem: we don't go many ""fancy"" places anyway, and there are different standards for acceptable clothing for young kids in a lot of situations. But, he's been asked to be the ring bearer in my cousin's wedding. If we accept, the event is going to require a suit.  I have no idea how to get him interested in the idea of dressier clothing. We have two months to prepare: what can I try to make him more open to different, ""fancy"" clothes?    * I feel it's important to note that neither parent defined these shirts as fancy: it's an adjective that he decides how and when to use, and we have a tough time predicting when it will be an issue. (I would not, on my own, decide that a bicycle t-shirt is fancier than a doggy t-shirt.) I'm also unclear on why fancy is a bad thing, but that's the implication he makes. "
1696,How to quell toddler's fear in time of emergency?,"Suppose the alarm is starting and we must reach shelter as soon as possible for fear of falling missiles.  Our 2 y/o daughter understands most words and conditions, but I can't think of a good way to explain such a situation to her especially if it will happen in the middle of the night and she's forced out of sleep.  I believe many parents will make it a game for their children, for example ""Let's race to the shelter, the winner get a candy"" or ""this noisy sound means we start a running contest"" etc. However shouldn't we explain the real situation? At what age is it appropriate?  Are there other things to consider? "
1697,"What are the legal, emotional, and/or behavioral repercussions of confiscating money as a punishment?","Let's assume I'm a parent and that I use this punishment, for the sake of the question.  The primary punishment I use to discipline my children is to confiscate money. It seems fairly effective in preventing them from repeating behaviors, as they only misbehave the same way once or twice after I repeatedly take their money. While I don't keep the amounts of money consistent, to throw them off, I typically take $1 for every time they:   use inappropriate language refuse to do chores (persistently) act mildly rude   And a bit more when they:   hit one another act excessively rude turn in late/missing assignments (children are homeschooled)   The most I've ever taken was $25 because I asked my daughter to walk to an activity after being quite rude and she refused.  For reference, none of the children have any steady income (oldest is 13). The younger ones receive most of their money from allowance, the older from yard work/babysitting.  So while this punishment is effective and they usually apologize/repent for their behavior, I'm not sure of the downsides of it. Are there any possible behavioral, emotional, or legal repercussions? For example, if one of my children were to tell another adult about my punishment, would I get in trouble? Or could it cause lasting resentment towards me?  This is the easiest disciplining method I've ever used, but I don't want to continue taking their money if it's going to cause problems. Any thoughts? I'm looking for any criticisms you might have.  To whom it may concern, we currently reside in the Portland area of Oregon. "
1698,How do you identify/relieve/prevent constipation in toddlers?,"My son has had a couple of bouts of constipation, and they're pretty unpleasant for the whole family.  The first time he was up all night, every hour, crying inconsolably.  We had no idea what the problem was until we could get to the pediatrician.    Now we worry about constipation whenever he cries in the middle of the night, even if he had a bowel movement earlier that evening.  Sometimes the crying is simply from a bad dream, but a couple of times it has been due to other (less severe) bouts of constipation.  Aside from ""waking up in the middle of the night and crying"", how can you tell when a toddler is constipated before he can fully verbalize the problem?    What are the best ways of relieving constipation once it becomes an issue, and how can you help avoid it altogether?  We know of another child my son's age (2) that has had near-constant constipation issues. "
1699,Does anyone know a cautionary tale about seeing the bigger picture?,"I want to teach my kids the value of stepping back and taking a look at the bigger picture. A story or fable would be great, although I'm pretty sure Aesop didn't write one about this subject.   The metaphor about not being able to see the wood for the trees doesn't really cut it.  Can anybody think of a good story that fits the bill? It doesn't have to be packaged as cautionary tale with a moral at the end - any good fairy tale or modern fiction even would do just as well - as long as I can read it in one session.   They're 5 and 8 years old. I expect the 8-year-old to pick up the idea immediately, but I think a good story for the 5-year-old will be key, especially for referring back to (e.g. remember what the prince did which stopped him falling into the witch's trap?)  I guess it's basically about teaching them to find a micro-second to consider a thought before going with the flow or being swept along or charging into something. "
1700,"My son calls my father in law Grandpa ""nonno"" (in italian) and his wife (step grandma) is telling my son to call him just Grandpa now not nonno","My son has always called his grandma (my mother-in-law) the Italian word for grandma, ""nonna"" and his grandpa ""nonno"", the Italian word for grandpa. Recently my son called his grandpa ""nonno"" in front of his new wife and she then told him to start calling him just Grandpa Steve instead of ""nonno"".   I asked why and she said because it sounds like my father-in-law and mother-in-law are still married and that's not fair to her. I just looked at my father-in-law and he didn't say anything. My husband wasn't present when this conversation happened but he wasn't happy. He said there's no way she (step-grandma) is going to change the way my son calls my father-in-law.    What should I do? Am I overreacting or am I right for also feeling like she has no say so in what my child calls his grandpa?  "
1701,Room sleeping temperature for babies in tropical climates,"So the consensus online is that babies should sleep in a room with a temperature between 16 to 21 degrees.  But there are millions of babies born in hot tropical climates to families with low income, where the temperature even at night time will be 28-32 degrees Celsius. So obviously they do not sleep at 16 to 21 degrees, but are fine. So what is the deal here? How can this contradict the common recommendation? What happens if a person from a cold climate has a baby with a person from a tropical climate, and the baby is born in the tropical climate. Is it then okay for the baby to sleep in a room at 28 degrees? "
1702,Why does my formula suggest mixing it in only a portion of the water?,"The directions for Holle baby formula say to boil water, let it cool, put 2/3 of the water into the bottle, then add the formula, then add the remaining 1/3 of the water.  Is it necessary to add 2/3 of the water, then the formula, then the remaining 1/3 of the water? Or can we just add the full water amount and then the formula? "
1703,How to handle disobediant children as non-parental authority figure,"I volunteer with children regularly, usually very young preschool or toddler age.  One of the common issues I have noticed is that handling disobeying children can become complicated when your the authority figure trusted with the child, but in a volunteer format where exact expectations from parents are unclear.  For example, I once was a teacher aid for sunday school class for preschool age children, and I was the one responsible for handling distractions and problematic children so the teacher could focus on her lesson.  These kids were so young, with no experience with this sort of format, and so we had a decent number of issues with kids just not knowing what the rules were they were suppose to follow.  Most of the time simple corrections would be all it took, maybe taking away a toy.  However, what happens if a child refuses to give me a toy, or if I tell two fighting kids to sit in opposite corners to separate them and one refuses to do so?  With a kid in my family I would physically take the toy, or carry them to where they need to be.  However, I don't know what the parents' opinion will be of my using physical force to control their children.  I'm already a male , which sadly means I have to watch my every action due to idiotic prejudice about men working with kids, so I'm afraid of any risk of being seen overstepping my boundaries.  One child I remember fondly was not a bad kid, but was hyperactive (ADHD), had a desperate desire for attention, even if negative, and did not yet understand why his acting out in class was a problem.  He was a real nightmare of distraction, running away just so someone would have to chase him because he thought it was fun, doing stuff to force me to give him attention to make him stop etc. He could easily single handled prevent any lesson from being taught if left unchecked.   Ultimately I managed to work out a policy of giving lots of positive attention whenever possible, and making 'discipline' from acting out as boring as possible for him; it worked pretty well actually, and his mother told us she was very pleased with the progress he made with us, to the point she felt ready to put him into school a year earlier.  However, part of handling him meant (very short) time outs for misbehaving where I would have to sit beside him (while pointedly giving no interesting attention to him) to stop him when he inevitably tried to get up and run away from the char (which happened multiple times per time-out originally).  The first time we used this timeout policy I had to physically stop him probably a dozen times in just a few minutes.  I had the mother's defacto permission in this case; however, I don't know how I would have handled this child if I didn't have explicit permission to physically restrain him if needed.  I could see some overbearing parents being quite displeased with the same course of action I used with this child if I hadn't gotten express permission.  So my question is how do you handle these situations as a defacto-authority figure?  How do you know where the limit of the authority afforded to you by the parents are, and when they would consider it crossed.  And what methods do I have to deal with infractions, including fighting between children, which really can't be ignored, if the child won't cooperate with me and I don't know what authority I have? "
1704,How can I ensure my 14-year old's safety on a major trip away from home?,"Brace yourselves, it's going to be a long one... I hope this is an acceptable question here; if not I wonder if the Interpersonal Skills board might take it?  TL;DR: My 14-year old daughter wants to visit a young man I've never met who lives a significant distance from us. I'm reasonably confident it's safe because of context, but I want to know how I can be more certain.  I'm a single mother with a 14-year old daughter, who we'll call Lydia. A few years ago (think when Lydia was 11-12), we had an older (17-18) female friend (call her Ella) who she'd met at school babysit for her after school while I was still at work. Ella became a good friend to Lydia, and I trust her (Ella).  I assume they hung out together at school as well, as over the summer holidays 2016, Lydia started mentioning some of Ella's friends in idle conversation. Fast forward slightly: she started talking to one of these friends (Ella's age, and we'll call him Oliver) on Facebook. They've met in person a few times, both with and without Ella present, so I'm confident that at least he's a real person who is who he claims to be.  For better or worse, Ella dropped out of our lives when she left school and went to university. Oliver didn't (drop out of our lives that is) - Lydia continued talking to him online and they have a good friendship. Lydia is having a number of mental health issues that she won't talk to me about (I think I've reacted the wrong way to them previously so she won't trust me with them any more, but that's another issue), but she talks to Oliver about them and says he's really helped her.  The current situation: Oliver is at university around 100 miles away from us (""us"" being in London). Recently, Lydia brought up to me the idea of going to see him for a day or potentially a weekend. I hope some other parents on this board can see why I'm nervous about that.  I would like to be able to allow her to go, because I think it would help her and make her happier, but I'm still not entirely without concern. The journey itself is not a concern: it's not a difficult trip by train, I could take her to the station one end and Oliver could pick her up at the other. However, while I'm reasonably sure that Oliver is who he claims to be and Lydia would be safe, I've never personally met him, which makes me nervous.  How can I talk to Lydia about this? What can I do to allay my own fears? Going with her is out of the question - she would rather not go than have me with her. What other options are there? "
1705,is a long car ride safe for my newborn?,"Im planning a trip from vermont to New York,  its about a 4 and a half hour trip and my babygirl is 1 month old. Im just worried she will get overwhelmed at being in the carseat so long, of course I will stop whenever necessary,  I breastfeed and dont use bottles yet. Im also worried she will get sick, or her body will be in pain or cramp from the same position so long. Is this a safe trip and what other things should I do to ensure she will be okay??  "
1706,What should I do about my pre-teen son messaging older girls he's never met?,"My 12 year son seems to be growing up way too soon.. He went from playing with his Legos one day to next texting girls the next. He goes back and forth. One day he is in the shower playing with his action figures and a few hours later acting very grown.   One problem here is that I found him Kiking (an instant message application for mobile devices) girls he has never meet before. One girl is 15, going by the last name of ""Sexton"" and showing a little too much skin. His profile says ""very single"". This is all too new for me and nerve-racking. How do I go about this? Should I let him continue using Kik? I'm one that believed I can try to prevent it but they'll eventually find a way.   I want him to trust me and I want to trust him. I don't know where to start in advising him, if I should take phone iPod privileges away. He doesn't do that great in school either. He went from always on the honor roll to failing at least 2 classes every quarter. He was a very good kid, now he is always lying. What can I do? Any advice on how I can handle this situation, especially from those with a similar experience? "
1707,Impact of moving to Germany with a stepson and a toddler with signs of autism,"I live in the midwestern U.S. with my wife, my 8 year old stepson and our 2 year old son who shows signs of and is undergoing therapy for autism. The company I work for just offered to relocate us to their headquarters in Germany for a period of 2-4 years. My wife and I love it there and have daydreamed about spending more time abroad, and it would be an excellent career opportunity. No one can make this decision except us and I'm not looking for a recommendation. I am seeking wisdom from other parents on what kinds of issues we should be thinking about to make this decision, pros and cons, or general opinions and advice on some of the specific issues to aid in our decisionmaking.   My stepson visits his biological father every other weekend and they have a positive relationship. He pays child support and we would need to reach an agreement with him, maybe involving allocating the support money toward travel expenses to send him back a couple times a year. He also has two half-brothers who he sees at his dad's. Our 2 year old is ""presumed autistic"" (our doctor won't officially diagnose it until age 2 1/2). He has serious language and behavioral delays. We're set up with local resources that provide 1-on-1 therapy sessions for language and behavioral development and have been doing this for about a month. My wife quit her job last fall and has been staying home with the kids and plans to continue to do this whether or not we move.   So naturally, some things we have to think about are:   How would a move to a foreign country affect our younger son's development? Would being exposed to a foreign language impair his development even more or is there a potential it could actually help? How would the older son react to moving so far away from his biological father? He and I have a wonderful relationship as well, he loves, trusts and respects me, we have bonded very deeply and he has adapted very well to having a dad and a stepdad. Would a change like this ruin a good thing and plant seeds of discontent, resentment, regret, ... where there don't seem to be any now? We can see this as an amazing life experience for the kids - we can always come back in a few years if we want and the trip would expose them to lots of culture and history they wouldn't get otherwise. Or we can also see it as taking them away from a life experience they're already used to and happy with.   Thanks for any thoughts and talking points you might have. For the purposes of this question we can ignore issues of finance or logistics. I'll be posting a similar question on Travel.SE about some logistics questions and will add a link here when I do; but here I'm chiefly concerned with the kids and the impact this decision might have on our family.

Is she old enough to be amazed by magic, or are we projecting ourselves onto her? "

1710,How do you tell if a toddler is lactose intolerant?,"Our daughter was breast-fed until about 1 year-old, with a variety of table foods as she got older.  During this time she would ocassionally get skin rashes, but we didn't think much of it.  When she turned 1, we started her on whole milk, and a normal balanced diet.  In the 6 months since then, she is averaging about one ear infection per month, and has chronically dry skin.    She got ear tubes, but she continues to get regular ear infections.  Now her doctors are recommending adenoid removal.  Before we go to that, we want to consider that both the skin trouble and ear infections might be allergic reactions.  The most likely allergy seems to be dairy products.  We've started her on soy milk, and she's gotten another ear infection since then.  But we haven't tried completely eliminating dairy from her diet (because that is very hard to do!)  Are there any reliable ways to tell if she is having a reaction to dairy products?  If we were able to completely eliminate dairy from her diet for some time, should we expect the skin trouble and ear infections to completely go away (assuming they were are a reaction to dairy)?  Update: We've had our daughter on no dairy for about a month now.  Her skin has been about the same, and she's gotten her usual monthly ear infection.  We are now pretty confident that she doesn't have an issue with dairy.  To confirm that, we plan to heavily reintroduce dairy to her diet.  Assuming no noticable changes at that point, we'll assume she's good. "
1711,How to persuade my father to stop physically abusing my mother?,"In summary: I am the daughter. My mother is being domestically abused by my father. What can I do to make him stop without hurting my mother in any way? - she still loves him!  Details: My father is a very abusive character. When I was a child, he used to go into 'rage' modes where he would just beat the life out of my mother. Trying to interfere would only get me enough injuries to not be able to go to school for the next week. As he got older, the rages got fewer but he would still lash out randomly. I'm not talking about the odd slap to the face kind of abuse - I am talking about the kind of abuse that lasts for up to 20 minutes, and renders my mother bloody and swollen and not able to walk for days. Growing up it was extremely painful (physically and mentally) for me and I still wake up from the nightmares. I was terrified of him - I think I've spoken about 15 words with him my entire life.  I moved out when I was 18, reasoning that I could get my mother to come live with me, but she refuses to go anywhere without him.   The last time I went to visit, they started an argument and I interfered and told my dad to back off.  He started yelling things at my mother saying she's been training me to go against him, and I wound up backing off at the request of my mother.  I would very much like to file a complaint against him but that would just make things worse for my mother - she wants to be with my father (and I don't understand her) and furthermore, if I do file a complaint, I am sure I will never be able to see my mother again.  I have thought of this so much for the past week that I am hopeless and see no way forward. I even considered paying him some cash every month, almost a bribe to not fight with my mother.  Can you think of any way I can put an end to this without hurting my father's ego so it wouldn't create any more consequences? If only I can find a way to persuade him to not physically abuse my mother...   I moved out to a different country as soon as I could (that's how much distance I wanted between us) and though I now live in a better place, my mother still lives in a third world country where help for cases like this is not readily available - certainly no helpline that I can find online, but a legal action may be a possibility. During the times when ""arranged marriage"" was the only acceptable type of marriage, my parents loved each other and, naturally, their parents / family did not agree to that, so they had to do the ""runaway marriage"" - because of this, neither my mother's family nor my father's family are now in contact with any of us. So getting family members involved is not an option.   Thank you for answering, I was just hopeful that maybe there is a way.. a strategy.. or something I could to to intervene. Looks like professional help is the way to go, though I am scared of that route. "
1712,What age is it appropriate to start martial arts?,I would like to send my son to learn martial arts as soon as possible as I believe this would help him gain confidence in his early stages of life (it worked for me when I was an adult)  At what age should I send him? I suppose this question could apply to any sport though Are some martial arts more appropriate than others for kids or is it just a matter of preference? 
1713,What to do if my new-born child urinated into own ear?,"OK, I know how it sounds, but this really happened today!  As is usual with boys, while changing the diaper he transformed into a fountain. I tried to cover myself with my hand, which deflected the stream and a few drops got into his ear.  I was told that you should not try to wash/clean internal parts of an ear of a new-born child. OTOH, I believe that humidity inside ear, hygiene, and aesthetics provide some good reasons to clean up the mess in this case. Are the acids from child's urine dangerous for ears? What should I use to clean it up? "
1714,How to feed a 2-year-old without using an iPad or TV to distract him?,"   Possible Duplicate:   How do you feed a picky eater?       We try to feed our 24-month-old son the same food for dinner as we are having ourselves. Obviously, we mash or chop it and avoid the strong flavours he doesn't like (curry or garlic).  Most of the time, he will point blank refuse without even tasting, demanding apple-sauce or fruit or something sweet. Fruit is good but we want to give him a variety.  However if we set up an iPad with sesame street on he'll be so distracted that he'll eat pretty much whatever we put in front of him, even asking for more when he's finished.   How do we get him to accept the food without the iPad? "
1715,How does Elimination Communication work?,"Elimination Communication was mentioned in a comment on another question, and I started looking into it.  It seems an interesting concept, but I don't understand quite how it works.  How do you determine the timing?  Once you've established the timing, how do you keep up with the changes as the baby gets older?  Wikipedia talks about the basics, but more details would be helpful.  For example:     Parents report that some babies as young as three months will appear to hold all their bowel movements until they are held in a particular squat position, as long as this is offered regularly enough.   What is this ""particular squat position""?  What else should someone attempting Elimination Communication know? "
1716,What should be done when your child wakes up from a nap and is extremely irritable?,"We have a daughter who takes naps and (usually) wakes up extremely cranky and irritable. She is 1 month away from being 3. Because she is so irritable, she'll usually cry when she wakes up. Depending on the day, it can range all the way to 30 straight minutes of crying. But, it's not always like this. Sometimes she'll wake up from a nap and not cry a bit or even be cranky. Usually we can get her to calm down after 10-15 minutes of crying by doing some playful activity. Or sometimes she'll want something such as to watch a certain TV show, to do a certain activity, a certain food, etc. If we don't(or can't) give her what she wants, that's when the 30 minute crying sessions happen.   We're not really for sure what to do. Instincts tell me that she appears to be crying to manipulate us into getting what she wants, but if this is the case she is extremely stubborn and content with crying until her voice is hoarse. What we've tried:   Time out until she is done crying (works about 25% of the time) Attempt to distract her with something fun or interesting(works about 25% of the time. Most of the time she is just not interested) Holding her and soothing her until she is done crying (if she wants something, this hardly ever works unless we give it to her though... and it can again take 15-30 minutes for her to calm down when my wife is doing this)    Some of the things she requests are things like    Candy/junk food A particular food(other than junk food, such as eggs) To watch a certain TV show For us to play with her in her room(when we're trying to get her to eat dinner)   All of these things are particularly problematic because she usually falls asleep when we are preparing dinner. We usually try to keep her awake, but it's nearly impossible when she wants to take a nap.   What should be done in these instances? Has anyone else experienced their children doing the same thing?   Note: Other than these fits, she's usually pretty well behaved(I'd dare to say better than most toddlers at least) and temper tantrums and the like are handled well with a time out(she even knows when she starts crying to go sit at her time out spot and will usually go there before we even tell her to) "
1717,helping a child deal with a parent who lies,"I emphasise that this is a prospective question - I am asking about how to prepare for a situation that has not fully arisen yet.   My wife is emotionally abusive, and while we are currently in a phase of working on our marriage, I think it is most likely that it will end soon. One of the central parts of her abusive behaviour has been gaslighting - denying things she did and accusing me of things I didn't do, while implying that I am mentally ill - and over the past year that has developed into full-blown  lying.  She will act badly and then simply lie about what happened, usually by claiming I did something I never did.  We have two children - an eight year old girl and a four year old son - and I think that so far my wife has not been consistently dishonest with them (though she has done it to our daughter on occasion).  However, as they grow older and begin to challenge her further, I expect her to start using the same tactics on them, unless she works on herself, which currently looks unlikely.  My question is - is there anything I can do to gently teach my kids to trust their own memories and versions of reality (for instance, keeping a journal), to prepare them for this eventuality?  And assuming we do get a divorce, what should I do when the children tell me of episodes like this?  What should I tell the kids? "
1718,What are the proper precaution for using cow's milk to feed babies?,"There's a great guide for using pumped breastmilk...in it, there are tons of guidelines for:   How long it can be kept after it has been heated up? If a baby didn't finish a bottle, how long before you have to toss the remaining milk? etc.   Is there such a guide for cow's milk? I couldn't find a comprehensive site like the above for it. I found a related question here, but it only address one case...heating up the milk.  NOTE: My daughter is older than 12 months. "
1719,Napping and early waking?,"A child (3 years 10 months) wakes every morning at 5am.  When he is with me he has a midday nap which can last 3 hours. He is clearly tired when he wants to nap, and if he wakes too early from his nap he will return to sleep - sometimes being quite distressed that he woke early.  He goes to nursery 4 days a week and I assume they let him nap there.  He will start school soon (England: we start formal school very young) and I'm not sure if they'll have napping there.  My question: would removing his midday nap improve his early waking?  Or would it just create an over-tired little boy? "
1720,Why does this special tune makes my 2.5 year old daughter sad?,"A few weeks ago my daughter saw a turtle toy being used by some other kid in kindergarten. She asked us to buy her one too and so just before Christmas, we bought one. This is the kind of turtle toy that you can turn its lights on and then it projects stars on ceiling and can also play different songs/tunes. I guess it is primary function would be to get kid asleep at night.   The next day my wife called me at work and asked if I could get home earlier. Our daughter had been playing this one particular song for almost  two hours and had been crying and calling for me. So I got home as soon as possible and she gave me a big hug and we played a lot together, yet she was still sad and would not let the turtle away from her. Finally, I managed to hide turtle and after some time she was normal.  The next day was a weekend, so I stayed at home. When she got up, she started to  play this song again and began to be sad again. She refused to play or do anything and would hug me or my wife all the time and occasionally begin to cry. I tried to get turtle away or to at least change song, but she refused. She demanded this particular song and wouldn't let the turtle away from her. Once again, she looked very sad and behaved strange.  In the end, we hide the turtle and I removed the batteries later. Now when there is no way for the turtle to play this song, she acts like a happy, normal kid.  I can't figure what was that all about!   Why would one particular song make her behave or feel that way? Have any of you had similar experience?  "
1721,Would switching to a Waldorf kindergarten be worth the potential stress to our active pre-schooler?,"We've just moved to Germany from London.   Our 4 years old son, who loved going to the kindergarten in London, seems to have a lot of trouble settling in to the German kindergarten.   Language is not an issue, and he is fluent in German.  We've just received a letter from a Waldorf kindergarten that they would accept him, but we are afraid that if we decide to switch him, it could be stressful for him again.  Is it worth it?   Why would you strongly recommend the switch?  If it helps, our boy is very active, with extra batteries attached :) He'd rather play football all day long than sit down and draw a picture.  Would Waldorf be a good fit for this type of kid? "
1722,When should you start brushing your child's teeth?,"My seven-month-old son just cut his first two teeth.  When do we start to brush them?  Is two teeth enough to brush?  Or should I wait until he has more?  If so, how many more? "
1723,Baby started solids and stopped pooing. When should I be worried?,I've read that it's normal for babies to go many days without doing a poo once they first start eating solids. I'm just wondering    at what point should a parent be concerned that their baby hasn't gone? Are there any signs that I should look out for? Is there anything I should be doing during this time?  
1724,Sleeping routines and mother-father differences,"The tl;dr version:   The father can get a toddler to sleep easily, but the mother struggles. Has anyone else experienced this and if so, what strategies were used to overcome it?   Scenario:  We have an 18 month old son who nurses twice per day. He's been going to a daycare from the time he's been 15 months old. I drop him off in the morning at around 07:45 and my wife picks him up after he eats lunch at around 13:00. He seems really happy there (based on our observations, the reports from the workers, and the excitement he gets when he arrives there), but since he started there, he hasn't consistently napped.   Since he was about 8 months, I have been solely responsible for putting him to bed at night. He and I developed a nice routine and he would go to bed and fall asleep without fuss 99% of the time. At that time, my wife would get him to nap by nursing him. In preparation for the daycare transition, my wife slowly reduced the nursing sessions to twice per day: once in the morning before breakfast and once in the evening before supper.   Now he won't nap except for on the weekends when I'm there. Recently I took a two week vacation from work in the hope that I would be able to help get him some much-needed naptime and then transition him over to his mother for naps once a routine was established. During those two weeks he slept great during the day, but now that I'm back at work, he won't nap. He just screams and screams and screams as soon as his mother puts him into his crib no matter what she does. He'll scream for 1.5 hours and then my wife will go and get him. In the early days of this, she would then get him to nap either by lying down with him and then by taking him for a drive in the car. He would usually fall asleep right away, but she can't then transition him back to his crib.   What we've tried:  My wife has tried to adopt and adapt our routine to no avail. She's tried to develop a routine completely different from mine. None of this works. The only way our son will nap is in the car or sleeping (and nursing) in our bed with his mother. Neither of these options are optimal.   Question:  Has anyone else experienced this circumstance. Is it just to do with differences in the ways that we've interacted with our son? It's starting to make my wife crazy and very upset. It's obviously difficult to hear your son who you love scream for an hour and despite my protests, she inevitably sees it as somehow being her fault. Of course, it isn't but that's hard to accept. If anyone manages to read through this, I'd be interested to know if anyone else has experienced anything similar to this and if so, what they've done to cope. Or if anyone has a theory about what might be behind this, I'm all ears! "
1725,How to get 2 year old to vocalize words?,"I have a two year old (just turned two) boy that doesn't speak much.  He vocalizes only a few words (like ""mom"", ""up"", and ""grandpa"") clearly but other than those, he's largely silent.  He seems content being silent except when he wants something and is frustrated that he can't say it.  He does do a few simple sign-lanugage signs (""more"", ""all done"", etc) that we taught him.  He babbles some, but mostly when he's alone (right before bed or right after waking up).  He's wants us to read books to him all the time, and he can follow verbal directions from me so I'm confident he understands what's being said.  His pediatrician does not think he's exhibiting any signs for autism and other than his verbal development - he's healthy, well-rounded, and achieving the proper developmental milestones.  I haven't had success with the technique of offering choices to entice him to speak (i.e. ""do you want the red shirt or the blue shirt?""), he just watches and doesn't say anything.  I'm sure I'm over-simplifying, but it seems to me like he just doesn't want to talk.  Are there techniques I could use to get him to speak? "

1727,"9-year-old received tablet as gift, but he does not have the self-control or maturity to own a tablet","Summary:  Upon receiving the tablet, his first course of action was to install a game. For various reasons, I believe that he has proven himself to be irresponsible with such devices, and it would be detrimental to his development to have it. What should I do?  Full text:   Recent positive behavior: Starting to follow his schedule, completing homework on time albeit with constant nagging and frequent yelling. Recent negative behavior: He installed malware on his computer in an attempt to install video games, then denied doing so when confronted. He executed a factory-reset on dad's workplace cellphone, and he changed some obscure language settings on dad's computer. This resulted in data loss, wasted time, and lost productivity. I discussed with him the blunders described above, what went wrong and how to avoid them. Next, I spent some time telling him about being humble and modest, as opposed to gloating. I was satisfied with his reception to this talk and gave him the gift. One minute after receiving the tablet, he naturally (and to my great dismay) went gloating to our dad, who commented in a sarcastic tone: ""Yes, give him a tablet because his academics are too good."" Hence, a condition was implemented that he is not to install any games on it. The following morning, I found Pokémon Go installed, so the tablet was confiscated. The games that he wants to install seem to employ psychological techniques to produce addiction. These games do not challenge him intellectually and do not require creativity. I've seen him spend hours grinding mindlessly to collect virtual points/rewards, and I know from first hand experience that these types of games have correlated to a flat-line in my own intellectual development.   I'm ashamed to say that I yielded to my emotions in gifting him what he wanted rather than what he needed. He'd done nothing to earn this and has not proven to be capable of using a mobile device responsibly. If not controlled, it will inevitably be detrimental to his development.  I believe that the correct course of action is to ungive this tablet, but that is a can of worms in itself. This will be a lesson for me to remember as this was ultimately my decision and my naive mistake, but right now I'm looking for a solution to this. What should I do?  Update:  I had a discussion with my brother to implement some guidelines, in most part following the example provided by @thisiswhatwedo. The ""no games"" rule has been removed, replaced by the following:   May be used only after all assigned homework/tasks have been completed for the day. May be used for maximum of 1.5 hours in a day, noncumulative. Generally not to be used in public, ultimately at the discretion of adults. Tablet will be stored by an adult when not in use. Must mute speakers or use headphones/earbuds when prompted. Application installation and removal are decided by adults. No food or beverage during use. Hands must be washed prior to use.   We mutually agreed to these rules, and I'm satisfied with this arrangement. "
1728,"At what age should a child stop accompanying a parent into the ""wrong"" public toilet?","When you're a Dad on your own you take your small girls into the Gents with you. Mums take their sons with them to the Ladies.  At what age should we stop doing this?

With shopping centres somewhere in between.  So what are the range of answers, depending on location? "
1729,Finding Great Books at the Right Level,"My daughter began reading at age three.  When we enrolled in Kindergarten, she was tested and it was discovered that she could already read (and comprehend) at a fifth grade level at age five.  She was not tested with Lexile, so I do not have a lexile score, but am aware of their website and its resources.  The trouble is that despite her reading abilities, she still has the attention span of a six-year old (now that she is six) and still wants pictures. We check out tons of books (and I own tons of children's books).  Additionally, Books written for fifth graders have material about which she is not ready on a social level.    It is getting a little crazy pre-reading everything (well, mostly skimming) in order to be sure book content is appropriate and to screen for challenge level.    Do any of you have experience (or short-cuts) for finding books that are challenging but still appropriate for such a child to read?  For many reasons, I am now homeschooling her and she has already finished all of the Literature and Comprehension material for her second grade curriculum for this year.  She has not finished the other second grade Language Arts curriculum, but she still needs to have reading time.    She has lots of books she enjoys reading, but none of those books are actually a reading challenge for her meaning her vocabulary building and sentence structure complexity level are stagnating.  She finishes Magic Treehouse books in just an hour or two, but The Roman Mysteries Series (which she loves) is a little too overwhelming for her to feel good about reading alone.  How do you go about finding and screening books for such a child? "

1731,How can I prevent my 2 year old from covering her face with a blanket when she sleeps?,"For the past couple of months, our two year old has been covering her face (her whole head, actually) with a blanket whenever she sleeps.  At night we usually go in after she has fallen asleep and pull it down to her neck.  During her naps we don't want to disturb her, so when she wakes up from her nap her face is bright red and her hair is wet (with sweat) like she just had a bath.  It's not like she just rests the blanket on her head - she more wraps her head in the blanket.  At first she was using her ""blankie"" which has a satin side - I was really worried that she would suffocate so we told her not to cover her face or we would take her blankie away.  We ended up taking her blankie away but she just started using the blanket/bedspread on her bed.  We can't take that away because we live up north and it will be getting very cold at night.  We tried giving her a very small (maybe 6 inch by 6 inch) thin blanket that she could put on her face but she won't use that.  We have tried giving her one of those quilts that has a lot of holes in it, but she won't use that either.  We have asked her why she does it but she just says ""because"".  We tell her every night before bed not to cover her face, but when we go in to check on her, the blanket is wrapped around her head.  Sometimes when we try to pull it down she wakes up and puts it back on.  Should I be concerned that she is covering her face?  I worry about her suffocating or getting overheated.  It is very hard to reason with a two year old.  We even tried telling her we would take a toy away from her if she covered her face, but when we check on her later, her face is covered.  We can't get her to stop covering her face - the only thing left that I can think of is to take away all of her sheets and blankets on her bed - but that isn't really an option because of the cold weather.  I'm out of ideas so I am hoping someone here can think of something.  Or maybe I'm just over-reacting and I should let her do this?  Thanks in advance! "
1732,"Is there a formal term for a ""I'm not your friend anymore"" trait?","One time, when my wife was doing homework with my 6-year-old son, he did not want to do something so she couldn't take it and she slightly yelled at him. I sat down with him and he told me that ""He's no longer friends with her"". Why do you think he said that? What was his intention? And in Psychology, is there a term for this trait? "
1733,Should we worry about my toddler accidentally banging his head against the sides of the crib?,"Our son is 18 months old and sleeps in a crib. He sleeps well, but he moves around a lot and really ""explores"" the crib's space during the night! This isn't a problem per se, but it often causes him to hit his head on the crib. We can hear a bang! whenever it happens. Sometimes it's so loud that I seriously worry he might be suffering minor concussions... It happens usually two or three times between between his bedtime at around 19:30 and when my wife and I go to bed at around 22:00.   One option we have heard about is what is often called a ""bettnest"" in German and I think maybe ""bumpers"" in English. Here's an example: [website]My Questions   Has anyone experienced this kind of head-bonking phenomenon? If so, what did you do about it, if anything? Or what might you recommend doing to cushion the impact? Do the health warnings applied to crib bumbers like the one linked to above still apply to an 18 month old?  "
1734,How worried should I be about head bumps as my infant learns to get around?,"We have hardwood floors in the house, and have made a little ""play area"" out of foam interlocking ""tiles"" for our 9 MO to play on. Of course, he's not content to restrict his explorations to the designated area (on the contrary - he loves dropping his blocks on the hardwood floor so that they make a more interesting sound!)  Naturally, as he learns to crawl, cruise and get about, there are bound to be spills, falls and other bumps - he seems to be particularly talented at bumping his head when he's sitting and turns around too quickly.  How much of a concern are these bumps to the head (I'm not talking about falling from a height - just falling from a crawl or sitting position)?   Should we be hovering and not letting him fall at all? Is falling a natural and reasonably safe thing that teaches children about cause and effect and hopefully to be less clumsy? Can they seriously injure themselves as the result of a bump to the head on a mat or the floor? "
1735,How can I increase the numeracy of a toddler?,"My 2-year-old is just starting to learn counting. A few weeks ago, if he saw two of an item, e.g. a clock, he would say ""clock clock"". In the last week, he started saying ""two clock"". Although he can name all the numerals 1-9, he cannot (or will not?) exhibit a count of any number of objects more numerous than 2. Still, this is the beginning of numeracy.  I want to develop his numeracy. Sesame Street has counting games, but he's not allowed to watch TV. Does anyone have suggestions for proven games or activities to develop numeracy in young toddlers? "
1736,At what age is it appropriate to bring my children to an (Italian) opera?,I'd like to take my kids to opera. However most opera shows are in original language (mostly Italian). Do you have experience with it?  Are kids following the story without understanding the language? Aren't early readers (age 6) distracted by subtitle banners? Any suggested piece to start with? Anyone tried? 
1737,Raising our daughter to be bilingual without one-parent-one-language,"I've been through a lot of answers here on raising bilingual children, and the general consensus seems to be (1) each parent speaks their language to the child ('one parent - one language') and (2) There is consistency.  What are some strategies for raising a bilingual child?  My husband and I have a fully bilingual relationship. We live in a non-English community and speak 50/50 English and our local language at home. He's fluent in both, I'm fluent in English and advanced in our local language.   We code-switch a lot and speak both languages all the time. Different subjects of conversation are associated with each language (work is English, mundane home affairs are local language) and sometimes we'll simply use whichever language is easier or quicker to get the point across. We'll switch languages mid-sentence and borrow words that are shorter/easier to remember from the other language.  We would really like to continue doing this after our daughter is born. This system works really well for us. However, I am concerned that this goes against the general advice I've read. I'm particularly concerned that our daughter won't know which word belongs to which language, or that she won't be able to tell the languages apart and get them confused, especially since we mix them so often.   I really don't want to have to switch to the one-parent-one-language method because it takes a lot of work and conscious effort to implement and I'd be concerned we'd just default to English out of laziness.   Maintaining a 3-way conversation with her where I speak one language and my husband speaks another is particularly where the difficulty lies, since we'll automatically want to switch to the other person's language (so my husband will hear me speak English and he'll automatically want to switch to English too and it'll take a conscious effort to not do that). I've been in situations where one side is always speaking one language and I have to maintain the opposite language and it is really tough to do.  Is it going to be detrimental to her if she hears both of us speak both languages all the time, with (seemingly) arbitrary distinction between them?  "
1738,How to become closer to a religious parent as a non-religious child,"My mom is a devout Christian, and she holds tightly to her beliefs since that is what kept her hopes up when she suffered a kidney disease. Since I was a child she has always tried to get me more involved in the faith by taking me to religious events and getting me involved into a youth group. However, I have had bad experiences with both. The former case always involved going to prayer events early in the morning or all day/all weekend while I wanted to hang out with my own friends or sleep in and watch anime/do programming. In the latter case I always felt left out of the group since the kids all grew up together while I only joined in high school and they constantly talked about memories they had before I joined (them claiming that the group was ""closer"" in the old days didn't help either). The former case happened when I was 11-16, while the latter happened around 16-18.  Fast forward to college years, and I've moved out on my own (and am still living away from her even after college). Despite her telling me I should call her more often I don't want to talk to her because she references God/Jesus/Christianity in everything she says to me, saying things like   ""I'll pray for you""  ""Having sex is against the Lord""  ""Just keep praying and God will give you what is best for you""  ""God has a reason for [insert bad event here] happening""  ""Did you go to church?""   I would like to be closer to my mother, but at the same time I don't want to hear about religion every time we speak. We have had meaningful conversations before in the past, but whenever she says something religious it makes it less meaningful due to the experiences I've had.  How can my mother and I have meaningful conversations without too much mention of religion? "
1739,How can I work with a math teacher who is having trouble differentiating learning?,"My daughter is very bright, and particularly good at math. But, she gets bored easily — possibly some near ADHD traits, although generally not to the level where it causes any disruption. She's in seventh grade this year, and tells me that math class is the worst part of her day, which is sad and scary. STEM  education research shows that girls often lose interest in math and science at this age, even when they excel at it.  Specifically, my daughter says that she understands the material presented in class immediately, but then the whole class is spent going over it, leaving her, as she describes it, ""bored out of my mind"". And evidence shows that she does get it — she's getting an A in this class and can easily do and discuss the material. (She even teaches it to her younger sister.)  I've spoken with the teacher a number of times over the year so far, and he seems receptive, but... it isn't really helping.  Initially, he said that he would ""shift"" the homework so that she'd be getting a more challenging problem set. (The materials are structured so for each section of the workbook, easier problems come first, and he usually assigns the first few questions as homework.)  After a month or so, though, this never actually happened — my daughter was coming home with the same problems, and still complaining. So, I talked to the teacher again. This time, he said ""Oh, well, she's not doing any of the challenge problems, and that's how I really know if a student is advanced.""  Challenge problems? Turns out that these are written on the board in the back of the class every week. They tend to be more like math puzzles than something which follows the curriculum (for example, one was the Knights of the Round Table Marriage Problem). Students may work on these if they're finished with in-class work — but there's no space to discuss them.  My daughter says ""I'm not a mind-reader! How can I figure out how to do these things if we don't talk about them in class?"" And, that point does seem to have some fairness. I encouraged her to try them anyway to help show the teacher that she can, and she has some, but... I'm sympathetic to her argument that doing brain-teasers doesn't do much to address the thing she's having a problem with.  What she really wants is for the regular curriculum to move at her pace. I know that's really hard when you've got a class of 20, but there's got to be something. Last week, I went back to the teacher again and we talked about the issue with the challenge problems, and I reminded him again that he hadn't actually done the ""homework shifting"" he'd first promised. So, the new thing is that he sends home a notecard with some extra, more advanced problems.  They're currently doing the very beginnings of algebra; the normal homework has them graphing equations like x = 3y and x = 5y - 5. The first notecard had problems 3x + 8y = 24. My daughter said ""Dad, I don't know how to do this."" I showed her how to isolate the x variable, and I could see a little nuclear lightbulb go off in her head.  The next day had y = x² and similar, and again, bam — ""Dad! This isn't linear!"" And last night, she was given some equations and told to find the ""x and y intercept"" — and to look up what that meant. I showed her on the graphs she'd drawn earlier (""Look, when x is zero, you intercept the y axis..."") and again, she didn't need to be told twice.  So.... this is at least offering some challenge, but:   She's still bored in class, She says ""So, when we do get to this stuff, now I'm going to be even more bored! I'd rather just wait to learn it so I at least have something to think about."" If I'm doing all the teaching, what is she going to class for?    And thank goodness I can still dredge up memories of all this stuff — if I couldn't, I'm not sure she'd really do well being completely self-directed via Khan Academy. I mean, we could get a private tutor or something, but that's still extra work, not better work.  I'm kind of out of ideas. Do you have any helpful suggestions I could bring to the teacher? I could talk to the principal, but without some concrete idea for what I want, that just seems like getting the teacher in trouble, which isn't my goal. "
1740,Difficulty pronouncing R and L: how fast is it overcome?,"This question concerns difficulty pronouncing the sounds R and L between the ages of 4 and 6 years old.  Assuming that there's no serious problem (that is, all other sounds are correctly pronounced and speech is mostly intelligible) and that the child will learn to pronounce those letters correctly on their own, how fast is the process of overcoming it?   I don't mean the whole practice and exercises that I've seen advised everywhere, though. I mean, once the child starts pronouncing the difficult letters, is the evolution overnight or does it take several weeks, with some words correctly pronounced and others not so much. Are there moments of backtracking, when they go back to not pronouncing words correctly, or is it more like 'learn the trick and rarely make the mistake again'?  By the way, I'm not from the US and where I live it's considered normal for children up to 6 years old (or older, if their teeth have gaps) to have difficulty pronouncing some letters. Very rarely have I seen or heard of children asked to repeat the word correctly or coached about how to pronounce correctly those difficult sounds, only after they start school. Only if a lot of sounds are not correctly pronounced, making speech unintelligible, will one go to a doctor about it. "
1741,Hand me downs: what to do when it's not the receiving child who is resentful,"Our family has three boys and now a baby girl. My oldest is in his teens and was so gentle on his clothes that I have had a steady supply of well cared for and almost brand new hand me downs available for the next two boys (and a select few for my girl). Fewer things survive my second boy, but what does gets saved for his younger brother. I have the clothes organized in a closet by season and size and I let the boys ""shop"" in the closet at the beginning of each season before we hit the stores. This has been going on without any issues for years.   Lately, my 5 year old has been catching up in size to my 7 year old, so that right now, they are almost the same size. One is 7-8 and the other 6-7. Ususlly the clothes are ""out of circulation"" for two years but it's been barely a season lately, and this winter they are overlapping. My 7 year old has always been very possessive and kind of jealous, and now he's refusing to ""allow"" my 5 year old to wear ""his"" clothes. It's true that some of the stuff was his not too long ago (a month is as long as I could let them sit in the closet before my 5 year old needed to ""shop"".) The 7 year old goes into the 5 y.o. drawer to ""takes back"" what's ""his"" or attempts to rip the clothes off of his brother if he sees my 5 year old wearing them. He calls my 5 year old a copy cat, a thief, a scrub (for wearing someone else's clothes), and other nasty names. Poor little guys, each in their own hell. One getting tortured simply for getting dressed and the other by his emotions.  This is very distressing for everyone. Our mornings have become total chaos.  Here are some things we've tried:  My oldest son has tried to reason with my 7 year old, and remind him that the clothes were his and he's never once gotten mad at the 7 year old for wearing them. He also pointed out that the baby wears onsies, sweatpants, and mittens that were my 7 year olds and he doesn't get mad at her.  My 7 year old's response is ""well, they aren't your clothes anymore because they are mine, so you would be an idiot for being mad at me for wearing things that are mine."" He then rejects his own ""logic"" when we apply it to his brother who is wearing his clothes that are his. My 7 year old says ""no, they are mine forever once they are mine.""  We tried doing a ""swap"" in the closet. He had to ""buy"" the clothes out of the closet with his old clothes. He was fine with this. He happily swapped out a pair of size 7 jeans for an identical pair of size 8's. We then waited a few weeks before we brought our 5 year old to shop. Our 7 year old immediately spots ""new"" clothes on his brother and will tackle him and inspect the tag for the size.   We've tried buying the 7 year old clothes instead of going shopping in the closet, and skipping him altogether with the hand me downs. He still gets mad at my 5 year old, claiming that he should have first dibs and they are STILL his even though he never laid eyes on the items since my oldest last wore them years before.   We've bought new clothes for our 5 year old, and our 7 year old screams and cries that we make him wear my oldest son's rags while the 5 year old gets new stuff...when we mention that he has several brand new pairs of Hanna Andersson sweats (not cheap!) that he picked out for himself he says ""yeah but you'll take them and give them to him! You only wanted them for him!!""  We're worn out by this. Our 5 year old, who has mastered the morning routine and has been getting himself up, dressed, and fed every morning without much intervention now won't get dressed, and is moody and snippy in the morning. He won't put his clothes away because he insists it's a waste of time Bc his brother will just rip them out during one of his ""raids."" Our 7 year old has also started going thru our daughter's books and blankets to weed out what's ""his."" At this point he doesn't get mad at her, but comes to me all teary eyed that I've given away his baby things like he ""doesn't even exist.""  Then he gets mad at me.  He goes thru the trash to see if I've thrown away his school work, and inspects the contents of boxes that go out to make sure I've not donated any of his things. He's like a little hoarder in the making! (No, we've never suffered a loss like a fire or flood, been poor or displaced, and we've never forcefully down sized his belongings for any reason. We also don't give into tantrums, but he hasn't given them up yet nonetheless.)  I suspect he's got a larger issue (we're already in therapy for his anger/temper/tantrums) but for now, if anyone has any tips on what to do about the hand me downs I'd appreciate it. I saw the other question here that deals with resentment of a younger child, so, how about we cover the topic from the opposite perspective?  How can I make this easier on my 5 year old, who just wants to get clothes on so he can go to school? I've already spoken to our therapist about this and she was stumped! She says most kids are happy to see their stuff go, or, couldn't care less.   Please don't say stop using hand me downs because with 4 kids, it's not economically feasible to purchase new clothes for all of them every season.   "
1742,My 2.5yr old daughter does not answer to us,"Anyone ever experienced similar situation? My 2.5yr old daughter always trying to ignore my words, by not listening and not answering.   For example, when there's conflict I try to blame her on some bad behaviour, she would run away, or not look at me at all. However even when there's no conflict, even like when my mum's asking her what did she eat for lunch, if she's not in the mood (which seems everyday she's not in the mood), she will not listen or answer at all.   I've kept talking with her for months that it is basic courtesy to look at the counterpart, and answer, when people talk to her. Not working. It happens to everyone: parents, other relatives in family, teachers in kindergarten, etc....  We don't think she has hearing problem: when she's in a good mood or she has some demand for us, she's talkative and our communication flows well.   What can I do in such situation please? Thanks! "

1744,How can I teach my 9-month-old son to attempt to say his first words?,"Sometimes when I try to teach my 9-month-old son words like ""daddy"" or ""mummy"", he stares blankly or gets distracted (which I guess is quite normal for that age).  He coos (is this even a word?) and makes baby-like noises - blabbering, kisses, aahs, oohs, and so on.   Does anyone have any advice on how to get my 9-month-old son to attempt to say his first words like ""daddy"" or ""da da""?  I've been repeating words like ""daddy"" and ""mummy"" in an attempt to get him used to the sounds and syllables.  Are there better times to teach babies their first words?

1749,Should I stop the visits of my infant's in-and-out father?,"My son is nine months old and his father has seen him 10 times and recently has been cancelling his visits. We do not have custody in place but there is child support.  I'm not sure if I should just cut him off or let him keep making plans and cancelling. My son is also afraid of him - he cries and it takes an hour for him to get used to him each time he visits, but he only stays for 2 hours.   I have offered him to stay at my house 1 night a week. This weekend was supposed to be the first time and he cancelled.   We have no relationship. I did want to be with him, but he’s not a stable person he works at McDonald's. Has no education, dropped out of school in 10th grade, he was doing his GED then stopped. Lives with his mom and uncle in a 2 bedroom apartment and sleeps in the same room as his mom when she’s not in rehab for her drug alcohol, seizures problems. He doesn’t have a license or permit, he’s almost 23, he says he doesn’t smoke weed anymore, but if you don’t then why do you have no money left out of your paychecks? I know how much he makes due to court ordered child support and I know how much he has left.  I just looked at my dates that he has come to see him because I write them down. It’s only been 7 times and he has off work Tuesday’s and Wednesday’s off from work and now every Saturday and his excuses that he can’t come are ""oh my mom had seizures"", meanwhile his mom is in rehab 2 hours away, I got called into work I call each time and they say he’s off today visiting his son, I don’t have money to come out there. He pays no bills besides his phone bill which I know is only $50 because I used to pay it when we were together, so how don’t you have money to come out here he lives 20 min away.   He says he would be here every day if I would let him and I told him he could, but he always comes up with excuses on why he can’t come. I have tried everything but he shows no interest in him, he never texts or calls about him even when he’s asking me when he can come. He knows nothing about him. I don’t feel the need to tell him if he never asks. I recently had to take our son the the Hospital with a very high fever, he didn’t text back until the next day and all he said was “OK👌”  Should I stop his visits? "
1750,"How do we teach our 1-year-old that ""no"" isn't a game?","We have an almost 13-month-old daughter.

Or is this just part of being a 1-year-old? "
1751,10 year old refuses to go to bed,"Our 10 year old stepdaughter has trouble going to bed at night. She refuses to go to bed, and fights us very hard, to the point where our only hope of her going to bed is to physically pick her up and put her in her bed. Then, we have to keep picking her up and putting her back into bed, up to a couple of dozen times.  Her attitude and behaviour are fine until we ask her to go to bed... it's like a switch.  The routine goes a little like this:  We say godnight and ask her to go to bed. The first one or two requests are usually ignored. When we stop requesting and start telling, she responds with ""No"", ""make me"" etc.  This is usually followed by delaying tactics or inventing reasons to come back downstairs. We reach a point where the only response she will receive is the word ""Bed"", followed by physically putting her there if necessary.  It can go on like this until after midnight, and she will vehemently complain, insult, argue, scream, shout, hit things, slam doors, say hurtful things, throw stuff, and has at one point struck one of us.  We have recently suffered through 3 weeks of this with only a single night off (which was rewarded). We have been consistent with not budging on bedtime while allowing other things that aren't as important, so the frequency started to lessen. However it crops back up and is a real pain on a weeknight - and I don't want to give over any random weeknight to keeping one of the kids in bed.  Is there a better way to deal with this other than our current method of asking nicely up to 3 times, then telling, then physically putting her in bed?  We do think that she just wants more attention and are doing our best to give her as much as possible. Assuming we can find &amp; help with the root cause, how do we deal with the symptoms without losing our sleep-deprived minds? "
1752,Why does my infant wake crying the instant we put him in his bed?,"This is probably a classic but here goes. Some time between midnight and three my 9 month old will wake crying. Often he is hungry or has gas and can be fairly easily consoled and falls asleep in our arms once his needs have been met.  However, on many occasions, no matter how long we wait or how deeply he appears to be asleep, the instant he ""touches down"" on his bed (or sometimes a few milliseconds before), he will arch his back and begin to cry. After that there is nothing to do but to pick him up again and he will frequently fall right back asleep in our arms.   What's up with that? Is it time we take the shards of glass out of his mattress? (just kidding - I'm tired and feeling a little punchy).   When he first falls asleep for the night the Devil's orchestra couldn't wake the little sack of potatoes, but once he transitions to REM stage we go through this circus act. Not every night - some nights he will sleep straight through from 8:30 till 6:30. But on the ""bad nights"" we might be up for a couple hours doing the ""putting himdown"" song and dance.   I guess I want to get some opinions on ""how the heck does he wake up instantly the moment he touches his bed?"" and ""why?"" before moving on to what could be done.   Update  I'm answering my own question 4 years after the fact because I had the recent opportunity to think back on this and wanted to capture those thoughts.  Eventually things worked out. It was many months, but sleep habits formed and everyone ended up getting their much-needed rest. In the meantime, here's what worked:  Reduce the % change in environment.  Basically, I tried to make sure that there was as little change at once, with pauses in-between. This translated to a fairly drawn out process, but anything was better than being up all night. In order to reduce the % change, I had to add a bunch of stuff that could be kept constant. Noise, lighting, temperature, etc. because of course physical contact and orientation were going to change as soon as I put him in the bed.   Noise: create a white noise environment that will not change when you put the child down - be aware that the sides of a crib can alter the frequencies that hit the ear, so be mindful of your sound source and how it sounds above the bed (where you'll be rocking the child) and inside the bed. Humming: add your own noise (humming or singing) to the mix. This is a good one because it maintains your presence, and (more importantly) can be tapered off gradually (sing quieter and quieter) Light: be mindful of how any ambient light can be occluded by the sides of the crib - and possibly register on the child's eyelids. And don't forget your own shadow. Orientation: you need to gradually move the baby into the exact orientation (in your arms) that the child will be on the bed. So figure out how you need to hold the child when being laid on the bed and maneuver him/her into position in your arms. Cribs with deep sides are killer because you have to really bend over and that can mess up your back. Don't let the child roll when you lay them down! Be prepared to stay leaning over the crib with the child still in your arms, but touching the bed for agonizing periods before you remove your hands / arms, which changes body heat Body Heat: blankets and swaddling are key here as they insulate the child from y our own body heat and there's less of a temperature drop when you extract yourself. Don't leave yet! If by some miracle you've extracted your hands, stay where you are! Keep everything else constant - your humming, the white noise, the light, and your presence. Ninja-like exit. Practice your exit - two steps max if you have creaky floors. I had it down to two steps, a pivot and close the door in under 2 seconds. When you're ready to go for broke and you've followed all the other steps slowly, get out of there in a (soundless) flash. Repeat, repeat, repeat. Ritual is the key. The more you do everything exactly the same, the more smooth the process will be. Stay calm. Agitation is the worst. You know those nights you REALLY just need the baby to settle down because you have to get some work done, or go out, or just get to sleep? That's the night it will take THE LONGEST! So just be calm. I got to a point where my inner monologue was ""hey, enjoy it. You get to be with your baby just the two of you. These are precious moments. Besides, what else am I going to do with my time? This is what I was made for..."" I'm not sure I bought my own propaganda all the time, but, 4 years later I can still look back at all that with fondness so I can only conclude that A) it WAS actually precious and special and rare and B) you forget the bad stuff and remember the good - as do your kids - and that's why the human race has not died out.

1753,Can I put my infant to sleep downstairs and then move him in the crib?,"When bedtime is getting near, at about 7pm, for our 6 week old baby, can we keep him downstairs with us (with conversation and regular lighting), swaddled and rocking until he goes into a deep sleep, and then put him in bed?  Or do we need to take him upstairs to the darkened room by his crib, with low lights and maybe some white noise, and put him to sleep there... even if it could take an hour or two? "
1754,Value of pacifier as a young infant's sleep aid?,"There seems to be no consensus among baby-sleep experts on the value of the pacifier; some sources consider it a good sleep association (akin to swaddling and white noise), others see it as a hassle for parents who must constantly reinsert it, not to mention eventually wean their strongly-attached toddlers from it. It's been valuable for us but I'm beginning to wonder if it's worth discontinuing much earlier than toddlerhood.  My situation: my three-month-old is generally a good and independent sleeper -- we've been practicing ""drowsy but awake"" since he was quite young in hopes that it'd create smooth and generous naps, like it did for our older son -- except that he has a very strong association to the pacifier. He doesn't use it much during the day (only to hold him off while milk is warming, or if overstimulated in a public place) but since the newborn days, he's relied on it to fall asleep on his own for naps or bedtime. (Typically I'll put him down in the crib, pacifier inserted, and soothingly rub his back or hold his hand; this calms him enough that he can settle on his own, most of the time, although I confess to rocking him to sleep on fussier days.)  At three months, I'd expect him to begin consolidating daytime sleep into fewer and longer naps, and he seems to want to. But despite an otherwise excellent foundation for independent sleep, he has difficulty extending his naps beyond one sleep cycle (~40 minutes) because invariably the pacifier has fallen out of his mouth; he certainly doesn't have the hand-eye coordination or self-awareness yet to reinsert the pacifier himself, and won't for some time. I've found myself reentering his room to soothe him and re-insert the pacifier, in order to get any decently long and restful nap out of him (and if I do this, he can nap for two or more hours at a time). This practice seems unsustainable, especially when it means leaving my energetic toddler alone downstairs while I deal with the pacifier every 40 minutes.  Given that we're just now working on establishing a better nap schedule anyway, am I crazy for trying to wean the baby off the pacifier at the same time? I feel like the short-term pain might be worth the long-term gain -- and that doing so at three months, before object permanence sets in, might be the best opportunity. But I also fear that breaking his best sleep association at such a young age could make napping more tenuous and difficult overall, which would be counterproductive -- and I fear that half-measures (trying to settle without the pacifier, growing frustrated/enraged, then finally giving up and reinserting it) would lead us to both negative consequences.   Has anyone had this experience with pacifiers before? Is there any evidence of benefits of the use of pacifiers into toddlerhood? "
1755,How best to take advantage of a child's extended vacation,"This is a little more complicated than it might seem, so I'll give some back-story.    We have 2 kids:   The oldest, 11, was born to us during my first year of college, and I was only intermittently in the picture due to distance, and relationship instability at that point.  He is diagnosed with moderate autism, but is extremely high functioning and has a high IQ.  He is fairly creative and has a very good ability to think abstractly. He has a fair number of great qualities, but the negative behavior so dominates daily life that it really overshadows many of the good times daily.  He also has significant social-behavior problems, and very poor impulse control, and frequently gets in trouble. We have a fairly high-stress and contentious relationship with this one.  He will not complete any chores without significant involvement by one or both parents; he (quite viciously sometimes) argues just about everything that requires him to do anything other than what he is doing at the moment.  This is emotionally taxing and makes it difficult to connect and maintain a connection him. The youngest, 3, was born to us after we reconciled, had moved in together for about a year or two, and had a stable relationship.  He was a relatively early talker, is highly verbal and intelligent.  He has his own issues that are hard to deal with, but he has not yet hit the pre-teen argumentative/defiant stage-or anything resembling it.     Currently, the 11-year-old is traveling out-of-state to visit family.  My question is, other than taking time to more closely bond with the 3-year-old, and taking time to ""recharge"", what can actively be done in anticipation of our 11-year-old's return to prepare and, quite honestly, regroup, for a stronger/smarter/more understanding approach?  What I might also be asking, is ""what are some good, fresh approaches to use with an argumentative, effort-avoiding, back-talking, smart ass whom I was not fully prepared to (positively) interact with as a parent in the first place""? "
1756,Why has my infant suddenly changed her sleep patterns? Is she teething?,"My daughter normally goes down for the night around 7.30pm. After that she sleeps soundly (with a feed at 10pm) until 3-4am, where she'll grizzle a few times but go back to sleep without needing to be taken out of the cot. Then she'll wake up fully between 6am and 7am.  A few nights ago this changed. She will still go to sleep relatively easily, but will wake up every few hours, including before her 10pm feed, crying like a wounded polar bear. Our usual soothing techniques don't seem to work, and sometimes she cries herself fully awake.   Around 4am we snap and take her into our bed to see if that soothes her more, but last night she just lay in bed babbling and playing. It took 90 minutes to get her back to sleep and she still woke up around 6.30am.   What could cause this behaviour? I'd suspect teething but then why was she so seemingly happy when she woke up at 4am? Shouldn't she be either tired or still crying from the teething? Why does she behave like this at night but be relatively happy during the day? What can we do to help her sleep more?  Update:  She's now 9mo, and this behaviour has recently got a lot worse. We started using controlled crying to great success, and she now goes down to sleep at 7.30pm with great ease. However the middle-of-the-night crying is still occuring, except now with more force than ever. She screams extremely loudly and violently, but I'm pretty sure she's not in pain. She has been doing this for almost two weeks and still doesn't have any teeth, so it's probably not teething, and she still does the tell-tale pause in crying that signals she's just looking for our attention.  Comforting her in the cot does not work, she doesn't stop crying and she rejects her dummy. Picking her up does stop her crying. Taking her into our bed stops her crying, but she doesn't go to sleep, instead play-fighting or crawling around the bed, which keeps us awake as much as the screaming.  We have been trying to do controlled crying in the same manner as we did for her bedtime, but it's harder because we can't stop her crying while leaving her in the cot. The longest we've left it is two hours of solid crying, but then our tiredness and guilt about the neighbours makes us give in.  Any more help/support appreciated. "
1757,"How to help a 6-year-old who has difficulties with ""what comes before / after"" questions (in sequences)?","My son will be 6 at the end of next month. He is generally doing good with regards to his development. He has started reading and loves math.  But there is a problem I have consistently noticed. Although he knows sequences like letters, days of the week, planets etc., if he is asked a question like ""What day comes after Wednesday"" or ""What's before G"", he has to say the whole sequence from the beginning to figure it out.   Is this common for his age? What can I do besides giving him more practice? "
1758,Is this excess phlegm and throat clearing a sign of lactose intolerance?,"My daughter, aged nigh on 8, really gets 'phlegmy' after any dairy, clearing her throat continuously and complains, after a while, that her throat gets sore.  I have done some research, but from what I can see, being lactose intolerant usually leads to to rashes etc.  Has anyone heard of this?  I sometimes experience this too but I think it could be mainly dehydration based (I never drink enough water).  She does drink lots of water, so I cannot really link it to that.  Any ideas? "
1759,How to raise a child between agnostic parent and believer relatives?," Few months back I turned agnostic.    Don't have children yet.   Other family members are believers, I am not.     My mother tells me to pray to God and ask him to increase my salary/happiness/safety etc. I can deal with my mother.  My in-laws ask me to pray to the God before embarking on a journey. I do as they wish (to make them happy (not a big deal for me)).  Now, when my relatives tell my future child to pray to God for the above mentioned reasons, how should I explain to him(child) that this God didn't protect the gas chamber victims so there is no reason that you should expect him to help you to get good grades in exams, etc?  I think the child will ask - then why is the grand mother praying to God? I don't have an answer to this.  My brother and his wife have taught their child (2 years old) that if you do bad things God will punish you. I want my child to not to do bad things because the bad things are bad, not because God is going to punish.  I want that when he grows up (about 15 years of age) then he should decide for himself whether he wants to follow religion or not    till then he should have a free mind. He should be dependent on himself for his acts, not on God.    I don't even know what to do with the ""fairy tales"" thing. Every comic book for children has these fairies, and witches.  I don't know if it is wise to first explain to a child that the fairy did that, and then if he asks is it all true?? What to reply - yes, it is, but god is different than fairy? OR no, this story is to make you go to sleep!   "

1761,Kid having trouble with some seemingly easy questions (language and visual cognition) for his age,"My son will be 6 end of next month. He is generally doing good with regards to his development. He has started reading and loves math.  There are a couple of things I've noticed he has difficulty with-   I asked him for 3 words that rhyme with the word ""car"" (and many more similar questions, like rhyming words for ""frog"" etc.) . He takes a very long time to come up with appropriate words and sometimes gives up.. Given his clear and fluent speech and his developing reading skills + his reasonable vocabulary, I would've thought this was very easy for him. Is this normal for a kid his age? I asked him ""What letter looks like the number 5"" expecting ""S"" and he had to hard time answering this. I made it simpler and simpler like ""0"" and ""1"" expecting ""O"" and ""I/l"" etc. but it took a lot of effort to get him to understand the concept. And he finally answered ""6"" with ""b"". Are kids this age expected to make such visual associations?   Thank you very much! "
1762,How do you handle a toddler that refuses to say 'sorry'?,"My two-year-old son is generally exceptionally well-behaved and polite.  He was saying ""please"" and ""thank you"" at a very early age, and would apologize if he had problems sharing or accidentally hurt someone.  However, now at 26 months, he has started to really push our boundaries.  Most recently, he refuses to say ""sorry"" when he hurts someone.  On one occasion, he was playing too rough with me, and pinched my neck pretty hard.  I said ""ow, that hurt.  You've got to be careful.  Can you say you're sorry?"".    On another, he was bouncing on the bed when he landed hard on my wife, and hurt her.  She also asked for an apology.  Both times he said ""no!"", laughed, cried, covered his eyes, ran away, and generally avoided apologizing.  We kept insisting that he apologize, and I tried explaining to him that sometimes you can hurt someone by accident, but that apologizing showed that you didn't mean to hurt them.  He asked ""why?"".  I tried simplifying it, saying that ""good boys say sorry so they don't hurt other people's feelings"".  He then said he wanted to be a bad boy.  I said ""people don't like to be around bad boys"".  He said ""why?"".  I said ""because they hurt people and don't say sorry.  People don't like to get hurt.""  However, he responded by saying that he liked to get hurt.  At this point, I can't tell how much of this is him just testing boundaries, and how much is him simply not understanding the concepts.  In the past, taking away the toys he was playing with was usually enough to get him to apologize, but that no longer works.  Last night he was put to bed about 30 minutes early, with no bedtime stories, because ""bad boys don't get stories read"".  However, we still got no apology.  What is the best strategy for getting him to apologize for when he does something that hurts someone?   "
1763,How to deal with my parents frequently getting mad at my life choices?,"I’m 26 and I find both of my parents get mad at me for very bad reasons. For example, I was visiting my mom. In a mad tone she told me to stop playing a game on my phone. Just realizing it now, I find this hypocritical as when I come to visit she usually leaves the TV on and watches it so it’s not as if we’re giving each other undivided attention. I find this particularly offensive as I got a job and worked hard to make money to buy my phone, both of my parents seem averse to technology and my mom never owned a cellphone.  I wouldn’t say my parents regret their life decisions, but I would say they aren’t happy with their life. They both live alone and don’t like their jobs. I sometimes wonder if they take this out on me.  I also find my parents get mad at me for work/career related decisions. I’ve always had a full time job when I wasn’t in school full time since I was 16. Right now they’re mad at me because my job doesn’t use my degree and doesn’t advance my career (I took it as it’s temporary and pays very well and I need money right now).   I told my mom that she’s not allowed to talk about my work, phone, money or living accommodations because it always leads to an argument. Was this the right thing to do or any other suggestions?  Also things like if my parents found out I have been napping they start criticizing me for being unhealthy or lazy.  I find that both my parents are very nosy and if I try to steer the conversation away from a topic that would be unpleasant to discuss, they go towards it. Also both my parents need to get the last word in an argument, they won’t drop a subject until you drop it. This behavior makes me want to hide information from them.  When I say my parents get mad at something I do, it’s usually expressed through their tone of voice. I’m curious, is getting mad at someone ever an appropriate? It’s ok to express your opinions and desires and to tell a person not to do something, though “getting mad” basically means trying to use aggression to control another person.   By the way I’ve seen a psychologist for a completely separate issue and found it did more damage than help so please don’t suggest seeing a psychologist or councilor.  "

1765,When should a child begin to learn knife skills for use in the Kitchen?,"Helping in the kitchen is something my child thoroughly enjoys.  Now that she is in elementary she has a handle on most of the ""safe"" kitchen skills from kneading dough to reading a recipe and even measuring out ingredients after doubling or halving a recipe (with a little checking and help with the math at times).  With the holiday season fast approaching, I know we will be spending a lot of time in the kitchen.  She is still scared to go anywhere near the heat and doesn't want to help with flipping things or removing things from the oven yet (not that I'm complaining) but she has begun to ask about helping with chopping, slicing and dicing.    Should I just tell her no, you need to wait another year or two?  If so, what signs of maturity does she need to demonstrate to show me she is ready to use the knives?  Of course I've let her use a butter knife for things like slicing dough or bananas but does anyone have suggestions for teaching SAFE knife use and skills.  Once I decide she is ready;  Where do we start?  Are there tools out there designed to help teach this skill?  What skill is easiest/safest to start with and what are some good resources for making sure I'm really covering all that I should in terms of her safe use of the knife?   "

1767,Daughters friend invading,"My daughter is in 7th grade. We left a private school for homeschooling for 2 years. This year I put her back in public. She started this new adventure with an old friend. They were very close from 1st grade to 4th when they fell out a little. During homeschooling they got close again. There had been alot of drama while we were gone and everyone was blaming this girl, but I didn't believe it.  My daughter has been a specific type of dancer since Kindergarten (Irish Step Dance) it's unique and very special to her. She works incredibly hard at it and has alot of pride about it.  3 months ago the friend started taking classes, initially saying it was to improve her footwork for tennis. Well now she is always talking about it, telling people they dance together, having her Mom buy all the stuff (that my daughter had to earn through years of hard work) and just overall invading into a world that was special and personal for my daughter.  It may seem petty but it's really bothering her. It bothers me too in that it feels like an invasion. There's really nothing I can do about it but I'm struggling with what to tell my daughter.  I will add, there's alot of other nonsense too. Trying to drag her into boy and online drama etc. In a few short months I've realized I was wrong about her and now we feel stuck.  Thoughts?  Thanks for all the input. I was definitely not very descriptive in my post, because it's hard to explain really. There's a lot to it and she doesn't enjoy the friendship anymore because she's not much for drama, social media etc... The friend has lots of other friends and activities. I don't necessarily have a problem with her taking up dance, but my daughter is FEELING invaded. It's genuinely upsetting her. She treats her like the ""sidekick"" and is very dominating in the friendship. I think my daughter is feeling this entering into the world that was her own special place. Make sense? She FEELS that the girl only wants it because she doesn't want my daughter to have something special that's only hers. I can't change any of this for her, but I guess I'm struggling with telling her to stop complaining and be happy about it, or telling her that her feelings are valid.  I've encouraged her to expand on the new friendships she's developed and to just try to ignore it. The good news is this overall new adventure into middle school has been pretty good so far. That's why this is a bit puzzling how much this is upsetting her 😕 but I get it at the same time. "
1768,"Research on postpartum depression, child behavior and effective treatment?","My daughter experienced severe postpartum depression after her first birth. She took part in a PPD program and with treatment, she improved.   Her son, now 9, has a history is extremely aggressive and destructive tantrums that have continued throughout his life. His father, possibly to make up for lack of maternal connection when he was an infant, and partly due to his personality, has provided few limits and buys lots of toys even though their debt is astronomical.   This 9 year-old's behavior has been excused at every stage. My daughter, a social worker, says he's got anxiety, and I believe her as I see signs of childhood anxiety, but I worry about his lack of self-control and aggression toward his little sister, now 5, who has been hearing his tantrums and subject to his verbal abuse and depersonalization since she was born.    I worry about how close he is to pre-adolescence and wonder if his behavior might be linked  to his mother's initial rejection of him though she breastfed him and took care of all his needs, but still was depressed and had a rough time.   Is there research about links to PPD and outcomes for children in terms of behavior as they grow?   How about effective treatment options?   As an advanced social worker, my daughter thinks she has all the answers but seems to miss what's happening in her own home. I've not ever meddled or given advice, but I have background in areas that ground me in knowledge also. I've been supportive, have assisted in caring for my grandchildren whenever asked and have respected the practices of their parents, etc.   Still, I feel very worried about perils facing my grandson in terms of his long-term well-being and ability to be in close relationships as he gets older. I'll add that he is an exceptionally intelligent and interesting child and we've enjoyed caring for him greatly, tantrums aside. "
1769,When do babies start understanding a kiss?,"Sometimes my two weeks old daughter starts crying and crying. Apart from checking her basic needs (food, poo, pee...), I sometimes hold her and kiss on the cheek together with a soft hug. However, I have the feeling that such action does not have any effect on her (I even imagine her thinking thanks for the kiss, but where is my food!?).  Is there any specific moment in the life of a baby when they start understanding the ""meaning"" of a kiss in the sense of a caress? Is it an instintive action or something they learn from the context?  I tried looking for some references but could not find any. "
1770,How can an older brother fill the parenting void of an absent father?,"I'm not a parent. My father has recently left and a big void of fatherly like stuff has been left. I am that older son who moved back in and is attempting to help out the family. So naturally, the mini-father part of me is kicking in.   My sisters, however, are starting to lose maturity. One is in the state of constant anger and one false move means argument and confrontation. The other is now throwing tantrums and adding to the drama in the house; one is young and the other older.  So in my attempt to help, I try to get the angry sister to think about her words before she says them or to understand that she is not the only one with anger or hostility. However she argues (quite loudly) that she's not angry and that the only problem is me.   While I can't discount that, I find it very unlikely that I can fix the said problem in me, if I can't identify it well.  While I remind the drama sister, that she needs to be mature and that attempting to manipulate someone's emotions for your benefit will only turn them away.  So, in essence: What can I do? I fear I don't have many options. I'd imagine that my mother would need to step up but this experience has been emotionally crippling thus far. Any advice here? "
1771,Are signs of early puberty in a primary-school aged child a cause for concern?,"My son is less than 6 years old, and last week we discovered that he has grown a little bit of pubic hair.

1772,Balance between sharing and being taken advantage of,"tl;dr? see bold items...  We take my kid to a library reading every week and afterwards all the kids play with toys.  He doesn't get a lot of social interaction with kids his age and can be a little shy.  My son is 1.5 years old and there is another kid who is about 3 (and resembles a fat Justin Guarini).  My son has one toy he really likes to play with there which is a pickup truck.  He almost always gets it right away, but then the 3 yr old comes over and rips it from his hands.  The mom of the 3 year old sees this usually, but says nothing.  My wife used to tell our son ""it's ok you should share"" but I don't feel like this is a good response.    My concerns with this approach are:    He shouldn't share with a bully He got the toy first and has had it for MAYBE 30 seconds so he has the right to play with it for a little bit before giving it up This is encouraging him to not stand up for himself and possibly to be pushed around his whole life   She doesn't say this anymore, btw.  Today the 3 year old got the truck first, and after about 15 minutes, he set it down to play with another toy (but kinda within his reach still).  My son walked up and grabbed it and ran to my wife with a big smile on his face.  Note, he didn't take it out of the other childs hands at all, and the other kid was seemingly done with it.  The other kid came up ripped it away again and set it back down to play with the other toy.  My wife finally got upset and said something to the kid and the 3 year old's mom came up to her and said ""well your son did steal it from my son"".  The 3 year old's mom is now setting a precedence that   It's the 3 year old's toy (by saying it was his and my kid stole it), but it's  the libraries not his (see below) She obviously doesn't care to encourage good social behavior with her kid She has some social issues of her own   Funny thing was the kid started crying when they left because he had to leave the truck.  He obviously has this mindset that the truck is his, and I'm sure the mom is part of the problem there.  I couldn't help but to laugh a little ... just loud enough for the other mom to hear.  Note, my son has taken these encounters like a champ. Never shed a tear, I'm super proud of him for that. But I also don't want him thinking this is ok.  My questions are:  Does anyone have advice for dealing with a bully who doesn't share toys (even when he's done playing with them), who will rip toys from my sons arms,  and who has a parent that seemingly encourage these anti-social (and downright mean) behaviors?  Are my concerns above correct/valid? "
1773,Research into dealing with kids biting,"I'm a grandad wondering. I'm watching my kids and their contemporaries deal with various parenting issues that my wife and I encountered ourselves. As they're living some way away I don't often get involved day-to-day, just see some discussions on social media.  Recently the question of dealing with biting came up. Various opinions were expressed, pretty much in line with questions and answers I've seen on this site. The contrasting opinions being ""teach them it hurts, bite them!"" and ""how can you expect a child to learn not to bite by biting them?!""   I saw one statement to the effect: extensive research has proven that biting may stop the initial biting behaviour but in the longer term other violent or aggressive behaviours will manifest.  Now as I have a somewhat academic mindset that piqued my interest. I'm somewhat sceptical that such research results exist - it sounds quite a difficult thing to study - but if we have facts I surely want to base my actions on them.  So I began googling to see whether I could find that research, or indeed any other solid basis for choosing a disciplining strategy relating to biting. Then I realised that most serious academic work is hiding behind paywalls. Hence the question:  Do we have empirical data about effectiveness of strategies for dealing with biting? Do we have longitudinal studies that might reveal whether apparently effective approaches might have longer term less desirable effects?  Please note: I'm not here asking for opinions about what we should do, or accounts of what worked for you, or even the policies of schools or other organisations. I'm interested in the empirical basis for making such decisions. "
1774,How to best handle a mother who does not enjoy staying with her kids,"The bonding between mother and child can be compromised early on, for instance by post-partum depression. More rarely, a mother can have difficulty enjoying her time with older kids such as those of age 6, possibly because she sees this maternal role as a duty rather than a fulfillment.  Whenever such bonding is compromised and a mother sees her commitments to her kids mainly as a duty and cannot find inherent gratifications in being a mother, her life can turn badly, with unfavorable consequences for her spouse and the children themselves.   How can this best be handled? Besides individual psychotherapy or family counseling, which practical interventions, in everyday life as well as more in general, can favorably impact on such crisis in motherhood? "
1775,Should I let my adult daughter know that I am her biological father?,"My daughter is 33 years old. She has grown up in a normal loving family and knows me as both a family friend and godparent. Her parents had fertility issues so I helped them have a child.   All parents know. I believe she has a right to know the truth and personally want her to know, but her family parents do not want her to know the truth. Well, the mother is 50:50 but her father is definite that she should not know. He is an alcoholic and they have just separated.   With life turned upside down it is my belief that now is a good time to be honest and have a fresh start to changing family dynamics. Also my daughter has 2 sons and alcoholism runs through her 'fathers' family, causing deaths, and she is naturally concerned for her children. But they do not have his genes.  Do I have the right to tell her against the others wishes? Should she know the truth of her biological background? "
1776,How can I decide whether to raise my teenage son's allowance?,"My 14 year old son currently gets an allowance of $12 per week.   He has no fiancial obligations that he has to pay from this amount, this is just for ""fun"" things. He does a list of chores, together with the family, but we do not ""pay"" for doing them via allowance.  He claims that his friends get $20 per week and wants me to increase his allowance. Financially speaking, that wouldn't be a problem. But I see his friends smoke and I don't want him to follow suit. I'm afraid that giving him more money would lead to his spending it for unwise or potentially dangerous things and I find it impossible to control what he uses his allowance for. My feeling is that the current amount is sufficient.  Am I completely out of sync? Are there any resources on an ""appropriate"" amount or how do I handle the discrepancy of allowances? "
1777,How long is breast milk good out of the freezer?,"I was breast feeding but I moved a few hours from were we lived and I had to stop because I had to drive 7 hours back and forth for a few days and didn't have the time to breastfeed or pump, so I froze a lot of milk.  After you take breast milk from the freezer, how long is it good for? I didn't warm it up, I just moved it from the freezer to the fridge, and I want to finish the one I have left but I'm not sure how to tell if it's good or not. How can I tell if the breast milk is bad? "
1778,"When I should, and should not use manual pump for breast feeding?",Just curious: - Can I start using it from the first day onwards? - Can I continue using it for a very long time? Any side effects? - Any advantages to mother and child when using breast milk stored in bottle? - Using it continuously causes a lack of bondage between the kid and parent? 
1779,How can I make noisy toys quieter?,"My son has a few toys that are so loud and piercing that they hurt my ears (emergency trucks with sirens, an aeroplane flies around in a circle on an articulated arm, and a toy musical piano). My ears have had almost forty years of abuse, and I find them unbearable; I hate to think of the potential for damage to my son's ears. I don't understand how toys can be made and sold with such deafening noise levels.  I know enough about electricalness to know that I could just open up the toy and snip the wire to the speaker. But what if I don't want to mute it? I have considered covering external speaker grills with tape, but my son would probably just remove the tape. Is there something I can I do – discretely, from inside the toy – to an electronic speaker to quieten it without removing the sound entirely? "
1780,Innocent age related stubborness or bad behaviour?,"My 4-year-old shows impressive stubborness and singlemindedness. While it is sometimes clear, often I find it hard to tell if I'm looking at: ""I'm four years old and surprises make me insecure"" or ""I'm the resident dictator, all shall bow to my will"". My gut feeling tells me these are different things and should be dealt with differently.  Two examples: we go to the zoo and I see the parking lot nearest the enterence is almost full so I drive to the next parking lot with many empty spaces. Son starts crying he wants me to park at the parking lot ""where we always park"". I hate parking so I go to the empty one.   He cries and screams, I have to drag him out of the car (first I run around the car trying to catch him, while he is inside the car and tries to evade me). He continues to cry in the parking lot on his bicycle on the way to the zoo, so I finally cave in. I put him and his bike back in the car and drive to the parking lot with few empty spaces. All is well. I ask him why it's such a big deal and he cannot really tell me why but he says it's a big deal.  Now the other one: I put jam on a slice of bread for breakfast, I'm almost done as he declares he wants me to put peanut butter on the other half. I tell him I have finished this slice of bread I will put peanut butter on another slice. He starts moaning and crying: he wants me to throw it away and do one half-half. It ends with time outs on the stairs, lots of crying and him throwing stuff and finally he eats his breakfast and we're late for school.  Sometimes it starts out when he asks for something I will happily accommodate, then slowly increases his demands until he either wants something he cannot have or he has annoyed me so much I decide I will not give in to everything he asks. But when he only gets 80% of what he has asked for he will think of something new. Rinse repeat.   Should I not seek confrontation when he displays quasi-autistic behaviour (like in the parking lot)?  How should I deal with unreasonable demands and are they the result of too much freedom to choose in general?  I have always believed that he can do what he likes as long as he is not doing anything dangerous or terribly inconvenient. If he wakes up and says he wants to go to the swimming pool, and we are free to go, then we'll go.  "
1781,How long should my newborn baby be in a car seat,I am planning an hour and a half ride with my 1 month old baby girl. I heard that being in the car seat for a long time is not good for newborns.  Is an hour and a half too long? Should we do a stop in the middle of the trip? 
1782,Why grain/cereal mash + fruits for infants?,"My wife just came up with a question so basic I have no answer for it: Why is it recommended to mix the typical grain/cereal mash an infant gets to eat with fruit? Basically the first solid food a baby ever eats after about half a year.  The typical recipes are always rye + apple, banana etc. Is there a particular reason to mix these things? Is it simply something the baby will typically eat and it's largely harmless? Or are there good reasons to start babies on this because... it gives them a good basis for their development or something? "
1783,How to figure out why parents are so strict about Internet access?,"My parents are extremely strict about my use of the Internet. I'm only allowed to use it on a specific PC in wide view of everyone in the house. However, this PC does not have it's logging facilities enabled and as I write this, no one is actively watching.  I would like to have a little more freedom and be able to use it on my own PC in my room, which can't be seen as easily. However, I was told no when I asked.  I fail to understand the logic of this, but when I bring it up, I get information about how ""there are dangerous people online"" and ""why do you need it in your room?""  How do I make them understand where I'm coming from? I have gotten angry in the past but recently I've adopted a more calm approach, which didn't work.  I'd be happy to have it in my room and also have some monitoring program, but I'm very much into programming and I think they believe I'll be able to disable the monitoring when I please.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. By the way, this isn't the only issue my parents have been very strict on. (It was a whole other fight to get my own PC.)  EDIT: Why I want it in my room? Not because I want to browse weird sites (like I said, I'm perfectly OK with monitoring usage), but because I want to be able to do things on my own independently of others. I've found it difficult to get that message across to the other side.  Another EDIT: I'm physically prevented from using the computer after bedtime so anyone can walk to my room and see whether I'm using it or not. "
1784,Can a “magic answer box” backfire? Is it ok?,"I’m a fresh father (4 months old daughter) and I’m sometimes visualising the future.   I was thinking of implementing a system for when she’ll be a little older (7+ years old) in which:   she posts a thought in a box on a piece of paper (I expect mostly questions) I secretely take the piece of paper I respond in some way (supporting, explaining, etc.) and replace her piece of paper with mine without her ever knowing.    This system should offer her a friend whom she can trust and rely on in case she gets mad at us, or whenever.   However:   I’m thinking she might already be old enough to figure out such tricks I’m worried that when she’ll be even older she might feel I tricked her into sharing private thoughts that I was never meant to know.    What are your thoughts on this idea? Does it need any adjustments? "
1785,At what age get a child to stop using pullups at night? [merged],At what age get a child to stop using pullups at night? And how do you encourage a child and give them the confidence to try sleeping without one? I know one OK way is telling them it's Ok to wet the bed. Any other techniques? 
1786,What should I teach my teenager about condoms?,"Let me preface the question by saying that I'm not asking this question in order to endorse or promote teenage sex. Even if my child wants to wait until he is married to have sex, as a parent, I still want to educate him on how condoms work.  So some pertinent questions are:    How do you bring up the topic?  What do you demonstrate on?  What storage precautions should you explain? What things should you mention about efficacy with regards to pregnancy and STDs? What else should you tell your child about condoms?  "
1787,"What do I do about the fact that my child can already read, write and do math before entering Kindergarten?","My nearly 6 year-old son is going to first grade next year. He's already reading quite fluently and writing. He does basic math (without writing).  He has great sense of humor, and he loves to make his friends laugh.   I'm afraid my child disturb the class when he starts first grade already reading and writing?  My concern is that he'll be very bored when starting school, and then will start making jokes and disturbing the class. Then he might be tagged by the teacher as he will disturb her in her teaching. On the one hand, I think this is a real possibility, and on the other hand, I don't want to take any action or say anything that might make this reality.   Any suggestions about how to move forward?  "
1788,Is starting a small fire a good way to the explain dangers of flammability?,"How can one teach a 5 year old that acetone, white spirit and other household solvents are not to be played with if he somehow manages to get a hold of them?  One idea is to go to the yard far enough from any flammable structures, pour some amount onto ground (where no plants grow of course) so that a pool about two feet in diameter forms and set that on fire so that a kid could see that violent flame and think twice whether he wants it anywhere in a house.  Is that a good idea? What are other options? "
1789,How to deal with siblings always quarreling over simple situations?,"I am a 20 year old male about to join undergraduate, living with my cousin (15 yo, grade 8) and my sister (17 yo high schooler) in a single rented room.  We all live away from home for study reasons. My sister is a good student, has been awarded scholarships, and also does most of the work around the house. My cousin is very smart for his age, does work around the house as well (we each have our chores), but is a very poor student.  He has terrible handwriting, is bad at English spelling &amp; grammar, and lacks basic math and science skills, which he will sorely need in high school. If he continues like this, I am almost certain he will fail his secondary school education.   To make it worse, he and my sister don't like each other at all. They are constantly on the verge of conflict, and I don't know to make them get along. My cousin repeats the same mistakes, which sets her off (he mostly ignores her suggestion), and my sister keeps going off over the little things he does.  For the 2 years we have been living together, I have been counselling him about his studies, but he has not improved. He obeys me, and doesn't hate me like he hates my sister.   Whenever I speak the truth about his studies to his parents, they react very poorly:     ""Throw him out of the room, why are we paying if he does not study? Slap him!"" etc.   I am tired of hearing this. How could I hurt him or throw him out?   Instead, I've tried to help him by giving him extra high quality text books to study from, and access to internet for research - I've also taught him how to search for information. Unfortunately, he seldom uses that book, and mostly watches cartoons on the internet.   I can't stay with him all the time since I have my own studies to do . I can only guide him.  How can I deal with them? "
1790,Is it ok to play a computer game with a 3yo,"My 3yo daughter has recently noticed me playing Craft the World, a game which is (mostly) about dwarves working and building their home, with hardly any violence. She wanted to know what it's about, I started explaining, and after a while we've started playing together.     She really enjoyed building dwarves their home, furnishing it, dressing dwarves and giving them tools to work better, etc. etc.  So far, over the last week or so, we've played 3 or 4 times for 15 minutes max each time. I'm doing most of the clicking but decisions are made together. I encouraged her to use the mouse, but with little success.   I'm having doubts about this. While I'm against giving a child a phone or tablet to get rid of them, I didn't really feel bad playing this game with her. I had the opportunity to talk about some things she never heard about before, explain with a good example that one has to work to have something.  Should I let her play with me at all? Do you think that this activity, as I have described it, is acceptable for a 3 yo? "
1791,What should I consider when flying with an infant?,"My wife and I will be traveling to the US next month and we're going to take two flights, probably one of 2 hours and the other 4.  Although my 7-month-old son already sits by himself, I'm not sure I should get him his own seat. Is carrying him on our arms for both flights something bearable?  Also something I'm really worried about is his ears, due to the air pressure. Are there any tips or considerations I should take about that?  What about the takeoff and landing? Is that something babies get afraid of? My little one is kind of scared of the blender...so I'm kinda worried.  I'm still going to ask our doctor when he has his next visit, but wanted to get some tips ahead. "
1792,Should we freeze some breastmilk for later use even if there's no excess supply?,"My wife is currently pumping just enough milk to keep up with ""demand"".  Since she'll be going to back to work and won't be able to pump as often as she does now, her milk supply will likely run out before the baby stops needing it.  We're considering freezing some of the breast milk now and supplementing whatever is frozen by formula, so that we can feed the combination of formula/breast milk for a much longer period of time.  Is this a good idea?  Or is it better for the baby's immune system to feed all the breast milk  now and later on be 100% on formula? "
1793,What are tested ways to teach kids about self-discipline?,"I have made my 6.2-year-old kid aware of the experiment on delayed gratification (+ video) and its results. It seems to have worked. Now we write what she wants to buy and associate possible (days) delay to it. Also delaying many other things (say, watching a video by few minutes) which she is agreeing to. In general, I find her more disciplined and more free from pangs, otherwise.  Here are some variants I have tried:   Asking to write 2 words: ""gradual, planning"" multiple times after explaining the context with examples (say for gradual: ""Did you run immediately after being born?"" ""Ans: No"" ""First turned, crawled, walking with support ... then running"". The idea is to let them contemplate on antonyms for sudden / unplanned stuff using a variety of ways: Asking to come up with different sentences using these words). I have bought Mi Band (basic and 'Tools &amp; Mi Band' app) and configured to vibrate every 10 minutes. For 10 minutes study and then for 10 minutes playing... There is fun with the band. Asking to sit quietly without any movements for 2 minutes with a timer (mobile screen). If there is a movement then again for 2 minutes.   Many more variety of ways we can definitely do and this is what I was expecting. All these things we can do only after connecting. I would request to read ""My Heart I Give to Children"" by Sukhomlynsky for good inspiration.  This makes me think there must have been similar interesting experiments done in the past, the results of which we can make use of.   Are there any more such results (in variety)? Do you have any powerful (tested) ideas which are orthogonal in variety? "
1794,Can I use a stroller for my infant in Chicago's public transportation?,"My family will be visiting Chicago next month and we'll be using the metro and buses.  My question is, how do infants (son is a 7 month old baby) usually travel in public transporation? Does one have to set-up a car seat on either of those? Or is it always on arms?  Also, if we carry a lightweight stroller, are there ramps on every station to be able to move around in it? How about when going through the turnstiles? Can the baby go through it on the stroller? Or does one have to fold the stroller, carry the baby on arms, and then unfold the stroller again when boarding?  Thanks for the help. "
1795,Is there software that helps teach pre-schoolers to recognize letters?,"I am looking for software, which allow my three year old to tap a letter and it will present the letter and say it. I speak an obscure language so I need to record the letters myself. Does this exist?  The reason for asking trial made in Sweden where they found that children should start to learn by writing, not reading.  If this does not exist, would you be willing to sponsor the development? I would then hire someone to make such software. "
1796,"When flying with an infant, what airport security restrictions for breast milk/formula/baby food apply?","We're planning on taking a short (1-2 hour) air trip in a couple of months.  Our son will be 11 months old by then.  Given the delays with getting through security, the amount of time in advance we'll need to arrive at the gate, and the duration of the flight, we're assuming we'll need to feed him at least once during the trip.  However, with the restrictions of airport security, we're not sure if we'll be able to bring food with us.  Can we bring bottled breast milk?  Powdered formula with water?  Jars of baby food?  All of those would need to exceed the fluid volume restrictions in place for carry-on baggage within the US.  Are exceptions made for infants?  Would glass jars for the baby food be an issue? "
1797,Helping a child independently make logical connections,"My seven year-old son has a lot of difficulty making logical connections on his own.  His inability to make logical connections is his biggest obstacle to academics and social functioning.  How can we help him improve at it?  For example, one of his teeth fell out last night, but he left it in the van.  We took him out to the van this morning to see if the tooth fairy came.  He looked straight at the money a few times, but didn't notice it, because he was looking for his tooth.  We asked him what he was looking for, and he answered his tooth.  So we asked why he was looking for his tooth, and he answered because he left it in there last night.  So we asked him what the tooth fairy does, and he answered correctly and promptly.  But it still didn't dawn on him.  So we asked him what he should be looking for.  Only then did he get it.  We know this isn't age-typical behavior, because his four year-old sister sometimes makes similar mistakes starting out, but she almost always makes the connection when she first sees hints like the money, and on the rare occasions she doesn't, she doesn't need more than one verbal hint.  Our son almost never makes those connections without our input.  He easily remembers the pieces of the puzzle one at a time when prompted, and once the pieces are all there he can easily put them together.  He does very well on logic games like robot turtles.  It's just like it doesn't occur to his brain to ask the right questions.  This affects him academically.  Math has a lot of deductive reasoning, and in reading new words he often gets stuck on his first pronunciation, and it doesn't occur to him to try an 's' sound for the 'c', for example.  He is actually a grade level or more ahead in reading, according to these tests, but it's like he remembers a huge number of sight words rather than possessing good decoding ability.   In other words, he is severely hampered in learning new things independently, but probably above average in recalling facts he learned previously.  We've probably said things like ""What other sounds does a 'c' make?"" thousands of times, but it doesn't occur to him to ask those questions of himself. Obviously modeling the behavior isn't working.  We could make prospective memory aids for specific situations like reading new words, but that won't help him in other new situations, especially social ones.  We try to give him as small of hints as possible, in order to help him exercise that skill, but it hasn't seemed to make a difference.  What else can we do to help him develop this skill? "
1798,Is there any benefit in reading to a baby 2 weeks old?,"My baby is now 2 weeks old. I am eager to read to her because of all the associated reading benefits.     Birth to 6 months: Since an infant's vision is still developing,   choose books with little or no text and big, high-contrast pictures.   Also consider books with interactive stuff, such as puppets, mirrors,   or peepholes, recommends Pamela High, MD, author of the Brown   University reading study and a professor of pediatrics there. The more   ways you both have to enjoy a book, the better. If you'd like, read to   your baby from grown-up books or magazines too. Comprehending the   words isn't really the point with babies this young. For infants,   reading is about the tone of your voice and cuddling up to you.   However I find that my baby sleeps, cries and eats. Her eyes are not really opening all of the time, which means she can't see the colorful books; she doesn't seem to be able to hear my voice ( if she does, she isn't showing it), which makes it quite pointless to read to her.   So is there any benefit in reading to a 2 weeks old baby?  Note that this question is distinctively different from In what way does reading storybooks to babies help them (besides falling asleep), and at what age should it be started?. That question is more about the benefits of reading storybooks, this is more about whether reading the books to 2 weeks old newborn is beneficial at all.  "
1799,4 year old steals toys from baby brother,"My nephew (Alex) is turning 4 in one week, and his little brother (Ben) is 10 months old. When Ben was born, Alex loved him to death and would do anything to help us with him, bringing him toys and binkies and blankets and stuff.    But now that Ben has learned how to crawl and can get around better, he (of course) loves to play with his older brother's toys. However, when Ben gets ahold of any toy, Alex comes storming over and yanks it out of his hands.  We are trying to teach Alex that it is not nice to steal toys from Ben, since he is little and doesn't understand. We also want to help Alex understand that if he doesn't want Ben to play with his toys, he should not leave them where Ben can reach them.  However it has moved on from just not sharing his own toys. Whenever Ben does anything, Alex has to try to stop him or take things away from him. Even if Ben is playing with a baby toy that Alex hates, just the fact that Ben has it makes Alex want to take it back.  We don't really understand his behavior and how to correct it. We have considered jealousy issues and try not to force Alex to share his toys and give Alex plenty of special time.  Has anyone else experienced this? Do you have any tips on how to get them to play nicely together? "
1800,Will cradle swing cause concussion to young infant?,"My baby is now 2 weeks old, and I was cautioned against the use of cradle swing on her:    The reason is because ""the baby is too young and the use of cradle swing might cause concussion on her"".  Is this caveat valid? When can I start using cradle swing on newborn? "
1801,"Infant turns in her sleep, is that a concern?","It´s summertime now where we live, and it can be pretty hot (30 degrees Celsius or 86 Fahrenheit). So we put our daughter of 5 month to sleep on her back without blanket or sleep sack.  However, she sometimes turn on her tummy in her sleep. Is that a concern ? Should we turn her back on her back ? Should we put a light blanket to prevent her from turning while sleeping ? "
1802,Need suggestions on how to deal with my 11yo in school,"This turned out way longer than I intended, please try to bulldoze thru it.  My oldest daughter is 11. She's the middle of 5 (21 19 11 9 7). Her older bros are in 'college' (they're taking classes). They pretty much blazed the middle-school trail for their siblings so the wiff and I have had plenty of warning with the general issues that we will face again. Yes kids are different, I know this... but they've all grown up in the same middle class neighborhood so their general issues are very similar  The problem with school work is that she's simply not doing it. I was an 11 yo latchkey kid that never did his homework, but I also didn't have much if any guidance or direction. There's nothing stopping her from coming home, getting a drink, sitting in the kitchen, and doing the hw before her siblings get home. This isn't earthshattering and therefore, I expect that she can do that. She doesn't. We're midway thru the 2nd quarter of 6th grade (1st yr of middle school) and can't seem to crack the nut into making a routine. She's failing 3 of 4 core classes (science, math, communcation arts/english, but not social studies) because she doesn't do the work. She's seriously about to fail and repeat 6th grade simply because she will not do it.  She's very much like I was and her 2 older brothers. The difference is that I managed to deal with it without parental or school aid, and her brothers eventually got it. Both of them, Jr/Sr yr, were finally able to do what they needed to do without me crawling up their back about it.  Anyway, in class, she does other things besides ""using her time wisely""; ranging from sitting there staring at the ceiling to old-school reading a book you want to read while it's framed in the book that you're supposed to read. She's supposed to fill out a daily agenda with the assignment for that class (all kids get the agenda booklet) have it signed by the teacher (just my kid and then i deal with it at home) and then come home and do the work, and me or mom will look it over. This is not a complex process, but she's supposed to do it 5 days in a row to get pc/ds privileges back. The most she's managed to do is 2 days.  Now . . . I know that she's distractable. She always stops in the middle of whatever and I have to make her focus. ""Aaaahhhh, there it is... add/adhd"". Not so fast there, bub...   I've not seen real effort put into doing it. Without going into the gory details and examples, she can get started (2 days above) and she clearly exhibits the ability to focus (not hyperfocus) for varied times and levels of concentration. But they're all things that she really likes to do... reading, drawing, pokemon, building lego farms with her younger siblings. I don't count, but to some extent probably should count, minecraft and certain pc/vid games that require serial attention on goal oriented gameplay.   It's hard to quantify in this space all the things I've tried and the conversations I've had with her. Her teachers generally care, but they're middle school teachers with 200 kids, or whatever, to deal with. One teacher seems to be going thru the motions but the others are interactive with her and parents. I've burned completely thru a variety of motivational systems, positive, negative, bonus, none of them stick. From ""bring a signed agenda home, I'll put a bead in your vase"" (full vase gets you something cool) down to ""bring it, or else"" and all the ""or elses"" have come to pass. And I know from experience with her older brothers that they eventually turn into the rat in the electrified cage: After 2 weeks without pc/ds, it no longer matters.   Yes I follow up on the negative stuff. 11 is too old to spank in our house (besides, she's like 5'8"" 150#), but she quite literally has zero privs right now. Come home, sit at the table, the end. And I still have to tell her to do the work and she doesn't do it because I'm busy being a parent and can't stand over her like a totalitarian despot.   As said, it's not my first rodeo. My older boys had previously set the mark on ""horrible getting hw done"" and we dealt with it, dare I say, effectively. I managed to deal with it without parental or school aid, and her brothers eventually got it. However it took them several years, all the way up into hs, before I had to really start hacking into life-affecting privs. Both of them, Jr/Sr yr, were finally able to do what they needed to do without me crawling up their back.   So the fact that I've blasted thru a 6 year plan in 2.5 mos has left me with no idea what to do. I've considered homeschool (my schedule would allow it), her younger siblings are in the gifted program at school and she missed it by a couple points in math (she convinced herself that she hates math yet can do it easily). They all tested high in younger grades and are following the same path of dumbing down to the curriculum that's taught. Homeschooling, tho, presents a number of challenges for especially me.  So, after all that, the questions are:   What else I can do motivationally? I've explained how much it woudl suck for her to repeat, and she gets it: the next 6 years of school will affect the next 60 years of her life. Any specific recommendations for some kind of professional? I'm not beyond counselling but I've no idea where to begin. I'm not beyond accepting diagnosis, but I'm not convinced that 1) she's diagnosable and I'm not throwing meds at it 2) she's got a problem beyond motivation. We know add and adhd kids and personality wise she's nothing like any of them. Any thoughts on the homeschooling solution? What about part time homeschooling?  "
1803,Tandem nursing infants of different ages,"Does a newborn infant of 2 wk get enough nutrition from the breast milk which is also fed to a older child of one year in tandem nursing? Our pediatrician said that the better quality milk made for newborn is unnecessarily taken up by the older child, which may cause the newborn to not get the sufficient  nutrition. But the local La leche representative did not object to tandem nursing and allowed it. So what are the evidence based guidelines , pros and cons of tandem nursing infants of different ages?  Also the older child is now  even more interested in breastfeeding then ever before on seeing her sibling feed , this inspite of the older child getting enough external foods. The older child feeds more frequently and for longer duration clearly showing  competing behavior. "
1804,Is milk powder left in a hot car going to go bad?,I bought milk powder for my 2-year-old boy and forgot it in the car for a day. Usually the car is locked and parked outside. The car becomes hot inside as the temperature in my area is nearly 40 degrees (Celsius) during the day.   Will this effect the milk? Can I use that milk powder for my baby? 
1805,Is jogging an appropriate activity for a pre-adolescent child?,"This question was motivated by seeing a 6 or 7 year old girl jogging with her mom today. I was in slow moving traffic so I know she ran at least 2.5 miles (the distance between the lights causing said traffic). The little girl was wearing ear buds, running shoes/gear, and had what looked like a pedometer on her waist. A perfect replica of her mom. If she wasn't so young it would have been cute, but because of her apparent age it left me feeling more disturbed than anything.    Don't get me wrong - kids need exercise. But I feel that pre-adolescence, it should be more about play, fun, team building, and sportsmanship than ""fitness.""  Perhaps my opinion is off base? After all, Olympians are made not born right?    However, with Olympians in mind, I am having trouble finding any other motivation for a lengthy jog than to be fit or to train. I actually love jogging, but wouldn't dream of encouraging my 9-year-old to do it because the benefits (besides an Olympic Medal) I'm seeking are not applicable to him - cardiovascular health, weight management, mental clarity, muscle tone... frankly, running just seems like it would be really boring for a kid. Of course, there are also risks involved, which are joint damage, getting hit by a car, sprains, etc... So why would someone allow/encourage a young child to do it? Is it healthy for a 6, 7, 8 year old to do long distance running? At what age is running a healthy form of exercise for a kid?   Am I crazy for thinking this scene was weird to begin with? (That's a matter of opinion and not good ""stack"" form so no one has to answer that...)  I don't want people to think I'm picking on runners - I also wonder if any of these other ""adult"" sports would be healthy/appropriate for a young child (say, more than 5, less than puberty):   weight lifting swimming (laps, not as part of a team) cycling   Do any of these sports have a benefit unique to children (as in, something kids would get that adults wouldn't - such as a development advantage) that would make them a better alternative to the usual kid sports (baseball, soccer, karate, etc.) that perhaps I am unaware of?  I realize there's quite a bit of opinion-orientated questions in here - but I'm leaving it so that my intent is understood. I'm really curious to know if running, etc., is harmful to kids or merely unpopular. If they are harmful, at what age do they transition into the healthy category?  "
1806,Is it safe to have your baby sleep next to you in a tent?,We will be going camping this weekend and plan to have our 8-month-old baby sleep next to me on the tent floor. Is this safe? Will it work? 
1807,"What can be causing night wakings, similar to sleep walking?","My 13 month old baby wakes up once or twice every night...sits up or stands up in her crib and cries out. What could be causing this?  She can't be having nightmares every night. My wife has not weened her from night feedings, so some of the wakings could be due to this.  However, sometimes I can actually talk calmly to her and help her lay back down...and this will put her right back to sleep.  What causes these night wakings? Could she be sleepwalking? "
1808,How to help a seven year old with unrequited love?,"My son turned seven two months ago, and will begin his second year in elementary school after this summer.  Yesterday he received a love letter by one of his class mates, a girl of the same age. She wrote that she is in love with him and asked if they could meet in secret. She also asked him not to tell their class mates or parents. I learned of the letter, because I was sitting at the table with my son when we opened the day's mail, but I suspect he would have told me anyway, because he was clearly out of his depth with that declaration.  You might think the whole matter cute, but the problem is that my son vaguely dislikes this girl and at the same time is the kind of person who strongly feels the pain of others and does not want to hurt her.  The girl lives two houses away from us and visited the same kindergarten as my son. When we moved here, four years ago, we tried to get the two kids to befriend each other and went to the playground, swimming and elsewhere a couple of times with the other family. The girl very much liked and wanted to spend time with my son right from the beginning. But my son soon lost interest in her as he made other friends, and his initial openness slowly turned into a mild form of dislike as he realized a basic incompatibility between them, yet she kept attempting to connect with him.  My son is quite popular with his peers, and he has a score of close and favourite friends, about a third of which are girls. The girl in question, on the other hand, appears to have only a few, exclusively female, friends. My son and his friends are of course interested in each other's physical differences and show their private parts to each other when they believe no adults are watching, but as yet none of them have shown any signs of attempts at romantic love.  Against this background the love letter is doubly incongruous: because my son is not yet interested in girls in this way, and because he is not interested in this girl even as a friend.  Since my son did not know how to deal with this letter, I helped him compose a reply. I thought and told him a reply is a necessary courtesy and that he should make his disinterest in a romantic relationship unmistakeably clear. I'm the kind of person who immediately gets cured of an infatuation upon being refused, so I try to quickly set those free who are unlucky enough to fall in love with me and not encounter a corresponding feeling.  To my surprise my son also said he would be willing (not interested!) to go swimming with the girl. So he added that offer to the reply. He went and put his letter in the girl's mailbox this morning. Her reply promptly arrived around lunch: she asks if he wants to go swimming tomorrow, which is fine, but covered the letter in lipstick kisses, which clearly shows that she did not understand (or believe) my son's refusal and that she lives in a fantasy world quite unlike that of my son, in which love letters covered in kisses don't yet exist. He knows of love, of course, but in his conception it is something that adults do and he is interested in it in the same way that he is interested in where money comes from or what cancer is: as something that does not directly affect him.  My son is gone for two weeks now and won't receive the girl's second letter before he returns. I have called the girl's mother and told her that my son won't be able to go swimming with her daughter tomorrow (and nothing else).  But the question remains how he (and I) should deal with this matter. I am worried that the girl will keep pressing for my son's affection and make both herself and him unhappy with her dependence. But should I interfere? Should I tell the girl's parents and hope they will be able to help her accept my son's disinterest and turn her desire for, I guess, friendship to more likely candidates? What kind of advice can I give him, who is not only not interested in this girl, but also not even interested in the problem of love, and now has to deal with emotions that are not part of his current stage of development?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.    Update:  I was so unsure about this that I did not do anything at all at that time. The summer holidays and a lengthy trip came on between the two kids going swimming together, and then I forgot about it all until, a few weeks ago, a second letter arrived. I hesitated to deliver it and put it among my paperwork, where it remains unopened and unread. I felt and still feel that the letters take this all to a different level and put more pressure on my son than he deserves. The two kids are in the same class, so they meet and interact almost daily, and twice in the intervening time my son came home telling me that that girl is in love with him, and after a short pause, but he not with her. Then he proceeded to tell me that another boy from his class is in love with another girl, but she not with him either. And then he turned to other, more immediate matters. So I feel that it is not such a big issue after all, neither for him nor the girl, and I do not interfere as long as it remains so. "
1809,What is a fair way to punish a sibling who unintentionally erases another's Saved Game?,"TL;DR: Question title. (What is a fair way to punish a sibling who unintentionally erases another's Saved Game?)  So this question could (should?) perhaps be posted on Parenting, but I thought users here might have some personal experience with this.  I recall two incidents from my childhood where I erased my younger brother's saved games, both times unintentionally (in my mind).  The first time was when I somehow deleted all the files for SimTown.  Game files, saved games, and all.  We re-installed the game, but no saves to be found.  My brother was devastated and demanded my Roller Coaster Tycoon files be erased in retribution.  My parents did not think that erasing save files for a game I'd played many more hours on was fair.  Fast forward a couple years and we're at daycare beefing up the kids starting lineups with the 3 starter Pokemon for Red and Blue.  I was the cool kid with the link cable that let us trade, and I volunteered to get everyone set.  Not even considering that there is only one save file and that to make a trade you need to save, I overwrote my brother's 100+ Pokedex to trade a Charmander for a Rattata.  This horrific act again resulted in no punishment for me, but I did offer to help my brother with a new game.  Looking back, I got off easy.  I would have been pretty vengeful if I had been my little brother, and maybe that's why we aren't close today (or because he lives a couple hundred miles away) and he's not the gamer type.  Still, that leaves me wondering what an appropriate punishment would have been?  Is erasing the saves of the offending sibling really making things ""fair?""  What would be an appropriate punishment these days?  EDIT: Just to clarify, both of these cases were unintentional.  The first one due to not understanding how to properly use a computer at the age of 8, the second time just forgetting (and not reading the warning message) that you have to erase the saved game to do the trade. "
1810,My child is constantly hungry. How do I keep her feeling fuller?,"I give my daughter lots of healthy foods, including those that have fiber in them.  She gets veggies and fruits, proteins, dairy, she has a water bottle with her wherever she goes and yet this week she is waking up in the middle of the night hungry and honestly wanting food as well as needing something to eat almost every hour during the day.  Breakfast often includes eggs, sausage, ham or other such foods (often in an omlette, frittata or quiche.  We do oatmeal a lot along with some fruit or a yummy shake and once a week or so we have muffins, pancakes or waffles (which almost always have a little flaxseed thrown in.  She loves both the eggs and oatmeal and eats plenty at breakfast.    Lunches usually include a homemade burger (I have a recipe that includes blackbeans, soy and ground beef together I use), deli sandwich and/or some sort of soup or chili (especially this time of year).  This is also when I might do what most people in the US would have for Dinner.  Stir Fry (again, brown or wild rice or a mixture), Porkchops and root veggies, Meatloaf and mashed potato.  We might also get something at McD's or Panda Express if we are out and about (she loves the orange chicken).  Almost every sauce I make has veggies in it as well as what she eats on the side.  One of her favorite veggies is broccoli so she often asks for half veggies/half rice when we are eating at Panda Express.  Dinner is often a lot simpler and might be rice (I never use white) and beans, a nutty cous cous concoction that is a family favorite that includes a little quinoa with the cous cous and pistachios or something more traditional like spaghetti (without all the extra trimmings though) and a side of veggies such as roasted squash or zucchini, green beans, peas and carrots. . . (you get the idea).  I don't do desert very often, but she does get chocolate milk some of the time (2%), has access to candy (but rarely chooses to eat it - seriously, I don't even tell her she needs to ask anymore) and when we are at the theater often gets the ""less healthy"" stuff for dinner because we are out OR I'll pack sandwiches with carrot sticks, jicama and fruit and a cup of pudding or yogurt.  She is six, tall and skinny, and pretty active, so this is not an over-eating thing (or an infant thing).  I don't believe it is medical because there is no genetic history of such things and we've actually gone through similar periods of time before.  The pattern often is that it lasts about a week or so.  Then, she suddenly grows some (and we have to pull out the hand-me-downs in the next size) and then her appetite goes back to normal.  In the past, having some extra apples and grapes around (or other fruits) along with some yogurt or cheese and a piece of toast or crackers for her to grab has worked.  She also can make herself a peanut butter sandwich at any time really (and I'll help with other ideas if she wishes for them).  The getting up in the middle of the night so hungry she can't get back to sleep part is new though.  I'm expecting it to pass any day now (and to suddenly need the new PJ's, shirts and leggings I got to put in presents under the tree sooner rather than later) but in the meantime I am starting to get concerned about her sleep.  Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.  Pre-bedtime snack ideas that are healthy to try?  Tricks-of-the-trade for helping her sleep even after she gets hungry?  A Snack that won't be bad for her teeth and gums she can just have by the bed so she doesn't even have to get up and can fall back asleep faster? . . .  UPDATE:  8:30am ate 3 servings of egg, cheese, sausage fritata that also contained zucchini, and summer squash.  Along side had a smoothie with yogurt, spinach, strawberries, blackberries and a banana.  9:35 - ""Mom, I'm hungry.  Can I have some yogurt raisins and an apple?"" ""Sure Hon.  Do you want a bowl of peanut butter to dip your apples in?"" ""Yumm.  That sounds good mommy.""  11:00 - ""Mom is it time for lunch yet?"" Daddy responds, ""Do you want to go get a burger? - Have a little Daddy time?""   Apparently she ate all but two bites of her cheeseburger and a sizable amount of fries.  1:30 - ""Mom, did we have lunch?  I'm hungry.""  She had a little chocolate milk and a pear with a small handful of crackers and a few slices of cheddar.  Half an hour later we added a granola bar.  Just now - ""Mom, I'm hungry again.""  FINAL Update: without a lot of change, but with a peanut butter and jelly protein shake (and the diet outlined above) just before teeth brushing and bed - she slept Really Well last night YEAH!!!!.  The shake had crunchy, all natural peanut butter, frozen strawberries, Greek Yogurt, spinach (I know - but she likes one I make with spinach and pineapple in it and when I was making it said, but mom what about the spinach?) and soy protein powder in it.  By bed she was SUPER tired anyway, and she has awoken with visibly longer legs (when viewing where the cuff falls) than the ones she started the day with yesterday morning.  Can't really tell if its anything we did differently or if it was just time, but I'm keeping all the ideas in mind and getting some great ones on the cooking site too.  I'm sure it will come up again. "
1811,"In the USA in the year 2014, does the law forbid children from being out and about without close adult supervision?","My wife and I are set to become parents within the next few months.  One thing that frightens me about the prospect of being a parent in today's world, and specifically, in Littleton, Colorado, USA, is the recent spate of reports of parents being arrested and having their children taken away because the children engage in activities on their own that would have been considered normal a few decades ago.  I was born in 1983.  Much to the dismay of my parents, I preferred to constantly amuse myself with Nintendo games throughout my childhood.  However, I was certainly allowed and encouraged to play outside any time I wanted to.  In today's United States, it appears that many people in law enforcement and the courts see it as a parent's duty to keep their children under close supervision at all times; they see anything else as criminal child endangerment.    See this report by the Washington Post: A boy in Ohio left church one Sunday morning to go play with friends.  Someone saw him at a ""Family Dollar Store"" and reported this to the police.  The police arrived, took him home, and arrested his father for ""child endangerment"".  Google will find you many stories like this, so I'm not going to post them all here; I believe that the above story is a good example of what I'm concerned about.  Are parents required by law in the United States in the year 2014 to closely supervise their children when they are out and about, or else keep them at home?  It sounds like the answer is a resounding ""Absolutely, yes, and you can go to jail and lose your family if you don't obey!""  Are these reports typical of how the law is applied in the USA today, or are these reports outliers?  Finally, if I don't want my children to be developmentally stunted by being placed under close adult supervision at all times and ""house arrest"" when supervision isn't available, what can I do about it?  I would be particularly interested in an answer that cites the law as applied here or how the courts have interpreted the law. "
1812,Is it ok to let my 3-month-old sleep through the night?,"I have a 3-month-old child. My pediatrician told me that you shouldn't let a baby sleep through the night until she/he is at least 4 months old. Even if they are gaining weight.   But my little one from day one had a different opinion. I turn on my alarm clock to make sure I get up to feed him. But every once and a while I don't hear my alarm clock and I wake up feeling like the worst mother for letting him sleep 8 hours! He has been gaining weight perfectly, weighing about 13 lbs now. He takes just a few quick naps during the day and eats almost every hour-two during the day until his bedtime at 8-9pm. I feed him at 9pm and again at 1-2am and then at 5-6am. But last night I didn't wake at 2am but at 5:30, and this has happened a few times. I also have a 20-month-old who would sleep through the night from the first month.   Could it just be that my kids like to sleep during the night? And why can't we let them sleep that long? I grew up always hearing ""Never wake a sleeping baby!"" Did they just mean during their nap? "
1813,How do you explain terrorist extremism to children?,"I have an 8, 6 and 4 year old. While eating dinner, we watched Obama's announcement on Bin Laden.   With hindsight, it would have been easier to keep the TV off, but I thought it was a good idea at the time. This was a significant moment in history, he's the US president, and ten years from now my kids might vaguely remember watching this, even if they don't really understand it now.  To try and explain it quickly and simply, I said that Bin Laden was a ""baddie"". My six year old said that baddie's think that they are goodies.  The questions kept coming, and now I have to explain terrorists' motivations. I felt like I was pushed into this scene: [website]Does anyone have advice or any links to resources which can help me here? "
1814,1.5 years old banging his head on the floor,"My son is 1.5 years old. In case of distress, strong unhappiness or fussiness, he  bangs his head on the floor or into the wall, or punches his fists on the head when crying aloud. He is not doing it hard enough to harm himself but it worries me.   Is this behavior normal for his age? How can I prevent it or mitigate it?  "
1815,Is my 7mo ready for solids?,"We've had my 7mo old on pureed foods for about a month now (she had a week off while she was sick). Prior to this she was exclusively breastfed and continues to be breastfed for at least a year. She doesn't open her mouth for me to feed her. She will take the spoon (knocking off most of the food in the process) and bring it to her mouth, but she doesn't open her mouth to put the spoon in it. She sticks her tongue out just a little to taste it, she'll kindof lick/eat the food slowly off her hands and the spoon and then mostly smears it all over her face. (It's actually quite an adorable mess!) I can sometimes sneak the spoon in her mouth if she opens it to smile, but I don't want to startle her or cause her to choke if she's not ready for the bite. When she gets food in her mouth she sticks her tongue out a little. It looks like she's moving around in her mouth, but I can't tell. I don't think it's a taste preference because she does this for all food we feed her, not just certain ones. I can't tell if this is normal and she's just experimenting with this solid food thing... or if she's not ready for solids?? I know she doesn't NEED the food because the breastmilk is enough to satisfy her nutritional needs. Thoughts? "

1818,"""Secret"" correspondence with a child","A is parent of B, let's say in primary school age. A invents fake profiles of n realistic, inspiring characters and starts sending anonymous letters from each of these n characters to B, at different times, with different styles, such that each character behaves according to their own profile and each with their own story to tell; B starts a private correspondence with some of them without realising A is behind them.  A makes use of these correspondences for genuine educational purposes (i.e. A is not a psychopath). Let us assume no actual manipulation is involved: each of the n characters will actually behave independently and without any hidden goal apart that of being B's good friend and having some good time together.  Of course, these characters may decide to uncover their true identity, more or less gradually, more or less explicitly, entirely or just partially, perhaps maintaining the correspondence and continuing it as a ""game"".  A's behaviour presents obvious ethical dilemmas (starting with children's right to privacy, their right not to be deceived/misguided). Can it be ethically acceptable or is there a way to make it ethically acceptable? Is it even legal?  Is that worse than parents pretending to be Santa Claus or the Tooth Fairy?    EDIT Following answers by jker and Ines, I try to clarify my question  What is the purpose of these correspondences? Expose the child to great personalities, fictitious but realistic, inspiring, able to communicate with the child and teach them something in a context that is outside what the child perceives to be ""family"" or ""school"".  Why, can't A do the same without this bewildering trick? Yes, of course, A can play one character: the parent. Unfortunately parents are not enough: all children need many good quality one-to-one interactions with as many different educators as possible, and from as many different cultural backgrounds as possible; however educators, relatives and friends are usually not able or not willing to engage, cooperatively with the families, in activities so much tailored on the needs of one single child. This trivial trick would allow the child to interact with astrophysicists, musicians, artists, philosophers, mathematicians, neuroscientists, etc. - and these would not be just ""mum"" or ""dad"", they would have an aura of magic, they would be fascinating - which parents cannot usually be. And having real pen-friends is such a great educative experience for children of that age, expanding so much their normal, little microcosms.  It seems necessary to highlight that the purpose is cultural, not psychotherapeutic.  Genuine educational purposes are perfectly compatible with having a good time as friends - I feel a bit uncomfortable having to state that.  Why secrecy? Because children need lots of good educators, and school educators, relatives and friends are not good enough, they are not astrophysicists, musicians, artists, philosophers, mathematicians, neuroscientists, etc. Often they don't even have time for individual children. For parents it can be much easier, they just need to get to know their child, pick some good book from the local library and write few pages per week in interaction with the child, mostly following the child's interests. If there is no secrecy or at least some degree of complicity from the child, the game cannot work.  ""Genuine educational purposes"" might count as a ""hidden goal"" (?), what is important is that the parent behaves ethically and does not attempt to manipulate the child in any unethical manner. An example of the latter would be a parent trying to extort information from the child or exert psychological pressure on them: that would be very, very, very unethical.  How long would the ""deception"" last? It depends on the maturity of the child (weeks, I would say, perhaps few months, just the time to conquer the child, convince the child that the game is fun). The deception can be removed very easily and the game can continue with more awareness (and more fantasy/imagination on the side of the child who would try to attempt impersonating their own fictitious characters, great exercise).  By the way, yes, I confess I do believe that children have the right not to be deceived/misguided, at least to some extent that is not easy to define/quantify.  Also, Santa Claus is a false persona, and I can't see any educational value in it, it seems to me a triumph of conformism. Children can be distracted from falling teeth in many ways other than the Tooth Fairy tale. "
1819,9 month old with an imperative to sit,"I though it was just a phase, but it's been two or three weeks already and doesn't stop. My 9 month old has an imperative to sit. She absolutely has to sit. When put to bed, even if extremely sleepy, she will try to roll to her belly and push herself up to sit. When laid down again, she will sit again. The process will repeat until she is tired and sleepy enough to fall asleep when on her belly, still half trying to sit, but failing to.  Sometimes at night she wakes. And then she sits. After a few seconds she either starts complaining or falls asleep again. If she falls asleep - she is in some really weirdly bent positions (she once fell asleep with her head between her legs - she was sitting then she just laid her torso and head). I am fairly certain I once found her sleeping while sitting.  She also hardly lays when awake. She only does it when we give her something to eat, and we do it only to make her lay for a while.  Advice I could use is:   did your children behave the same way? can we somehow encourage more laying on her back or belly time? how to effectively lay her down to bed? is so much sitting (95% of awake time, 10-11h per day) safe for her spine?  "
1820,How to make my 5-year-old speak in first person when she speaks in second person?,"My 5-year-old daughter talks a lot. But when she does, it's in second person (i.e. the second person in the conversation), saying what she expects I would say when directed towards her. So she's not speaking in first person, but in first person from my perspective.  For example, she will say ""I will take you out to a bike ride this evening"" pointing to me, as she wants me to say that. What she means is ""Let's go on a bike ride,"" or ""Take me on a bike ride"".  Another example is when she wants to comment on the temperature of something. She will say, ""Is it hot?"" as though I am asking the question, when in reality she is trying to say, ""It is hot"".  It has been rather cute, so we kept going like this for the last couple of years. But she is growing up now and needs to talk normally in social settings.  How can I get her to speak in first person and also is this indicative of a larger problem? "
1821,Why do my 14-month-old twins cry whenever they drink milk or water?,"Whenever we try to feed any liquid to (both of) our 14-month-old twin girls, they cry. This includes milk, water or any kind of liquid. They don't use a bottle anymore, so we are using a spoon to feed them.   We have tried various positions like: putting them on their booster seats, making them sleep on our laps. No change; they cry. However, they don't cry when they are fed solids. Is this normal among babies? We are clueless how to control them.  Any suggestions? Should we visit some kind of doctor? "
1822,How do I tell my 14 year old niece that her mom is kicking her out?,"I'm a 30 year old guy, and I'm single, never had a real girlfriend to speak of. My sister's first born is in some trouble and she has decided that her daughter cannot live with her anymore (there's been some lying, stealing, running away from home, and, well, sexual activity). So it's either she lives with me (I'm not exactly a short drive away) or she gets sent to a foster home, or basically a prison for teenage girls.  I'm willing to do whatever it takes to keep that girl safe, as my family is very important to me and I especially adore her. I took her in as a visitor for the past month or so, and things have been fine so far, we get along great and I haven't had any problems.  As it turns out, her mom has basically told her nothing of the seriousness of the situation, that she is kicking her out. It's apparently up to me to tell her, or have her mother tell her, and I'm not sure what's the best (least bad?) way. I kind of get the feeling that they're not communicating very well, and that they tend to fight a lot, so I'm not sure if her mom should be the one to break this news, or if I should be the one. I'm sort of an easy going guy that tends not to get too worked up, I don't judge, it's all cool by me, I usually just coast through life in chill mode (even though it sometimes bites me in the ass when I get kinda lost).  In this case, I'm definitely kinda lost. I've never had a kid. I don't know how to raise one (I don't know if I can ever ""know"", is that something you pretty much just have to wing it?). I don't know how badly this is going to mess her up, if it will cause her to misbehave with me the way that she seems to with her mom. I guess there are so many questions that I ultimately have, but it starts with the big one first  How do I talk to a 14 year old girl about something important like that? How do I say ""your mom is kicking you out, you can either live with me or she's going to ship you off to some boarding school type deal""? "

My son has ADHD and is home trying to get disability, so they let me take the baby every week and he usally stays about 3 days.   I am trying everything that I didn't do with my kids. I want him to learn and bring it home. I do not think the boy's parents parent very good (I don't want to get into that can of worms). So maybe I over analyze everything because I am so afraid of him also having ADHD.  He gets excited and grabs and scratches people's faces hard. He also grunts all the time, enough to make his face red and then he laughs like it's a joke.   He does not say any words yet, is this his way of talking? Should I be worried? "

He's shy and dislikes conflict, when other boys get loud, he goes away to where it's quieter. Another boy accused him of having kicked him; he says he didn't do it. Now I don't know what exactly happened, of course, but from what I know about my nephew, I think it's extremely unlikely he kicked someone. The kindergarden teacher seems to agree.  However, the mother of the boy who accused him made a big deal out of a (in my eyes) small issue and demanded consequences, and the kindergarden teacher made my nephew apologize to the other boy. From what I was told, I'm getting the impression she just wanted to get the mother off her back and that was the path of least resistance and the simplest thing that would do it.  My nephew came home and told my sister he was told to apologize, and that he did, but he didn't know what for.  Now I don't want to get involved in this, but if my nephew was my son, I would have requested a talk with the kindergarden teacher and demanded an explanation.  Two kids who tell different stories about what happened in a small-scale fight (if you can call it that - I really doubt they actually got physical) seems like something that would happen all the time in kindergarden. I know it happens often enough with my own kids, at home. How would you expect the teacher to handle it, especially with one party's mother demanding consequences? And would you talk to the teacher about the forced apology, or let it go? "
1827,How should I deal with a 3 year old storming off and sulking over minor incidents,"I have three children, a five year old, a three year old and a 10 month old baby.  At the slightest thing, the three year old will get annoyed and storm off in a sulk. It could be anything from being told that he can't do something (such as take a hard toy onto the trampoline) or it could be something like his food is slightly too hot to eat. Sometimes there doesn't seem to be any particular reason, something will upset him, his face changes into a sulky face, then he will run off. He will often scream and slam doors on the way out. I guess you could describe it as kind of a tantrum but it's more like a sulk.  Other times it will manifest as a rebellious sulk in a public situation, like today in the park, he refused to slide down a big slide halfway down, for some reason - holding up the other children. I have no idea what was even the problem. I feel like in many situations he often chooses to not conform.  I've tried various ways of dealing with it:   I've tried, going to get him, being nice and carrying him back - he will just run off again. I've tried being playful, laughing and tickling him in the room he's stormed off into - but I think he quite likes this, now if I go into the room, he goes all giggly and silly in anticipation. But it doesn't really solve the problem. I've tried asking him what's wrong, he just ""growls"" at me and won't say anything. I've tried ignoring him completely. He will usually come back into the room, and maybe open and re-slam the door as if to make us notice him. This isn't always possible, e.g. in public he might be in danger if we let him walk off and we're not supervising properly. For the last two days the thing I'm trying is to bring him back and really trying to settle him by hugging/holding him very firmly, until he calms down - which does kind of seem to work, but he gets SO angry and exhibits more of a traditional tantrum in the meantime, and I'm having to hold him quite tightly. Even though it's not aggressive in any way and it's not done in anger it does feel like I'm using my size and strength to control him, and I'm not sure my wife would be able to do the same because he's very strong. The thing that usually always works is trying some kind of happy distraction, like for example once when he stormed off about not wanting the dinner I'd made, I made a face out of the vegetables, and he came back happily and ate it then. Or today I pointed out how much his runner bean that he's brought home from pre-school had grown. But it's not always possible to do something like this, or to think of or have the means or time to do something that will get his attention.   His vocabulary is pretty good, but when he goes into this mode he seems unable or unwilling to articulate what the problem is; instead he just goes into this silent sulk and won't say anything. He will sometimes explain afterwards what the problem was.  I really don't know what the best thing to do is. Should we ignore him completely or should I continue with the holding method to get him to calm down? Or should I even try to punish him, by putting him on the naughty step? I'm trying to not do the naughty step (positive punishment) at all now and only use positive reinforcement instead (a star chart).  Please help. "
1828,Good punishment for your kid using your credit card to buy things online without permission,What should you do if your kid uses your credit card without permission to buy things online?  What sort of actions would be appropriate to teach the kid or would you even punish your kid at all? 
1829,Kids and Cell Phones? What limits should be set along with giving the first phone?,"My nieces and nephew visited recently and I was floored that all three of the girls (including the eight year old) already have their own cell phones.  What really bowled me over was when we sat down to eat and all three girls and their mother were texting all through all our meals (except thanksgiving dinner thankfully ;-)).  My nephew had his DS at the table.  Even my six-year-old daughter Alice was taken aback enough to say something about it to me later.  It got me thinking about:  A. When do most kids get their first cell these days?  B. How do parents decide when their kids are responsible enough to have their own personal phone?  Both of these questions were answered on SE here;  There were varying opinions, but the general idea I liked most was that they should get the phone when they are paying for it (which also answers the responsibility question).  But that still left me with the question,  What limits should be set along with the first phone to help avoid having your own child exhibit such behavior? as well as other cell use behaviors that would be equally inappropriate. "
1830,How can I help my 9 year old son fall asleep and stop stuttering?,"My 9 year old son has always had a bedtime routine and has never had a problem falling asleep. However, during 3rd grade he began stuttering routinely and also began having problems falling asleep.   We did find out that he was being bullied by another boy (who happened to stutter).  His teacher did nothing to help with the bullying until I threatened to go to the principal (after 3 complaints). She also told him to save his tears for something really important. His teacher would reprimand my son if he raised his hand to ask a question when she was working with another reading group.   My son was in an advanced reading group which met once a week while two other groups met every single day. He was expected to ""figure it out"" instead of asking her a question about the work she required to be done by the next time they met. It was after he told me she hated him that I really noticed a change in his sleep patterns.   The stuttering began about three months after the start of school and by the third nine-week period he was no longer able to fall asleep per his usual schedule. Despite the change in his sleep pattern, my son was able to excel both academically and on standardized testing for which he was identified as AIG.   He is still stuttering, though we have been working on this ourselves as he has requested that I not take him to a doctor. I haven't been as concerned about the sleep pattern as I am a stay-at-home mom and it's summer break.    School starts in three weeks and I don't know what to do about getting him into a better sleep pattern. Often, 5 nights a week at least, I will find him awake at 1:00 a.m. He will then sleep until 11:30 or later in the morning.  I recognize that he still needs a certain amount of sleep. What can I do to get him back on the pattern he had before the bully and the bad teacher? I've heard about melatonin but am unsure as to whether I want to start giving my son a pill - even if it is safe. Has anyone had success with that?  I normally try to have him in bed with lights out at 9:00. He is allowed to play quietly and/or read until then. All screen time ends at or before 8:00 p.m. I just don't know what else to do to get him to fall asleep at a reasonable hour. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I would also be grateful for any recommendations regarding the stuttering. "
1831,planning babies in a quick succession?,What are the pros and cons of planning babies in a quick succession and then stopping it altogether. e.g: planing one baby per year and then stopping at number three.  Thus Is it a wise thing to get babies quickly without leaving much gaps? The reason I ask this is that the first year of the infant requires constant attention which means all time goes in the infant grooming which makes us to think to utilize this time for another pregnancy thus parallely saving precious time? 
1832,How can I teach my non-verbal child to let us know when he needs to go potty?,"So my 22 month old boy has been showing a lot of signs for potty training. He kept his diaper dry for a whole week at night. He can go 3 to 5 hours at school without a wet diaper, and he constainly would take his diaper off around the house if he peed in it. So last weekend we had a long weekend and decided to start the potty training process. I heard that going completely naked the first day and constantly bring him to the potty and showing him is the best method so that is what we did. He had many accidents on the floor and went about 11 times in the toilet. But day 2 and 3 were better. By day 2 at night we added in him wearing underwear and pull up for night and nap. Then the 4th day he goes to school. He refused to use the toilet at school and acts as if he is afraid of it. He only has about 2 accidents at school a day which isn't bad. But how do I get him to actually tell me when he needs to go, and not me or the teacher having to take him to the bathroom every 45 minutes to an hour? Teacher thinks I need to do pull ups first and then underwear do you think  I progressed him to fast to underwear, I just think pull ups prolong the process? Because he isn't communicating yet how can I teach him to tell us he needs to go?   Also because he doesn't go at school when we get home it takes about 1 hr to 2 hrs before he will actually go on the toilet at home but then he is great for the rest of the night. Just looking for some suggestions. Thank you!  "
1833,Teens concerned about impregnation through clothes,"How active are you online? How much do you browse the internet?  I was surprised to see that many teens ask the same question regarding what is called Dry Humping, which, in definition is:     dry humping is the process of two people repeatedly moving up and down and back and forth on top of each other fully clothed( or missing various pieces, but the penis must not come in contact with the vagina with out some sort of fabric seperating them ex: boxers,panties, or even sheets!!)   We all know that the basic rule for impregnation is that the sperm must come in contact with the egg, and even be able to fertilize it. While sperm can get through clothes, semen (but this is yet been proven or disproved) gets stuck, thus the sperm dies.  What is your opinion about this? If two people are on top of each other, fully clothed, and the male comes to ejaculation, is there any chance that pregnancy can happen, in the realistic look at it (and not some probability or statistical way)?   I would love to see the feedback of such a great community. "
1834,How to avoid association of child's room with time-outs?,"Sometimes we send our toddler son to his room, either to calm down or because he has misbehaved and we need some distance. Our aim is not primarily the punishment, but rather to have him calm down and/or get him out of our way. This works well and usually everything is fine 3-5 minutes later.  We don't have a ""naughty step"", ""naughty corner"" or whatever location is often mentioned in such time-out methods. He wouldn't stay there anyway, but staying in his room works fine.  Are we creating a negative link between ""time-outs"" and ""his room""? How can we avoid that? "
1835,When to buy first toy and what kind of toys have any sense for newborns? (if any),"We have a girl, currently 3 weeks old. When should we start thinking about any toys for her? Is there any sense for buying any toys for such a young baby? If so, what kind of toys would work best and for what reason?  I am aware that her senses and brain are not fully developed yet, still, I have no idea about newborn/infant toys so maybe I am missing something. "
1836,What's the best way to deal with bedwetting?,"Our toddler is bedwetting a lot, and we are unsure how to deal with things.  We haven't told her off for it, but we're not sure what we should be doing.  Would telling her off just make things worse?  If so, should we just wait for her to grow out of it? "
1837,"My 2.5 years old daughter says no to everything, all the time, again and again","I think somebody has already asked this kind of question, but my situation is a little different.  My 2.5-year-old daughter has been in an increasingly-more-difficult period of ""no"" for 6 long months now.  She says no to everything, and however I ask her, gently, angrily, explaining the goals, etc. it does not work. I have to ask her almost 20 times to put on her shoes, to dress up, to brush her teeth, etc.  Sometimes she does things when asked, but a strategy that works the first time may cause a tantrum the next time, with cries and screams.  What is new now is that she agrees to do something at first, but then refuses, as a kind of test, I guess. For example, she asks to have a banana, and I ask her if she is sure. She says yes, I peel it, and then she doesn't even take a bite.  I (try to) keep calm and explain to her why I want her to put on her shoes, for example, but I always end up raising my voice at the end, and asking 1000 times a day is exhausting...  Aside from that, she can be very good. I think she is a little above average for her age: she speaks very well, is not overactive, goes to sleep well, and eats very well too.  My wife has been pregnant for 3 months, and our daughter has now been aware of the pregnancy for 1 month. She seems to act out more since this announcement, but she takes care of the future baby and plays mother a lot with her stuffed animals.  She has been potty trained for 1.5 months and sleeps in a bed without a barrier (which she asked to have removed), so she is making efforts to grow and learn.  I don't know what else to do. When she is being difficult, I tell she is ""offside"" (I got that from a Montessori book), and putt her in a room until she becomes calm again. She might cry for 5 minutes at most, but it still happens again and again.  Of course, I don't spank her.  Do you have an idea of what I can do?  Can somebody please explain to me why she acts like this? Is it normal behavior? "
1838,Is nipple confusion a real thing?,"Our baby daughter is breast-fed, but sometimes it would be convenient to supplement with a bottle of formula (mostly so that the mother can sleep a little longer while dad takes care of it).  We keep hearing/reading of the danger of ""nipple confusion"": that she will then no longer wish to breast feed as she will prefer the bottle.  Personally, I feel a bit doubtful that this could be a big problem. I tried googling for reputable literature on this, but could not really find any scientific studies on whether this is a real effect.  Is nipple confusion real? Can a bottle feeding once or twice a week trigger it?  "
1839,At what age can children learn a non native language through television/podcasts?,"Child is currently 2 years 2 months old. I speak only in English with the child and the child understands it. I read the story books in English and the child understands them.  English is not the native language and I am the only source of English for the child.  Considering: meta.ell.stackexchange.com     Be careful―children don't generally learn language from television, and allowing more than a couple hours a day of television has been shown to slow language development. Children under 2 years old shouldn't be shown television at all. They need real human beings to learn languages.   and linuxquestions.org       A child of that age is a sponge for languages, and can learn more than one at a time. But they key is that the child is looking at a person who is speaking the language to him or her, and listening to it being spoken.      ""A video"" is not the same thing. A very young child doesn't associate a picture on a flat device with being a person. S/He doesn't associate that with ""speech.""   People are different, communities are different but the claim is same.   Are there any studies about whether children learn the spoken language from the television/podcasts or not?     Considering that a reputable website like BBC has special section for learning English through podcasts, my question is: - From what age children start learning the spoken language from the television/podcasts? "
1840,Are there any studies about whether learning to read in two languages is slower?,"I don't know the details of any studies, but I think the general consensus these days is that bringing up children multilingual from the start is a positive thing to do, even if it can slightly delay their initial development.  As our oldest is starting to learn to read at school, I wondered if anyone knows if there are any studies about learning to read in two languages? Specifically: is there a difference in the conclusions for reading compared to talking?  (The two languages in this case are French &amp; English). "
1841,How do I figure out which infant formula is the healthiest?,"With so many formulas out there, I am not sure which is the healthiest. Are there any studies that show which formulas are the best? OR what to look for in formula? Are there things that are unhealthy in formula that I should keep my eye out for?  == EDIT ==  Just to clarify, im not looking for specific formulas. Im looking for what makes formulas healthy. For example ""X formula contains Y and Y has been shown to be better than Z which most other formulas have""  I hope that helps... "
1842,How do you train an infant or young toddler to swim?,"I recently saw a video on Facebook (see it here on YouTube) that involved a young boy, approximately 18 months old, that literally dived into a pool, was fully submerged for at least 7 seconds, and kicked/swam his way to the surface of the water. At this point, he spends another 2 full minutes on his back, staying afloat and keeping his face out of the water. (A parent was in the pool, off-camera, the whole time. This was an educational/informational video.)  It also appeared to me that while the child was underwater he was covering his nose and/or mouth with one of his hands, and so returned to the surface using only his legs and one arm to swim.  I'd heard of babies being train to keep there heads afloat, and I know there's a reflex that causes them to hold there breaths when submerged. But, I'd never been under the impression that diving (practically head first!) was part of that training?  What are the safe techniques used to train such a young child in that way? What type of background or certifications should you look for in an infant swim instruct to achieve this? How much in-the-water time does it take to teach young ones this particular skill?  Here are some stills from the video, which illustrate the type of techniques I'm asking about:   "
1843,How do we help our toddler to sleep through the night?,"My 14-month old daughter is no longer breastfeeding, and sleeps happily in her bed, although it is still in our room. But she wakes up around three times at night, and as far as we can determine it's because she is hungry. A bottle of milk formula is a necessity to get her to sleep again.  We tried getting her used to not eating by making the formula slowly weaker, but that just means she wakes up quicker after each bottle. We do try as hard as we can to make her eat as much as possible during the daytime (especially just before going to bed), and she seems to eat a reasonable amount of food during the day, so now I'm at a loss at going forward.  Ideas? Anyone who has had similar experiences and was able to solve it? "
1844,When should a small child get out of the oral fascination?,"Our boy is a few months away from his 4th birthday... but he still puts darn near everything in his mouth. We are constantly talking to him about what should and should not go in his mouth, only food and your toothbrush... not toys, not sticks, not random junk you picked up off the floor, not napkins, etc. But it seems to just go in one ear and out the other. Even though he's told me he understands, and has sat there and told me ""not in mouth"" for various things, he still does it.   He's well past teething; they're all in. (Our dentist has even taken an x-ray to confirm that in the front since he's only got 3 front incisors.)  It does not appear to be hunger related. He routinely eats a good breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack and dinner. There doesn't seem to be a difference between days that he eats at day care and days that he eats with us; they report that he usually eats his whole meal, sometimes asking for more... pretty much the same thing we see. On several occasions when he's been seen chewing on toys, he has had the partial remains of a meal sitting on the table that he walked away from saying he was done.  When should we start to get worried? Any other suggestions for helping him stop this? (Aside from the choking concerns, the cleanliness/disease issues, and the various bad things that could happen to his GI tract if he swallowed something he shouldn't... there's some concern about what he's doing to his teeth... daycare just called and informed us he's had a piece of random blue pastic stuck between his front teeth for a while before they managed to get it out.) "
1845,"How much time, energy, and money should an adult child give to struggling parents?","I've got a friend who is asking me for some advice. He does very well. He is 26, owns a house, and has a really good technology career.  However, his dad spent four years trying to find work and ultimately landed a job in the same city as him. His parents and younger brother temporarily moved in with him, although that is never a single guy's dream. The parents tried to sell their house but the escrow devastatingly fell apart the day before closing. Long story short, the buyer made them spend thousands of dollars in minor repairs only to walk away because he could not fund.  It has been nearly three months since they moved in. He lent his parents thousands of dollars to help them with the repairs hoping it would expedite the sale and get everyone to move out. He also flew home three times to help stage the house, then move everything out, and then move everything back in.   His parents, brother, and their dog are all invading his lifestyle. They are short a car so he has to taxi people as well as deal with the clutter and mess of a crowded house.  He is about to lose his mind and says he feels trapped. He says none of this is his problem, although his parents gave everything to pay for his private school tuition growing up. But he did not anticipate helping his parents would turn into a bottomless pit sucking his time, money, energy, and social life.  Finally a cash offer came in for the house. His parents are now looking for a home as escrow nears closing. He is frustrated again because his parents want him to help move a fourth time, but he feels he has done everything he can and just wants his time back. He also is frustrated that his area is the only affordable one, and his parents may move only blocks away. He wants distance and a healthy single life, and worked hard to get distance from his family's drama and chaos. Ironically, his success, resources, and stability has made him the go-to person for every family problem. He'd like to start a family of his own, but his parents and brother are always following him for help.  What can he do as the only stable person with resources in his family, which he is now saying is a curse more than a blessing? Should he go and help them move or has he done enough? Should he be concerned about his parents moving close to him because that is the only area they can afford?  What boundaries need to be established? "
1846,What do we do if our children don't like the nanny?,"So I just came back to work after a long discussion with our 4-year-old. He complains (more to the effect, he had a meltdown) that he doesn't like our nanny, and would prefer to have our neighbour watch after him instead. It's not like she's behaving inappropriately or abusing him in any way, he just doesn't like her as much as the neighbour. He, on the other hand, generally behaves poorly with temper tantrums, bad manners, and throwing things at her (not constantly, just once a day or thereabouts, and she disciplines him appropriately).  To be honest, we've had better daycare providers in the past, but my wife says the problem isn't with her, it's with our son, and he'll get over it eventually. She has prior experience as a full-time nanny, and we both like her (in fact, she's a friend of ours), and we don't really have too much of a problem with the way she cares for the kids. It seems to just come down to a personality conflict. Our second son is only 14 months old, but he goes into a fit every time we leave him with her as well.   What do we do in this situation? Look for another daycare provider, or stick it out and hope things just get better somehow? "
1847,"What's a good age for a ""penny skateboard""?","My two kids, ages 4 and 6, are reasonably active and coordinated. In general, what is a good age to get children started playing on a skateboard (such as a ""penny board"", a cheap and small skateboard)? Or, if there are parents here who have young kids on skateboards, at what age did they start? "
1848,A three week old baby refuses to sleep in his crib,"We have a 3 week  old sweet baby boy. We got used that for the first few months there is very little order in his feeding/sleep time, but during night time, he wakes up to eat (my wife's breastfeeding him), after food time he sleeps very well if he is on a nice and comfortable pillow (the pillow on my knees).   But if we put him in his crib after 2 minutes he is crying and wants to eat again. Almost like something is bothering him on the crib, we tried to put him on the pillow in the crib and he slept well. But the problem is when he sleeps on the crib mattress.   Did anyone experience something like that? How can we make him sleep in his crib? Would love some advice. "
1849,Do newborns recognize their own cry?,"I wonder if a newborn can recognize his/her own cry.  Yesterday I did a little ""experiment"" with my four weeks old daughter:  I recorded her cry for a while. Once she was relaxed again, I reproduced it next to her so she could hear it. I did this a couple of times on different moments. Surprisingly, in most of the cases she started to feel a bit anxious and, eventually, started crying again. Stopping the audio relaxed her again within seconds.  So I wonder: why did this happen? Is the recognizing her own cry or is the sound itself that alters her? "
1850,Why would a primary-schooler want to kill himself?,"My nine year old nephew told his (single) mother tonight that he wants to kill himself. What would prompt that?  backstory:  His father is ... upstate ... for a little while longer, and they do have regular face time with him, as often as they may. He and his mother at times get a little heated with each other, but by and large they get along well. I'm generally the closest thing he has to a positive male role model, but I don't get to see him near as often as would probably be best for him. He's going to spend some time with my wife tomorrow (that was already planned before this evening).  He doesn't have a history of that sort of attitude in general, and altho he's had a few bouts of anger in the past, by and large he's a pretty well adjusted little kid. He's incredibly gifted for his age, compared to his peers.  I don't know what was going on between them tonight, I just heard from her what he said, and she didn't want to talk about it too much, he was probably in the same room. I'm sure I'll see him at lunchtime tomorrow.  Do nine year olds ever talk like that as a way of pushing their boundaries?     Update  So I had the chance to sit down with him and ask him why he said that, which was probably the wrong way to approach it, but never-the-less, what his own admission was after-the-fact was that he was pretty well just doing it for attention. We then had a short chat about how that's about the worst possible way to get attention, and we discussed the story of the boy who cried wolf, again, and I re-affirmed with him that if he ever felt like that, he could always talk to me about it.  There was some other conversation about kids and bullying tactics (name calling, picking on, general young boy activities) and so ... yeah.  Life goes on. "
1851,"Help me understand the attraction of Instagram, please","(Context in case it's helpful: My son is 12.  He created an Instagram account for himself at school this past year.  Since he doesn't meet the Instagram age requirement (13 and up), I tried to follow the help instructions on instagram to delete the account.  The account seems to have limited functionality, but still be in existence.  When I try to choose ""Manage Apps,"" it says ""You have not authorized any applications to access your Instagram account.""  He can't visit Instagram on his account on our home computer due to not having a smart phone and the internet safety rules set up on his account.)  I think I understand most of the things my son is interested in doing on the web, but not Instagram.  I don't know what teenagers typically do with Instagram.  Question A: if a group of pre-teens are active on instagram, and my son doesn't have an account, what will he be missing?  I need the specifics, please.  Question B: Any tips for helping prevent instagram from becoming a huge time sink for him over the next few years?  I already know about the general things (providing plenty of wholesome non-computer activities, using internet filtering and time controls, putting the family computer in a high-traffic part of the house) -- I'm looking for tips specific to Instagram.  I plan to post this question on Web Apps as well.  If you can respond to the parenting aspects, please do, and don't worry if you can't give me the full picture. "
1852,How important is stability / change / lack of change for children?,"I frequently see people around the web supporting various arguments with the following statement:      ""children need stability.""     Is there any evidence for this, and more importantly can there be such a thing as too much stability? Is there any evidence that lack of change leaves children unprepared for/unable to deal with small changes?   An example of a child reacting poorly to change:   When a friend of mine was six years old her mother changed the plate over the light switch in the bathroom, the six year old girl was so upset about this change that she hid under the sink in the kitchen and refused to come out. To this day she gets very stressed during periods of change. Could this be genetic?  I realize I've just asked many questions, but they are all aspects of one:  How important is stability for children? "
1853,When are my kids old enough to mow the lawn?,"I'm sure this largely has to do with personality (well behaved, cautious) as it does age, but what is an appropriate age for kids to start using a push lawn mower? Or a riding mower? "
1854,Do mild facial scars (from fingernail scratches) on a young child fade?,"I have a 4-year-old whose younger sibling scratched her on the face, leaving a minor ""gouge"" mark. It's been a couple of months since the incident, but the mark is still visible; the edges are very slightly raised and the mark is coloured (but has faded).  My guess is that being so young the mark will fade as she grows, but is it worth getting the mark cosmetically treated now, so the whole thing can heal as she grows?  By ""treated"" I'm thinking dermabrasion or laser or something similar (zero research done).  Has anyone else been in this situation? Were you happy with your decision? How did things turn out? "
1855,potty training 3 days method - 22 months old - daycare problems,"We started potty training (22 month-old boy) about a week ago using a variation of the 3 day potty training method.  He was ok at home: 5 days diaper free, about 1-2 accidents a day. Usually I ask him if he needs to go potty and then he sometimes agrees and may go again in a couple of minutes, because he likes it. He's diaper free at naps and cries hard when I put diapers on him for a bedtime.  So it's not going badly at home, but in daycare he refuses to cooperate.   The problem is that after he had 2 accidents in daycare, they decided to put a diaper on him and continue the training with a diaper. Also, their strategy (to put him on the potty every 30 min) apparently doesn't work for him. He sometimes cries when they try to put him there and lately he has stopped peeing in a potty.  Is it going to work? Should I insist and ask daycare to change their strategy? (not sure if that's possible)  Or should I just accept him being in diapers in the daycare until he moves to the next room - that's in 2 months?  P.S At home we constantly observe him, and notice when he signs or says that he needs to go potty. I'm not sure that at daycare they pay very much attention to him (10 kids in a room, 2 teachers)...  thank you "
1856,What to do about 13-month-old who cries and whines all the time?,"My 13-month-old daughter was very well behaved up until about 11.5 months. I guess it's separation anxiety but I've come to a point where I don't know what to do. It's making me miserable, exhausted, and, to be honest, resentful. I am also 16 weeks pregnant which is why I further need help in not allowing her to equate crying 24-7 equals getting whatever she wants. Or is she still too young to understand this?  She pretty much won't even let me use the bathroom without a fuss/whine/cry. About two weeks ago my family started noticing her change also. It took me by surprise that my then perfectly behaved baby has become this needy, clingy toddler without much warning. Like she started off only doing it to and around me, and not so much around my parents or my aunt when they babysit her for 1.5-3 hours.  She's started becoming more vocal to my parents recently, but even then it's not as bad as how she cries hysterically for like an hour or more when it's just us. I don't know if she's throwing a tantrum and I need to/should ignore her or if she's still too young and just wants my attention?  I'm honestly scared to death of it getting worse rather than progressively better by the time #2 arrives. This is my dilemma otherwise I'd spoil her and not blink because it would only be her to deal with, but it's not. I need more than just ""it's just a phase. It'll pass..."" so if you have specific examples, that'd be great.  "
1857,17 Year Old Moving Out or Staying Home?,"I'm 17 years old, progressing through High School and a local ATC.  I have had some typical ""Grr teenager"" problems in the past that I really think I've moved past. I don't get into big fights with my parents, although I do have heated conversations with them from time to time.  While my parents insist otherwise, I feel the only option post-high school will be to move out, get a car/utilize public transit and finish out my ATC schooling before moving on to a college. They have said in the past I am welcome to continue living with them, but here's the problem: we don't see eye to eye on some key points.  This is mostly due to me having different religious views than my parents, and the way that they raised me. They're very disappointed, and as much as it hurts to see that, I get that part of being an adult is doing things regardless of social pressures.  So where is this all leading to? you might ask. Well, I feel if I stay at home, I will still be treated like a child, for example, I would still be expected to arrive home before curfew. This is an example and I'm trying not to be specific.  The obvious con to moving out is it will cost me. Nobody else is going to be paying for me in the future, but is it worth it to really be the person I am? Right now, I'm going through the motions and living as a ""character"" if you will: something my parents are ok with that won't get me severely punished, etc.  Thoughts and advice? "
1858,"What benefits does using ""baby talk"" provide, and how do you maximize those benefits?","When I was doing my initial language development research about 7 years ago, I vaguely remember seeing several (probably non-scientific or blog sources) recommend against using ""baby talk"", arguing that modeling proper pronunciation would help teach by keeping a consistent end goal for the child's language development.  However, this answer indicates that opinion is divided, and this comment on the same answer indicates that there is research supporting the value of baby talk with babies.  So what is the benefit?  How does baby talk help?  At what point can/should baby talk be left to move on to ""regular talk"" full time?    Please provide links to studies or research papers documenting how the benefit was quantified, and the methodologies used, if at all possible. "
1859,What is an effective dating policy for a 12-year-old boy?,"This is similar but not identical to When is it safe to start letting our children go into relationships?  My 12-year-old son is precocious in terms of height and puberty, but emotionally he is out of kilter with his physical development, i.e. he is in many ways quite emotionally immature for his age.  He has a healthy interest in girls, although he doesn't have much of an idea how to go from fantasy to reality yet. But a  female friend of his from school has been calling their play dates ""dates."" The truth is that when we pick her up and take them to the swimming pool, or whatever, they just yak about stuff, go down the water slide again and again -- to us it looks like a normal play date.  He told me they were ""dating"", and had the idea I should drive them around, pay for movies and so on, and make myself persona non grata because he thought (realized) people go on ""dates"" without their parents. So far I've been able to steer through a very narrow navigable channel, but I'd like to establish a dating policy (which I didn't need to do when my other son was this age, because he was slow to mature and a bit socially awkward).  I told him, ""It's too soon for 'dating' but 'play dates' are fine; and every day is too often for talking to her on the phone.""  (He has OCD and tends to want to phone friends compulsively.) But he wants to know when he can 'date' and I don't know what to say.  The closest I've been able to come to articulating a dating policy is to laugh a bit and say, If we're driving you guys around, that's a play date, not a date!   What is an effective dating policy for a 12yo boy, in terms of what age he may start, and any constraints he should have for the next few years? "
1860,My children witnessed family violence. How should I handle it?,"Yesterday my sister-in-law unleashed a torrent of verbal abuse during a family gathering, which culminated in her pinning her sister to the floor and punching her, and when I asked her to leave, a loud and angry stand-off ensued, with she and I both swearing at each other, culminating in her hitting me and leaving.    My 5- and 2-year old children witnessed the whole thing (as well as her kids).  So when my 5-year old asked me ""why was Eloise sitting on top of Giovanna?"", I wasn't quite sure what to respond.  I told him ""Eloise went a bit crazy"", and it wasn't nice, she shouldn't have done it, and so on.  But I don't know if that was the best way to handle it.    Should I raise it again with him pro-actively?  If not, and he raises it again, what should I do?  To clarify, Eloise and Giovanna are adults, and sisters of my wife. "
1861,Safe ways to support slumping 14-month-old in bike trailer?,"I have a small-for-his-age 14-month-old who loves the bike trailer and sleeps blissfully in it, or just watches the scenery. So long as I'm pushing it like a pram, and he has no helmet on.  When the helmet goes on he tugs and twists it until it's over his face then gets enraged. He can be distracted after putting it on and gets used to it. Until he's put in the bike trailer.  The helmet pushes his head forward and down when he leans back. He hates that, so he always twists off to the side, slumps over, and lands up wedged in a corner, angry and uncomfortable. Putting something behind him helps a lot, but he still tends to slip over (straps aren't really small enough, etc.) and get uncomfortable.  I just discovered that if I wedge him in with panniers on each side he's comfortable as anything, and in fact he promptly went to sleep. I'm not too comfortable doing that regularly though, and it's awkward.  So. Any advice on a good way to support a small child in a bike trailer, so they don't easily slip over? He quite likes it when he's supported, but I don't want to use pillows etc. when I can't easily monitor him.  What do others use? If anything? "
1862,When should parents stop changing clothes in front of children?,"Baby is 2 years 2 months old.  What will happen if we don't stop and at what age should we stop? Why?  From: What to Expect The Toddler Years (Arlene Eisenberg, ‎Heidi Murkoff, ‎Sandee Hathaway - 2009)     Even if a child doesn't show any such interest, family nudity could become a problem by age three, when it's believed that some children unconsciously become sexually stimulated by parental nudity, and are confused and embarrassed by these feelings. So it's probably wise to start donning bathrobes and segregating showers by your toddler's third birthday. You can explain such a change by saying, 'Now that you're older, you need to have some privacy, and so do I.'  "
1863,"Is it bad being a ""bad influence"" for my younger cousin?","First some background information: I am a young woman in my early 20s, I lived alone since I was 18 relatively far away from home.  I graduated top of my class and I am studying and working in IT. (side note: I am not financially dependent on my family) My cousin is 14 (almost 15) and he visits a higher school where he struggles to keep passing. No one in his close family graduated Germany’s most difficult school (in Germany there are 3 levels of difficulty to choose from), but they want him to study hard to make it.  I am emotionally close to him and his grandmother, but no one else in his family.  Now the story starts!  My first cousin once removed and I used to play together when we were younger and I still lived with my parents. His family used to visit mine around 2-3 times a year. I was always like a bigger sister to him.   Naturally when I moved out he still wanted to meet me. His mother allowed it, and he also was allowed to go by train by himself. It is around a 5h trip. He visited around once a year. He is really mature for his age and I was able to take him around the city show him places, go to fancy restaurants and play videogames in the evening. He could also eat chocolate and chips and drink Coke as much as he wanted. (he is doing different kind of sports 4 times a week and is a naturally skinny child; he also eats healthy the rest of the time).  We also discuss his future plans, I help him with bigger school projects (also via Skype when he is at home) because his parents can't. I am always there for him if he needs academic, emotional or any other kind of advice.   Now that he got older and went through puberty his mother keeps saying that he wants to be like me when he grows up and that I am being a horrible influence. She blames ALL the negative side effects of puberty on me, even though he sees me 2 days a year and her 363 days a year. We do message each other every other month. Also she doesn't forbid him to visit me but she talks bad about those visits in front of my family. I was always the black sheep in my family because I chose a ""male career path"" but I never cared what they thought.  Sadly, now I care. Because I care for my cousin. I personally believe that having a weekend of fun once a year can't possibly harm him, and that his mother is just looking for someone to blame instead of blaming her way of raising him. At home he isn't allowed to drink or eat any sweets. He is only allowed to see friends if he passed all his classes with good grades. So that hasn't happenend in a long time. Video games are completly forbidden.  Now his father games a lot, he has been unemployed for a few years and played games almost the whole day. He even brags about doing so on social media.  His father smokes a pack a day and recently my cousin told me he sometimes steals a few cigarettes and smokes them. I explained how harmful they are and that I wouldn't want him to smoke so he stopped. (At least that is what he told me)  I have the feeling his bad habits come from his dad or are just naturally because of his age.    Am I being a bad influence? Should I restrict my contact to him? Can I help him or his mother in any way? If yes, how? Even if I am being a ""bad influence"", is it harmful for his development?   I do not have any children on my own but I am a godmother of one (2) and have 1 niece (7) and 3 nephews (1,4 and 9) which I spend lots of time with.  I know it is not the same as raising the kids but being in a parenting like role is nothing new to me.   tl;dr: Is gaming and eating junk food with an almost 15 year old once a year harming his development?   UPDATE:  Thanks Francine DeGrood Taylor and other great answers, I did find a way of dealing with this situation. I did feel confident that I am a good part of his life after your answers and I just asked him first if he feels that way. What he replied was really close to what the accepted answer also described. I was overwhelmed by the maturity of our talk and the deepness of his thoughts.  However I also found a time to talk to his mother in person and she did promise me to stop spreading any kind of information about me. Here a big thanks to Shauna! It really helped me seeing the role of a mother who wants the best for her child even though his mother was bad at showing so.   Even though the whole thing wasn't ""only"" a big understanding and there are still some kind of hard feelings on both sides, we (his mother and I) now do communicate more and I try to do some more things she also approves of.   To answer my own questions:    Am I being a bad influence?    No, I am not. Even his mother agreed after our talk.   Should I restrict my contact to him?   No, I actually do have more contact with him and his family now.    Can I help him or his mother in any way? If yes, how? Even if I am being    a ""bad influence"", is    it harmful for his development?   Yes, I am now a part of his weekly school routine as a compromise, I get to continue with ""spoiling"" him, but also help him catch up with his school (even though I still think he shouldn't be there, I understand now that it is not my decision to make, so I am making the best out of it).  No it is not harmful to his development, see the accepted answer. "
1864,Does the Montessori method allow a child to choose the same lesson every day without guidance?,"My 7-year-old daughter goes to a Montessori school. For at least 3 months now, she has been choosing the same lesson every day. There have been new lessons given by the teacher, but it seems the level of interaction between the two is non-existent otherwise.   Montessori says it is child led, but there is no clear answer on at what point the teacher needs to drive the learning path to continue forward momentum. I want to understand the philosophy better for my parent teacher meeting in two weeks. I am going to discuss it either way, I know the response I get is ""Montessori is child led"", but I still believe there needs to be an adult in the room and I cannot find confirmation that at some point the teacher should guide her to try new challenges.  I know the program is child led, but does the teacher have a responsibility to guide her to something else? I am concerned that the teachers are just passing the buck to a 7-year-old. Is the Montessori method that hands off that she is free to do the same lesson everyday without guidance? "
1865,How to help a toddler go to sleep on their own?,"Our toddler is 2 and half, and has just started to become difficult at bedtimes.  We have always given her milk and held her until she goes to sleep. Once she goes off, she usually sleeps very well. However the last 2-3 weeks she no longer wants the milk, and no longer wants to go to sleep. As she is used to being held to go to sleep, if we put her straight into bed she goes mad; shouts, cries and quite quickly makes herself sick. We have never once got her to go to sleep like this. At the moment we are persevering with holding her, despite the struggle to go and play in the sitting room. Eventually she will go to sleep after an hour or two. However it seems like now might be the time to get her (and us) into a better sleeping routine/habit.   I know we have probably made a rod for our own back, by not tackling this sooner (in terms of helping her go to sleep on her own), but what would be the best way to transition?  She is still in her cot bed (which turns in to a bed once we lower the sides). Would it be better to turn it into a bed at the same time as getting her to go to sleep by herself? Or could this be worse?  Any other suggestions or ideas on how best to help our daughter go to sleep in her bed, rather than being held? "
1866,When is the best time in a child's development to move to a different area?,"We're thinking of switching to a different region at some point in the future. We're not sure when would be best with regards to our child's education and development needs? Would it be best to move when they're younger (kindergarden/grade school) and haven't had a chance to make a lot of friends, or when they're older and might be able to better rationally understand and cope with the move? "
1867,Are there adverse effects on a baby to see their parent talking to a toy?,"I have a small cuddly bear from very young and have had it for over 20 years. I have it on my pillow every night and talk to it just like I do to a pet cat. I have a very close bond to it and can't imagine living without it.  My wife thinks this is borderline mental disorder. She asked me to make binary choice of the bear or her early in our marriage, which led to a massive fight. Finally she was OK to live with it.   Recently we had a daughter. Now wife thinks my behaviour to the cuddly bear will make our daughter a psycho since it will make the baby believe cuddly bears talk back. So she demands I put it away.  My question is: are there any adverse mental effects on a baby to see their parent talking/cuddling to a toy repeatedly? Does it matter that I'm male? Would it matter if we had had a son? "
1868,Crying during bed-time routine?,"First time parents. We are sleep training our four month old daughter using CIO (full extinction), out of necessity as both of us need to work during the day. We started about 2 weeks ago, and so far it's going well: first night she cried for 23 minutes, fusses for 15 mins then falls asleep. And that was the longest cry. Now it's stabilized around 10 mins of moderate, on and off crying, followed by 10 mins of quiet fussing, before falling asleep. And she does not wake up crying during the night, except for 1-2 night feedings. Overall good improvement from before CIO.  But, 3 days ago something different started happening: she would start fussing and crying DURING her bed-time routine, in which her mom or I read her a picture book then swaddle her. It's not full crying, but a single cry here or there during reading. And she has a very serious and tense look. It's as of she knows she's about to be put in the crib in a dark room soon. Once put to the crib, everything is still as usual: she cries on and off for 10 mins, fusses quietly for 10 mins, then falls asleep, like clockwork.  She's otherwise fine: wakes up in the morning not crying, naps 4 times a day for 1-1.5 hrs each, smiles when played with, etc. While we both work, my in-laws are caring for her during the day and they didn't report any abnormal crying during the day.  Should I be concerned ? Is she developing negative association with sleep? Is she dreading sleep every night and knows it before being put to crib? "
1869,What if my parents get a divorce?,"I’m a 14 year old girl, and I was wondering what I should do if my parents want a divorce?  My parents (50 and 55) have been married for over 20 years. But I’ve noticed some things in the past year or two that put me on edge. Like they’d fight about the smallest things, like “Did you do this yet?” or something along the lines, then they’d fight back and forth because they misunderstood each other (this could be due to the fact that my moms second language is English). This happens every other week or so. Especially when our family goes on vacations, they fight even more.  My dad is more of a guy who plans things way ahead and gets upset and angry if things don’t go exactly his way. My mom is a little more flexible. Though, she just blames people for problems she created a lot of the time.  They both have a narcissistic parenting style. They never really gave my brother or I emotional support, but instead give us financial support, and so they ignore any mental illnesses that I tell them I have, no matter how much I explain. I know this, because about a year ago, our family went out to dinner. My brother told us that he’s depressed because we live in such a rainy place. My dad got angry, and threatened to leave the family. My mom made me swoop in, and fix everything. What if I had told him that I was actually depressed, would he have divorced my mother?  And ever so recently, my brother (16) has been playing video games, and his grades have been dropping. We aren’t supposed to play video games on the weekdays in the first place. My mom and dad have been arguing what to do with him. My mom told me my brother is going to be the reason they divorced. All of 3 of my dads siblings have gotten a divorce, so the signs are not well.  Another problem is, my mom is a stay at home mom, and didn’t finish college so if they divorce, it’s be hard for her to get a job. Because I do not plan on staying with my dad, despite him being the money maker. We disagree on things religiously and politically.  Sorry this is pretty long, any tips on what I should do? Thank you. "
1870,"3-year-old says they need to go, then don't go","My three year old daughter has routinely needed to use the toilet once at the beginning of bed time routine, and again at the end of the routine. However, she's started to say she needs to go at the end of the routine without actually producing anything. This has started happening at nap time too.  I don't want to discourage this kid; she basically trained herself starting almost a year ago, and has had nearly zero accidents... If she's little, and still figuring out the signals, and sometimes thinks she has to go but doesn't, then that's that, and we just have her go when she says she needs to. But the timing and lack of production are getting suspicious, and she's started the normal 3 year old developmental stage of manipulation...   Anyone else encounter this? Do we have her sit (for a timed amount) every time she says she needs to go? Or do we have her try, and not let her interrupt her quiet time to try again later? With the risk she'll go in her pull-up? "
1871,How to address with a child that a deceased actress appears in an upcoming movie?,"My 7-year-old daughter is a big Star Wars fan and has loved Princess Leia through all of the movies she has appeared in.    In discussing it with her, she already knows that the woman who played Princess Leia died recently. But I'm concerned that she is still not old enough to really grasp death (having never really dealt with a death in the family yet). She seems to grasp the concept of death at some level in some discussions we have had. But we are worried that Carrie Fisher's future appearance in Star Wars Episode VIII 11 months from now is going to confuse her.  Is there anything I should do to help address this with her preemptively, or is this something I should just wait for her to ask questions? And if I should address it with her, is there any specific method I should follow? "
1872,Is (supervised) play time alone beneficial for an infant/toddler?,"My son (currently 8 months old) is quite content to sit by himself and play with toys (blocks, toy cars, etc.).  We make sure that he spends time interacting with other children, and we also make sure that we spend one-on-one (and two-on-one) time playing with him, reading to him, singing, etc., and he clearly enjoys those activities.  However, he seems equally content to be on his own.  My assumption has been that play time without interacting with other people would help him develop some independence, and hopefully help teach him not to be bored when no one is actively entertaining him.  However, I don't really have any research, or even experience, to back this assumption up.  Is there benefit to him spending time playing solo?  Is there a certain amount of time he should spend playing by himself each day (or a limit to how much time he spends playing by himself)?  Does this change according to developmental stages? "
1873,How to encourage 9 year old to stop whining and independently practice their math?,"I live with my 9 year old cousin who dislikes and has been doing poorly in math. (New Canadian education system likes to have ""no homework"" because apparently this will be good and reduce stress in kids, but math like other skills requires practice)   He has written on an assignment answering what he wants to be (a scientist) while also declaring that he hates math.  He seems to think he knows the material (the grades beg to differ, especially at this level when there shouldn't be part marks), and claims he knows the technique but just makes mistakes. (Really at the elementary school level it's about both and the results for basic addition,subtraction, division and multiplication will be foundational moving forwards.)  How can one encourage him to stop whining about it and just grind it out to get better? He's getting additional practice now (as would be necessary to improve his grades) however how can one promote autonomy and try to get him to stop dragging his feet about it all the time?  Edit: 9 year old's parents were already on board with getting the kid more math practice. I was looking for any way to help make the kid less whiny about it to reduce what I perceive to be friction being generated in the household. (eg kid is whining, additionally kid won't independently practice meaning a parent gets stuck babysitting and whatnot)  "
1874,What is the optimal way to store and use pumped breast milk?,"What's an optimal strategy for storing pumped breast milk for using feeding ""emergencies"" (mom needs to leave the house for a few hours)? Ideally it would be FIFO but it seems like a waste to dump milk off the end of the queue every day. Obviously we could just feed a bottle to him once a day but my wife wants to minimize bottle time.  Another strategy would be to pump once a week or more as needed but that doesn't allow for much depth in the queue.  I feel like what we really want is to freeze a lot of milk, but without microwaving I imagine that it would take a long time to warm up the milk.  What would be a good strategy? Or am I over-thinking this problem? "
1875,Are second-hand shoes safe to wear?,"Are hand-me-down and second-hand shoes safe to wear? For adults &mdash; and especially for children. Kids' feet are always growing.  When the proper precautions are taken, are second-hand shoes safe? Or are they too likely to transmit athlete's foot (tinea pedis) and/or harm the feet of the wearer? "
1876,Are cloth diapers really more environmentally minded than disposables?,"Yes. disposables are made of plastic that often winds up filling landfills (or worse-yet) floating in bits in the ocean, but what about all the harsh cleaning fluids used in cleaning the diapers by diaper laundering companies?  The dioxins alone can't be great for our water resources!  In terms of waste during production vs. waste during production and maintenance is there really a significant difference?  Has anyone seen any non-biased (or at least less-biased) research showing one or the other to actually be a better choice environmentally? "
1877,"Should an infant, awake and happy in the middle of the night, be helped back to sleep?","We've had a pretty good sleep routine with my three month old recently. She wakes to eat and, occasionally needs gentle rocking back to sleep.  This week she started something new. After having slept for a few ""feeding cycles"" she will wake up, and happily babble and giggle in her crib, alone.  Last night she did this for just over an hour before we went in and rocked her to sleep. Once I picked her up, she was fast asleep in a few short minutes (and soundly for another 3 hours).  She wasn't fussing or crying, but she was wide awake and playing when she would ""normally"" be asleep.  Should we ""help"" her get back to sleep? Or should we let her stay awake by herself until she cries out? "
1878,What is the best way to potty train a little boy?,"I was trying to find out the best way to potty train our son, since I know boys sometimes have a harder time learning than girls. I was thinking of just teaching him to sit when he is ready to start to try, and then later teach him how to stand when he could control himself better. Is this a good idea and could it help him? Or could this make it harder for him later? "
1879,When to allow children to consume sugar/candy/sweets/junk?,"We have so far not allowed our toddler (20-months) any foods that contain sugar (chocolate, cake, sweets, sweetened juice, etc.) on the premise that consuming sugar is not needed and only causes trouble for the parents, in terms of risks of making the child a picky eater, trouble at mealtime caused by sweets in between meals, and health concerns like tooth decay. This also means that we politely turn down any sweets offered to the child by third parties. (It's amazing how rudely insistent strangers (e.g. waitresses) can be!)  We do allow normal healthy foods that taste sweet, like fruits and teas, but no fruit juices and no deliberately sweetened foods.   Obviously we can't keep our son sugarless forever, and don't aim to anyway. So my question is this: Until what age does it make sense to avoid sugar? Why?  Also, what strategies are effective to postpone the introduction of sugars?   Come to think of it, one could ask almost the exact same question about spices. They're not unhealthy of course, but they're only needed for taste and therefore carry the same potential of causing a picky eater. "

I'm not a big fan of social networks so I think blog is a good way to do this, not only with my family but with anyone that could help.  Now I need to go for a CMS and I really don't know what to choose between Wordpress, Joomla, Drupal, etc.  I'm looking for something easy and looking nice (skins). Any idea? "
1882,Why do babies like to be bounced?,"For a large amount of the time if our baby is crying I can stick her on my shoulder or my knee and bounce or rock her (gently), and she will calm down.  Why does this work?  She gets bounced a lot when she is with me. One thing I thought recently is maybe it makes her quiet because she gets scared (similar to the effect a fairground ride has) - which would not be good..   Am I doing her development any harm, perhaps by overstimulating her or suppressing some natural urge? "
1883,Do I need infant cloth diaper covers with a cut-out for the umbilical cord?,We are in the process of purchasing our first round of cloth diapers for our soon to be born son.  We are planning to go with prefolds and covers and I have noticed that some of the companies sell covers with a cut out for the umbilical cord.  Are these needed or just helpful? Can you just fold down normal infant covers untill the cord falls off? If they are needed can they be used even after the cord falls off?  Thanks.  
1884,How can I encourage my three-year-old to have a bath?,"Every bathtime it's the same story:     Me: ""It's bathtime now.""      Son: ""I don't want a bath""      Me: ""You need a bath to make you clean. You don't want to be dirty do you?""      Son: ""I don't need a bath""      Me: ""Why don't you choose a toy to take up to your bath with you.""      Son: ""NO! I WANT TO PLAY HERE! I DON'T WANT A BATH !!""       (...until finally he is carried to the bathroom kicking and screaming. And, of course, after a   few minutes he's enjoying himself so much he doesn't want to get out.)   My wife and I always give him plenty of warning. We've tried getting him new and exciting bath toys. We've tried letting him bring his favourite (non-electrical) toys up to the bath with him. But every time, it's the same story.   Does anyone have any suggestions of things to try?  "
1885,Should I keep hairy pets when my wife is going to give birth?,"cats, hamsters. Should I still keep them when my wife is going to give birth?   My concern is about whether the hair from my hairy pets affect my wife and the baby in term of allergy (The hair might attract dust)? "
1886,When should we  allow children to experience spices in food?,"Based on this question, I think it would be interesting to hear opinions on use of spices in foods for toddlers.   When we prepare meals, we add the seasoning/spices fairly late. This allows us to prepare some of the not-yet-seasoned food and prepare it for our toddler. We will then add spices to the rest of the food and finish cooking. I think the baby food we make is too bland for my (adult) taste, but then again the baby food you can buy in small jars is bland too. One reason is that small children should not consume too much salt. Another reason is that the child should have an honest chance to learn what the individual parts actually taste like: vegetables, potatoes, meats, all have distinct tastes that would be somewhat camouflaged behind seasoning. I'm sure my wife can think of a few more reasons.  So just like the sugar question, this begs the question: When to introduce spices/seasonings into a toddler's diet? Why then?  I'm not deliberately taking any extreme stance; I am not asking why allow children to experience spices. I do believe that children have a right to experience spices at some point, just as much as they ought to learn the foods' individual tastes. But when? And why then? "
1887,When should I start to be concerned about stammering or stuttering?,"My 27 month old son started talking fairly early, and is very enthusiastic about it.  He talks constantly.  However, he does stammer a lot, and stutters on some words.    Most commonly, he'll have trouble starting a sentence.  E.g. ""I... I... I want to go look out the window"".  I have been operating under the assumption that this is because he's still getting used to the physical act of speaking, and still developing the muscles and reflexes needed (much like he still has trouble with the letter 's'.  However, at what point should I start worrying?  Is there a particular age range where this should start to disappear on its own? "
1888,Are cloth diapers really supposed to fit a newborn?,"We decided to go with a diaper service before our son was born but when we brought him home the diapers seems way to large for him. He was small, but not insanely small (6 lbs 10 oz). Only the Newborn sized disposable diapers seemed to fit. And what was strange was that most stores don't seem to sell Newborn sized diapers, they almost all seem to sell only size 1 and up.  Am I wrong is thinking that my son really isn't exceptionally tiny? At what weight are ""newborn"" cloth diapers supposed to fit? "
1889,"When changing diapers, how soon should we put the new diaper on?","Are we supposed to put the new diaper on immediately or give our newborn some diaper-free time? His skin under the diaper is slightly moist when changing it, should we give him some time to air out? If so, how much? And what are the negative consequences of just putting a new diaper back on him? "
1890,"How to stop preschooler from taking toiletries from the bathroom to ""play with""?","Our 4-year old has (finally) potty-trained and is starting to use the bathroom on his own.    Recently though, unless we're constantly paying close attention every time he goes, he's started taking things like toothpaste/shampoo/soaps from the bathroom and treating them as toys (or art supplies) to play with, resulting in them getting all over the walls/carpets/furniture.  We've tried explaining that these things are ""not toys"", though it's a difficult thing to explain since he gets to play with soaps and stuff when he's having a bath.  Only parts of it seems to be getting through - after realizing he'd been in the bathroom for a while (he'd run off to go potty), we discovered he had stripped down to sit in the bathtub to play with the shampoo.  What other strategies are there to discourage this type of behaviour? Is this a normal thing? "
1891,"When is the best time to pump breastmilk, and for  how long should I pump?","I have a baby who's just a few weeks old. I try to pump bottles occasionally, so that my baby will be used to the bottle, and also so that I have some mobility if it's really necessary. I'm having a difficult time deciding when to pump, though. I've found that the best time to pump, really, is right after I skipped a feeding (by giving a bottle). This is not always possible, though. Otherwise, I usually pump about a half-hour or so after a feeding, as I'm afraid to pump too close to the next one; I don't always get very much this way, though. When is the optimum time to pump?  Also, I've been pumping for about 10 minutes at a time, 5 min each side. Is this recommended? Does pumping longer mean I'll express more, or once my milk slows down/stops am I not likely to get any more? What's the average time I should spend on a pumping session? "
1892,Are there any reputable studies on spanking?,"Is there any scientific evidence that non-harmful spanking does or does not exist? Furthermore, is it ever effective (whether or not it is harmful)? "
1893,What should I look for in a new car (automobile)?,"I have a 6 months baby and planning my family to grow for at least one, maybe two new members in the following years. My current car (a C-segment) broke down recently, and I'm looking for a new one.  From the (short) experience I have, I know several things I missed in the old car: more space in the rear seats to fit comfortably an adult and 1 or 2 car-seats, a bigger boot/trunk (the baby pram/stroller's + carrycot/portacrib® simply occupied all of it).  After my baby was born I got surprised of the many things we needed which I didn't expect to be useful before becoming a parent. I'd like to avoid that lack of knowledge before getting the new car. What will I (probably) need in a car for the following 5 or 10 years? What is your experience?  I know this question is highly localization biased, as legal and social requirements for having childens in a car are not the same at (e.g.) Democratic Republic of Congo as in Luxembourg. I live in Europe, but (I expect) answers should also work in other similar areas. "
1894,My wild 3.5-year-old - have I missed out on the key years of relationship-building and discipline?,"I have a 3.5-year-old son. He's bright and energetic, but I'm worried about his behavior, since it seems out of control.  He was walking at 7 months.  His language has always been good - he knew his alphabet in song by 1 or so, and all his animals - hundreds.  He has great abilities to rationalize, comprehend a story, and a good imagination and level of intelligence.   The problem is that he can't sit still.  He still has this urge to run, to shout, to disobey and to throw tantrums and cry and the most preposterous events.  Every day is a struggle.  We put him in a Nursery at 11 months when I went back to work, and it was OK at first.  But then the biting began.  And he was always so busy, unlike other children who could be still, he was always on the move.    Going to restaurants was out of the question.    We took to the odd spanking when his behavior goes really out of control.      Recently, he got kicked out of his pre-kindergarten nursery at 3.5.  Granted these people were humourless and failed to celebrate his character, but is it me?  What can I do to make him listen, to focus, to behave?  Will he grow out of it?  I'm terrified he'll get kicked out of his next school.    Bottom line: is it too late for us to correct his out of control behavior?  What's the best strategy to get started? "
1895,What is the least problematic age difference between siblings?,"We have one young toddler daughter and are pondering when (and if) she should have a younger sibling -- and  what age difference might work best for both of them.   For many (most) parents, what works for them is a major factor, but I have gone to a huge effort to prepare such that I'm ready to make whatever sacrifices I need to do what's best for my kids. I don't mind broadening the answers, but this question is specifically about the kid's angle.  There's a huge amount of soft ""opiniony"" discussion of this stuff in various media, but I'm more interested in whether people know of any really scientifically solid research that you think is useful to know (for example, data on stuff like 'success', not personality profiles); and what specific personal experiences people have that illustrate difficulties (the less obvious/cliché the better) of certain age differences.   (In our case, they will probably be primarily homeschooled... that probably changes some things, but the responses do not have to be limited to our situation.)   Do you have any siblings? Or children? What are the age differences? Can you reflect on any specific problems in your experience that an empathic parent might want to take into account? "
1896,How do we make our toddler less afraid of robots?,"I'm sure the headline made you curious? :-) But I'm serious, and I am not referring to toys but actual household machines. We have a Roomba floor vacuum cleaner and a lawn mower.   My 20-month son is afraid of these machines, even when they're parked and turned off. He will back away from them and start to whine. I've told him, and shown him, that the machines are harmless and not evil, but that didn't convince him.  He is not afraid of kitchen machines that are much more noisy. He's also (mostly) not afraid of the regular vacuum cleaner and the regular electric lawn mower that we also use, nor of other machines or cars, mopeds, bikes, etc. even if they are noisy. But he is afraid of the power drill. And terrified of mascots operated by a person inside (as in Disneyland).  Do you have experience with similar situations? What can be the cause? What helped?  Note: Just to be clear, I'm well aware that any lawnmower can be very dangerous, and we make absolutely sure that there is no way for the lawnmower to get near our son. But he can still see it.  I'm including some marketing photos so you can see what size the robots are:     "
1897,My 4yo son is addicted to cartoons. Do I need to forcefully control his watching habits or should I let him watch?,"My son is almost 4yo, too much addicted to cartoons, in fact he started repeating the accent and copying attitudes as well.  Is it common behaviour in pre school kids?  Do I need to forcefully control his watching habits or should I let him watch?   This may be a silly question to ask but might be faced by many of us.   Please help me in identifying problems in this, please let me know if I am worrying too much; TV, mobile phones and internet are all available to him at home. I am sure this must not be a new problem, I just need to know what should be my right behaviour on this, if someone had cracked this puzzle share your thoughts.  He is a single child at home, this may be the reason he is so attracted towards cartoons.  He hardly sits in one place, he continuously runs from one place to another. It's only television which keep him in one place for hours, sometimes both my partner and I allow him to watch TV just to avoid the running around.  I grew up in an age where we could barely watch TV or cartoons but these days I am not sure how to control it as so many options are available.  Thanks. "
1898,What safety gate can I use at the top of my stairs?,"I have two staircases in my home. On one side is a metal spindle that is square in shape, probably 1.5"" on each edge. The other side is the wall (drywall).  I've been doing research online only for now; I haven't had time to venture to a Baby's 'R Us to look in person. Does anyone know what my options are or which baby gate is the ""best"" for this setup? My 11 month old has a playroom at the top of the stairs and it's always tense when she suddenly takes off toward the stairs and my wife &amp; I rush to get between her and the first step.  Any recommendations? "
1899,Till what age will an infant keep waking to nurse each 3 hours?,I have twin boys who are 6 weeks old. They breastfeed each 3 hours as an average. However this is making me tired especially during the night. Till what age will they keep waking each 3 hours? Is there anything I could do to make them sleep longer durations during nights? 
1900,"Mindfulness Meditation for 6 year old with ADHD, ASD","I have a 6 year old boy with somewhat severe ADHD.  He also has been diagnosed as being on the Autistic spectrum at a low level ( my sense is that the ASD symptoms are primarily driven by the ADHD ).  I would like to practice meditation with him.  I already practice mindfulness meditation myself, and I'd like to support my son in doing this as well.  I have some general questions - they are all tied together, so answering one may answer several:   Is this an age appropriate goal? Any recommendations on structure, such as duration, method, ""rules"" / rigidness? Any recommendations on teaching, either as techniques or resources for more info?   I'd prefer not to use the ""before bed"" method  as we already read every night and that structure works really well.  I've had some success doing this with him already, but only sporadically, and never for longer than 5 minutes.  Also if your answer is from your own experiences, I'd be interested in hearing any success stories ( if only briefly ). "
1901,"How can we discipline a strong-willed, misbehaving 5 year-old?","My 5 year old son receives and fears punishment but repeatedly exhibits the same unacceptable behaviors.  He's always been strong-willed, and is usually the kind to view a statement like ""Don't do that"" as an open invitation to do it.  We've tried redirection or distraction tactics, but he is still so narrowly focused on doing the original behavior.  Even worse, he will typically do the prohibited behavior and flagrantly tell us or show us that he's done it.  Repeatedly, even after punishment.  (He's in time out right now for this very thing).  He's consistently punished, yet he continues down the same self-destructive path each time.  When he is punished, we explain what he did wrong, why he's being punished, and why he shouldn't do what he was told not to do.  Sometimes he'll even tell us first why he's in trouble, so it makes me wonder if he's acting out for the inevitable negative attention he gets.  I think he gets plenty of love and positive attention- he's an only child and stays with a relative during the day.  We're trying to give him a good, fun childhood, but we need to figure out how to effectively discipline him.    His repeated misbehavior includes:   Yelling at the top of his lungs in public (stores, friends' houses, etc) Running away from us (at parks, stores, parking lots, etc) Talking back and disrespecting authority figures Hurting animals even after we explain why it's wrong Repetitive nuisance behaviors (repeating himself, banging his fists, kicking walls, intentionally crumbling food on floors, etc) Repeatedly asking us why he can't do something even after it's been explained to him Basically, most bad behaviors that young children may do, but repeated over and over again, even after discipline   He gets a warning to stop the behavior, then depending on the severity of what he's done (and where we are), he'll either go to time out or lose a privilege (such as taking away a favorite movie or missing out on an activity).  Going to time outs and losing privileges really upset him, but still do not ultimately deter him from the bad behavior.  It's like he can't help himself.  My spouse and I are getting worn down.  We try to model good behavior and encourage him to be well-mannered and respectful.  This behavior mortifies us.  It seems we can't even enjoy life as a family because our son is so disruptive and unresponsive.  Most public outings have to be cut short or eliminated because he consistently misbehaves and doesn't respond to our discipline.  After he's misbehaved, when we try to have heart-to-heart talks with him about his behavior and why we expect him to mind us, he usually has a little trouble expressing himself, and a lot of times we get the same nonsensical responses from him (Us: Why did you do [bad behavior]?  Him: Because I didn't want to).  He also doesn't like to make eye contact.  We don't usually feel like we've gotten through to him.  Is there another discipline tactic we could try?  Or does it sound like we need to see a professional at this point?  We're at a loss, and don't want things to spiral further out of control as he gets older (and even begins school).  We just want him to understand that his behavior isn't always acceptable.  Thanks for reading.  Update (from comments below): My spouse and I disagree on spanking, as we had different experiences with it. He feels it's necessary sometimes. Since our son failed to improve after time outs and taking away items/privileges, I grew to agree with him and we used it for select bad behaviors. It didn't work any better. However, when he was spanked, he was always told why. I didn't mention that we have used it because I was afraid it would distract from the original question, but since it has already come up [in comments], yes, it has been explored, but with no better results than our other tactics. "
1902,Poop-training and cleaning up,"My three year old is 100% pee trained, even at night, but as with many little guys is not poop trained.  We started him in underwear, partly because preschool encouraged it and partly because he pee trained better - and we hoped poop would come faster.  Nope.  He's now in full resistance mode, ie, mommy sees him squatting, takes him into potty, he screams and stops pooping and then goes right afterwards in his underwear.  (Yes, we know this wasn't the right thing to do.)  We're considering, as part of the process, asking him to clean up his own underwear when he has an accident.  What are the benefits and/or downsides of such a process?  How much should we expect him to clean up?   I saw in this question that 'first rinse' was recommended by some, but didn't see any explanation in the linked article what that entailed or why that was a good idea. Would that include him pulling down his pants/underwear, or is this more something we'd do for him and then say 'okay, rinse it in the sink now'? "
1903,How should we prepare for a parent-teacher consultation in preschool?,"Our very first parent-teacher consultation for our pre-schooler (almost three years old) is coming up. Because of that I'd like to bring some more attention to this question: How to maximise the usefulness of parent teacher consultations?  which had until now only one answer (albeit an excellent one from HedgeMage), but I would like to make it also more specific about preschool.  In our experience communication between teachers and parents in (this) preschool is quite different from daycare. It's not impossible to have contact with the teacher during the schoolyear but it takes more effort then at our daycare where we regularly had an informal conversation about our child with the caregivers. Altough we have the impression she is doing ok, this lack of communication makes us a bit unsure about what our child does at school, how she behaves and if she feels well. In a way we expect to get more insight in how she is doing. Altough we have some small comments on how things are going I have no reason at all to distrust the school or the teacher. Still I have some irrational ""first child paranoia"" and I would like to gain some trust in the school.  I know I can not expect to change all this with this one consultation but still I want to take as much out of it as possible.  Which information should the teacher give us?  What questions should we ask to make sure our child is feeling well at school and is getting the education (as far as education goes at preschool) she needs?  Which questions illuminated things for you, about the time your child spends at school, or exposed aspects of your child you did not know of? "
1904,No BM control; what does this mean for training?,"My daughter is 2 years, 7 months old, and we started potty-training her two months ago. She's gotten to the point where she's great at peeing - not only no accidents, but all-around promptness, awareness and control - but has no control at all over bowel movements. This might actually be a full-blown regression, since she used to sometimes make them on the potty, but in the past couple of weeks she never does. Also, her BM timing is extremely unreliable - she seems to need to go at vastly different times from day to day.  I'm not seeing any obvious problem. She's generally cheerful and likes going to the potty; she doesn't seem anxious about it (though sometimes she is not shy about not wanting to go :P). We're always encouraging and we try to avoid any sense of pressure. A lot of the online advice I've found says the likeliest culprits are stool consistency, and discomfort on the potty, but I'm not seeing any signs of either of those. Possibly she isn't ready yet, and we've simply started too early. It's very hard to say.  This being the case, and assuming we don't see drastic improvement quite soon - how should we continue with her training? We've heard a lot of advice frowning on returning to diapers, and that seems like it would undermine all the progress we've made over the past couple of months. On the other hand, I don't know that it's good for her to be ""missing"" all the time - all the cleanups, ""boring"" time waiting on the potty, a sense of failure, getting asked if she needs to go... I'm worried that if this builds up over time, it might stress her out.  What options should we consider? Tough it out? Take a break? Or is there some middle-way compromise, something we can do to take the pressure off of pooping without going back to diapers? "
1905,At what age should parent of opposite sex stop taking their children to changing room?,"Say it's a public changing room of a swimming pool. From what age should a father stop bringing his daughter into males room with him? (Is it different for mother-son?)  I know it's probably very culturally dependent, so please say where you are. I live in the UK btw. On the other hand, is there any law regarding this (in any part of the world)? "
1906,How to teach tact and empathic understanding based communication to an INTJ (overly honest) child?,"My daughter is in her early 20's. She has proven to be ""overly honest"" time and again. She has pretty much remained at an even level since around 10 years old, though, in terms of this issue. While this personality trait has been a joy in many regards and has allowed extremely high levels of trust and even a loving relationship that I think would not be possible otherwise, it has caused a lot of social pain within and without the family.    It has just now become something that I feel like I must address as it is causing a lot of relationship issues that reach outside of our personal sphere of influence. She has expressed her desire to change if she could understand what to change and feels that no one has been able to explain to her, with enough precision, the problem so that she can actually pursue a change and still feels others should be the ones doing the changing.  The tendency to think that she's always right is compounded by the fact that she very nearly is always correct.  This then has caused her to approach things in a slightly less than socially acceptable way, especially with those who are (perhaps overly) sensitive.  Usually she is cognizant enough to not be outright mean, but tone has been her particular downfall.  It is easily perceived by the recipient of her suggestions that she is harsh, angry, uncaring, insensitive, or otherwise harbors negative will in her (generally accurate) assessment.  While this amazingly insightful input well surpasses her years and personal experiences, it has gotten to the point where correctness and insight no longer matter since it is breaking down and poisoning relationships both within and without of the family.  I wanted to get a little more foundation on my approach to the situation, so I suggested that she take a personality test.  I was little surprised when she came back with an INTJ personality (even though women of this personality type are especially rare, forming just 0.8% of the population).  Interestingly she was about at a 1 on the T aspect and so she could have nearly fallen into the F category there and thus is quite balanced between these two aspects in her personality.  I had a very lengthy (elevated) dialogue recently with her wherein we reached quite the impasse.  The only thing that I could suggest for her was to try to build an allegorical comparison of how her communication is more like a person who is standing in front of someone and shouting at them to ""look over there at this thing!"" vs standing beside the person with her arm around them while saying, ""look over there at that thing.""  I tried to explain that it is not about changing her message, but rather to simply change the way the message is conveyed and / or its frame of reference.    Unfortunately she expects (more than several) other people in our family, and out of our family, to try to change to match her communicative needs vs attempting to understand how to modify her own output and, possibly, expectations.  I fear that this is about to cause an overwhelming emotional explosion or implosion for her.  Our debate ended with my suggesting that she read ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" by Dale Carnegie.  This was countered with a severe questioning of how a book can change the situation and cause others to change their minds and negative reactionary response to her input to them.  I could only really tell her that it will do so by helping her to understand other people's communicative wants / needs on a different level that will help her to change her approach.  This was not very palatable for her and she has little to no confidence that this can help.  What suggestions (especially in the realm of self help) might you have regarding dealing with such a particular situation in terms of helping a loved one, like this, to understand their own personal need to change in order to effectively participate in familial and societal relationships?  I am, obviously, particularly interested in actionable material that would help one to change their personal frame of reference and help them to understand how to properly frame their output for others.  Are there any other books or training material (video, audio, etc.) that you think could help that go above and beyond Dale Carnegie's book?  I am desperate to help her to move through this and I know that if she can simply discover the solution herself by consuming proper information and insight (vs my trying to ram it down her throat), she'll be absolutely one of the most remarkable people with whom to associate for others.

1907,Are there things to watch out for after a tongue-tie operation?,"My son is going in for a Tongue Tie clip, basically to do a small snip under his tongue to free it up, he fed well when he was young so it never came up until our dentist noticed it with his teeth and the school speech pathologist mentioned that he is having some trouble speaking.  So we decided to do this, since it's a short outpatient procedure, but is there anything that we should look for in this post op wise?  Most of what I have seen and read is that there should be nothing major, and considering he was in for another outpatient surgery last year and was up and about in a day I'm not too concerned about recovery.  I figure we should make him comfy, maybe give him some quiet time and let him watch a movie until he feels better, but with mouth surgery I don't know what would be best to do.  Watching for foods with acidic content or maybe too salty is on my mind, but I don't have a lot of experience with mouth surgeries.  Anyone gone through this recently who might have some advice? "
1908,Throwing parties for teenagers,"Are there any overarching guides, strategies, or ""best practices"" in throwing birthday parties for teenagers?  This is something that I will have to do soon, and I have a few concerns:   Their friends procuring alcohol somewhere and bringing it to the party, thus making their potentially irresponsible drinking my problem.  Same as the above, but with drugs? To be clear, I don't believe that my kids have this problem, but I can't be 100% certain about their friends. Not having my house wrecked (a la the stereotype parties depicted in teenager movies where there are a bunch of kids going crazy). How do I ensure that someone isn't showing up uninvited? Generally speaking guaranteeing safety: some of these kids are old enough to get into trouble, occasionally there are stories in the newspapers about horrible things that happened to some teenager at a party. I want to make sure that none of that happens on my watch.   Can anyone offer any advice or things to look out for? I have a decent amount of faith in my kids to self-manage things to an extent, but the above still has me worried. When I was their age, my parents adopted a very hands-off attitude, which just happened to work out fine, but I'm not sure that that is the best way to go. "
1909,Is cryopreservation of sperm worth it for non-emergency “personal backup” purpose?,"Last year I went to the cryogenic sperm bank and I got a few ampules of my sperm frozen. I did this for the reason that if I die anytime in the near future, and since I do not currently have offsprings/children/cubs, so if I die, my parents or girlfriend can use my frozen sperm to make my child.  I basically feel a little bit safer now because even if I die, I still have that small chance of still having kids in the future because my sperm is still alive.  Anyway, it costs about [tex]360 so it saves some money if I buy a whole year (or more years, it would cost even less).  I am wondering if I am throwing my money away, and is this even worth the money?  Does frozen sperm go ""stale"" over time (like soda) and what does this mean for my case?  Any advice/recommendations appreciated.  I am wondering if I should just cancel the service, or pay for a year to get the discount. "
1910,What type of pillow is best for a pre schooler?,"My four years old daughter asked for a pillow - something we didn't really think about until she asked.  Can't see any reason to deny her request of course but question is, what is the best type of pillow for children this age? Should we avoid certain types or look for specific type? (e.g. soft, synthetic , etc) "
1911,My 4.5-year-old son has no dominant hand,"We never really knew if my son was left or right-handed. He can use any most of the time. A doctor said that sometimes it takes longer time to know which hand is dominant, so we never paid attention although we thought he was left-handed.  Anyway, the school provides a little notebook to exchange information about kids with parents which must be available in my son's schoolbag. The first day his teacher put the following note:     He is left-handed   A few days later, another note:     It seems that I was wrong, he is right handed.   Last week, she wrote the following:     Can you please confirm if he is left or right-handed.   He only learned how to write 1, 2, 3 and A, B, C... He does not really write well yet, but when we ask him to write 1, 2, 3, he will use any of his hands. We tried not to tell him which hand to use and the result is bad writing regardless of the hand he uses.  So, is this normal at his age (4.5 years)? Do kids take longer time to decide which hand is dominant? Is it a sign of some serious thing, and I should be worried? So far he is an amazing kid, he speaks two languages (my wife and I are from different countries) and he can understand a third language. What makes us more worried is that his little brother who is two years old, and we already know he is right-handed. "
1912,How to encourage our guest's kids to clean up the room from toys before leaving?,"We have our relatives kids at our house somewhat frequently, and we have a lot of toys here for the kids to play with. Sometimes they are here for over a night or two.  But when the kids are about to leave, there comes this nasty job of putting the toys back in their original places, and it seems almost impossible task to do.  How can I encourage the kids to enjoy that work and feel good after the room has been cleaned? The kids are around 3-7 years old.  I have read this: How can I get my 4 year old to clean up toys without a battle? but it's not quite the situation we have, since the kids are our guests.  PS. My mother tongue isn't english. "
1913,How are pregnancy ultrasounds administered?,I was wondering if hospitals let you take pictures of any ultrasound home? Also if so how large or small are they-what are the sizes of the prints? ? 
1914,Teaching manners to a toddler,"I have a 19mo daughter who spends ~30hrs/week with a nanny. She ""teaches"" her to say ""please"" by forcing her to say it and withholding a wanted item until she does. And forces a ""thank you"" afterward. I feel like this does less teaching and more just creating a mimic. I feel like manners is best taught by modeling, but I recognize this is a very passive method.   Is there a more interactive way to teach politeness and manners without forcing it?  EDIT: What about saying you're sorry? I'm a firm believer that forcing a child to say they are sorry after hitting another kid or taking a toy or whatever just won't work in teaching them to feel true remorse for their actions. "
1915,12 y/o daughter gives one-word answers to every question,"My 12 y/o daughter used to be very open. A great communicator. Very warm and gregarious.  A few months ago (right around the time her body started changing) she gradually started changing her pattern. Now she only speaks in one-word (or one-sentence) answers to direct questions. ""Yes."" ""No."" And her favorite / most common: ""I don't know."" Even to questions she clearly knows the answer to.  Example #1  Question: ""How are you feeling today?"" Answer: ""I don't know.""   She doesn't seem ""rude."" Or angry. Just not interested in communicating.  The reason I added the facts that this all started around the time her body started changing and that is was gradual is because it seems to me to be a natural adolescent / pre-teen behavior pattern. (And not the result of some ""event."")  Example #2  Today, I explained to her that it's difficult to have a conversation with her when she only gives one-word answers. Then I paused to give her space to respond. After a long silence, she said, ""Oh, so now you're going to stop talking to me!?"" After explaining to her what just happened, and still getting no conversation, I finally ended by giving up and just saying, ""Okay, sweetie. Thank you. Have a nice day. I love you."" I try to always keep everything positive.  My question is...  Question     What approach can I use to get her to talk to me in something other than one-word or single-sentence answers to direct questions?   Also: How hard should I try to have a conversation when I get the results described in Example #2? Should I just let everything ""work itself out?"" And wait until she wants to talk? Or otherwise outgrows this phase? Or should I press harder? Or try something altogether different? Like go to a movie or something? "
1916,Going hiking with an infant - how to prepare?,"We are going on a vacation with our 9 month old. As we love hiking, we have decided to try to hike with our little one. We chose mountains with rather easy paths and at most 1000 meters above sea level.  We would like to be as prepared as possible. We have decent experience hiking on our own, but it's the first time we're going with our child.  What things should we take, consider, prepare before the vacation and before each trip?  some useful hints can be found in What should we pack when going camping with an infant? but that question is about entirely different destination "
1917,"Teaching a toddler to say ""sorry"" and mean it","What's the best way to teach a child to say ""sorry"" and mean it without just creating a mimic? I don't truly believe that simply forcing a child to say they are sorry for hitting another kid or taking a toy is going to teach them how to have true remorse for their actions and make corrections to their behavior. For context, my daughter is 19mo. Is it possible at her age? When is a good age to expect they are cognitively able to understand this concept? "
1918,"As an adult, how to react when parents try to micromanage","I’m 26 and have a turbulent relationship with both my parents (who are now separated). For example, my dad was just helping me move some boxes and my bike with his car. Parts of it were nice, he bought me a couple slices of pizza and we talked. Parts were not so nice, he got really mad and accused me of not having my things ready.  When we arrived at my home I took the bike off the car and went to lock it up. My dad got really mad and told me not to waste time locking my bike and come help him carry more things. I asked why he was mad and he said he shouldn’t be the one lifting my boxes while I locked up my bike. My home is shared with lots of people and I think I was in the better position to decide to lock the bike right away, and I think my dad was out of line telling me what to do (anyway, it takes just 2 minutes to wrap a lock around the bike). Then we went inside the house and I took off my boots. My dad got mad at me for taking my boots off, as he thought I had forgotten to bring in some boxes that were sitting right at the door. So I kicked him out. He asked if he could use the bathroom and I said no (though I do feel bad about it), and I locked the door behind him. Did I do the right thing? I’m not sure what other options I had? I find it very disrespectful of him to talk to me this way, especially in front of the people I live with. In general I find both my parents extremely bossy and don’t know how to react to it.  The reasons I kicked him out were a) I didn't like the way he was talking to me b) I wanted to teach him a lesson so he wouldn't do it again. c) I wanted to make clear he was in my place and he's a guest there and had to follow my rules, not the other way around.  I know when someone does you a favor, it’s nice to help them back, but you do reserve the right not to. I definitely feel bad about kicking him out, and have thought of apologizing, but then I realize I probably did the right thing.  "
1919,How to react to my 9-year-old excessively pouting and trying to get away?,"My son is 9 years old. I would describe him as emotionally immature for his age.   He gets upset easier than other kids and tends to pout when he is especially upset about not getting his way. I do not cater to this or comfort him, but I do sometimes get mad. I realize that pouting will go away on its own if it gets ignored (something I'm working on). But what really gets to me is when he tries to create physical distance.   Here's an example - We're sitting at a parade and he and his sister get into an argument. I tell him to stop what he's doing and then out comes the lip and the smooshed up eyebrows. I could handle ignoring that if that's all that it was. But he has to take it further by moving his chair far away from everyone, despite me telling him to leave his chair where it is. He also accomplishes this distance gain by walking at snail pace and dragging his feet, and sometimes even crawling on the floor, again super slow.   Do I treat this all the same and ignore it altogether? What do I do when he's about to make me late, etc. because I have to wait for him to slowly crawl to the door, slowly put his shoes on, and finally stand up to leave? It drives me MAD! "
1920,What devices should toddlers be allowed to use?,"There has been some work on the use of technology by toddlers (for example, this paper). By and large, there are some advantages to the use of some of these technologies by children. For example, even two-year-old children started collaborating more and working in concert even when they were using their personal iPads (see link above). But there are other disadvantages that might arise through technology use such as access to violence (source).    What kind of devices do/did you allow your toddlers to use? If a toddler wants to use an iPad that the parents own, how were they allowed to use the iPad? Are there any apps that would be interesting/useful for them when using such technology? "
1921,Effects on children and parents of marriage breaking up,"Me and my wife have a two year old son and he is amazing and I love him wholeheartedly.  Unfortunately the relationship between my wife and I has frayed to the point where I no longer see a good outcome. Some of the issues are old, before him, and have been brought back up because of added responsibility and my unforgiving work schedule.  I cannot imagine not seeing or hugging my son regularly, when I am away for work he always asks about me and misses me.   Also I am worried about the effects his mom and I splitting will have on him.   But I am worried that if we do stay together in a fairly functional but basically loveless marriage, it will teach him the wrong lessons.   Is there a benefit to him to stay or go? Are there any resources for parents who would not be getting full custody on dealing with that?  Thank you. "
1922,How to know if 12 month old is talking,"I have a 12-month old girl.  She understands a few words (like mommy, daddy) and maybe a few words (claps when we say ""clap"", waves when people say ""hi"" or ""bye"").  I can't tell if she's talking or not.  When family members are around or babysitting they will say ""she said hi, and ball, and daddy"".  But I have never heard her say any of those things.  She says ""da"" a lot, but rarely exactly twice (sometimes ""Da"" other times ""dadadadada"").  Sometimes she says it when she sees her daddy, and sometimes when she sees her mommy, and plenty of times for no particular reason.   A few weeks ago she said something like ""book"" while we were reading, but she hasn't said it since.  So my question is.... how do I know when she is actually talking?  Since ""da"" has been her favorite syllable for months, how will I know when she says ""dada""?  "
1923,Hoarding food in mouth,"My 2.5-year-old has started hoarding food in her mouth, and won't chew, until her mouth is just full of food. Most of the time it seems like it's because she's distracted with something or doesn't especially feel like eating something (right now, the only things she really likes are her M&amp;M's and mac and cheese).   Anyone else faced this? What did you do to get around it? I'm assuming it's just a phase - should I just wait it out?  "
1924,DIY Crib Activity Gym,"My baby is just starting to get to an age where activity gyms are interesting to him. We have one that we borrowed from friends, but it takes up a fair amount of space in our tiny apartment. Plus, the ground is cold right now, so he seems less inclined to spend time on there. Since he is not yet sitting up, it seemed like I could string a makeshift gym across the top of his crib to put up for him to play with in there. A few questions:   Any major safety concerns with this I might not have considered? I plan to take it down when baby isn't playing (e.g., when sleeping), will discontinue use after he can sit up, and will ensure that the toys are out of reach. If anyone has done this before, suggestions for how to go about it?  "
1925,Is crib use (mostly) universal?,"We have friends who decided against a crib in favor of a futon mattress on the floor. This idea came from the book Montessori from the Start. The benefits for the baby are that they aren't confined and can start exploring their (safe) room as soon as they can crawl and it's supposedly safer since they aren't going to fall from high up. The benefits for the parents supposedly are that during sleepless nights you can lay on the floor next to them instead of staying bent over the crib for a long time.  We've been considering doing the same once our boy is too big for his bassinet but I'm somewhat skeptical considering that most people in the world who live in houses or apartments use cribs. So, there must be major benefits to having the baby high off of the ground and surrounded by bars, right?  Of course, this is based off of my assumption that crib use is universal (for people who have the room and can afford them). Is this truly the case? What are the popular alternatives? "
1926,Daughter is 11 and really upset that she may be lesbian,"My daughter is 11 and confused.  She recently read a book which at the end the character found himself to be gay.  She said that she now has thoughts of girls kissing and it makes her sick, she sometimes gets butterflies in her tummy when she sees girls. She is terrified to being lesbian. She asked me if she might be. I said that those feelings would not make her feel bad if she were.  I believe that those feelings would make her feel good. We are tolerant to gay and lesbian community, but we don't know anyone who is. She said she has feelings like this with boys also.  She is so anxious about being gay that she keeps asking for my reasurance several times a day.  When I said to her that she may feel that these feelings are normal, she is terrified that she will change and like the thoughts about girls.  I just want to help my daughter.  Are these feelings normal? Or is this her bodies way of telling her she is gay? "
1927,When do bilingual kids start to talk fluently?,"My older boy is turning 3 years old soon. And he still does not build meaningful sentence.  He is being raised inside Czech Republic, and we, both parents are Czech speaking. But thing is, that we do listen a lot English and even play him English speaking fairy tales.  By his progress, I feel, that he is naturally bilingual. Sometimes he says ""car"" and sometimes he says ""auto"", which is ""car"" in Czech (while pointing at car in both cases)  So while I am bit worried that my son still does not talk properly, I hope it is normal with bilingual kids.  But still, I would like to check: Is there any parent from multilingual culture? At which age started your kid to talk? "
1928,How can a teenager avoid changing in a school locker room?,"What can a teenager (or their parents) do when they very strongly refuse to change in a school locker room?   There are plenty of families and students that feel they should not undress in a somewhat public space, for reasons such as:   Religious beliefs Personal values Anxiety or mental health issues Physical issues or impairments   How do they manage?  Policies and expectations may be different in different schools and different areas, but answers that apply to your experience with your local school district are encouraged.  Answers should preferably not be limited to only suggestions to remove the child from the school or class. Often that's not viable, and it also does not help address the problem, it simply removes or moves it. "
1929,How do I get my father to stop making everything about him,"My father is a very demanding person, to the point of being unreasonable a lot of the time IMO. But lately it has been getting worse and I feel like i just don't have the energy to deal with it because it all seems so petty.  I am married with two children, a 4 year old and a 3 month old We live about 2 hours away from him. Most of the disagreements we have are about him being able to see our children, basically he can see them whenever he wants but he demands that we take them down there to see him, which is difficult because of the distance. He is divorced from my mother, who sees the children more often because she lives closer.  Some specific examples of his behavior I have a problem with are:   when our youngest son was born he had a serious heart condition that needed several risky operations. We choose to stay in hospital with him in case anything went wrong, so we could say good bye. During this time my eldest son was being looked after by my mother because it was the easiest and most convenient option at the time. My father took this as some sort of personal insult that we didn't let him look after our eldest son and actually phoned me to discuss it with me which I thought was very selfish and inconsiderate of him considering what we were going through at the time. when we came out of hospital my father wanted my eldest son to go and spend a couple of days with him. We didn't think it was a good idea because he had already been away from us for two weeks and we didn't want him to be insecure or feel pushed out by the new baby. It might have felt like we were sending him away. So we told my father that he would be able to visit only after a couple of months had passed when he was on summer holiday from school. In response to this my father wrote me a letter accusing me of wanting to punish him by stopping him from seeing his grandson.  He asks us to go down there at short notice, this causes two problems. The drive down there causes my significant neck and back pain and usually triggers a migraine which will stay with me all weekend. I have a very stressful job and I need to relax to be in any fit state to go to work the following week, taking a 4 year old and a newborn away for the weekend i find very stressful and does not allow me the time I need to decompress. So when i refuse to go he asks me why I don't want to go and see him, I do not know how to respond to that because it isn't that I don't want to see him just that we have other things that have to be the priority. He instant messages me at work and if i don't respond almost immediately he will ask me why I am obviously ignoring him. I answer him when I can, but my main responsibility is to do my work and I cannot always answer him right away.   Am I being unreasonable? If not, how can I get him to see that his behavior is inappropriate and to back off? "
1930,Toddler won't swallow or spit out food sometimes,"Sometimes around dinner my 21 month old toddler will eat reasonably well, and we don't try to force him to eat if he doesn't want anymore.  He loves fruits, grains and meats and seems to tolerate vegetables.  We will let him down from his chair when he starts playing with his food, or throwing it at the dog, that is generally when he is not hungry anymore.  We usually keep his plate up on the counter though because he doesn't always eat everything and 10 to 30 minutes later he will often try to reach for it because he would like another bite.  When we give the other bite, he will just kind of let it sit in his mouth and he won't swallow it, sometimes for a half hour or more.  We have tried convincing him to swallow, giving him water or juice, bribing with a cookie, convincing to spit it out into our hands, he just doesn't seem to want to.  I am not sure if it is a burgeoning rebellion in him but when we ask him to do something like this he gets this devious smile and joyfully tells us ""NO"".  It is concerning for me and I press it because he plays very rough and I am afraid he will choke on it.  Thank god this hasn't happened yet.  I have also tried timeout but when I put him in his timeout chair he breaks down into a complete tantrum with wildly throwing his body back into his chair further increasing the risk he is going to choke.  The last time I did this he begrudgingly swallowed but then gagged and threw up everywhere.  Is this behavior normal?  Do you have any advice or suggestions to help with this situation?  I don't want to not feed my child when they ask me for food. "
1931,Letting a newborn sleep - bassinet or full-sized baby bed?,"Is it a bassinet really necessary for a newborn?   We are expecting our first in a bit less than half a year. We have been asked if we want to use the family heirloom bassinet, and we really can't decide what to do, and lack of experience doesn't help. The problem is that my sister-in-law is expecting her second one only three months before us, and will use the bassinet for at least the first three months, depending on whether or not we want it too. It feels like snatching it from her, even though she kindly offered it to us.  We were originally thinking about going straight to a full-sized baby bed, partly because we don't have much space and we'd like to cut back on anything that isn't essential; however, my mother-in-law told me that a bassinet would be more suitable for a newborn as it fits snugly around the baby.   Is this true, does a newborn really sleep better in a bassinet?  The other thing we're wondering about is where the baby would sleep, and this might also influence the question if we need the bassinet, as our bedroom is so small that a baby bed won't fit, but a bassinet will. Our bedroom is one floor above the rest of the apartment incl. baby room, and the spiral stairs are pretty narrow. This makes me anxious about having to go downstairs 3x or more every night for feeding. If the baby room had been right next to ours, I would probably let the baby sleep in the baby room pretty quickly, but as it is with the stairs, I am strongly considering keeping it in our room for at least the first few months. On the other hand, I know that many baby sleep experts do not recommend this, and I'm really hoping we can get our baby to sleep well once it's a few months old.   What are your experiences, will keeping the baby in our bedroom for the first few months affect it's sleeping pattern beyond a few days/weeks? In a scenario as ours, will keeping the baby in our bedroom vs going downstairs be a big difference? "
1932,2 year old daughter unable to chew,"My 2 year old daughter does not like chewing her food. I was wasn't sure what to do and therefore I gave her pureed food. She has been eating that well. As she is becomes older; I am concerned that pureed food has become her habit.   Instead of chewing, she usually uses her tongue to eat rather then chew the food with teeth. I try to encourage her as much as I can by showing her, playing with her, showing how other kids are having food but still she is doing the same thing.  I am becoming so fed up with her actions. She either keeps food in her mouth or spits it out. I told this to the doctor but the doctor said let her feed herself. By doing that I see that she is remaining hungry whole day. She does not understand the feeling of hunger so either she is sleepy or getting cranky. It is frustrating too. It has been 3 months since I started this process of giving her totally solid food like we have.   How long should I try to deal with this alone? Is this just a phase?  "
1933,Till what age are frog feet a normal issue?,My twin boys are 10 weeks old. One of them has his legs as the frog legs position. Till what age must I consider this a normal issue?  or is it abnormal already? I thought it was normal that I hadn't asked his ped yet. 
1934,Kid hates lessons - Dropping Kumon English,"This question is similar to Worried that Kumon tutoring is not working for our daughter - but different enough that the answers there don't adequately cover my problem (this is about English rather then maths, my son has never enjoyed it and is constantly being pressured to continue)  My 7 year old son goes to a good school and has slightly above average grades. but the teachers almost certainly don't realise the amount of private lessons he is taking to augment his learning.  It is quite probable that without these extra lessons he would fall towards the bottom of the class.    Other possibly relevant information - My son loves reading. My son speaks English natively, and we live in an English speaking country. My spouse and other family members do not speak English natively - English is not typically spoken at home except by/for me.  The biggest problem is Kumon English lessons which he hates (and has hated for the 2 years he has been doing it)  It is always a struggle to get him to do it - to the point I feel its breaking up our family.  No amount of incentives can get him to focus on it.   My spouse - and her  community (of rich parents of the same ethnicity)  is, however, insistent that my son needs to continue with Kumon.  Sitting down with him over the last few days to try do it with him, I discovered that it is extremely repetitive.  I don't have a background in education and repeating the identical questions multiple times does not make a lot of sense to me - and sadly, my son does not seem good at remembering previous answers.  So My questions -   Is it actually beneficial to force my son to continue to do Kumon ? Would replacing Kumon with reading books have a similar benefit ? Are there other programs which take a different approach which may be  easier and as beneficial to my son ?  "
1935,how to deal with complete meltdown for simple everyday tasks with my 4 year old,"My 4 year old girl has been progressively worsening with meltdown-tantrums with simple daily tasks like wearing clothes, shoes, underwear. . . She has always been particular with things on her body, but it has gotten out of control.  She will only wear 1 pair of shoes because all her other shoes ""don't feel right"".  I purchaced the same exact shoe hoping that would work but encountered the same meltdown!  She freaks out, screaming, crying and rolling on the floor with almost everything she tries on in clothing, shoes, and swim suits.  We have spent the entire day indoors because she refuses to get dressed because all her clothes bothers her (trying to not give her the option but she does not give in)  I don't know how to go about dealing with this problem but my nerves are shot and preschool is starting and she cant go naked!  any advice??!! "
1936,"Screaming, crying, tantrums, pushing... how to give effective timeout?","I'm the father of a toddler boy.  As the title says, his behavior is very poor.  If something doesn't go his way, it devolves into pushing, screaming, tantrums and the like.  I say wait a minute and if he doesn't get what he wants right away, it's pretty much a disaster.  Honestly, this really sucks.  We live in a small condo and don't have much space.  We have a large walk-in closet that I'm thinking of using as a timeout area.  The question is, how?  Should I close him in there for 15 minutes as punishment?  There is ample light and the place has enough space for me to lay there fully stretched out.  How have you done this?  What worked for you?  [edit]  Ultimately, I want to teach him to be more patient and understanding that what he's doing is bad and harmful.  And yes, I want him to stop doing these things. "
1937,"How can I help my almost six year old behave better at my home? He is good at his dad's house, with grandparents, and at school","My son is with me 4 or 5 nights per week; with his father the balance. But I see him every day after school regardless (I'm at home with my second baby). I have a good relationship with my ex, and with his partner  - and sometimes the four of us with my partner, son and second baby son socialise together e.g. school picnic etc.   The problem is my son misbehaves at our house, but is an angel at his dad's. His dad says it's because we are too soft, fall for the tears, don't follow through. This is true - we are too soft. But even if we are hard and do follow through - no ipad for  a week, cancel a play date etc - he is still naughty. He says a ""switch goes off in his brain"" when he comes to my place and although he tries to be good, he can't.  He isn't horrifically bad - just you know, whines for junk food even after I say no, takes me five times to instruct him before he does something, gets too rambunctuous and after several ignored warnings ends up hurting himself, or the baby or breaking something -  that sort of thing. But at the end of a long day, I'm yelling, he's crying, everyone is hot and bothered - and it isn't pleasant at all. And bad role modelling for the baby.   He is quite a sensitive soul, but has loads of energy and often acts before he thinks.   He adores my partner and his little brother and we make sure he still has special alone time with mummy - - and the naughtiness at (solely) our house started about a year before baby came along.   What is the circuit breaker???? Any advice gratefully received! "
1938,What to do about my 6-year-old who misbehaves regularly and doesn't pay attention to punishments?,"My 6-year-old son is misbehaving a lot. He doesn't care about punishments. He even would say so I don't care if I don't get this or that. Even if I whoop him, which I try not to at all, it does not faze him.   When I sit down and talk to him and ask him ""Why?"", he laughs and say he doesn't know and that he tried not to do it. That he can't help it. Recently I asked him if it makes him sad that he makes me sad, he said no. One time I cried because I'm so stressed with the situation and he laughed. He's only six! He shows no sign of regret or anything of the sort for his behavior.  I don't know what else to do! I have tried everything except doctors. I'm scared he is going to be something really bad when he gets older. I have 4 kids and he's the only one that acts like this. I spend lots of time with them all, especially him. What am I doing wrong?  "
1939,What Can I do to get An Adult Child with Special Needs to Start eating and Drinking Again?,"This individual is a twenty-five-year-old man with no verbal communication skills, totally deaf and blind. He was born with a genetic condition that made him this way--Norries.  We hired somebody who was willing to communicate with him using American Sign Language so he could better express what he wanted or needed. At some point while we were out, he got really scared because he couldn't differentiate between his mother and the new assistant, who were both trying to sign to him. I tried to engage him into eating or drinking something since last Friday, but for the last twenty-four hours, he's refused to eat.  I read that nobody can survive without water for three days, and food for three weeks, but I can't explain to him that if he doesn't at least drink something I will have to take him to the hospital. What's more, he won't let anyone poke him or prod him while he's awake. :/ Normally, we would know if he was sick or had an upset stomach, but he appears to be well, otherwise. I wonder if the experience with the new assistant had traumatised him to where he's depressed? This kind of behaviour has never happened before. He's always had a good appetite, grabbing for food whenever he was hungry. He has no other condition that I am aware of that could hinder his ability to feel hunger or pain. What can I do? I am just helping out my mother because she doesn't speak English, and my brother and I are both blind, except that his condition is made him deaf as well. If he doesn't eat in an hour, I will call his on-call physician. "
1940,What should I be aware of when introducing 7-8 year old to Harry Potter book?,"I plan to get my child (7-8 YO) introduced to Harry Potter books (specifically, the first one - ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"").  It is definitely within the language level that is comfortable for the child, and likely he will be able to read large parts of it himself, although I may read parts aloud as well.   However, I think that the books is intended for a slightly older age (protagonist is 11YO) and is in an environment that is somewhat alien (I'm talking about boarding school, not magic :)  What are the main things that I should be aware of/prepared when the child reads the book or has it read to him?  What topics/points/themes would it be helpful to discuss, either in advance of reading the book, or as we read? "
1941,How should I teach my child to help but also do things on her own?,"The other day I asked my child ""Can you give me a napkin?"" and she said ""o self"" which means ""you do it yourself""!  At first I was shocked, and ashamed that she has perhaps learned it from me and my wife, where perhaps my wife asks me to give her something, but then I tell her I'm busy and she has to get it herself.  I think that's partially the reason why. Now most of the time, me and my wife now try to respond and do things no matter what so she can learn.  However at other instances she asks me to do something which she has to do herself e.g. she has to clean the soda she just spilled and I tell her you have to do it yourself or you have to walk to the car yourself.  So my question is how can I teach her to clean after her own mess while I also teach her to be polite when others ask? She used to be the kind of person to not want to be carried or want to do everything herself, even cleaning up. Still now she does want to do a lot of things on her own (85%), but she's more selective. I guess you could say this is how they make their own progress!?  PS: She's 2.5 years old and I love to carry and help her, but just think she also needs to take responsibility a bit. "
1942,4 languages... are we going to overload our child?,"My husband and I are native speakers of 2 different Languages. Lets say mine is A and his is B. We both can speak and understand the other language - with varying fluencies. He speaks my native language (A) better than I speak his, so we speak ""A"" at home. It's become the dominant language for us now. So our child will definitely first learn A, and probably learn it the best. His parents though, speak only his native language - B, and we'd want our child to be able to communicate with them comfortably when we/they visit. So that's the story of A and B.  Now, we have just recently moved to Italy with our 4 month old. Once we get her into a day care and play groups, she'll naturally pick up Italian. That's already 3 languages. But we may not always be in Italy, and when we move to an English speaking country, we don't want her to be at a disadvantage. Especially if we move once she's a little older, and unable to learn a new language as easily as a toddler would. So we'd like to try and teach her English too, at which we are both quite proficient.  Is it too much of a burden on her to teach her English this early too? If not, how do we go about incorporating both English and our secondary language B into her everyday life? (I'm not asking specifically about language A and Italian, because I figure those will happen naturally) "
1943,"15 month old waking in the night, screaming and hysterical","My 15 month old has suddenly started waking at night crying. We go into her room to try to comfort her, and sometimes bring her into bed with us, but our presence seems to make things worse. Sometimes she screams and becomes so hysterical that nothing will calm her down for 30 to 40 minutes. In between these episodes, and during the day, she is otherwise totally normal and her daytime behaviour has not changed.  Are we dealing with separation anxiety or is this closer to night terrors? She always seems awake and aware when she has a screaming jag. We haven't had trouble waking her, so I am thinking it could be separation anxiety. We recently took a 3 week vacation overseas and it was hard for her to adjust to the time change and jet-lag...could that be the reason for these outbursts?  Whatever it is, these tantrums are very scary...I am not sure now whether I should pick her up at night or not. I can't stand the thought of letting her scream alone...and when I go to her and try to comfort her while leaving her in the crib she becomes even more angry. "
1944,As an agnostic how to respond to my toddler who points out to god and folds her hands to pay respect to it?,"Child is 2 years 2 months old.  I am an agnostic. I don't want my child to believe in God until she is 20 years old. Reason is that I believe that if the child below that age is repeatedly told by her elders to pray to god, that the god exists, and the god can punish them if they don't - then I think the child will follow what the elders say because of her lack of world experience and because of her trust in her elders.   After she is 20, I can reveal to her the world history (wars, natural calamities, gas chambers etc.) and I can tell her why I turned agnostic. Then if she thinks it is wise to pray to god or to demons - I simply won't interfere. It would be totally her decision.  I live among believers. My in laws have shown some photographs of Hindu gods to her and have taught her to fold her hands as a mark of respect.    Child has learnt that and follows the practice whenever she sees a photo of those gods.  I live in India. There is a huge cultural difference as compared to western countries. Therefore it is simply not possible to tell the in-laws to not talk about god to the child.  The in-laws don't live with us. They live far away. But, every year for 2-3 weeks we have to visit them, and they also visit us the same way.   How should I respond to the child when she is alone with me? How should I respond to the child when she is in presence of the in laws?  "
1945,Babbling - encourage babbling in 2 yo with glue ear?,"What does the best research say about babbling, and whether it should be encouraged, ignored, or discouraged?  Would early deafness make a difference to that advice?  I've been told that babbling is fine; and to repeat the sounds back sometimes is good.  Babbling lets children explore and develop their tongue and mouth.  And repeating the babbling back to them lets them know that they can make a noise that people will respond to, which encourages them to talk.  If they try to say a word you model the correct word, and reply to the question / demand.  Does that match good recent research? "
1946,At what age is it appropriate to start to teach a foreign language / second language - and how to do it?,"We are a Brazilian family in Brazil and therefore we speak Portuguese. I can  speak English reasonably well but my wife is just learning it now. We want our 9 months old son to learn English, too. However, we only use Portuguese at home and there is no environment where we speak English naturally, so I bet we will have to resort to English classes (and help at home, of course).  There are a lot of questions about multilingual children here but none of them seems to approach the precise point I want to understand. So, my question is: what would be a good age to start to teach a child a foreign language? What would be good ways to teach such a language to a child?  "
1947,How to tell my parents I want to marry my girlfriend,"Background info  I'm a 20 y/o guy living with my parents in the Netherlands. When I was 16, I unintentionally met an American girl online whom I fell in love with and we have had a great relationship for 3 years now. We've seen each other a lot of times (usually 3 times per year for around 3 weeks per visit, during summer usually longer). She has been at our house for a long period once and I have been at their house many times. Her family loves me very much, has given us financial support so that we can be together more often and all the signs say that I want to be with her forever. I love the U.S.A. and I would love to live and work there after we graduate.  Problem  Her family loves me, but my parents don't really seem to like her. Due to the language barrier and her having some social awkwardness issues, she isn't very close with my family. She has been at our house for 4 weeks when the two of us really enjoyed our time together. When she went back home and I asked my mother afterward how they experienced those 4 weeks, the reaction I got back from her made me feel depressed for about two weeks, not exaggerating (it wasn't anything positive at all). It basically came down to the fact that they had a terrible time because she was here, I still don't really understand why... I never asked my dad what he thought because I'm afraid to get burned to the ground again. My parents tell me that she is still welcome over here, but that they hope things will be different next time.  But my girlfriend doesn't feel welcome anymore (which I understand) and I'm afraid to get her at our house again.  During Christmas, I was over there and I really enjoyed my time there and so did her family. They always tell me how welcome and loved I am in their family and that they will do anything for the both of us. I want to propose to my girlfriend and she wants to be engaged, too, thus I asked for her father's blessing behind her back which was a big ""yes absolutely""  and it made him very happy.   On the other hand, I'm afraid to tell my parents I want to marry her. I don't feel like they are supporting us in our relationship at all. I don't have a great relationship with my parents (and never had), have small fights with them every now and then, they seem to care barely about me and I don't really feel like they see me, especially since my sister got married and moved out and now I'm the only child in the house.   How do I tell my parents that I want to marry her and move over there in a few years? I'm afraid they will start yelling at me, disallow me to do that, or that it will make the relationship with my parents even worse than it already is. I don't know what to do or how to tell them that I even asked for her dad's blessing. I'm afraid I will mess up things and make things only worse when I tell them. Do I even need to tell them my plan of proposing at all? I don't know what to do in this situation and it's really stressing me out. Any help is appreciated.   "
1948,What is the best way to deal with a 16 month old who started hitting?,"   Possible Duplicate:   How do you discourage a toddler from hitting people?       Out of the blue my 16 month old son has started hitting his sister (4 year old) and other kids when he is frustrated (and sometimes he did it pro-actively without any clear reason).  In those cases he would just walk up to his sister (or mother on one occasion) and just swing at them without any apparent provocation from their side.   This is worrying me, so I wanted to get advice on how to deal with this as he is too young to take any conversational feedback besides just saying ""No"" but that doesn't seem to be stopping him so far from doing it again.  I can't see timeouts or similar things working for a 16 month old.  Any suggestions for how to deal with this issue on a kid so young?  "
1949,Why is trying to talk children out of how they feel a bad idea?,"The article 7 Parenting Essentials says,        Accept your children’s feelings.   ...   Instead, comfort your children and let them know you love them, rather than try to talk them out of how they feel.      Google says that “talk them out” means “to discuss a problem in detail” or “to settle something by discussion”.  According to the answer(s) given, correct interpretation is ""to persuade someone not to do something"".   Why is it a bad idea to tell a child not to feel bad about something? Won't that make the child stop feeling bad and be happy? Does this have any negative side effects? "
1950,Kid's bedroom adjacent to living room - noise,"We are considering buying an apartment. Most apartments have the kid's bedroom separated from the living room by only a thin wall.  We are concerned about implications, in particular noise due to people talking or watching a movies past the child's bedtime. We do not have a child yet, so this question concerns potentially all ages from age 0 on.   Do children get used to low-volume noise while trying to fall asleep and/or while sleeping? Under the assumption that they get used to it, would it significantly influence the quality of their sleep?  "
1951,Should I speak English with my toddler,"My spouse has a plan! She wants me to speak English with my toddler, to give him an early advantage in English. We live in Israel and both of us speak Hebrew, this is our native language. While my English is better than hers, I am not fluent in expressing complex thoughts and emotions in English. So... Can this be done?  Maybe there are other options? For example, we can have one hour of English every day, a happy-english hour!  What do you think? "
1952,Do babies have difficulty to fall asleep after playing?,"If you play with a baby before putting him to sleep, will he have difficulty falling asleep?  What about if the baby is crawling playfully around the house and me is playfully chasing him around and we are both laughing and having fun, will he afterwards fall asleep with more difficulty?  Is it true that if a baby is very tired, he will have difficulty falling asleep??  My common sense is telling me that the more a baby plays, the more exhausted/tired he will be afterwards, thus he will fall asleep more easily. What is your experience with this? "
1953,How to stop 1-yr old from kicking us while sleeping,"Our daughter is one year old.  We've been co-sleeping, but about two weeks ago we started transitioning her to her own room.     We rock her down and put her to sleep in her room. When she wakes up (usually in 1-2 hours) and starts fussing, we get her and bring her back to our bed and go back to sleep.   Sometimes she gets to a full cry before we get to her, but usually we are there before she's too upset.  However, despite our attempt to be as non-traumatic with this transition as possible, she's suddenly gotten very squirmy when she's cosleeping with us.   She'll twist about till she's lying perpendicular between us, and then start kicking her dad. A lot.     I don't know if it's related to the transition to her bed, or if it's just a natural development for her age, but I don't know what to try to get her to stop.  It's almost always when she's nursing - she used to nurse very easily lying down.  She'd be lying parallel to me, she'd be mostly still, we'd both drift back to sleep ... Now, if she's nursing (or just before or just after), she's in constant motion, either maneuvering herself into the perpendicular, head twisted position that she favors now (cannot understand why, but there it is), or kicking her dad, or hitting me.     She doesn't hit hard - just a rhythmic, keep-the-beat kind of thing.  But she kicks a lot harder.  Usually she is drumming her poor father in his chest, but she's managed to kick his face a few times, as well as lower.  Which makes sleeping pretty difficult for him.  We can't tell her no; she's not really awake.   And I can hold her hand while nursing, but I can't hold her feet as well or keep her from twisting all around.   If I sit up and pull her into my lap to nurse, she is still - but then I don't get any sleep.  How can I get her to stop kicking and stop squirming when she's sleeping?   Or how long should we expect this phase to last?   Is there anything my husband can do to keep the kicking at bay?  UPDATE   Far the 'how long will this last??' question - just a few weeks.  2 months later, she's almost completely transitioned to her own bed, and the few times she does sleeps in our bed, she is good. We found that giving her a high-protein meal soon before bedtime helped her reach a sound sleep faster and stay there longer.   The schedule is a scrambled egg, bath, nursing and reading, and then bed.    That gives us 4-6 hours before she rouses (yah!) I did finally figure out that the trade-off with sleeping in her own bed is that I can't do the lay-down nursing anymore.    When she wakes at night, she needs the comfort of being held in a lap as much as anything else - the comfort of lying down again doesn't cut it.   This is much easier to do now that I'm getting 4-hour stretches of sleep  :) We also found the right comfort items to put in bed with her and her preferred sleep temperature.  She also sleeps better (ie, without kicking and thrashing) if she's had her naps, and when she isn't teething.   So many variables!  "
1954,How to address preschooler lying,"My 3.5 years old recently started lying. Up to now, they where mostly ""I didn't do this"" type of lies. For exemple, he would unroll the toilet paper in the bathroom or put play-doh in the washer (!) and then pretend he didn't do it. Sometimes he would even come get me to look at his wrong doing and then tell straight to my face that he didn't do it. I didn't make a big deal of it because I figured he was experimenting with lies and it was pretty much inoffensive. My typical reaction was to say something like ""look, I now you did this, now help me clean"". He then stopped pretending he didn't do it, helped me clean and sometimes said he was sorry.  But yesterday, there was an incident at daycare. When I picked him up, there was a bracelet hidden in his case. He said a friend (let's call him John) gave it to him. Something was strange with his behaviour but I went with it and he brought the bracelet home. Once home, he wanted to hide it in his room and didn't wear it at all, which I found suspicious. This morning, at breakfast, he asked where was his bracelet and when I asked once again where he got it, he finally admitted that the bracelet belongs to Claire. John took it from Claire's case and gave it to my son, then he hid it in his case. Claire was giving the bracelets to her friends and my son wanted one, John knew and they did this.   So I explained to him how it was wrong to take other people's things and that he will have to give the bracelet back and apologize to Claire, which he did. I think he understood this part well (clearly he knew it was wrong, because he lied about it). However, I'm a bit at lost when it comes to make him understand that lying was also wrong. He lied to me by saying that John gave it to him and not saying the truth that they took it from Claire without her knowing. I think he doesn't really understands the words ""lie"" and ""truth"" and I struggle to find simple words to explain to him that lying is wrong, it upsets people and it could get him in much more trouble. It's somewhat of an abstract and new concept for him.  How can I address the lying? Do you know of any good resources (books, etc.) that might help? "
1955,Explaining Teen Pregnancy to Young Child,"So, my six-year-old daughter has understood that babies come from a ""special kind of hug"" done between the mommy and daddy.  I should clarify that she has actually seen sex on a farm between animals and labeled it ""hugging"" herself when she saw it (though she couldn't really see the exact mechanics).  I should also clarify that she already knows all the terminology for both the male and female anatomy and that the ""special hug"" requires no clothing and an older age than she is at now.  I have used the term sex with her, but she prefers ""special hug"" and has clearly shown she isn't ready to fully grasp the mechanics part yet.    However, she put two and two together herself when she asked how babies were made and I answered something akin to when two people really love each other, they can get together and choose to make a baby together.  She actually asked, ""is it like the special hug the donkey's did?"" I answered, ""It can be.""  The confusion lies in the ""choice"" part.  She understands this hug cannot be made accidentally and even that requires removing clothes, but is now confused because her youngest aunt (my youngest sister in law and who ran away from home) has now sent out an announcement and photo to all of us that she just had a baby.  There has been a lot of conversation about it now over the holiday.  My daughter has always just figured that special hug happened between two people that were married and though I didn't purposefully plant this idea, I didn't correct it when she expressed it either.  Needless to say, my six-year-old has some questions:  ""Why did Auntie do the special hug when she isn't ready for a baby?"" being one of the main ones.  I do want her to get the idea that the ""special hug"" is generally reserved for much older members of society and that have a monogamous relationship without getting into too much detail or sounding too judgemental while also answering her question honestly.    My youngest sister in law is getting a lot of critique, because she is young, without an income, and without the means to truly care for this baby - subjects that are complex to broach with a six year old especially when sex is wrapped up in an already complex topic.  ""Your aunt made a dumb-f*ck decision"" - The answer my lovely father in law inserted and that thankfully, my daughter didn't quite catch - seems highly inappropriate to me as I'd like to be a little more sensitive to my sister-in-law and her baby even if it wasn't the smartest choice in the world.  After-all, we all make mistakes.   I wondered how other parents in this situation may have discussed this with their early elementary or primary kids. "
1956,How do you encourage your primary-school-aged child to eat new foods?,"I thought this question might be a good complement to a question posted about a child that pretends to choke when he doesn't like a certain food.  This question and its answers mostly address the choking behavior, but what about the dislike of the food in the first place?    This question has some great recommendations for toddlers and preschoolers really, but what about the somewhat older child?  How do you get a child between six and the upper limit of being able to influence such things in the first place, to give new foods a try? "
1957,When the new baby arrives how do you help the oldest sibling adjust?,"   Possible Duplicate:   How do I cope with my toddler’s jealousy towards her newborn brother and sister?       Sibling rivalry will occur, but there must be preventative things that can be done to help the first child to be more accepting of the arrival of the second and get the sibling relationship started on the right foot.  What practices did you use that you believe to have made a difference with your own kids?  What do you wish you had done because you think things may have been easier if you had? "
1958,My grandson only likes girl toys,"My 4 year old grandson will only play with girl toys. My daughter and husband criticize me for allowing it. His birthday was last week and my sisters and I took him to the toy store to let him pick out his toy, and naturally he picked out princess toys and Monster High dolls. My daughter was angry when she came home and told him she was throwing them away. I feel it's because it's all he knows. He's only around women. His parents aren't married and Dad isn't around much. He has one sister. Am I wrong in feeling that I can't force him to like boy toys? Does it necessarily mean he's going to be gay or want to become a female? I'm confused. The only thing I'm sure of is that he likes these toys and I want him to enjoy playing. "
1959,How to deal with excluding my son from the favourite activity of his peers?,"This is about forbidding my son from participating in an activity all his friends partake in, not about the activity itself.  How does one go about this when these are his only friends? (Please see edit based on comments before answering. Thanks.)    My son is ten years old and will be eleven this summer. For the past half year he has been playing Clash of Clans and Clash Royale on his mobile phone.  For those of you who are not familiar with free-to-play mobile online games, search for ""Clash of Clans addiction"" or ""Clash Royale addiction"" to learn more. In short, the games are designed specifically to induce addiction-like behavior in its players. For example, certain quests can only be played on certain days and the trophies that you have won are not available immediately, but on certain other days, so that players want to be online to play and claim their trophies, making it difficult to abstain. There are other attractors, such as an in-game social network, ""clans"" that you must regularly participate in, time sensitive enhancements, and so on. On top of that, game play is significantly obstructed if you don't buy certain enhancements, and my son has begun to spend his pocket money for them.  I have observed how my son and his friends, who all play the game too, have changed over the past months. My son can no longer think of anything else. Everything he says or does, outside of school and homework, is related to the game. When he visits his friends, or they come visiting, they all sit bent over their mobile phones and play. When they are not allowed to play, they do not know what to do. Literally. They sit and wait for the time to pass until they may play again.  When my son has to stop playing, for example to eat or go to bed or go to school — yes, the game is the first thing he needs in the morning — he becomes irritable and angry. When I forbid him to play, he lies and tells me he goes outside (for example to play basketball), but I then find him standing in front of our house, where he has WiFi access, playing Clash of Clans.  I don't know how the other kids behave at home, but my son is clearly no longer in control of his life. I have therefore uninstalled the game from his mobile phone and blocked Google Play, so he cannot install it again.  This was fine for him for a few days. But all his friends still play the game and talk about nothing else. And again I mean that literally. There is no male child his age or older that I know who does not play the two games. All his friends boast of their ""achievements"" in their WhatsApp group, and whenever they meet my son in my presence, I hear how they talk of nothing else.  So basically, my problem comes down to this:  I don't want my son to play these games because they change him in a way I find alarming. At the same time, these games are the only thing all his friends and classmates are (currently) interested in, and I don't want to destroy his friendships for him.  What can I do?  I am quite convinced that some of his friends' parents don't see the problem I do. Some of his peers have TVs and game consoles in their bedrooms and parents who are ""avid gamers"" themselves. Maybe other kids aren't as addicted as my son is. I found someone online saying that creative kids with a lively imagination are more in danger than those that live more solidly in the real world. However that may be, I don't see the other parents taking the game away from their kids.  I have given this question the tag of ""video-games"", although those are distinctly different than the mobile games of today, but there was no other more fitting tag. Please edit, if necessary.    Edit based on comments:   ""But the game needs a credit card for purchases.""  I don't know how these things work in the part of the world where you live, but here every kid can buy a Google Play gift card at any supermarket or kiosk and enter the code on it in the game without any kind of authorization required except their Google password.  I have blocked Google Play, so this is no longer an issue. ""Your child has unlimited access to the internet.""  No, he doesn't. I had allowed the games to connect to the internet. Apart from them he only had email and WhatsApp. I have uninstalled and blocked the games, so all he can do ""on the internet"" is send email and write WhatsApp messages. I don't call that ""unlimited"". ""Block his ability to install apps on the phone, uninstall all games, lock it down.""  I already did. ""This particular game is not the issue.""  Maybe not. There have been several studies that found Clash of Clans and similar games to be addictive). But maybe that research is wrong.  However that may be, my question wasn't whether or not those games are problematic, but how to deal with the fact that I have excluded my son from an activity all his friends partake in. I would greatly appreciate it if answerers attempted to actually answer my question instead of forcing their unfounded opinion on me. ""He'll need ... other kids to be around""  They are his classmates and neighbors. There are no other kids, unless we move to a different town.  But I'm not sure that would help. Here, every boy plays those games. All the older siblings play. And I'm sure other towns have smartphones, too.   So the real problem is how to deal with the fact that my son cannot partake in the favourite activity of his age group.   Sure, there certainly are some other kids his age who don't play. But at 10 years, I can no longer force him to be friends with kids he isn't interested in. These are his friends for a reason. It took many years for him to make them his friends, and I can't just replace them with random other kids. "
1960,At what age will a child understand a map?,"I want to prepare my 25-month-old for a long distance trip - across the Pacific Ocean. Part of that is understanding where he is and where he's going. I have a globe, but I don't know if I point to it whether he'll understand wtf I'm talking about. I thought about using Google Maps or Earth to zoom into our house, which he'll probably recognize, then slowly zoom out to show him other parts of the city he may recognize, then zoom out further and show him how it starts to look like the globe.  Is he too young to understand this? If so, is there another approach that will work better? "
1961,Can a Child Fail Preschool in the United States? Should a Child be Held-Back from Kindergarten?,"I have a acquaintance who lives in the United States with a young daughter who will be starting Kindergarten next year.  However, her preschool feels she should be ""held back"", because among other things, she does not appear to be interested in writing her name.  I do not live in the United States, so perhaps I am in the wrong, but is this a scam?  It certainly sounds like a scam. Preschools are paid institutions, while Kindergarten is free (public school system). In my country, you do not need to ""graduate"" kindergarten to be accepted into 1st grade. Thus, holding someone back from kindergarten sounds ridiculous.  Even if she performs poorly, I don't see how this would harm her academic career. I do feel that delaying her education by a year will be detrimental.  I am advising this acquaintance that this sounds like a scam, but I could be in the wrong.  What is consensus on this? "
1962,Getting grandparents to accept parents' choices,"I understand that what children are supposed to eat is a bone of contention between parents and grandparents  in many families. However this is not the main point of my question. I would like to describe a bizarre stalemate situation remotely related to the ""proper food"" question:  Due to a medical condition my son had (sort of an eccema on a finger) that did not improve my wife suggested to try a cow milk-free diet, or at least keeping cow milk to a minimum. We went ahead with this and things seemed to improve, but then it was Christmas eve and big showers of milk chocolate were to be expected from all sides. So my wife called my parents in advance and kindly asked them not to send milk chocolate this time. My parents seemed to be a bit puzzled by that request, but did not object. Yet.   It was not until a week later that my father called my wife. That's where things are getting complicated. The content of said phone call is being recalled fundamentally differently by both parties. My dad says he just  stated his concerns about the measure we took. My wife says, the call was one long stream of accusations, culminating in the claim that not allowing milk was ""neurotic"". My dad denies to have said that, saying that he stated that the measure ""would make our son neurotic"".   I talked to my dad, but we could not find a consensus on this issue. He asked me if I had a suggestion on how to proceed. After quite some thinking I suggested to him to call my wife - telling him that I only had second-hand information and apparently could not contribute anything meaningful to this conflict. I asked him twice, but to no avail. He claims not to have done anything wrong.  My wife is not really motivated to approach my dad herself, since I asked her to do this in previous conflicts already, where my dad's response was something along the lines of ""gee, what conflict? do we have a conflict here?""  Has anyone had similar experiences where family communication got totally stuck? I'd be happy to learn what your solution was, if any.  "
1963,Is it normal for a 16-month-old to always wake up at the same time no matter what?,"I have a 16-month-old daughter. I'm 5 months pregnant with her baby brother. No matter what time I put her down for bed she wakes up at 12:30 am. I've tried putting her in bed at 7 pm, 8 pm, 9 pm, 10 pm and even as late as 11:30 pm and no matter what, she's up at 12:30 am screaming. I have the monitor on by my head and I'm a super light sleeper so I really don't sleep, any noise in her room wakes me up. She only gets 1 nap in the day and that's 12 pm to 2 or 3 pm but that's it.  I don't think daylight savings effected anything - no change, she still wakes up at 12:30 am. I've tried letting her cry it out when this started and she would cry for 10 min then go to sleep then wake up again half an hour later, stand up in her crib and scream again for another 10 minutes. After the 5th time we sat in the living room watching food network (nothing too exciting ).  It used to be she would wake up around 2 or 3 in the morning and I would hand her a bottle and she would fall right back to sleep but now she wakes up and won't take a bottle. When she got sick I gave her some Zarbees Night Time which is supposed to help them sleep, but she still woke up.  Is this a problem? Is it normal? "
1964,Can I still nurse?,"I am a first time mom and my baby is three and a half weeks early. I am currently pumping, but am trying to nurse. Unfortunately, she won't even latch for more than 20 seconds and I'd say about 95% of the milk she gets is from a bottle. She is 2 weeks and 2 days old. My goal is to be exclusively breastfeeding her.   Am I too late to change?  Help? Ideas? Advice? Lactation consultant vs. La Leche League? Also, my nipples are fairly flat. Thoughts on nipple shield or nipple shells? "
1965,Sleeping problems,"Hi everyone I am new in this field and I have so many questions but I believe the most important  for now is how to recover a good sleep pattern for my wife.  Well my daughter is 11 month old chronological and corrected is 9 month. She born premature with just 29 week from then to now has been a really difficults days.  In the last 2 or 3 weeks She wakes up more than 3 times in the night and She try to play with us it doesn't matter that she is almost falling asleep, I called playing in a zoombie mode and she just want to be with her mom and rejects anything from my side.  We are trying with a more strict sleeping rutine (bath, story time, sleep) and at the beginning this work really well but now she is getting this behaviour again.  I Believe this is related to the stimulation that we give to her with different activities, such as swimming, playing in parks among others. But how i can still stimulate her and get a good sleeping  time?  Do you have any recommendations? "
1966,Is buying school supplies online worth it?,"I just got the supply list for my son's class, and figured this year I would buy school supplies well in advanced instead of hustling through Walmart and Target 3 days before the first day of school.  Is it generally worth buying school supplies online, when it comes to price and time?  If so, is Amazon pretty much the best bet in pricing?  (Looking for answers from people that have done it before and their opinion with regards to just buying it in person.) "
1967,How should a jobless father advise his son when he refuses to study because of his educated jobless dad?,"Suppose father XXX holds a college degree, usually comes home late and suddenly one fine day, stays at home. He lost his job. His son sees this happening. The father is a hard-working man, always advising his son to study hard so that he can earn a good living. Now, he is jobless and humiliated despite all his hard work. The son is smart but too blunt with his words. The father's heart was broken when the son said      ""Why should I study so hard when you hold a college degree, work hard   all your life and see what happened to you?""   The father finds it hard to argue with his son because the logic is sound. How would fellow parents advise him?  "
1968,When do babies start responding to their name?,"I talk a lot with my almost two-months daughter. In many cases I mention her name, even though I don't think it means anything to her yet.  But I was wondering: when do newborns / babies start responding to their name? When do they understand the fact that it points to exactly themselves?  I read When will my baby respond to her name? and they mention 7 months. However, I still wonder: does the word itself represent anything to them? "
1969,How can I teach my 5yo son to respect authority?,"My kid is nearly 5, and damn clever but unfortunately he lacks empathy and social skills. Among other things, he does not understand that when a parent gives an order, that order is to be followed -- or conversely, when he gives a parent an order in precisely the same way, that order may very well be ignored.  He is generally well-behaved among strangers and among caretakers (sitters, kindergarten staff, etc.). At home with his parents is where he tests his limits and our patience -- he is also very strong-willed, stubborn, hyperactive, destructive, and absolutely tireless. Looking at other posts here (like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) seems to suggest ODD but I am not jumping to conclusions, just trying to describe him (although that ODD page is eerily accurate).   I want him to understand what authority means and how it works. As you can see from earlier questions, I first addressed this problem three years ago!    We have always tried to use reason and natural consequences as disciplinary action, and when he's completely unreasonable and unreachable occasionally physically carrying him to his room and keeping him there for a short while. Time-outs and losing privileges and toys doesn't work because he usually ignores it and continues his thing. We've done ""123-Magic"" since age 2 and it is mostly effective in the specific situation but there has been zero improvement in the long term.  I'm also trying to use elements from the classic book How to Talk So Kids Will Listen &amp; Listen So Kids Will Talk but it's just not getting through to him; he doesn't listen and he doesn't want to talk...   How can I teach my son that we as parents have authority over him; that this is not to open to discussion; and that it is not a two-way street?   "
1970,Why does my son (5) suddenly provoke me although everything seemed to be perfect before?,"My son (5) sometimes changes his mood suddenly. Sure this is somehow normal human behavior, but it can drive us mad.  This morning everything worked great and ""peacefully"" until breakfast. After having breakfast, we went to the bathroom: he was supposed to was his hands/face and he just didn't do it (instead did other things like hiding somewhere behind a towel or rolling up the carpet )  although I told him calmly several times to firstly clean his hands.  It seemed to be fun for him to see me getting more and more angry until I was really really angry.  I don't like arguments like that, because even if he gets normal quickly afterwards, I am angry quite a long time and can not easily forget that I was provoked for nothing (at least that's my point of view).  I have the impression, that if the situation gets too perfect, he purposefully tries to destroy it. This sounds strange to me - could this be true?  What could be the reasons for such behavior and what would be a good reaction?  Highly sensitive persons  Some time ago we learned about highly sensitive persons (I had never heard about this before) and that our son might be one of them. This helps me a lot understanding his often ""difficult"" behavior, also like what I described in this question.  As far as I understood this might explain that he very suddenly gets kind of ""information/stimulus overload"" (especially if we had many activities during the day) and then the situation gets out of control.  ... and this also explains, why his behavior and reactions might be different from that of >80% of the other children and therefore maybe different from the experience of 80% of other parents. "
1971,How young is too young to switch to a toddler bed?,"I have a (almost) 20mo daughter who currently sleeps well in her crib. There is a futon in her room that one of us uses frequently when she wants someone close by to sleep or needs help getting to sleep. Her room is safe for her to be in for a short period without hurting herself. We have a video monitor to watch her when we're not in the room. I've started thinking it would ok to convert her crib to the toddler bed (not exactly, but similar to this one) My husband says ""don't rock the boat"" because she does sleep well in the crib. I like the idea of giving her a little more freedom to get out of the bed when she wakes without having to wait for one of us to come get her.   Is there any reason to put off converting to a toddler bed? What things should I consider when we do make the switch? "
1972,What qualities should one look for when choosing picture books for young children?,"Many picture books wind up on children's bookshelves that are only looked at a few times and then they sit there collecting dust - never revisited.  Buying books for kids (especially when they aren't there to choose with you) can be pretty difficult because it is so hard to know what will go over well and what will not.   What aspects of a children's book are likely to make it well received by the children it is given to?    I am truly not asking what makes a book popular - I don't want a list of fads or ""in things"" right now.  How do I choose books of QUALITY?  What makes a book one kids will read over and over again - what should I look for in picture books to choose books for my kids that are more likely to be the kind of book my children will love - even to the point of wanting to share the same books with their own kids someday? "
1973,How should I respond to a 6 year old's dark drawings?,"My 6 year old nephew likes to draw. Most of the drawings have been of the family, animals and locations we visit or that he would like to visit. Until recently, I wouldn't describe any of these images as being dark.  Over the last fortnight, some of the images have been dark. To cite 2 examples:   One drawing was of a saber-tooth tiger surrounded by 3 human hunters with spears. There was a lot of red on the page indicating blood One drawing was of the family dog, who sadly passed away in October last year. Most of the drawing was fine, except the dog was urinating heavily. My nephew thought this aspect to be hilarious     Now I think it is important to give some background of his home life:   He is actually very kind. He treats younger children very well and likes meeting the neighbours' friendly pets His parents are going through a rough patch at the moment. His father (my brother) is suffering from a midlife crisis and is having an affair. This is well known to everyone in the family except my nephew There has been bereavement in the family. As mentioned, the family pet died a few months ago, and his paternal grandfather died 2 years' ago     When I saw the drawings I didn't know how to respond. Part of me feels that it is beneficial for him to express his feelings, whereas another part feels concerned about the social stigma associated with the drawings if other people found out about them.  My questions are:   Should I be worried about the darker aspects of his drawings? How should I respond to them?  "
1974,Receiving a new visitor who has autism,"We are receiving new guests over the holidays. My brother has a new girlfriend who has two children.  Her youngest, an 8-year-old boy, has ""mild autism."" I am not absolutely sure what that covers, and unfortunately I haven't had much time to really discuss it directly with her. I would like to be sensitive to his needs when he comes to visit, but I am having difficulty finding resources that directly address how to help a child with autism adjust to a new environment.  Specifically, I was thinking that providing a calm, quiet area or room (and letting him know that he can retreat there whenever he wants to) would help him feel more comfortable, but I am concerned that he might feel isolated by this gesture.  Has anyone had experience with this kind of visit before? Would creating this kind of space be helpful, or only make things more complicated? "
1975,Toddler roughly touching her genitals,"My 20mo grabs at her genitals whenever she's naked (which is often as it's warm outside and she's toilet learning). She yanks on the outer labia and pokes at the inside. It looks rough to me, though she doesn't seem to care. I keep her nails trimmed so she doesn't scratch herself. I'm hesitant to stop her because I don't want her to feel shame for being curious about and exploring her body.   What's an appropriate reaction to this? I want to teach her it's ok to touch her own body, but she should be gentle so she doesn't hurt herself (Is she cognitively able to understand that if it hurts she has to stop? Can she make this connection?)and there are appropriate times and places to do this. What language should I use? "
1976,What should my collgeaue do to stop her 20 year old son from smoking?,"What are some ways to stop a 20 year old boy from smoking? We know that smoking is bad and cause all sort of cancers (such as lung / heart / throat cancer), are there ways to stop or discourage the boy from smoking?  My colleague's son saw his grandfather smoking and wanted to follow in his footstep, even though my colleague and her spouse do not smoke. My colleague even scolded her father for smoking in front of her grandson.  Are there any solutions to this problem? "
1977,How to handle a toddler's infinite cycle of hand washing - getting hands dirty - putting hands in mouth,"My almost 3 year old nephew keeps touching the floor, dusty corners, door mats and other generally not too clean things around the house. We do try to always keep a watch on where his hands are going, but a split second is enough for him to dirty them. (He doesn't respond to a ""No"" either, if you want to stop him, you've to physically do so). And then we wash his hands. And repeat.  Its worse when this happens in the middle of nibbling some snacks. He's at an age where he wants to eat everything on his own instead of being fed. He has a bite, runs around and touches some dirty stuff, and comes back for the next bite. Even if we wash his hands then, the same cycle is going to repeat before the next bite.  I'm not sure washing hands every 10 minutes is efficient or healthy, specially during the cold seasons. We do keep the house as clean as possible, but there's always an errant corner or doormat.   a) Should we not care too much about the dirty hands and eating with them? We haven't had many cases of an upset stomach.. But I don't know if its because we keep cleaning him up, or because a toddler's body is equipped to handle things being put in the mouth all the time.  or b) Should we keep up with the washing hands every time he gets them dirty? If so, is using a hand sanitizer better?  or a different solution altogether? "
1978,"Son 22 asks me how to deal with a friend with benefits, so that she does not get hurt","So my son is seeing a girl as of a couple weeks ago.   They go out salsa dancing a lot, which both like, and take salsa classes together. He told me he made it clear to her that a relationship is not possible for him. He just came out of one and just knows that he does not want a long-term relationship now. Friends with benefits is fine though.  The girl, on the other hand, was telling him that he must tell her as soon as he has something with someone else, and then she'll end it.  Do you see the problem with interests here? The relation they have between each other is not right from the start. From experience I would say, it is rarely the case that boys and girls want the same thing. So, this is not a such a big surprise is it?  My son wants other girls. So sooner or later this is bound to fail anyways.  So his question was actually:  ""Should I try to make clear to her, all the time, that we are not together, so when I actually meet someone else the final punch in her face will be less brutal or should I say/act not related to this and one day surprise her with the news that I was with someone else?""  Additionally, he asked me this:  ""I really like her, so if I have something like a one night stand with another girl I don't want to lose her for that. What if I just keep it to myself?""  I felt a bit lost. What kind of advice would you give to your son? "
1979,Visiting my mother causes problems for me. How can I handle her behavior and attitude better?,"My mom has a puppy dog, who is a lot of fun and I enjoy taking on walks. However, he’s not very well trained and tends to chew things up. On a number of occasions he has taken my shoes and hid them or chewed on them. My mom told me I had to put them on the stairs leading up to my brothers room (my brother still lives with her) out of the dogs reach. On a number of occasions my brother has gotten mad when I leave things on a chair or on the stairs and throws them around the house.  Tonight when I went to visit this happened, and I couldn’t find my shoes. My brother went to his room and closed the door and when I asked if he knew where my shoes were he didn’t reply. I told my mom that I couldn’t find my shoes and needed to leave and she said to go pound on my brothers door.   First thing that bugs me is, whenever the dog has gotten into my stuff or my brother has moved it, my mom laughs and has a very flippant attitude. Second thing is, I don’t know what to do in situations like this? On one hand it is my brother’s fault for moving my belongings without asking me. On the other is that my mom probably should train her dog better so I don’t have to leave my stuff in awkward places. I don’t really want to be caught in the middle.  I eventually found my shoes and my brother had moved them not to far from where they first were but still enough so I had trouble finding them (he basically put them underneath a near by pile of shoes). The first thing my mom said was “so whose fault was it?” I find this question very immature and don’t want to play the blame game.  Also my mom had asked me to take the dog for a walk earlier. I told her I didn’t really have time and she said “just a 5 minute walk”. I agreed but when I wasn’t able to find my shoes I told her if I don’t find them in 2 minutes I won’t be able to take the dog for a walk. Since it took more like 15 minutes to find them, I ended up not taking the dog. My mom said if I’m going to act this way I’m not allowed to come over. While it’s true I was mad for having my stuff hidden, I wasn’t really mad at her and know that I can choose not to walk the dog. I told her to remind me not to come over as we usually don’t get along.  I know it kind of sounds silly as this huge ordeal was over a pair of shoes, but still they cost $200 and I use them in my running group (most of my shoes aren't the expensive). Also the dog (and my brother) has gone after my jacket, which has my cellphone and keys in it, so I see this as a very serious problem.   I find I communicate with my mom best by email so I’m thinking of sending her this.     Hi mom,      If I come over could you please ask me to take the dog for a walk in   the first 15 minutes of my arrival? Otherwise I might not have time.   Also, I can say no for any reason and this needs to be ok.      It’s happened a few times that valuable items of mine such as my shoes   have been misplaced or (almost) damaged by the dog or my brother. I   can’t afford this. What can be done so this doesn’t happen? Until this   gets solved I won’t be coming by your place to visit.      Thanks, snowchym   As per my other questions I have a bad relationship with my parents. A few answers suggested not seeing them (as much). I believe there is some natural instinct on a person to want to see their parents, so how can this be dealt with? I feel like I know I shouldn't see my parent's, as it usually ends badly, but I keep forgetting. A friend of mine blocked his parent's phone numbers which I don't think is a good solution.  I forgot to mention I haven't lived with my parent's for 6 years, though I recently moved back to the same city they are in so I'm seeing them more. "
1980,How early should I start thinking about cloth diapers?,"My girlfriend and I just got pregnant, she is eight weeks in. I have been reading a lot about cloth diapering, and I was wondering if it is too early to start thinking about this. Here are my questions:   Should I start with disposables at birth, then move to cloth when they get bigger? Should I start with cloth right from birth?  How difficult is it to use at birth?   Really I am just looking for advice on this. "
1981,How to make a 3-year-old eat?,"   Possible Duplicate:   How can I get my toddler to eat as well for us as he does at daycare?       We have tried to feed her but when she is really hungry she only drinks milk and goes to sleep. We have waited for a while to wait for her hunger to rise, but that does not happen. We have waited for a few hours and she would only eat a few salad pieces and then run away, so waiting is ruled out.  I have tried to compose a poem and sing to my child and she did take food. Diversion and competition has worked so far like      Eat or else your sister will eat your meal etc.,    How have you attempted to make a child eat? "
1982,Is the 'naughty chair' an effective strategy to punish children?,"I am a great skeptic in punishment in general as the most common methods seem to become irrelevant when the child grows up (confiscation of games, threats, verbal or corporal reprimands...). Since all these methods will no longer be present when the child becomes an adult and leaves the home, it seems to be that they will not be long term solutions.   What I mean by this is if you confiscate a game when a child does something wrong, when he is older he will know that if he does that activity there will be no punishment as he is no longer at home and so will be tempted to revert to negative behaviour.  An idea that seems to make more sense to me is to deal with negative behaviour by isolating the child in a 'naughty room' or 'naughty chair' and encourage them to think about why they behaviour was bad. When a certain amount of time has elapsed the child should be asked why they think their behaviour was bad and, if they can't figure it out by themselves, it would be explained to them as an anecdote or story.   This way when they are out of the house and tempted to do such negative behaviour they will remember the reasons why that behaviour is not necessarily a good idea based on factual anecdotal evidence.  Thus, my question is: Is this method sufficient and effective? (I am particularly interested in views from parents whose children have now moved out, or young adults who have moved out from home.)  Related question: What are the advantages and disadvantages of time-outs? "
1983,Should I worried about my son's development? Or maybe my son's right brain is dominant?,"My son is almost 3 years old now. Compared to my neighbour's son who is only a month older, my son seems to have slow development. The neighbour's son is able to speak just like the parent. He can do counting, logical thinking (if a then b will happen.) It seems that my neighbour's son has advanced cognitive development. On the other side, my son is:   Still having trouble in communicating. If there is a three syllables word, he usually only can say the last syllable. A very sensitive person, it seems that he is a moody person Still often use his left hand rather than his right hand The one I like is he likes to play kind a lego toys. He likes to build anything, but used to get angry by himself if he fails to build it He likes music very much, when he hears music, then he will dance automatically   Should I worry about my son development? I read an article that described Roger Speery's findings about right and left brain. Perhaps my son is right brain dominant?  If it is true, based on this article, he might face problems following along in common school which is dominantly for left brain kids.  Am I right to be concerned, and is there something I should be doing? "
1984,Homework for 10 year-old,"How do I make my 10 years old boy to do his study with interest? That is, how I can make him have passion for studies?   Also he seems little less mature to his age. If I ask him to do some maths some and study 1 chapter of science he will finish it off in 10 minutes.   To what I check whether he has studied well or not. This cycle goes on and on.  If I just leave him his grades will go  down.   I am really confused - how to make him study?  "
1985,Culture differences,"I am looking here for some opinions, if you think what I did was OK or not in your country/culture.  We have a baby (4 month old) that has trouble sleeping (very light sleeper). We are trying to put her for a nap three times a day and each nap lasts around 40 min. It takes usually 15-20 min to make her sleep (rocking, lullabies etc.). The baby sleeps on an attached bed.  Scenario:  The baby is sleeping (20 minutes already), the mother is beside the baby, the door is closed, with light background music. The grandma (mother of my wife) needs a bag weight scale and is outside the door and calls the mother. Each call is getting louder cause she doesn't get a response... Now I am downstairs hear her calling and I tell her that the baby is sleeping... (I am sure that the Grandma knew that the baby is sleeping as the lullaby song was on and door closed, but she still insisted on a response)  They tell my wife that I was extremely rude to do that cause I would never tell an older person to ask to be quiet...  Also, it was not like that they needed the scale right now. They were making already bags but only going to the airport in another week...  I think this is totally non-sense and I think that I have the right to say or ask them to be quiet in that case.  What do you think? How is it in your country/culture? "
1986,How do I stop my daughter from hitting another child?,"Recently my daughter started to hit another girl with whom she is currently sharing her nanny. My daughter is 2 years and 2 months now, the other child is 1 year 3 months. The nanny was our daughters only nanny until 5 months ago, when we started sharing with the other family. We had a few trial days and it was perfect, but after a few proper days it became clear that our daughter is not very happy with the arrangement - probably she was jealous.   A few weeks ago the problems grew more serious, and our daughter started hitting the other girl much more often. Part of the reason might be that the younger girl is interested in everything around and in particular in the toy that our daughter is playing with (natural at this age I guess), so our daughter was fighting back. But now she became so aggressive that the nanny and all the parents involved are very worried: often she would attach the little girl when she just passes by or waves her hand.   We are trying to figure out how to improve their relationship and how to make our daughter stop violence. Gentle explanations don't seem to work - I believe she understands she does the wrong thing, she says sorry, kisses the smaller child etc., but 3 mins later the same thing happens again.  Could anyone recommend anything we could do about it? And what could make it worse? The real question is should we try to punish our daughter in any way (e.g. do time-outs: stop the play and take her to the other end of the room for a short while), or is it going to have the opposite effect? "
1987,Fast swinging or rocking,My little one just turned 2 months old. When swinging in the swing or when I am rocking him he likes to be swinging fast and rocking fast...I don't mean normal fast he likes to go FAST! Is this normal and why do you think he might like this? He cries until I go fast and then settles right down. I am not sure why. He does seem to have colic and cries more than the average baby. Any one have this happen with their child?? 
1988,My 10 year old daughter punches her legs when she gets angry or doesn't get her way,"When my daughter gets angry, she makes this mean looking face and then starts punching on her legs. Should I be concerned about this behavior? I do tell her to ""stop it"" and I would ask her, 'Why is she punching herself?'. She would respond with, ""because I am mad"".   Is this a problem that may become a much bigger problem as she gets older? "
1989,2-year old started resisting going anywhere,"Months ago, my now-2-year-old boy would happily come and let us put his shoes and jacket on and walk out of the door with us.   Now, when we tell him it's time to get ready or time to go, he'll run away and want us to chase him (we don't feed this behaviour), hang back, wander off in another direction, demand a treat—basically do anything to prevaricate and delay.   It takes forever to get out of the house. On occasions when we just have to go, the only option is to pick him up and force him through the process, with screaming and struggling.    What's going on? How to address it? "
1990,Why does TV/video aimed at young kids contain so much songs and music?,"Why does TV/video aimed at young kids, say between 0-5 years, contain so much songs and music?  Both the intro och the credits almost always contains a song and more often then not the characters sing a song or two as well.  Do kids differ from us adults in that they appreciate songs more, or can they more easily understand/grasp a message that is singed? "
1991,How big should solid food for the infant be when doing baby-led weaning?,"Our son has been supplementing his formula with solid food for several months now.  We started him on simple cereals (rice cereal, oatmeal, etc.), then added basic jarred baby food.  Now he's eating blended jarred baby food, and we've been giving him selected ""adult"" food off our plates on occasion.    Toast and french fries/potato wedges appear to be his favorite foods, mostly because he can easily grip them and enjoy them for 5-10 minutes at a time (before they become too mushy and disintegrate or he drops them).  He has no problem ripping off small pieces to chew (well, mostly gum; he has his 2 front bottom teeth, with his 2 top front teeth just coming in), but sometimes the pieces he gets are much bigger.  My wife constantly worries about him choking, and starts whacking on his back any time he shows any difficulties.  What information I could find on the subject (for example) seems to indicate ""easy to grip"" is a good criteria for baby led weaning, and that gagging is ""their way of moving food around in the mouth and don’t panic"".  That site in particular highlights a variety of photos of very young children eating adult-sized portions of everything ranging from broccoli to pork chops.  I've seen other sites that state that babies should only be fed solid food if it is in tiny pieces, to avoid choking.  How big should solid foods be?  Is toast a choking hazard?   "
1992,How to deal with a separated family as an adult child when my parents want me to spend more time with them?,"I am a 23-year-old male, my father is working in Town B (for about 2 years now) and he tries to come home every weekend (Friday night - Sunday night), so it's just me and my mother at Town A during the weekdays.   I don't know what I'm feeling at the moment, but I feel very angry and confused, not directly at my parents but somewhat indirectly at them. When I go to work, I keep thinking of my mother and I feel guilty (although it is not my fault) that she is alone at home. Sure she has friends but she can't seem to keep herself occupied for the whole day, and she resorts to watching TV. I also feel guilty when I want to stay back later at work and come back home at 8pm instead of 5:30pm-6:30pm, as I want to accompany her. Also, during weekdays after work I might have gatherings and outings with friends and I would come home normally around 11pm+. So my mother will be asleep and I won't see her until the next morning briefly. This has lead to me cancelling some of the events that I attend with my friends as I want to spend time with my mother.   Then the same problem comes on the weekend. I normally would have my own plans on the weekends to do my own things, but since my father moved to Town B, I always feel guilty if I go out on weekends and not spend time with my parents/my father. So this has led to me also sacrificing alot of my own plans.  In short, I just feel so constrained by my parents and both of them even made some remarks about not seeing me a lot during the weekdays//weekends. I get so angry and fustrated because I want them to understand I am not a child and I have my own life now. I don't go out for the whole day/go out excessively, it's just maybe in the morning and afternoon I've got my own plans with my friends and such but I do try to come back for dinner with them or at least one meal a day. Even then, it's not enough for them and they would like to me to spend the whole day with them (ever since my dad moved to Town B to work). Moving out is not an option at the moment because of my finances, but even so, if I did move out it would cause more guilt as my mother will be living alone.  How would I deal with this? Is this my fault? Or should I put aside all my emotions and do what I please. Should I confront my parents? I was thinking of it, but I don't think it will change anything. "
1993,Which music is suited infants and toddlers?,"I wonder which kind of music is well suited for infants and toddlers.  I'd assume those criteria are important:    the change of loudness is not too big (so that the child does not get shocked by a sudden fortissimo) the music is not too dramatic and ""bombastic""  (like e. g. Richard Wagner's Operas)   My questions:   What other criteria make music suitable for a child? Can you give examples for music matching the criteria?    I'd assume that some classical music might be well suited, but for sure there might be alternatives.    Background: our son (9 months old) is often bored and I think he might enjoy music, but I'm not sure which one to take and how to select. "
1994,Disciplining a special needs child,What should a parent keep in mind when it comes to discipline and children with autism? What about children with learning disabilities? 
1995,Can Not Speaking Be Due To Just Plain Refusing To Speak?,"I have a 20 month old who quite clearly understands spoken language and commands. He communicates with pointing, shaking his head for yes and no, and he says, ""da"" (his one and only word) which does not mean daddy, rather it means ""hey I have something to tell you"".   He has had no signs from an ENT specialist, 18 month autism inventory, or other medical indications of speech impairment, and his hearing has been measured as a-ok a few times now.  Also, despite starting to walk sort of late, he is quite mobile; but he would prefer to be carried most of the time rather than to use his own two feet-- he throws tantrums to demonstrate this point.    Do some children just refuse to start talking because they don't feel they have to?  Could only saying ""da,"" and nothing else, be a refusal to speak as opposed to physical development issues? "
1996,"Should my children steer clear of the ""bad kids""?","My kids are 9 and 7, boy and girl, respectively. They're nice, spunky, forgiving, and open-minded. They're hardly perfect; they're also sassy, sarcastic, and demanding.  Because of their willingness to play almost any game with anyone, we know a lot of people. Unfortunately, there are a few kids with moderate behavioral problems--and perhaps a conscious or unconscious ability to manipulate--who like spending time with them.  When I say ""bad kids,"" I mean disrespectful to adults in general especially a parent, conduct issues such as petty theft or aggression, emotional disinhibition such as tantrums over minor issues, entitlement issues such as we have it better than them, and a general lack of age-appropriate empathy.  I want my kids to make good choices about peers, and we talk about how easy it is to do ""bad things"" when you see other kids doing them. The worst culprit, I gave my kids the choice, and they agreed to not be friends with this boy. He was violent with my kids.  But there are two others that fall just short of violent aggression. My concerns are   Where there's smoke, there's fire. A child with serious problems on the periphery is probably worse when you really get to know him Peer pressure. At 9 And 7 I'm not too worried about sex and drugs, and in the long run my kids will have to make their own good decisions by high school--there is still a lot of trouble preadolescents can get into. Scapegoat. Bad kids love to spread the blame to make themselves look less bad. This manipulative approach can cause emotional harm in and of itself. Risk of physical harm. Bad kids are far more likely to freak out and cause physical harm over a mild slight.   I don't want to frustrate my kids, but I'm struggling between guidance and restriction. Should I actively tell them ""Johnny can't be your friend""? And if that's the case, do I passively ignore requests for play dates, or do I lay it out to the child's parents? "
1997,How do we break the cycle of misbehavior when trying to discipline our 3-year-old?,"My wife and I have gotten into a bad habit with our 3-year-old.  When he misbehaves, sometimes he bites or otherwise physically assaults one of us in frustration, particularly when we are telling him he cannot do something he wants to do.  We will then tell him he shouldn't bite, that it hurts, and then he'll laugh at us and act as if it's a hilarious game.    These aren't little bites or hits, mind you; they're very painful, and they often make the recipient quite stressed out.  Further stressful of course is the laughing and gamboling about.  This usually happens when he's a bit tired (and thus hyper).  We will then make some effort to take him to a time out, but it won't work; it will devolve to that parent having to physically restrain him to keep him from running around and ignoring us, which just leads to another biting or hitting incident, and the cycle repeats.  We're well aware that essentially none of this works, but we haven't been able to come up with something that does, and is reasonably doable during these times.  Our son is pretty mature and able to be talked to when he's not over tired, and normally behaves quite well; our discipline usually only has to be occasional time outs, and the worst thing he does on a normal day is complain too much that his screen time is over.  But when these incidents occur - probably 2 times a week - it's a completely different story.  Once we do get him calmed down - often after getting him to go elsewhere - he's able to understand that he shouldn't lash out in frustration and talk about it, but getting to that point is what we can't seem to do in a calm manner.  We've discussed all sorts of options, and don't really like any of them.  We don't like having nonimmediate penalties (i. e., removing privileges), as he's just barely three - from what we've read (and seen) he isn't old enough to understand them.  We're considering star charts, but we don't have a lot of confidence there; the core of the issue is that he gets tired, either because he misses his nap (which he does fairly often, as he's not a good napper) or just because it's 7 or 8 pm.    What should we consider to deal with these outbursts?  What works well with otherwise well behaved children who have lost control over their behavior? "
1998,Is it ok for my baby to sleep in his swing?,"I have a Fisher-Price baby swing that my 7-week-old is spending a lot of time in :) I've found that I often put him in wide awake, and a short while later he's soundly sleeping. Is it ok to leave him asleep in the swing? Is there any reason to move him to a crib or bassinet?   "
1999,How do I help our 3/yo go through stress,"We have a 3 y/o daughter. A few months ago her and I thought it would be best to try and work out our differences by moving into separates homes.   Since then my daughter, now 3 who has always been a really good kid, has started acting out in ways than seems like regression. She is peeing on the floor, yet been potty trained for quite some time, hitting kids at day car, and throwing sand at other babies. It seems like an obvious sign of her stress with our separation, but I don't really know how to handle it. My wife I am brainstormed for ideas and came up with a few, but I wanted to reach out to the parenting community also and and for any thoughts, insights, ideas or suggestions.   Its not a problem about lack of discipline or she would always act like this. From my perspective this is a transitional problem and an overwhelming inability for her to cope with so many changes using regular methods.  Some ideas we came up with:   Set firmer boundaries. Connect with her more individually, when she is only with one parent, lots of one on one time. Be attentive as she needs, give here extra guidance and support right now. Undistracted time and attention. (i.e. no tv, or work while we are with her)   How can we prevent this?   Help remind her of our expectations. be close when she is around the cat or people to help her do the right thing and physically stop her from hitting if need be. No kid wants to keep hitting or feel out of control.  remind her to pee often or offer diaper if necessary. Lots of patience, love, and empathy.  talk openly about changes to house and routine and how it's a hard transition. let her know she can feel sad, mad, scared and she is always safe with mom or dad and we love her unconditionally. Verbalize what she can expect for the day (i.e. we will be together until after your nap, then you will go see mom.) self care for myself and my wife to prevent added anger and frustration. She needs us to be as calm and loving as possible in order to feel safe. More time outside to get fresh air, sunshine, and play in the dirt. Try to have more fun with her. laugh, play, lighten up a bit.   Any other ideas or suggestions? Thanks everyone in advance for taking the time to read this! "
2000,What's wrong with Dr Seuss?,"Our toddler is about the right age to start enjoying Dr Seuss books, and I don't see anything wrong with them (I had one as a child which I loved). But my own mother (despite this) hates them, and so does my partner's mother (who's a speech therapist).  So what's wrong with Dr Seuss? Is there a concern that these books inhibit speech or language development? Or are they just seen as too silly? "
2001,23-month-old no longer napping in her crib,"My kid is 23 months old and turns 2 in 2 weeks. She is able to sleep at night on her own since we used the cry-it-out method late last year. She usually has one 1.5-2 hour nap after lunch. However, she has been refusing to nap in her crib for the last 2 days. She can't go to sleep on her own for her naps so I have to hold her for about 10 minutes before putting her in her crib. It used to work but the past 2 days, she'll sleep in my arms but will wake up the minute I put her down.   Anyone else faced this or know how I can help her to nap in her crib again?  We recently came back from a 4 day overseas trip. On that trip she napped, but the timings were not the same. However, the 2 days after we came back, she was able to nap fine. So I'm not sure if the issue is caused by the trip or a 2 year old sleep regression. I'm under the impression that a sleep regression is refusal to sleep. However, she's not refusing to sleep. Just wakes up when I put her down.  Update: She stayed asleep for her nap when I put her in her crib on Sun and Mon. Thought I was out of the woods, unfortunately I was wrong. Last 2 days I couldn't put her down so I tried cry it out. First day she cried for 50 minutes napped for 40 minutes. Woke up crying. Second day cried for 50 minutes and napped for 50 minutes. Woke up crying. Anyone know if the duration will get longer and she will not wake up crying? She didn't wake up crying when I used to put her down. And her naps used to be longer. "
2002,Should we use a smiley chart to reward/punish our toddler?,"   Possible Duplicate:   How to operate a successful &ldquo;Star Chart&rdquo;?       Our nanny came up with an idea today to create a sort of table for our daughter, where they would draw a sun or smiley when my daughter behaves well and a sad face otherwise. Then we (the parents) would discuss the table with our daughter, offer her some sort of reward when there are many smileys, and explain that we are upset when there are many sad faces.   Does it make sense? Are there any risks with this kind of approach? "
2003,Dangers for children that adults might reasonably ignore themselves,"What are some health risks specifically for children that an adult might not be so concerned with? I am looking for things I may have forgotten or never even known about that are much more harmful to young people than adults. Such as lead abatement which, according to the Department of Health, is an acceptable risk for an OSHA compliant worker but it is detrimental to the development of children to even be in the building during it.  Sprung from this question, How can I get rid of mosquitoes? concerning the possible harm to children by the indoor use of a CO2 emitting device. Having no parenting knowledge myself, and many nieces and nephews who visit, I am wondering what other types of household risks I might be overlooking. I know they're more apt to scald themselves, the tank is set to a proper temperature. Ultimately, what things might be fine for us adults that we take for granted, but not children? "
2004,Is rewarding hard work for chores with money necessarily a bad idea?,"Growing up my parents had a system where harder chores like mowing the lawn, shoveling the driveway, and vacuuming meant that you got more money in your allowance every week.  It worked great for our family because my sisters didn't mind that I made more allowance since I was always outside on the weekend doing chores, and it taught me the value of hard work.  If my sisters were trying to save up for something they would jump at the opportunity to vacuum the entire house.  I think this system prepared me for the working world where those who work hard are rewarded for it.  But after reading Is bribing children with cash incentives a good idea? it seems like there is an overwhelming amount of people discouraging this.  Am I missing something? "
2005,How do I address lack of tact in a 4 year old?,"This morning, I dropped my son off at pre-school, and he introduced me to one of his new friends.  He then, loudly, and right in front of this friend, proceeded to explain how this child ""gets upset all the time about everything"" and ""constantly complains"".  While I don't know if this is true or not (my son has a tendency to fixate onto negative behavior in others to a sometimes obsessive degree), I don't believe it matters.  I simply want my son to understand that saying things like that are rude, and potentially hurtful.  I tried telling him, on the spot, to stop saying those things, because they weren't nice, and he kept interrupting me to explain that it was true (""but he does!"").  I understand that ""tact"" is a subject some people never fully master, so I don't expect my 4 year old to fully understand it immediately, but I would like to see what can be done to improve his basic understanding of the concept.  How normal is this behavior?  Is there anything I can do to curtail it, or, better yet, avoid it altogether? "
2006,How to explain to my children their mother's cancer?,"My wife is surviving (so far) an aggressive form of cancer called leiomyosarcoma. She's just had a second test after sugery removed the tumour, and we are waiting to find out whether the cancer is re-occurring. We'll know that in two weeks; my wife looks upbeat but she is fearful.  Meanwhile, in the next few weeks my daughters, 18 and 16, are having major end-of-shool exams (in the UK, A-levels and GCSEs repectively). Good news are good of course, but the probability of bad news is not negligible, and in that case, the information will arrive in the middle of this key moment in their life. The scan took place as they were at school, so they don't know the results are supposed to come in at that time.  I am certain that we must hide it from them until exams are over. The question is, how? What do we tell them afterwards? "

2008,How to deal with the toddler who is not least interested in listening to the stories I read or listening to my talks?,"Considering: In what way does reading story books to babies help them (besides falling sleep), and at what age should it be started?  and  How to motivate yourself to read stories to a kid whom you know cannot understand and respond accordingly?  The kid is 15 months old. The kid is hyperactive - always keeps on running around, picking things and throwing them down, and constantly babbling.  The problem is that I have bought story books with lots of text and no pictures for her. Intension is to let her ""hear"" the story and thus get her language improved.  The best way to get rid of the child is to start talking to her or start telling her stories. The moment I start, she turns away and starts minding her own business. She is not least interested in hearing when I talk about my day at office etc.  Then I bought big story books with big pictures and little text. The kid was definitely interested - in grabbing the book and tearing it off.  How to deal with the toddler who is not least interested in listening to the stories I read or listening to my talks? "
2009,Traveling with a 5 and a half months old for a whole month; options on strollers?,"We will be traveling soon for a whole month in Japan with our five and a half months old daughter and we are considering buying an umbrella stroller for the trip. We have a Bugaboo Buffalo at home and we are still considering if it's best to just travel with it instead, but taking into account its bulkiness, weight and the whole lot of horrible stories of airlines destroying strollers, I am more and more doubtful.  There are a bunch of questions that still plague me about using an umbrella stroller (albeit a mid/high range price one):  • The best strollers I am seeing do not recline completely horizontal (though they recline a bit) therefore in the specifications they say minimum age is 6 months. Do you think is OK to use them with a 5 1/2 months old? Anyone have a similar experience? Or could it be problematic for the muscle development of the child?  • We will be traveling for a whole month, so is expected that our daughter will spend a fair amount of time on the umbrella stroller, even combining it with a carrier (at least she will use it for couple of hours every day). Is this type of stroller OK for this amount of use? I wouldn't do it with a cheap umbrella stroller, but hopefully a better one would be almost as comfortable and good for the baby as our regular day to day stroller.  Thanks in advance! "
2010,How often is it okay for a kid to become ill in kindergarten?,"My son, age 4 (in two weeks) went to kindergarten this year. Not even a month has passed, and he's been ill twice. The first week was fine, the second - he was coughing a lot and had a runny nose. A barking type of cough. He stayed home for a week and then went back on the third week. And on Saturday he began coughing again, so is staying at home this week too. Now, I know that children in kindergarten catch colds more often, but this often? We have friends with kids who go to kindergartens and our son gets ill more often than the others, hands down.  So, I guess, my question is: is that normal? "
2011,My son started kindergarten and doesn't like writing his name. How should I think about this?,"My son did his first day of kindergarten last Friday.  On his first day of school he came home and said, ""I had to write my name lots of times on sheets of paper. I didn't like that.""  My son is perfectly capable of writing his name. (Two years of preschool and 4 years of childcare gave him a pretty good idea).   He came back from his second day of kindergarten today, and that was his first comment.     ""How was school"".       ""I had to write my name a lot"".    Now as a parent you have to rein in your paranoia a bit, and try and use good judgment. (This is a particularly small sample size). The challenge is that you want your kids to have a great time at school and drink it all in.   On the other side, this might be a normal experience for boys in infants school where writing is hard work. (I recall years of pain doing cursive writing). It might be that sitting still all day is hard work as well.   (I'll note that my daughter two years older loved kindergarten).   The thought still lingers. Do I need to help my son get better at writing his name? Can I encourage him to delight in it? Is there a way I can make it fun? Should I just get over myself and not worry about it?  My question is: My son started kindergarten and doesn't like writing his name. How should I think about this?  EDIT: I wanted to thank everyone for their comments. His sister was at a friends place yesterday so I took him out for a milkshake. He confessed he'd made a mistake the first time he wrote it and didn't like that very much. He also hangs out with his best buddy from preschool, and he said his buddy likes to complain about having to write his name. We're all good! A rambunctious, slightly self-conscious five year old boy living life with his mates. "
2012,Should bad feelings of a child not be mirrored?,"Considering: Why is trying to talk children out of how they feel a bad idea?  and  My son started kindergarten and doesn't like writing his name. How should I think about this?     I do not agree with the current trend of validating every single feeling a child might have. I think it leads to entitled adults who think that their feelings are above everything else, adults who think they have the right not to be hurt or offended, ever.      There's a difference between acknowledging a child's feelings (""I understand how you feel and why you feel like that""), and telling them it is OK to feel like that when it isn't.      It is OK to feel hurt when someone insulted you. It is OK to feel sad when your friend moves to another town. It is OK to feel anger when you see someone abusing somebody else.      It is not OK to feel envy of your friends toys. It is not OK to feel rage because you didn't get cake for dessert. And it is not OK to feel apathy because you had to write your name 5 times back at school.      Sure, it's not easy for a child to discern when it is OK to feel some way, and when it isn't. That's why we parents are here: to help them learn.   What about the ""bad"" feelings of the child? Should they be mirrored or not? What do studies say in this regard? "
2013,What is good way for me to learn how to suppliment my child's education? is almost 5,"I want to learn how to help my kid with school. I don't know how to motivate him to learn. He says he wants to make things (just like his Dad). I would like to start with basic skills, like ABC's and Math. What materials do I use? How do I learn how to teach? "
2014,How to encourage a child to self-edit and take criticism positively?,"Our eight year old daughter writes well for her age, and has produced some really spectacular pieces in class. She's not terribly interested in writing for fun at home, though. When she does, what she puts down is often pretty awful, even by the standards of an 8 year old.  Over the weekend she spent some time putting a poem together and she's really pleased with it, and proud of what she's done. Today she wanted to take it into class and show her peers and teacher, but honestly, a lot of it is drivel.   I put her off by saying that some of it is very good (which is true) but other bits could use some more work. She's not going to let it drop, though: she wants to know which bits need work, and why.  The truth is that most of it would benefit from rewriting, but I don't feel I can tell her that, nor would I want to squash her enthusiasm. She's very easily deflated and prone to taking even gentle criticism very harshly. But it's terribly frustrating: we know she can write so well for her age, but she has no concept of self-criticism, so often doesn't.  While I've given a specific example here, this is a topic I've started to struggle with as my kids have grown up. With little ones we've offered unreserved praise for all their efforts. But at what age is it reasonable to expect children to start to take critical comments constructively, and to start being a little self-critical about what they produce? How can parents, generally, encourage this process, especially with kids who don't tend to take it well? "
2015,"What to do with a child that won't sleep, to the detriment of their day?","There are many questions on here asking about sleepless children but my wife and I are starting to come to our wits-end and none of the advice we've found (here or otherwise) seems to fit our situation or no longer works.    I think this is because as our four and a half year old daughter is getting older her will and determination is getting stronger. She is a rather stubborn child and, to be fair, she gets that that from both parents. We've read most common advice and tried it all.  Here is how this plays out.  My wife and I follow our normal night-time routine, starting at 7:00 PM.  We sit down and read to both of our children* and they get a final, small snack while we read.  After corporate reading and snack, we head to potty-time, brush teeth, and put both kids to bed.  For our daughter, this involves reading a short book, singing a song with the lights out and walking out of the room.  My wife and I rotate who takes which child every other night.  This has been a mostly-successful routine but, progressively as our daughter has gotten older and smarter, she's found ways to try to get out of bed and come out of her room.  I'll spare the stories but she's smart enough to discern potential parental ""loopholes"" and will try to exploit them.  After a round of two of sending her back to bed, she resolves to laying in bed from 15 minutes to an hour and then cuts on the lights to read.  Let me be clear-- the 7:00 PM bed time routine is very-well crafted. Wait until 7:30 PM and, based off of behavioral observation, you've waited to long and she'll be over tired.  On those nights you know the task of getting her to bed is going to be a struggle involving tears of at least 2, if not 3, individuals in our household.  We've tried to follow the advice of other's and just ignore her behavior that happens in her room. Usually she quiet and not causing problems.  We have no clue how often she does this throughout the night, but on multiple occasions we've found the light on in the middle of the night, and she's surrounded by books or toys.  Also, she will wake up early in the morning if she hear's me getting ready.  I leave the house at 5:30 AM, and she's often up with lights on, some times clothed and ready to start her day!  This wouldn't be a problem but all of this sleep deprivation is starting to dramatically effect her attitude.  After a couple of good AM hours, the tiredness starts to kick in and she becomes cranky and hard to deal with, and understandably so.  She's exhausted!  We've long given up on a nap time because that became a fight over a year and a half ago.  Instead, it's a ""rest time"" where she has to be quite and in her bedroom for an hour where we encourage her to read on her bed.  About once every  2 weeks she will nap (and nap hard.)  Those become good evenings because she get's some of the catch-up sleep she desperately needs and we'll often put her to bed closer to 8:00 PM because we don't want her to go to bed and not be tired.  Sorry for the rather long post but the bottom-line is that our child is refusing to rest at night time if she can prevent it.  When we catch her awake, we try to cut off the lights, and reset the room to a sleep-time state. This always results in an angry toddler, who often ends up crashing, usually within 10-15 minutes of us cleaning up her room and cutting off the lights.  My wife and I are fit to be tied.  Our rather well behaved &amp; good daughter is stealthy and hates sleep.  However, this comes at the expense of my daughter (and wife's) day-time sanity.  What should we do?  Is there a point when we should see a doctor about this?  IMHO, this is completely behavioral stubbornness but you can't force a child to sleep.  This is an issue of control and the kid just won't sleep, and no amount of consistency, routine, loving reassurance, or autonomy seems to help her help herself and GO TO BED.  *Our other child is a 2 year old boy.  We have no problems with him and his sleep routine.  He doesn't sleep as much as the average child his age but he does handle our routine well and sleeps when he should sleep. "
2016,"Bully broke my sons bone, what next?","While at school my son has been getting bullied by a boy. They are both in 6th grade and used to be friends until recently, not the boy bullies him. Today I got a call to come get my son because he had been in a fight. At the time my son was in pain but it wasn't bad. By 8pm he was sweating really bad and in a lot of pain. We noticed a large lump on his collar bone and knew he had broken it. We took him to the ER to confirm his collar bone was broken and to get him a sling,  the limited but proper treatment.   Tomorrow he is staying home but I plan on going to the school to speak to the dean. I wanted to get feed back on the proper way to handle this situation.   What happened? In short, the boy snatched things from my son then pushed him really hard into a car. This broke his collar bone. A teacher saw it happen before my son got to react other than running from the boy.  File charges? Should/can I file assault charges? He is only in 6th grade and I don't know of i want to be the person to give him a record. Though he did break my son's collar bone while bullying him.  Who pays the medical bills? I do not feel we should have to pay the medical bills. The boy did this to my son, is the school or boy's parents liable?   Should I get an attorney? Is the school or parents liable? Who will ensure proper justice is served? This will cause unneeded stress in my families lives between restriction on my son's activities to financial costs and missed work. Am I getting a head of myself?  Proper school punishment? Should the kid not be punished? Should he be suspended or expelled? He is in all of my son's classes so he will always be around him.   Is there anything else I should know or consider?  Kind of answer I was seeking. I was not looking for legal advice. I wanted to hear from another parent who had unfortunately went through a similar experience and how things worked out. Maybe some opinion on if I should drop the ban hammer or show some leniency because they are young kids.  UPDATE: The Outcome The boy will have 7 days of suspension, the school will pay for anything my insurance won't cover. They will monitor the situation between the boys to make sure there are no more occurrences. We are not pressing charges due to boys being boys. If something else happens I will explore more serious action. "
2017,How to make my 3-year-old tell me that he needs to use the potty?,"My little boy has just turned three years old. I have only just recently stopped the nappies, but my little one doesn't like the potty. I've worked on that he sits on it with his tablet watching kids programmes and he uses it.   The only problem is that he only uses it when he wants to, most of the time he will just pee anywhere he is stood and I know they do that and accidents happen.   I just get frustrated sometimes as I'm asking him every 5 to 10 minutes if he needs to go potty. I have also done a sticker chart for him but that isn't working either, he still just goes where he wants.   Am I doing something wrong here? Can anybody give me some ideas how to get him to tell me he needs the loo, even though I'm asking him every 5 to 10 minutes if he does!? Any help will be appreciated!  "
2018,What are some games that I can play with my toddler son?,"I'm a little at a loss as to what I can do to better play with my son.  He's my first one, bright, energetic and very inquisitive.  What are some games that I can play with him?  How can I learn to better interact with him? "
2019,How long should a pediatric dental cleaning take?,"Due to some insurance changes we switched our children (ages 9 and 16) to a different dentist last year.  The new dentist is a pediatric dentist who only sees children.  Our prior dentist was a general family dentist who saw the whole family.  Our prior dentist is a bit old-school:  he does everything himself and seems very thorough, with routine cleanings typically taking 45 minutes to an hour for everything including X-rays if needed.  I was pretty surprised that the pediatric dental cleaning appointments seemed very short.  I timed our last one.  The hygienist spent a total of 9 minutes polishing and flossing my daughter's teeth, followed by less than 5 minutes with the dentist who did an inspection and applied fluoride.  Is it fair to judge the new dentist based on the duration of the cleaning?  My initial reaction is that it can't possibly be as high quality or effective as our old dentist.  But then again, our old dentist is certainly outside of the normal curve of typical dentists, maybe we are just accustomed to his lengthy and perhaps over-the-top thoroughness.  Maybe he is more thorough than he needs to be and is pushing the cleaning past the point of diminishing returns.  If it is fair to judge based on the duration of the basic cleaning procedures, how long should it take?  If 9 minutes is too short, what is appropriate...15?  30?  Are there accepted standards of practice for what constitutes ""good enough""?  I understand each situation is different and calls for different degrees of cleaning.  But this is a pretty ""normal"" case where the child has good brushing/flossing habits and is going in for cleanings every 6 months. "
2020,"Soft drinks, at which age I should let child to drink",My 4 years old daughter like to drink Coca-Cola and when her grandpa was around she was permitted to drink 100-200ml of carbonated drinks. Should I forbid her drinking soft drinks? What could be appropriate age to consume carbonated or soft drinks? What should be permissible quantity of that drinks?  
2021,What do I tell my child about her Asperger autism?,"My child has Asperger's syndrome. She is high-grade enough that she has been going through school and she speaks and sort of makes eye-contact, but it is clear to her and everyone that she is 'different', and she needs help.  She has been asking for some time ""what is wrong with me?""  She is 13. Teenage socialisation and sexualisation are next...  How do I tell her what it means to have AS? "
2022,How to approach my adult son and his ex wife about my son's likely fatherhood of her baby when both deny it?,"My 21-year-old son is newly divorced. He and his former wife hate each other a lot. Recently, his ex wife started posting pictures on social media of her baby boy just born in November.  Which would have made her pregnant a few months before their divorce and before my son left their home. I look at this sweet baby and he is my son's twin. It's hard not to notice. See, my son is half vietnamese and caucasian and his wife is mexican. And this baby has asian features - my son's features.   The baby's mother posted on a social site: ""I never want my son's father to ever see him or even hold him. I don't want him to even know he exsists"". And my son refuses to even look at a photo of the baby. I simply asked the mother if the baby was my son's and she got mad and then blocked me on all her social sites and said she's sorry but we can't have communication anymore.  How can I approach this situation without overstepping my bounds?   Is it wrong of me to want to know if this baby is my grandson? Is it wrong to want the chance to love him and be a grandma? Or should I just let it go, since both mother and my son deny it? And if it's not wrong of me, how should I address this issue?  "
2023,Am I giving a bad example to other people's children by buying junk food in supermarket?,"I'm an adult woman with no kids and no intention of having any, but I am a bit concerned about other people's kids.  Today in the supermarket I decided to buy some potato chips, among others. While I was queuing to pay, I noticed that in front of me I had a mother with her kid (who, I guess, was around 6-7 years old, in case that is relevant), and that their shopping contained basically healthy stuff.  Then I wondered if in such a case I'm being a bad example for the kid. More concrete, in case his parents are really trying to teach him good eating habits, is there a possibility that I'm inadvertently contributing to jeopardise this possible good teaching?  If so, would it be appropriate to avoid if possible having kids near me while queuing in the cash desk if I buy some junk food again? Or am I overthinking this situation? "
2024,Are vitamins supplements required for young children?,"Do I need to add vitamin supplements to my 4-year-old's and 2-year-old's diet? Currently they like pasta, noodle, cheese, rice, carrots, broccoli, chicken and eggs. I'm wondering whether B group supplement will benefit them since their father's side had some B deficiencies before. Does general vitamin supplements for toddlers do good?  "
2025,Is there evidence to suggest that young boys articulate their learning differently to girls?,"My son came home from the first week of kindergarten. Each day I asked him:     ""What did you learn at school today?""   His response:     ""Nothing.""    When I ask his teacher what they've been learning - she said:     ""We've been learning the letters C. A. and T. ""   My daughter two years ago could tell me each letter she learned each day in kindergarten, and the mnemonics and stories they had for each letter.   From recollection - my mother would ask me as a child      ""What did you learn at school today.""    Externally I would say,      ""Nothing.""    Internally I would think,      ""I don't think you're really interested. If you were, you'd make me a milkshake, sit me at the table and ask me. Then I could really concentrate on answering properly.""   My question is: Is there evidence to suggest that young boys articulate their learning differently to girls? "
2026,should i buy my toddler a punching bag?,my 4yr old loves play fighting punching a bit too much. was hoping this could provide him a healthy outlet as an alternative to my body which is getting tired of a beatdown.   is there a danger that it could lead to more punching attacks? or could it diffuse them?  
2027,What to do after my nephew showed a graphic video to my 9-year-old son?,"My 12-year-old nephew ""Bob"" took my 9-year-old son aside and showed him a video of ISIS beheading a victim. I am just flabbergasted that Bob would do that. Interestingly Bob did not show the video to my older child who is Bob's age. I suspect this is because my older son would stop him and inform the adults immediately.  My 9-year-old made me promise not to tell Bob off or to complain to his mother before he told me about the incident. I am not close to this nephew but understand from his mother that conventionally ""scary"" stuff does not bother him. Ghosts, blood, gore etc.   However I am very disturbed that he showed it to my little kid, and only to my little kid. Shouldn't he know better? It makes me feel like I should not leave him alone with my younger child. I shared my concerns with the grandfather, however grandpa is more concerned about Bob's wellbeing (he is losing weight) than my son's! Grandpa feels that it was just thoughtlessness on Bob's part.   Am I overreacting? If my older son had done that, he would have received a real shelling from me with phone privileges removed and the sender of the video blacklisted.     Update:  I realised what bothered me most was how manipulative Bob was. Bob basically sat my son down, said it was something that may be scary and he had the choice of whether or not he wanted to watch it without telling him it was a graphic video. When my son came to me, he emphasized that it was his own fault for deciding to watch it, and Bob was totally blameless.   After reading through the various responses and mulling for a few days, I finally sat my son down and told him    nephew did not really give him a choice and he should smell a rat in future if anyone present him with incomplete information there is no shame in walking away from such videos at any point in time  it was most definitely not his fault for watching it and to never pass such videos on.   I decided not to inform the parents as they are unlikely to do anything beyond mild chiding and I suspect Bob's dad treats him similarly, which is another can of worms. In other words, informing the parents will either make me angrier as a parent or reinforce an unhealthy environment for Bob.  "
2028,How do I get my daughter to spend less time at the computer?,"   Possible Duplicate:   What can I do to encourage my 12 year old son to do more productive things?       My daughter, age 13, dominated the ""public children laptop"" which was meant to be shared with her younger brother. The summer finally came upon us, but she had gotten sucked into the laptop and spent almost all day on it; watching anime 60% of the time, playing the MMO runescape another 30% of the time; and otherwise skyping her friend from school.  For better or worse, the laptop's screen was just cracked and is now virtually unusable. I see this as a good opportunity for her to go find a hobby, activity, etc. that she could really like or maybe even be passionate about.   What i need are some sites, ideas, or books that will help her discover some new things to do that she will like to do more than watching anime. Any pointers? Thanks in advance!  if this helps: she also likes to.....   Draw, and learn to draw from youtube Make things out of colorful ductape Spend time with friends about 2 days of the week be creative NOT do anything requiring hand-eye coordination  "
2029,Handling toddler aggression towards my child,"My 2yo daughter was playing on a playground, rotating on a kind of one-person carousel. A 2.5, maybe 3yo boy approached her, obviously (to me) wanting to sit on it and use it. The boy immediately started hitting my girl on the head with open hand. Before his parent approached and stopped him, he managed to score a few hits. I didn't intervene, since there was no real danger of her being hurt and I usually try to let her resolve her own playground ""trouble"". They used to be toy-grabbing problems until then, however. Afterwards, she looked at me, puzzled, showing me how the boy had hit her (gently hitting herself on the head). She's one of the non-violent, passive kids. She won't hit anyone, she doesn't bite or hit when she's angry. She will sometimes try to grab other kids toys when they are using it, but most of the time she sticks to those left free.  A day after that I started thinking and reconsidering that situation.  Should I have intervened? Stopped the boy hitting her? Shown her that such ""violence"" should be met with appropriate reaction? Or was I right to have let her handle the situation on her own.  What impact did my lack of action have on my daughter? Will she feel ""unsafe"" with me because of that? Will it encourage any reaction from her in case such thing happens again?  What would you have done? "
2030,How early should I start learning my baby bedtime routine?,"my baby is 2 month old. I want know when I should start ""bedtime routine"" ? and also when make him sleep in his room ? now he sleep next to me, is it correct to take him sleep on his bed or should I wait? "
2031,Is my infant boy's scrotum too large?,Our infant is now 8 weeks old.   When his legs are joined together the scrotum hangs through them and below the legs (can be seen  below his bum). The doctor says it's fine but others who've seen him say he has a larger scrotum and we need to consult someone.   I dont know what problems this might signify and what other questions I should be asking the doctor?  Does this reduce over time ? 
2032,Is one big burp enough after feeding my infant?,"I've read in many places that I should burp my baby for 5-10 minutes after feeding What I'm wondering is if it's ok to stop once the baby gives a nice loud burp, even if that was only a few seconds? Where does the 5-10 minute number come from? My interpretation would be ""until a big loud burp or 5-10 minutes if you don't hear one"". Thoughts? "
2033,Should I stop my 2-month-old from sucking his thumb?,"My 2-month-old has recently discovered his thumb. He used to often suck his hands, normal baby behavior, and occasionally would ""find"" his thumb and happily suck for a while - usually when he was starting to get hungry. However, in the past few days he has started to suck his thumb much more often, almost constantly.   At first I let him do it because it was occasional, he seemed to enjoy it - and because a 2-month-old sucking his thumb is just adorably cute :) But now I'm starting to get concerned. Should I leave him and assume he'll grow out of it, or will this just let him cement the habit and suck his thumb for years to come? (I really don't like seeing 3+ year olds still sucking...)   If I should try to discourage it, what can I do? Should I just leave him alone? And if not, what are some ideas to break the habit?  I've tried pulling out his thumb and sticking in a pacifier instead (which he doesn't seem to take too often)... but a minute later I'll pass by and the pacifier is out, and a minute later the thumb is back in. (I'd prefer an addiction to pacifiers than to his thumb, considering that pacifiers can be taken away... Thumb-sucking is a much harder habit to break.)   I did look at the 2 following posts, but found that my situation was different, hence my question:   When should an infant stop sucking on her hands? How to prevent children from sucking their thumb?  "
2034,5 year old lying and stealing,"My 5-year-old son has recently developed the habit of lying and stealing. All of this in the span of 2 weeks. It started with him getting a small toy from his school classroom. We made him understand that it was not ok to take things without permission from school and that he should take it back and tell his teacher the truth. He nodded and did as told.   The next day we found a twenty dollar bill in his pocket and upon asking, he admitted to taking it from our bedroom drawer. This time we punished him by cancelling his skating trip. He was sobbing and promised to never do it again.  And again today he brought a piece of candy home (which had his friend's name on it) and made up a story as to how his teacher gave him the candy and had mistakenly written his friends name instead of his. When we pushed him into telling the truth, he finally said that he took it from his friends bag when they were in the bus. This time I really felt like spanking him but somehow kept my composure. He has again promised not to do it again. But we are worried. We do not want this to turn into an habit and have tried all forms of explanation (lovingly and sternly). What should we do next? IS there something to try or is counseling the only option? "
2035,"Toddler, almost 2 years timeout not working","My son is nearly 2 years old and a bit hyper. Sometimes he is openly defiant and when we correct him he sometimes hits.  I have been reading that with timeout you want it to be 1 minute for each year of the child and that they have to sit still and be calm before you start the countdown.  This is impossible for my child. He just won't sit still and will escape the dark quiet room. If you lock him in or restrain him to your lap then he violently explodes in a vicious 10 level tantrum every time. I try to wait him out and after over a half hour of screaming he becomes hoarse and gets so upset that he starts to vomit. That or in his thrashing he bangs his head on something really hard and becomes a danger to himself.  I can't put him through that anymore. Is timeout not effective for every child? If so then what am I doing wrong? If not then what is another effective way to correct bad behavior like hitting?  Note, I am not going to spank my child. I will only swat his hand if he is doing something dangerous and I want him to associate pain and danger with something. "
2036,My daughter bites her nails - me too and my husbands says its my fault....?,"My 4 year old daughter recently started biting her nails. Not seriously short or bleeding but I never have to cut it. I've been a nail biter since I can remember but now my husband says she is biting because I bite mine. I have a 11 year old son as well and he doesn't bite his nails....I was just wondering - is this really my fault? You know...monkey see, monkey do?  "
2037,My father just gets mad when there's a problem instead of trying to resolve it,"I think it's best to tell the story before asking the question.  I live on my own now and my dad said I could have a spare bed he has. I didn't ask he offered. I am very grateful for this, beds cost a lot of money. He arranged a time to drop it off and I was home waiting for him.  He got really mad that my old bed was still in my room. He had agreed to help carry the new bed up the stairs so it seemed logical to assume he would help carry the old one out. But he insisted it was my responsibility to already have the old bed moved out.  I admit, maybe it was my mistake. I certainly didn't intend harm. What I didn't like is how he started swearing and telling me I should yell at my landlord because I'm doing her work. We got in an argument and I told him he can go yell at my landlord if he wants because in my opinion she has done nothing wrong.  He got mad and helped take my old bed out but left without helping put the new one in. He even commented how he's screwing me over.  It turned out I was able to carry everything by myself so that was no problem. If I had known my dad was so against carrying the old one out I could have got someone I live with to help or a friend. Or I could have just put the new mattress on top of the old one.  My dad then sent me a text message saying how manipulative I am and how I'm just using him. It then occurred to me, I am just using him. He's a very unpleasant person to be around and whenever I see him it's because he's offered to do something for me. If he hadn't freaked out at me I would have been happy to have a conversation with him and relax.  So here are my questions:   My dad owes me an apology. How do I get it from him? I need/want more respect from my dad (and my mom) how should I get it from them? Fail that, how do I effectively distance myself from my parents?   The above (and my other questions) are examples of my dad's continuing behavior. I guess we're living in the same city now so that's why it's on my mind. I can't help but notice a lot of answers to my questions seem to take my parent's side. Why? My dad blatantly swore at me and because he had offered to do something for me isn't an excuse. Anyone who thinks it is, is childish them self.  "
2038,Why is my 4-year-old child more aggressive now?,"My child recently turned 4 late this summer. We've noticed he has been more aggressive lately.  Background: I've pretend wrestled, boxed, and sword fought with my child before his third birthday. I started to see signs of him testing his limits outside of our pretend plays; one thing he would do is rush at me for a take down without warning or punch or kick my wife out of nowhere. I told him he can only display these behaviors when we're rough-housing. If someone bites, pinches, hair-pulls, punches, or kicks him after he warns them, and if an adult is present, to let them know; if that child hits him again, he can defend himself. So far, there have been no known cases of him harming another child at the daycare on campus at the University. They are very strict about children being physical.  At home, he is different. He continues to his aggression. My wife and I have come to the conclusion that it might be because he has too much energy. In his first three years, we did outdoor activities everyday since we were able to have enough savings to care for him for those years. Afterward, we are now back full-time working or studying. Monday to Friday, he stays at daycare from 8 AM to 5 PM. From 5 PM to 9:30 PM, we dedicate quality time with him since work or homework stays at the workplace or school; we finish before we pick him up at the daycare.  When he rushes, jabs, or kicks us, I tell him to stop in a calm demeanor that carries disappointment and he knows what he did is inappropriate. Wife raises her voice at him which I remind her sometimes that that's not necessary because he laughs when she reprimands him. We tell him that it's disrespectful and he needs to stop doing it. We follow that with different ways he can vent his energy. He tells us he's sorry for his action and lets us know next time, he will stop, breath, walk away, and then he will feel better. Later that day or the next, he does it again. Either we are not getting through to him or he is at an age where he wants to see how far he can push our limit. We stay consistent each time for the last few months that this have gotten to be a daily thing.  One thing that has worked is when we take him outdoors like how we used to, he gets all his energy out of his system. He wakes up for a nap, we take him out again because he is full of energy and loves the outdoors. We work/study full-time so it's a challenge to do outdoors on weekdays.   Sometimes we feel we need to get a TV, cable television, and allow him to watch movies. Other times we feel he should  be able to play his tablet more than two hours per week on the weekends.  Is him testing how far he can take his actions a sign of his developmental stage or are we not doing enough? We are not doing something right, what can we do to help him control his actions? Are we going at it the wrong way? "
2039,13-year-old sister dating elder (16 y.o. or more) guys,"To begin with, I am 22-year-old girl who studies far away from home town for 4 years by now. All my family lives in Russia, if this is important.    I have 13-year-old sister whose relations with our parents are not that good. To understand the situation better, the dad behaves like he's only interested in TV and occasionally our school marks; the mom is more emotional, but often gets captious towards my sister. One more problem is that I was a ""good child"" (excellent marks for every subject + afraid of parents scolding me so very obedient). My sister is not that good at school and more rebellious, perhaps because everyone used to tell her how good I was in comparison. So she often gets scolded. We are not very close with her, just chatting from time to time.  Earlier this year, I noticed on social media that she seemed to keep company (more probably, she had a crush on him) with a boy whose age I don't know but he seemed no less than 16 year old. There were some... objectionable groups on his list -- with vulgar pictures of ""loli"", anime style preteen girls. Then one day she asks me to block him (we never talked about him before, he doesn't know me) because ""they had a quarrel so he can send me some slander about her"", maybe fake nudes or so. I told her whatever he sends it's him being disgusting, not her, and parents won't know and I won't shame her even if there were real nudes. The guy never contacted me.    ----------  Then soon after this story she meets a guy in her school. She    doesn't tell parents but mom sees them walking together near our    house. She says he's 16 but his social network page says he's    18 (usually in Russia school graduates are 17-18 year old), though he of course can put fake info on his page to look elder. He    looks older than 16, but who knows. She denies having him as    boyfriend but she changed her last name on her page to the same as    his, and her profile pic is them taking selfie. Well, not going into    details, it's obvious by her page that she at least has a crush on    him or they are a couple.     Then one day dad sees them just staying together on stairs next to our apartment door (in Russia, residents usually are unfriendly and suspicious to anyone spending time there, almost no one does it) and yells at the guy, telling him that he shouldn't be seen there anymore. It's the first time dad sees the guy. Dad always yells a lot, of which I am afraid but my sister isn't.   Then one day mom comes home earlier than usual and sister doesn't open the apartment door (so mom has to wait on stairs) for some minutes which is pretty uncommon. When she eventually comes in everything seems ok but the restroom door (very close to apartment door) is closed. She proceeds to the kitchen and hears the apartment door closing. Clearly my sister had a guest she didn't want mom to see. Mom decides not to talk about it with my sister but calls me the next day being worried that my sister had sex with that guy.   Then sister tells mom the teachers grumble about her having ""just a friend"" elder than her.   And this guy also has ""loli"" groups. And my sister too. Perhaps it's popular in teens nowadays. Then mom gets a sneak peek of sister's messages (I think it's absolutely wrong, but it was mom not me) and sees something about this guy having problems with his sleep due to some drugs (for context -- ""light"" drugs like Spice or naswar are sometimes heard to be used among ""bad"" teens in Russia; drugs are illegal here but sellers often hire teens as couriers). I don't know the exact text mom has seen. Supposedly my sister doesn't know mom saw her messages.   ----------  So what should I do now? 1) Can I somehow discourage her from having affairs with older guys at that age?   I've heard it's common for teen girls to like boys older than them, but I feel that 16-year-old boy being interested in 13-year-old girl is creepy. My sister is definitely not too mature for her age, neither in mind (not the kind of a kid who's bored with coevals) nor in body (very slender, tiny breasts). What I'm afraid of are ""unequal"" relations when he can press on her ""being elder and thus knowing better"". What makes things a bit worse, I have a boyfriend since I was 14 (he was my classmate), so if I tell her something like ""maybe it's not the time"" it may sound like some double standards (even if it's not, she's 13 and having a crush). 2) Should I hurry to tell her about contraception?   My parents think that there's no need to tell children about sex (it's quite common in Russia: they told me nothing and always avoided the theme, so it was me who told my sister about menstruation). No sex ed in school also. Now I feel I have to tell her about contraception but we're not going to meet in person until summer at least. Before that I can visit them for a week at most, it's expensive but I have the money. Mom won't ever tell sister those things (I asked).  Moreover, I'm probably the only relative who can ever say to her she can have sex before marriage and even have an abortion if she doesn't want the baby.    Or is it too late to do anything? I guess, for instance, if I tell her withdrawal is not safe at all but the guy tells her it's safe and he doesn't want condoms, she will listen to him, not me. And so on.    TLDR 13-year-old sister seems to have 16-year-old boyfriend. Can and should I do something?  Obviously it shouldn't be my problem, but the parents prefer to either be angry at her for keeping company with any boy or pretend nothing happens (that's their strategy when she has problems in school). But I feel things aren't alright and it's wrong for me to just look. Or am I wrong?  P.S. Feel free to ask if something is unclear: my English is not so good. "
2040,Toddler extremely reserved around others,"I have a 21 month old daughter. She started talking when she was about a year old; right now she's extremely talkative and energetic around us. My wife has been a stay at home mom since our daughter was born and I also spend plenty of time at home interacting with her.  We noticed that in any environments where there are other people, she becomes very reserved. At first we thought she was just a little bit shy and she'd get past this once she becomes familiar with other kids and grown-ups (we're not very social either although, once she was born, we tried to change this).  She now knows all of the other kids on our street, she talks about how she'll play with them and always asks us to go outside and play with them. Every once in a while she actually does play with them and she even becomes talkative. But, most of the time, she doesn't do anything, she only wants to sit in our arms, staying quiet the whole time.  Is this normal behavior? Is there any way of getting her to open up and start interacting more with others? "
2041,How to enrich my “everyday” vocabulary as an ESL parent in the U.S.?,"How to quickly acquire the ""everyday"" English vocabulary needed to communicate with my preschool child? I am an immigrant IT professional who speaks fluent English, but who learned his English as an adult. My child was born in America. I can easily communicate on work-related topics. But when my child asks me ""What is this?"" or ""What are you doing?"", I often find myself at a loss. For example, I am playing a tune by drumming with my feet, the child asks ""What are you doing?"" -- and I say ""Err.. I am making music by..."" [Hitting? No; Knocking? No; Stepping? With? Ugh...] Instead of a single word, all I can offer is a lengthy explanation that relies on technical or generic terms or ill-suited synonyms. With other adults that had been OK, but not with a preschooler. A related problem is figuring out pronunciation while reading children's books aloud. I've never heard these words spoken! Is there some online resource, a textbook, or a word/phrase list that I can memorize? Something more efficient than writing out phrases by hand from hundreds of children's books? Thanks!  (PS. I do speak in the native tongue too, but unwilling to curtail the rest of my child's development for the sake of bilingualism.) "
2042,How to help my 11-year-old daughter who is confused because she likes a girl?,"My 11-year-old daughter came to me and told me that she thinks she has feelings for another girl. She explained it as she has the same feelings for this girl that she has had for a boy all school year. By feelings she explained that she gets kind of nervous, happy, and her body just feels funny when she is around the girl and also the boy she likes. This girl is also one of her best friends. All 3 of them are in the same class at school and all 3 sit at the same table together. She is very confused as am I. I have tried to explain to her that her body is going through all kinds of changes because of puberty, she is getting older and growing up.  She told me that she has talked to her other two best friends at school about this. And one of the friends told her that she has felt that way about another girl also but she just told herself didn't really feel that way or couldn't feel that way because she also liked a boy. Do you think the conversation with her friends confused her also?  I don't know what to say or do or how to help her. I just want her to continue to feel comfortable enough to talk to me. What do I say or not say to help her? How can I help her understanding her own feelings when she doesn't understand them herself? I don't want to make her uncomfortable.   She is very open with me and her father. She has always been very open with her questions about boys, problems that she's having, and questions about her body. She has asked me to tell her Daddy about all of this because she wants to be honest with him but she is afraid that he will see her differently. How do I explain this to my husband when I do not understand all of it myself?  I need advice on how to process this myself and how to help her when she can't make sense of what is going on with her body? "
2043,Getting real answers from a 3 year old,"Whenever we ask our 3-year-old an open-ended what or why question, he will usually just ask ""Why?"" or ""What?"" back. Examples:  (He wakes crying at night. We go in.) Why are you crying? ""Why...?""  (He seems like he doesn't feel well.) Do you not feel well? ""Yeah"" What doesn't feel well? ""What...?""  If you expand on those, e.g. ""Does your tummy hurt?"" he will just answer Yes, regardless of whether it actually hurts.  He's very well-developed in terms of speech, so it's not that he doesn't know the words. Are these questions just too open-ended for him to be able to comprehend what the actual ""answer"" is? Any way to help him develop this skill, so he can tell us what's actually wrong? "
2044,How should we address stuttering in a toddler?,"My 2.5 year old has recently developed what can be best described as a stutter.  It only seems to occur with us, and mostly when asking a question (""Wh, wh, wh, wh, what's that Daddy?). It's especially pronounced if he is tired.  It doesn't concern us greatly yet, he's happy and sociable. In fact it doesn't tend to occur around strangers.  Update: He's started to garble whole sentences recently, again mostly when he's tired, but he's also started getting noticeably frustrated.  His vocabulary is very wide and still growing quickly - if anything, it feels like his mouth can't keep up with this brain!  Is this similar to others experiences - how did you approach it? Should we ignore it (for now) and make no special effort, or would simple speech therapies help?  Update - 2.5 years later: It was just a phase, passed in a few months. He's near top of his class for reading, writing and spelling (phonetically or not).  As suggested in the great answers (and common with so many aspects of kids growing up), keep an eye on it to make sure it's not an early warning - but don't panic :) "
2045,Suggestions on making reading fun for a 10 year old girl,"What are some suggestions on making reading fun for a 10 year old girl, that dislikes reading?  When I tell her to read a book, she thinks it's a punishment that I'm making her read. I try to explain to her that reading is fundamental and also builds your vocabulary.   Added Info From My Comments Below  She sees me reading everyday, not a day goes by without a book in my hand. Her peers enjoys reading. I also read aloud to her. The books she has available here at home are, 'Monster High' (Dolls and cartoon character) books. But are these types of books good to read?! She is currently in the fifth grade, but she is on a third grade reading level. I'm assuming this is what strays her away from reading. She definitely is struggling, but this is why I'm searching for answers because I don't know what else to do to get her to read so it can build her reading level up. "
2046,How do I put my child in time-out when we're in public?,"What is the recommended thing to do when my kids are misbehaving in public?   For instance, I have had situations where they are yelling and throwing stuff in a restaurant, or the other day they one was pulling the other one's hair and hitting him on a store. I've usually taken them to the car and put them on their seat while I myself sit on the front, but I'm not sure this is working as well as time-outs at home.   Are there some special techniques for time-outs in public places? Or should I be doing something completely different? "
2047,How can we potty-train our pre-schooler outside the home?,"We're having problems with our 3.5 year-old boy concerning potty training:  Since his birth it seems, that being cleaned is much more unpleasing to him than running around with brimful diapers for hours, other parents always said that their kids even request fresh diapers themselves, as they can't stand it, if it's full. For him, that seemed to be no problem. Not only that he did not let us know, he even denied it if we asked him directly if he has poo'd in his diaper.  He is now in the kindergarten for 9 months and it is especially pronounced there: He he says when he needs to pee but does not say when he needs to poo.   In contrast at home it works very well: He runs around without diaper and since some months he reliably goes to his potty in time and is even proud of his poo (we are also honestly and happy with each of them landing in the potty and show him.)  However, when we are in town or somewhere on the way, he would not tell me that he needs a toilet, fills his diaper clandestinely and normally would not tell me - sometimes even deny if I ask him, if ""something is in his diapers"".  My questions:   Does anyone else have similar experience and how could that be solved?   More information:  I often tried to talk to him (and the kindergarten teacher) why he does not go to the toilet in time or at least tells somebody if it's too late already. From his comments (and my experience) there are several possible reasons:   He fears to loose his toys or that someone destroys e. g. his building brick construction when he goes away to the toilet (the kindergarten teacher then tells him that it will be still there for him, when he comes back).  He is ""too busy"" (does not want to interrupt playing). He does not want to disrupt a group activity like singing or reading a story or lunch by saying that he must go to the toilet He seems to not like the little toilets in the kindergarten, but I could not find out why. At home he has his potty and seems to be happy with it. In the kindergarten this is not possible unfortunately (not even an exception, otherwise all other kids would also want their potty being there). The kindergarten teacher however assured me that she even checks for him it its clean before he goes in. Maybe it is his way to gain some extra care and attention by the kindergarten teacher. He said to me once, the other (mostly older) kids are saying ""ick!"" if he has a full diaper and if it stinks. So it might be embarassing for him what happens, but that seems not to help him to get rid of the situation... Getting cleaned seems to be unpleasant for him, but surely it gets worse if he run around in his full diaper for an hour or more and he also knows that. He knows perfectly well that it might be less painful if he told us sooner, but he does not. If his full diaper is ""detected"", he then proposes on his own that I shall clean him in the shower instead of just taking a wet washcloth which might cause pain for his (then) already red skin)!   We had tried it without diapers in the kindergarten for some time (some months ago) but we gave up, as we had again and again several dirty trousers per day and so he has diapers in the kindergarten.  It adds to the problem, that his digestion seems to be somehow special, so he sometimes poos a great amount at once [the last two days we had dirty trousers for this reason, although he had worn diapers! it just flow out, as he did not tell anybody so that he even had to take a shower in the kindergarten] and on other days it's the frequency, so we have up to 4 more or less small amounts of poo per day.  The kindergarten teacher which is his psychological parent is very friendly, nice and cooperative and I admire her patience. However, she is at a loss with the situation as we are - she says she talks to him nearly each day about that, but it does not seem to change anything.  Our son is quite clever and often knows quite well what he has to say as an excuse to get out of something, so it seems to be even possible that he might be ""manipulating"" what he tells me about what happens in the kindergarten or about his reasons not to go to the toilet.    Edit The problem seems to be solved - however we'll have to see if it is a permanent solution.  One day, 2 weeks ago, it happened that the diapers in the nursery went out (for children older than 3 years, the parents have to supply them and we were not informed that there were not enough any more), so the kindergarten teachers let our son stay some hours without diapers and he managed that without big ""accidents"".  I seized the opportunity and asked him the next morning to go to the nursery without diapers. He agreed and now he is without diapers in the nursery since one week and it works (apart from some small accidents with poo'ed underwear, but sh*t happens ;-)).  Also when we were in town or in the circus in the afternoon, I let him without diapers and it worked very well, he was able to control himself and the pants stayed dry.  So that seems to be big step forward. Sure, this is only for one week now and there might be ""relapses"", but we're optimistic.  (Of course, when he sleeps he's not yet aware of peeing and needs diapers, so that will be the next step when all works well reliably during daytime.)    Edit 2:  At the moment, there are many ""relapses"": wet underpants during our trip yesterday, later at home even a small poo in the fresh underpants, today poo'ed trousers and underwear in the kindergarten...  All that was in the course of a series of days with really bad ""mood"", where our son quickly overreacts if the slightest thing is not exactly how he wanted to have it. We used to have that often in the first 3 years until some months ago when those phases seemed to get shorter and less pronounced.  We'll have to see how it continues...      Edit 3:  (2 months later) Well, we finally have made good progress: We've been on holiday abroad for 2 weeks with our son and everything worked perfectly well (during daytime): he went to the toilet together with me and also told us on his own if he needed a toilet. No accidents at all. :-)  The diapers were only needed for the night, where he apparently is not aware of peeing before it starts. So because of the lack of washing and drying facilities we did not want to risk wet beds.    We'll have to see how it will work now back in the kindergarten...  Edit 4:  5 days at home, 3 poo'ed underpants. :-( At least he seems to tell us by himself now, when the underpants are dirty. ... It's not over yet.  Edit 5: Well, we had 12 days with no accident (neither at home nor in the kindergarten), and then 2 days with ""accidents"" (but small amount of poo in the underwear) again...  ... and now even 2 big ""accidents"" (one at home and one in the kindergarten).... :(    Edit 6: (2 months since Edit 5 and 7 months after original question)    We had some phases where everything went well for some days, but already before christmas the number of accidents in kindergarten increased. During the christmas holidays at home it went quite well (apart from 3 ""accidents"") and then back in the kindergarten we're now moving step by step backwards ... Very full panties, tights, ... and we don't see any regular ""pattern"". The worst is, that he still mostly does not tell the teachers if the pants are dirty and that he even often is lying and denies that he has to be cleaned and then even spreads it more and more everywhere in his clothes.    Edit 7: (10 months after last edit and 1.5 years after original question)  Our son is now 5 years old. We had hard times in between - it got better, than it got worse again, we had many problems with the kindergarten, because the kindergarten teachers were not willing to support us any more and finally wanted us/our son to wear diapers during the day again - which he did not want (and we did not want either, because then there would have been no more motivation to go to the toilet at all...).  We had consulted different doctors (2 pediatricians, one ""expert"" for digestion who proved to be a charlatan which made some very expensive but totally useless analysis and convinced us giving our son medicine to ""stabilize"" the gut flora... with no effect at all).  Finally, by hazard we heard the term ""encopresis"" and with this new search term, we found out:   it is an illness there are specialists (doctors) who know about it (before, no one understood us or our child - neither in the kindergarten nor the pediatrician..., nobody took us seriously, everybody thought about psychological causes for the problem - the child ""seeking attention"" by his behavior... ) we went to a special ambulance for such problems   We learned from the doctor,    that our son must have had obstipation, which finally explained why he always made very small amounts of poo in the underwear - sometimes several times a day, which we had considered being diaarhea that our son has to learn to control it and that it may take a long time...   So since some months now, we are doing a toilet training, which means:   after each meal (breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack, diner) our son has to go to the toilet and stay there for 5..10 minutes for each day, he did that (no matter if pants got dirty or not!!!), he got a sticker which he could paste on a kind of calendar sheet (one field for each day) for documenting how it worked we had a list marking when it worked well and when it didn't (e. g. he refuses to go to the toilet after the meal or also what happened when (poo, pee, in the toilet/pants...)   We apologized to our son for setting him under pressure and for having him punished because of the dirty underwear...  Now it works much better, there are only small amounts of poo in the pants maybe every 1..2 weeks, but no large ""accidents"" any more, where a large amount of poo is distributed everywhere in pants/socks....  One large problem we could not solve up to now: our son does not tell us/kindergarten teachers directly, if he has poo in his pants... in the kindergarten he might hide it for hours, at home if playing or activity is too interesting, he won't tell us... that's a big problem for us..  EDIT 8 (10 months after last edit and >2years after original question)  things did not change much since the last edit: in general it works quite well (with some ""accidents"") but there are phases, when it does not really work any more: small stains of poo in the underwear nearly daily, rarely a large amount and nearly never he tells anyone to help him :(   EDIT 9 (5 months after last edit and about 2.5 years after original question)    not much news: often it works quite well, but there are phases of sometimes several weeks, where there are at least small stains of poo in the underwear 2..3 times daily and nearly each day and even sometimes a large amount... Situation in the kindergarten is still difficult, there are sometimes problems with young or unexperienced teachers (mostly interns) which show even less understanding for the problem than the experienced teachers... And he often avoids being ""caught"" and hides himself, so that my wife or I have to clean him when we pick him up and often he's apparently been around with dirty pants for quite a long time there... The therapy in the specialized hospital has brought us forward a lot, but it is still very hard to cope with this issue and the consequences.  .. as he'll soon go to school, here's my new question: How to deal with Encopresis in primary school?    EDIT 10  (10 months after last update, 3.5 years after original question)  There followed many difficult months - if my notes are correctly the longest durations with no soiled pants were about 7..10 consecutive days, and there were phases where it happened several times per day and also on the following days..  After the time in the day care was over, it also continued happening during our holidays when he was at home or when we were on holiday travelling.  Positive: he now (during the last 2 months) told us much more often when he needed help for cleaning and he sometimes also felt that he needed at toilet before it was too late. Even when invited on a birthday party he told to a parent that he needed help (we're very proud).   We were very concerned how it should be when he would be going to school in autumn. We informed the teachers in advance. Up to now all went quite well, it was only once that he had a soiled pants during school hours, maybe a dozen during the daycare after school and some more in the afternoon or during the week end.  The longest ""clean"" phases without soiled pants were about 2..3 weeks, and there were not many of them. :-(  So the problem is still not solved, but it is much reduced and we get along with it much better now, but it is still a burden for him and for us and restricts his life:   he/we can go nowhere without having some backup underwear with him (or placed somewhere) if no one from us (parents, grandparents) is with him, we have to talk to the adults he'll be with and have to rely on him telling them by himself if he needs help in case of an ""accident"" nocturnal enuresis is still there     EDIT 11  (2 years and 10 months after last update, 6 years and 4 months after original question)  Our son is nearly 10 years old now. We still have the problem, that he sometimes soils his pants. I've given up trying to do statistics or understanding something. It just happens sometimes (estimated every 7..10 days). Luckily, the cases when the amount of poo in the pants is high seem to happen more rarely, but they still happen. And he still often ignores it and just walks around like that until his mother or me smell it and tell him to clean himself.    It happens especially often in situations, where he (I suppose) just not wants to listen to the signs of his body (and in consequence go to the toilet), but concentrate on something else - e. g. birthday parties of his friends or our family, play dates when he has invited friends to our home or is invited by a friend, ...  I let him wash his pants himself.  He also still has no control over bedwetting at night and still needs to sleep in diapers.  During the last years I came to the conclusion, that he very often ignores the signs of his body and has to learn to take better care of his body and his body's needs (like not ignoring hunger and not forget eating because he wants to play or work on something, ...)  Summary: General remarks for other parents from my experience  (3.5 years after original post)  What I learned during those difficult years (which are still not over):   don't blame your child, just calmly help him clean up things (without any negative comments about how much work this is for you)! relax (I know how difficult this is!!) and try to avoid the stress which such situations can cause to you and your child, because this stress even can make things worse in a vicious circle seek help from doctors and psychologists I try to help my son to build self-confidence and learn being positive about his life and his chances. I now start believing that there are very often (if not always) relations between health/ physical aspects and psyche, so don't ignore the psychological help (thinking that your child is ""normal"" and does not need a psychologist. Your child might be perfectly normal, but the circumstances of his life might make him/her do strange things or have health problems)! The ideas and meditations from Louise L. Hay were very interesting for me in this  context.  "
2048,How do we determine what school is best when a child is high performing on the Autism Spectrum (Aspergers)?,"I have two children at primary school (5 and 7, primary school is from 4 to 11 in the UK) and there is a possibility of moving them both to a different school in the same area (we're not moving house). The eldest child is currently being assessed for autism, specifically Aspergers.   What are the most important criteria we should evaluate when considering which school is best for the family? If we decide to change what steps should we consider to prepare? How can we best handle uncertainty and disagreement between parents?  If anyone has any links to articles about Aspergers and changing schools that would be useful.  EDIT:   The full story.  My wife thinks the new school will be better at helping with the Asperger's (although there's no evidence to support this and I think the current school will be just as good in this regard) and is smaller (one class per year). However, the current school is better academically (he's incredibly bright, especially at science and maths) and has better facilities, and he has several friends there. "
2049,What are the chances that my wife will give birth vaginally after having a caesarean section in a previous pregnancy?,"My wife is now 4 months into our second pregnancy. Our first child was born via caesarean section. Our doctor told us that since the second child will be born within 2 years of the c-section, the second child will be born via c-section as well. Actually, this is sad news for us, because we really want our children born vaginally.  I would like to make sure that what the doctor said is right. Is there any valid research which shows that the minimal range to give birth vaginally is 2 years after having caesarean section? What are the chances that my wife will be able to give birth vaginally?  Hopefully, one of you guys have had the same experiences as my wife and will please share here. "
2050,Further correspondence from tooth fairy?,"My daughter, age 8 and well adjusted generally, occasionally writes a letter back to her [tooth] fairy .   I saw this article recommending writing tiny letters  and it seems just too adorable not to do something similar.  Is it ok to respond? No lasting damage likely from letting them believe in magic a little longer? "
2051,Does feeding breast milk from a bottle convey the same health benefits as nursing?,Is there's any specific benefit to nursing instead of just pumping and feeding from the bottle? Is there anything intrinsic in the act of nursing that improves baby's health or increases the nutrition? Does the mechanical act of sucking at the breast perhaps get at more /different/better parts of the breast than a pump and therefore get more diverse milk? Or does that not really make much of a difference? Can baby get the same benefits from pumped milk? 
2052,Is it dangerous for a child to sleep with the head hanging?,"I have never been worried about our 2yo sleeping half sitting with the head hanging. However today I met a person with really strong beliefs that it may cause neck injuries later in life.  Is there any danger with this? If so, for what age? "
2053,Should I let my child play with gun toys?,"I've noticed a great many parents do everything within their power to prevent their children playing with toy guns and weapons. As a 30-something, I grew up with toy swords, bows and guns, action men (GI Joe's) and ninja turtles etc. I'd hope most people who know me would consider that I've turned into a reasonable and well-balanced adult, just as those who I grew up with have also done.  My son recently turned 1 and currently doesn't have any gun / weapon toys, but as he gets older I suspect there will come a time when he wants to play ""Cops and Robbers"" or similar. Currently I'm not against the idea of him having toy weapons, but at the same time I don't want to expose him to anything that'll turn him into a violent or aggressive adult.  Most sources I've read state there's no correlation:         No study has yet linked pretend gunplay to future violent behavior,   and most child experts agree that by forbidding gunplay entirely,   parents give it far more power and will probably drive it underground.   Source 1  I've always thought that children don't really relate this type of play to violence and that it's more about good verses evil - but it's important to ensure they have some context / awareness of how to role-play those scenarios appropriately. Echoed by this article:      That doesn't mean this type of play is about violence, however.   According to Thompson, it's really about dominance and heroism,   winning and losing, and who gets to be the good guy in the end.   Sometimes ""there is aggression and hurtfulness, and that must be   stopped,"" Thompson says.   Source 2  Is preventing children playing with toy guns more a projection of the parents views or is it from a genuine belief (or study) that it is likely to harm the child's development?  If you don't let your child play with weapons, can you explain your rationale?  Likewise, if you do - why? Also, do you impose any controls or limits around play ""violence""?    Update  A few people have asked for background information on my location and laws here:  I'm from the UK, so access to a real gun by a child is very remote. Toy guns are legal, but almost all I see for sale are in bright / unrealistic colours etc. As others have mentioned, wherever you live, it's probably wise to ensure a toy can be identified as such from a distance.  However (despite the title), my question isn't gun specific - I'm interested in how to ensure ""violent"" play (including swords and bows etc.) doesn't encourage real violence or aggression. So, as one answerer touched upon - how they teach a kitchen knife isn't for playing with is valid in this context.  "
2054,Hyperemesis in second pregnancy if not in first?,"This is my second pregnancy. I had pretty bad nausea and vomitting with my first child, but not bad enough to be HG. This time, I feel like the nausea and vomitting is much worse. I'm only about 7 weeks, and I've been throwing up nearly daily (multiple times a day) for about a week now. Yesterday I threw up 4 times, more than I ever threw up on one day with my first.  Is it possible that I have HG? Can you have it in a second pregnancy if you didn't have it the first? "
2055,Is it wrong for a parent to partake in screaming/dominating competitions with their kids?,"I'm not the parent and I don't have any kids, so this is just based on what I observe.  There's this mother who, when her daughter (about 3 years old) starts crying and making a fuss, she'll lose her patience and try to ""out scream"" or ""out annoy"" her. In other words, she starts crying and screaming, and the mother will tell the child, ""I can scream louder!!!!!!!!! AH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" and give those sort of responses, basically over-yelling, etc., as if it's some sort of dominating display attempt to teach the kid (e.g., ""I'm the parent and I can scream louder and I'm in control!!!!!!"").   From what I notice, the child will keep crying and having a tantrum, and eventually the mother will completely neglect/ignore her by scaring her and yelling at her to stay in her room and will tell the daughter that she'll refuse to listen to her or get her anything unless she ""shuts up"" and stops crying. My assumption is the child stops crying when she's physically exhausted from it; not because she learned anything from the method. In short, the behavior doesn't change and it's not something I like being around.  What happens next is the daughter keeps screaming, crying, etc., and as the duration increases, the mother will occasionally enter the room and continue screaming very loudly and angrily at her, near to the point where it's heard houses away.   My question is, is this damaging/unproductive in raising a kid? Is trying to ""defeat"" your children harmful by trying to illustrate to them that you're, say, louder, can yell louder, can be more annoying, can pull harder (in, say, a tantrum when the child is yanking stuff) or even throw stuff after the kids do it to try and ""teach them"" it's wrong by doing the same thing to a greater extent.  For another example, a child has a tantrum and starts breaking stuff, and the parent gets explosively angry and starts screaming and breaking stuff in a more vicious manner.  What are the consequences of this, and how would this affect kids? More importantly, is this bad 100%? "
2056,What software can I use to plan and prepare for my family's security and safety?,"I'm looking for online software that will help me get my family prepared and secure. Any tips?  Specifically, a solution to the problem of discovering or detecting risks to your family and finding tasks to mitigate or contingency plan for them.  There's a number of checklist sites and parenting forums but I'm looking for something more personalized to my situation and context.  How do you currently do it? Excel spreadsheets? To-do lists? Thanks for tips and techniques! "
2057,How do you teach your children about regional colloquialisms?,"We live in an area that is relatively new to me.  Since moving here, I've found that there are some colloquial phrasings specific to this region that are particularly jarring to my ear.  In particular, if a verb like needs is followed by a passive construction in the infinitive, the ""to be"" portion is left out.    Then again, I have my own regional colloquialisms that are grammatically incorrect, yet to which my ""syntax ear"" is apparently deaf.  Given how pervasive some of these are, I suspect that the public school system will not put much, if any, effort into enforcing the more ""standard"" phrasings.  Is this something that I should be worried about?  Should I try to teach my children not to use the colloquial phrases, or at least make them aware that not everyone speaks like this?  How should I go about doing this? "
2058,How much should you buy for your child to keep up with their peers?,"How should you go about balancing the possessions you buy for your child against peer pressure from other children (particularly at school) and parents?  Many parents feel the need for their children to keep up to date with whatever other children might have, be it the latest trainers (sneakers), smartphone or tablet computer. The fear being either their child will be bullied or they'll miss out on educational or social opportunities.  I'm conscious of the effect of this ""have / have not"" scenario on both my child and other children - where if say, I jumped on the bandwagon and bought my child an iPad, chances are there'll be one or more children who won't get one because their parents can't afford it.  I'd imagine none of us want to have their child be the ""odd one out"", but what is a sensible balance?   Having (practically) everything? This is the expensive option, plus it puts more pressure on other parents and children. I'd also assume this would make it difficult to make the child appreciate how lucky they are if they get everything automatically. Have some of the things from their peer group? What would you prioritise, bearing in mind children can be very brand conscious and their attention / interest in the latest craze may be short-lived. Have very little of the ""in things"", trying to teach the child to appreciate what they do have and explain that there will always be someone with more than them, so they have to learn to accept that?   With the following in mind:   Like any parent, I want my child to have every opportunity and the best education. Like most parents, our family has a limited budget with a balance of priorities. We don't want our child to be bullied or excluded from social situations. We don't want other children to be left out or increase the pressure for their parents.     Update  Some people commenting and answering have misinterpreted my intentions - I'm not proposing spoiling my child by buying everything they want on a whim. My question relates to situations where all or most children in their class already have something and my child doesn't. The people preaching about how bad it is to hand children everything on a plate have missed the point of this question...  I'd agree with the sentiment that children should be taught not measure their worth in possessions or what they have. However, the further away they are from the situation of their peers, the more difficult they'll find being included and socialising at school. As one answerer already mentions, this really breaks down into two areas: possessions purely for status and prerequisites for participation.  Whilst it's easy to justify not buying fancy shoes, but when all the other child communicate after school using an app, play on-line together on their consoles or ride to their park on their pedal go carts (and your child has none of these things), the other children not playing with mine isn't bullying, it's situational. Ignoring that would just leave my child excluded. "
2059,Why does a pacifier trigger my baby's gag reflex?,"My baby doesn't often take a pacifier, but occasionally he will. I've noticed lately that once in a while, putting in the pacifier will trigger his gag reflex and will sometimes even cause him to spit up. I've tried using the ""mam"" pacifier that we received in the hospital, as well as some Avent ones... he's been using all of these happily until now, although not often. The gagging is a new thing and only occurs sometimes... What could be causing it? Is there anything to do about it? "
2060,Are there studies that have published the studied effects of PVC plastics on infants and children?,"In the process of researching a few of the toys our twins received for Christmas I found a blog post that pointed out a few of them may contain PVC.  I figured I should do due diligence to best understand what information is available about ""toxic toys"".  Are there any well cited studies documenting the dangers (or lack thereof) of PVC to infants and children?    What do the studies indicate regarding risks of exposure, ways to mitigate risk, etc.?  The response below from one of the companies in question is a large reason I ask this question.     We’re so glad you contacted us! Safety is number one here at omitted.    The well-being of the children who play with our toys is our top   priority.  We diligently monitor our products throughout every step of   their existence, from the drawing board to production to store   shelves.

2061,What should we pack when going camping with an infant?,"My family and I are going camping in a couple of weeks and were wondering if anyone had any tips or just precautions we should take. I have been camping only a couple of times in my life; however, my husband is pretty experienced.   We are planning to go with my mother, sister, myself, my husband, and our 11 month daughter. So far she seems to love outdoors. She loves her daily stroller rides outside and going on the swing, etc. She learned to walk a few weeks ago, and is getting better and better at walking outdoors as well (uneven ground is a bit of a challenge).   I still nurse her twice a day (morning and evening). She doesn't take formula or anything from a bottle. She eats table food / same thing as we do. She doesn't take a pacifier.   As a non-swimmer, I am really concerned about how the beach will be. What are some things we can do to ensure water safety for her? Are there any recommendations on a life jacket? Anything else we should get?   Thanks "
2062,Scientific evidence regarding methods for bathing newborns,"I came across some videos on youtube where women bathe a new born by laying it face down between their legs. Like this and this. In case the video is unavailable, these are my main concerns: There isn't any interaction between the adult and the baby, no attempt is made to comfort the crying baby, the baby is exposed to the water pretty abruptly (even if it's at a comfortable temperature), there's too much rubbing going on - especially the face and head, they flip the baby over by one arm.  One argument I've heard used repeatedly is that people have been doing this for 1000s of years, and they've survived. But I found no literature or scientific evidence for or against this method. This is what I'm looking for.  My question is: is there any evidence or statistics about this method of bathing newborns being safe, or unsafe. Or being a cause for the baby to associate bath time with discomfort. (If there's any discomfort at all) "
2063,How can I make my 3 weeks old to sleep on his own?,"I have great milk supply, but these are my issues:   My son has barely ever slept more than 30-40 minutes at once during the day. :(   (At night time he does sleep for 3 hrs at least once. But generally every time he falls asleep after feeding I try to put him down, but he won't stay asleep unless I hold him on my chest. He wakes up almost 5-10 min into placing him down and rooting and giving signs like he hasn't eaten for a whole day. Then I feed him again etc and so this goes in circles.) I am aware of the growth spurts but this is going on since birth. Is this ever going to shift?  He has gained weight, has perfect amount of dirty diapers etc.  I've read that other babies sleep 2-3 hrs straight, feed, then sleep again. I wish I could say the same. Also he shakes his head while my nipple is in his mouth and gets frustrated, cries, bangs his head with my nipple in his mouth... :confused: (this happens after like 3-4 hrs of straight feeding=him hopping from one nipple to the other after loooong hours...   Bottom line is, he doesn't sleep in his bassinet or on his very own unless I hold him. What can I do? I'm getting tired and a bit frustrated too. "
2064,Snoring Toddlers,My two toddlers (age 2 and 4) both snore during sleeping (usually at night). Is it too young for them to be snoring sleepers?    What could be medical conditions? What are the preventive measures if it is a symptom to future potential health failure?    Did I feed inappropriate food which make them snore? Sleeping positions are also tried but I am open for suggestions. Their pillows are relatively low 2.5 to 3.5 cm. Late night sleeping and late morning wake up is one of the sleeping patterns. Breastfeeding is intermittent during night sleep.  
2065,How to teach toddlers that rude words are inappropriate?,"We, parents are trying to not use those words in front of toddlers even if we have strong disagreement between each other. But this can be more difficult and complex to avoid them speaking since there are relatives, friends and neighbors involved. And soon children are going to preschool and they will have some friends or seniors who use rude words which is out of control to us, parents.   What can we do about my children potentially using rude, abusive words? Or are they just expressions of social conflicts and let them go?  "
2066,How to help a 2 year old go to bed alone,"I am writing here because I have tried everything there is. I am 22 weeks pregnant and my 2 yo (he will turn 2 on the 12th of October) weights 17 kg so I cannot handle him easily.   So here it is: he's always been a bad, really bad sleeper. We got him to sleep in his cot alone, but he won't go to bed if I (or sometimes he accepts my husband) hold his hand. Since my tummy is getting bigger and bigger I find it difficult to stay in that position. Furthermore, we are thinking of moving him into his own room.  The problem is, he can jump from his cot extremely easily, so I cannot just leave him in the cot and wait outside his room because he will follow me.  Has anyone been through something similar? What worked for you? Also I want to do this sooner and avoid him thinking he is thrown out of the room by the coming of the baby. "
2067,Is plane flight safe for a newborn?,"I have been pregnant for 38 weeks and 3 days. I booked my plane ticket a while back to go to New York in December and I am bringing my baby with me, but by the time we go to there and he will be about 7 weeks old. My question is whether he will he be safe flying? Are there any precautions I should take? "
2068,Handling strong need to protect family,"We have a 21mo and another due in February. Lately, I have felt compelled (internally, not from any external pressure) to do more to feel prepared to protect my family, in the unlikely event of a home intrusion.   I am not a gun person, but I've even considered attending a few trainings at a firing range in order to get a license for a firearm for home.   I talked with my wife, she suggested a home security system, but I am a tad distrustful of how effective those actually are.   Has anyone else dealt with similar feelings? Did you take any specific actions, or instead focus on acceptance or other means of comfort? "
2069,Why does my 17-month-old cry in the middle of the night?,"Our daughter is 17 months (500 days) old. She wakes up 2 or 3 times at night. After reading some websites, we're concerned that she might have night terrors.  What could be going on? What can we do? "
2070,Are electronics safe for babies,"My daughter is 3 years old and adopted. I've had her for 2 years now. When I got her she was crying non stop, now she will talk and laugh with everyone she meets.  I bought my little girl the newest iPad air 6 months ago to help her learn abc's and numbers and to entertain her when I'm busy, but it's gotten to the point where she can't go to sleep without her tablet, and she will be watching it even when I fall asleep then she's grumpy in the morning, if I take it she wont stop screaming.  Are tablets good for a child's brain? Are they harmful? I have heard of the radiation theory about brain damage from mobile phones but I do not know how accurate it is. I am concerned that the tablet may emit radiation that will harm my child's brain.   My question is twofold: Is the tablet good/bad for her developing brain and how can I take it from her without her screaming? "
2071,Kindergartner with no control over his emotions/behavior,"My son has been diagnosed with ADHD.  He has been kicked out of four different daycares starting when he was just 2 years old.  He is now in Kindergarten, and my wife and I hoped that with his recent diagnoses, medication and change of scenery to ""big boy"" school he would show signs of improvement.  He hasn't.  School is in its fourth week and he has been sent to the principal's office every day but 3.  He has run out of the class.  Dumped things out of their containers in the classroom and principle's office.  Thrown various tantrums.  Threatened teachers and the principles.  Today they called my wife to ask if she would sit in the classroom with him to show support for the teacher.  She said of course she would.  We were in the conference room talking to the principal while he was in the office with the other principal and another student.  Right before we were going to get him to take him back to class, he picked up a clipboard and smashed the other kid in the face with it.  He said he was thinking about what it would be like to have a lose tooth so he wanted to see if he could make the other kid's tooth loose.  So he's been suspended from school for a day.  He's a very smart kid.  He already does pretty much everything they're supposed to be doing at the end of the school year, so he's not suffering academic-wise, yet.  At home, he's really well behaved most of the time.  When he does start acting up it's usually later in the day, and he's tired.  So this doesn't seem to explain his behavior in the early afternoon when he's at school.  We've tried every type of reward/punishment we can think of to do.  Right now he has the incentive of hosting a party which he can invite anyone he wants to where we'll have a movie night with popcorn and decorations and whatever else he wants, if he can go one week without being sent to the principal.  His teacher knows about it, and reminds him about it when he starts to act up, but so far it hasn't stopped him.  He's told us that Kindergarten is boring and that he wants to go to first grade.  We told him that's fine, but they're not going to let that be an option until he shows that he can be in class and behave.  We have run out of ideas.  The psychiatrist keeps saying to ""look for the triggers"", but there don't seem to be any.  Sometimes he literally looks for something to upset him.  His trigger is getting what he wants, when he wants, by whatever means necessary.  He doesn't seem to care about rewards or punishments when he's set his mind to something.  Has anyone dealt with something like this before?  Any advice?  We really need some outside the box thinking here, because we've tried everything we can think of.  We've even read books about ""kids like him"", but nothing has helped. "
2072,Caring for the Children of Deceased Parents,"I am really wrestling with an issue that recently came up. Here is the background story: My brother-in-law (my wife's brother) has talked to my wife and said that he wants to name us as the care-takers of his children in his will if anything was to happen to both him and his wife. Here's the footnote to that, though. They have five young children, and one of those five is a special-needs child. To get a better idea of the social element between my family (wife and two young children) and theirs, we live on the other side of the country from them and it would be a huge stretch to even remotely say that we are ""close"".  I'm not sure what the typical obligation would be here at this point. It's one thing if we are talking about one child, or even two children. But five children (one with special needs) is quite an undertaking that I'm not sure is reasonable or even possible. Here are some points I struggle with:   I work hard to provide for my wife (stay at home Mother) and my two children. Truth is, I'm not sure if my income could provide for an additional 5 people.  My children would do without in many aspects of their lives. Accommodations simply aren't there. Yes there is a spare bedroom, but talking about the magnitude of five extra people to provide sustainable and long term living quarters, I just don't see it. Family element. Call it what you want, but as a father and a husband I enjoy spending my life with my wife and my children. Realistically speaking, adding five additional children to which I have no real bond to will most definitely change everything.   If we were the only other family to where these kids could go to, I'd say that's one thing. But we are surely not. In this family there are also my wife's parents (which would also be the same parents of her brother -- the kids' grandparents), my wife's brother's wife's sister (sorry for the confusion, could also be referred to as my brother-in-law's sister-in-law, the aunt of the kids on the other side of the family), and my wife's brother's wife's mother (the other grandmother, on that side of the family).  To undertake this responsibility alone just doesn't seem possible, appropriate, or feasible. What is the typical thing to do here? Given the quantity (five) and the requirements (one special-needs child), I would think this hardly fits in a ""typical"" scenario of care takers in the event parents pass away. But I would truly like to hear thoughts on this.  Am I wrong for thinking the way I'm thinking?  Is this just simply an inappropriate request from my wife's brother? "
2073,How to handle a 1-year-old pointing at and wanting things?,"My 1-year-old daughter has started pointing at things. Sometimes she ""wants"" them, to either hold herself or just touch, sometimes she seems to be satisfied with simply having the thing named.   Depending on what we are doing we either fulfill her ""want"" - give her the teddy bear or show the picture, etc. - or not. Then she often gets upset and keeps pointing and wanting for a while. Then, sometimes, stops and engages herself in another activity. Or one of us gives/shows her the thing.  In general we try to use common sense and don't let her start ruling us. I was wondering however, whether there is some well accepted way of handling this kind of behavior, since most (all?) kids go through this phase? Are there any studies about it? "
2074,How does one deal with excessive timidity in 8 year olds? Is it even excessive,"My son has reached the point that if something scares him once then he doesn't want to deal with it anymore on any level.  I can understand this for something like ""Star Wars."" But this has extended to programming like ""Phineas and Ferb"" as well as other books that should not be construed as scary. This also can occur at bedtime.  Typically, I wouldn't worry about this but his behaviour is what has me worried. He will first whine about not wanting to see it and then work himself up to an absolute bout of terror. This isn't a temper tantrum. It is absolute crying in fear.  Is this normal for an 8 yr old? Should I be stronger about this? I'm trying to gently walk him through the experience, but at times he is just inconsolable. "
2075,Risks of suffocation when the baby starts turning around,"We have a 4 month old baby and she is starting to turn around. We are worried when she goes to bed now that she might turn on her front (she never turned around 100% yet, only to her side) at night when she is sleeping in her bed and might suffocate then.  When I put he on her belly, she will hold her head up quite nicely for a minute or so, but then get tired and put her head face-down on the carpet.  Is there an actual risk that she might suffocate in bed? How would the baby react if she turns on her belly with her face downwards? Where would I be able to read more about this online? "
2076,Excessive drooling for a 4 year old,"I have a 4 year old who has been excessively drooling.  It has caused some issues with a rash around his mouth, mostly after a heavy night of sleep and in the morning.  We have seen a doctor to see if there is anything wrong with him physically.  Nothing wrong with his mouth or lips, nothing swollen (like tonsils or adnoids or gums).  The doctor did say to give it some time and it could just be a growth spurt causing changes in his mouth/jaw area so its open during the night, thus causing the excessive drooling.  The recommendation to wait it out and then see if there is something that needs to be done.  Has anyone else heard of this or been through something similar?  Possibly even in relation to there being something swollen, or in relation to tonsils and adnoids and such? "
2077,"Should children be preemptively taught about drugs, alcohol, and sex?","This is a follow up to When should you start talking with your children about sex?.  Is it better for parents to preemptively educate children about taboo subjects such as drugs, alcohol, sex, or profanity before they are exposed it in school?  Or is it better to let them discover them on their own through their friends?   "
2078,Can I use one time use puppy pads for toddler potty training while they sleep at night?,I'm starting to potty train my child at 20 months by not sleeping with a diaper on. It gets tiring to change / wash the bed sheets every night. I was thinking of using disposable one time use puppy training pads. Is this a feasible use case for something that is meant for animals? I means its just a super absorbent pad or is there another suggestion to create a quick environment to change the sheets when they wet themselves during sleep? 
2079,At what age should my baby be expected to support her own head?,"I have a 4-month old daughter.  Each time she is awake she gets some ""tummy-time"" where we put her on her stomach on a play-mat, to build up her neck muscles.  She doesn't like it that much and usually ends up crying after a few minutes of this.  Also, when we hold her so she is facing us, against our chest, she often jerks her head back like she doesn't enjoy being held that way.  While we have noticed her neck support getting stronger, there's still a small amount of wobble there and we have to support it.  At what age should we expect her to be able to support her head without any support?  Is there any other exercises other than tummy-time we can do to improve her strength?  Update  My daughter will be 5 months in about a week's time and we have noticed a big improvement in her head control/strength over the past few weeks.  I would say she has about 90% head control now.  Thanks for all of your great answers! "
2080,How to care for my 3.5-year-old's decaying teeth?,"Since more than a year, one tooth of my 3.5-year-old daughter has started to deteriorate. Recently, two more teeth are getting affected. This is due to not getting her teeth brushed up properly and regularly.   Now what measures should be taken to care for it and to rectify the situation? As these teeth are temporary, when will these come out and new permanent ones come? "
2081,Why does my baby have bubbles around the mouth?,My infant sometimes bubbles from the mouth. When he does this he doesn't seem to be distressed but I end up constantly having to wipe his mouth. Could this be because I am not burping him enough? Does this happen to other people? 
2082,How to explain scientific concepts to a curious 3.5-year-old?,"I have a 3.5-year-old who seems to be a bright spark (I know every parent thinks this :). She is asking:   What is water made of? (answered rain) What is air made of? (answered gas like steam coming out of the kettle but different) What is straw made of? (answered really big dead grass) What is grass made out of? (answered really little green 'cells' that drink sun) What are leaves? (answered like grass on but on trees to drink the sun and feed the tree)   I would like to know how to best explain these concepts, balancing complex advanced concepts (gases etc.) versus dismissing with a limiting un-scientific answer? "
2083,Why not let a toddler share a bedroom with a baby?,"We have a 2-year-old daughter and now we expect a baby in November. After the initial few months, when the newborn will be sleeping in our bedroom, we could  put both children in one room together. Are there any reasons against that?  The first thing that comes to my mind is safety - is the older one not going to do something silly yet dangerous to the little one? "
2084,What size schoolbag is good for a first-grader?,"My son's back is ~35cm.  As I understand, the backpack should have the same height, but we have found one that is 32cm wide x 37cm tall x 17cm deep, 900 grams.   Those extra 2cm height are okay, but there is another option: 32 x 38 x 22 cm, 980 grams.  Is 38cm too tall? He will grow soon, so maybe that's fine. But what about 22 cm depth, isn't that too much for a 1st grader? They don't have so many books, I suppose. "
2085,What to dow when my 13-year-old son still wants to hold my hand?,"My 13-year-old son still wants to hold my hand.  Holding his dad's hand has been drilled into him since he was able to walk as a safety thing and I assumed as he got older he would not want to anymore, but everytime we go anywhere he automatically reaches for my hand. I have adjusted this to linking arms but in the last few months he has really sprouted up and is nearly as tall as me.  I'm 5""11.    Does this look/seem odd to others?  Does it matter?  We are extremely close as father and son and he is incredibly affectionate. I suspect it's his way of showing me this, but I'm suddenly conscious of getting ""looks"" from people who might at first glance assume we are two adults.  Not that that is an issue for me but I don't want him to be embarrassed in any way or discouraged from displaying affection. I also don't want him to feel I am rejecting him by stopping it, so not sure what to do. "
2086,When should I stop swaddling my baby?,"I swaddled my baby in a swaddling blanket for a short time after he was born, and then moved on to a Halo combination sleep sack and swaddle blanket. He is now nearly 3 months old, and I'm still using it (only at night). For the first few minutes he usually struggles a bit - mostly because he's not interested in going to sleep - but then he falls asleep and seems happy with it; I think it helps him to sleep more soundly but can't be sure. If I don't get to him fast enough in the morning, he usually manages to get one hand out, or sometimes both, and a thumb into his mouth. When should I stop swaddling him? (And after I stop swaddling him, should he still sleep in a sleep sack / wearable blanket? If so, for how long? I know 2-year-olds who are still in a sleep sack...) "
2087,Can we afford to have a baby?,"I'm not a parent (yet!), but the wife and I are seriously thinking about starting a family.  We both really want kids, but I'm just worried about the financial strain a baby could have on us.  Am I right to worry about this?  How much should I be budgeting per month for the essential baby items?  Some things I have thought of, but have no idea of how much it will cost:   food clothes nappies medicine (is there anything that's regularly needed?) startup costs (cot, pram, etc)   Am I missing anything?  How do I go about making a rough estimate of how much a baby will cost? "
2088,Kids and tidying up with KonMari method,"I have found an interest in the KonMari method of tidying up. One of its main pillars is to declutter your life by throwing away things that bring you no joy. It makes sense from a productivity perspective, especially when you live in a small apartment.  The problem is how to apply this theory to my pre-school kids' belongings? As a parent I think a lot of their old stuff (primarily toys) should go to recycling, but if I ask my kids they refuse to let me throw away any of their old things. They will become sad if I do.  How to handle this problem? "
2089,When and how can we stop giving our toddler formula in the evening?,"My toddler gets a bottle of formula in the evening, as part of the bedtime ritual. At some point in time, we'd want to stop giving that bottle and stop using formula at all.   What is an effective method to do this?  Is it realistic to just stop giving the bottle one day? Or should the daily amount be reduced over a two weeks until nothing is left? Or should we replace it with water?   Ideally, we would want no more fluid intake in the evening to prevent future bed-wetting, so replacing with water could at best be a temporary solution. I have a feeling that an evening drink increases the risk of bed-wetting, though it would probably be naive to expect it can be fully avoided. "
2090,Hobby vs. baby balance,"Some context  During the week, I work every day from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. About once a week I finish about two hours later because I’m visiting a client in another city.  When I am not working, I’m at home where I take good part in the chores and taking care of the baby.  This week, the sport I am doing will resume after the winter break. I’m doing it one evening a week. It is weather dependent, so the duration is variable. Sometime it could take the whole evening (from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m.), and sometime it could last less than an hour or even be cancelled.  Now the parenting part  I am the happy father of a 1 ½ month old baby :)  And the problem  My wife says I should stop doing this sport for at least a year. She says she needs more help at home, and that going to this sport shows a lack of involvement in our baby and family. On my side, I have the feeling that this is giving me a rest from work-baby-sleep-work-baby-… I believe that it’s good for me, hence for them, to maintain a minimal activity outside home and work.  My question  Is there any general agreement on maintaining hobbies for recent parents (especially fathers)? Should I, when I’m not at work, focus at 100% on the baby, house chores and mother?  If so, for how long?  I would like to avoid this question being closed for opinion based: I’m not looking for your judgment on this. I’m asking for guidelines or information about balance between very young baby and hobbies. "
2091,Can I figure out what my baby wants by the sound it makes when it cries?,"Can I figure out what my baby needs from its crying?  According to Dunstan Baby Language, the sound used before hysterical baby crying gives information on what the baby needs. The Dunstan website claims there is scientific research on this, but the wikipedia article denies it. From the Wikipedia article linked above:     Between 0–3 months, infants make what Dunstan calls sound reflexes...There are other reflexes that all babies experience, and when sound is added to these, a distinct, preemptive ""cry"" will occur before the infant breaks into what Dunstan calls the hysterical cry. Dunstan claims that these preemptive cries can indicate what the infant requires (e.g., food, comfort, sleep, etc.), and they escalate to the hysterical cry if they are not answered.   Can I really figure out what my baby needs by the nature of its crying? Are there ways of figuring out what my baby needs by the phonemes emitted before/during crying? "
2092,What should we teach our children about violent attacks like the ones in Norway on 7/22/11?,"Let me begin with all sympathies to the victims, survivors, and their families, and the people of Norway.   I am sad and angry and deeply feel the fact that I cannot protect my family from an atrocity. I feel impotent. What can I do?     Children can't avoid finding out about these events. How can we explain such terrible acts to children in a way that doesn't cause them harm?  What can we do to instruct children to handle such a situation if they ever find themselves in one?   "
2093,How do I get my parents to let me vacation by myself?,"I'm planning to take a vacation next month. Since I started planning for it, my parents have continually expressed doubt and concern and generally interfered in the plans. They want to know where and with whom I'm staying, and recently have even begin pressing me for contact information and other details. (Though I'm a legal adult, housing costs in my country make it unfeasible to move out on my own without being married. As a result, I still live with my parents.)  The truth is that I'm going to a pony convention with a friend from America. Though I haven't met them in person yet and though they're reluctant to share their real-life information (and even more reluctant to get involved with my parents), I've known them for a few years and I trust them. At the insistence of my parents that I spend more time abroad than just the convention, I've also planned to stay with another American friend for about a week. (I'm also planning to engage in activities of an adult nature with my friends while I'm there.)  In previous attempts to appease my parents, I've told them that I'm going to the convention in order to showcase things of a technical nature, and that I'll be sharing a room with project staff. This worked fairly well initially, but they've become increasingly agitated lately and have even begun expressing a desire to go along with me. I fear that that won't end well, or will at least ruin my enjoyment of the trip. How do I reassure them and convince them that I'm perfectly capable of handling myself and should be left alone?  Some extra details: I'm male, 21, living in an Asian country. I'm attending university and have a part-time job, which nets me enough for me to save up for personal things, but I still live with my parents and by extension their food and lodging. My culture is ""traditional"", to the extent of being ignorant of homosexuality and (at best) thinking transsexuality is strange. As for my relationship with my parents, I mainly want to avoid conflict. I feel like deception is preferable. At the very least, they can't find out about what I get up to with my (also male) friends.     Is your relationship strong enough for you to maintain it through an act of independence?   It should be, but they're very concerned about safety. "
2094,How can I educate my 2.5 year old daughter to be quiet when my other 8 month old is sleeping during the day?,"Should I punish her? With saying you can't play with your toys? I don't think that would work!  Should I be quiet and when she yells...quietly tell her honey if we yell he will wake up? I did that, but it works 70% of the time. Can't it be done any better?  "
2095,How to remove electronics and shift sleep schedule of 6-year old?,"I started taking care of my grandchild when she was still 7 months old. During her first day to 6 months old she was with her father and my daughter. Sadly, their relationship didn't last. Right now, she's a single-parent. She rarely takes action because of work, due to tiredness and partying. She only has time for her during weekend. I told her about it. And tried disciplining. but my granddaughter is too hard-headed and won't listen to us.  She always goes to sleep at around 3 to 7 in the morning. This has been going on for a month now. She wakes up around 5 to 7 in the afternoon. Before, she barely even slept in the afternoon.  Every time she's gonna wake up. She'll go and look and ask me a question (that I hear every time she wakes up) ""Where's my iPad?"" My answer was I don't know. Then she's gonna have her usual series of tantrums. Scream, cry and throwing the pillows out of the couch. I always have no choice but to just give it to her.  Later on. She's gonna ask for a chocolate drink. She doesn't like white milk. I don't know. Is it because of the chocolate drink?  When we are at the table, her eyes are at the TV busy. She eats very slowly. Like take a bite then wait for 3 minutes before another bite.  Her favorite apps on her iPad are these: Minecraft, Roblox and youtube.  Is there a way for her to go back to sleep early again? What can I do so she would stop looking for her iPad? How can I make her listen to me? I did everything I could. She's impossible. She's gonna scream, cry and throw the pillows at us. Oh, we also tried scaring her yet again we failed. "
2096,Five-year-old son constantly fondling himself - is it normal?,"When my five-year-old son wears some comfy clothes, like joggers or pyjamas especially after school, he tends to either sit on the sofa or lie on the floor and basically fondle himself. He started doing this very early on (around 2 years old for maybe about half a year) then stopped.   Now he started again several months ago and it is fairly constant. He even tries to hide it by lying underneath a blanket which we keep in the living room and in his bed. Initially we thought it was normal but now he does it when he has the chance.  My husband and I came up with a couple of ways to try and deal with this:   Make up an excuse that if he keeps doing this, he will hurt himself and will have to go to the hospital (he doesn't like hospitals). Make him wear trousers or jeans (or something not completely comfortable) to make it more difficult.     Is this behaviour normal? Are there other steps we could try to lessen this level of fondling? "
2097,Scholarly recommendations for how much preschool is recommended for an 'average' child if there is such a thing,"For a child who goes to preschool, are there any scholarly recommendations on how much preschool is recommended for a child? I know that every child is different, and that disadvanted children may benefit differently.  Perhaps how much structured group educational instruction is a better question?  I.e. 4 hours a week? 10 hours? 15 hours?  "
2098,"Should we force the issue of remaining in a zero-hour class when it's an ""easy A""","My son is currently a high school sophomore who has been active in jazz bad since the sixth grade. He is in the ""second tier"" Jazz band and so goes to school an hour early three days per week. For him, jazz is a fairly easy A.  However, for junior year, he's taking three AP classes (AP English, AP History, AP Spanish) as well as calculus, astronomy, and Wind Ensemble. He claims he wants to give up jazz to free up time for his harder classes.   However, he's in AP History this year (I can't remember if it's US or World--just that it's one this year and the other the next). He took the AP practice exam, got a 96% against a class average of 71% and, after the teacher graded on the curve, he had 101%. Maybe the AP classes aren't as hard for him as he fears?  He hates science and math, and gets B's in those courses often enough that his GPA is around a 3.6. I want it to be higher, but it's mercifully better than his middle school grades so I don't complain (except to strangers on the internet).  The ""A"" in Jazz is keeping his GPA up...or will it bring it down in junior year because the time needed undercuts his other grades?  Would telling him about how the A affects his GPA undermine his confidence in his own decisions or would it allow him to make a more informed decision? Would I lose credibility by strongly urging that he stay in Jazz if at all possible? We have a collaborative and easy-going relationship that I don't want to jeopardize by opening the can of worms unless there's clear benefit.  I know he enjoys jazz as I hear him play songs from his book just because they looked like fun.  ETA: We just got his grades for Junior year. They are even better than usual and was one A- away from straight A's. He liked the extra hour's sleep and perhaps spent more time on regular homework. "
2099,Is it normal that father kisses his teenager son on the lips?,"I just watched the new episode on Britain's Got Talent 2018, featured a singing act between a father and son. The act was really great, and I really love the special and deep bond between the father and son. But I am a little confused. As shown in this clip, the father kissed his 12 years old son on the lips more than one.   [website]I know it is the great love the father has for his son. But at the age of 12, is it normal that he still kisses his son on the lips. I am asking because where I live, it is not a common thing. So I am wondering if it is a cultural thing. "
2100,2-month-old baby has panic attacks,"Since about 10 days ago, our 2-month-old baby started to have some sort of panic attack in the evening. After his evening feed (6pm), he will initially fall asleep or relax, but after a while suddenly wakes up in a panic and cries for an hour straight. Walking around only makes things worse and will cause him to anxiously look around as if he is scared of every object in the house. He seems to be looking at the shadows and lights in the house, but I am not sure. During the day (from 9am until 5pm) he is fine, happy, smiling and feeding/sleeping.  What worries me is not so much the crying but the fact you can see he is distressed and terrified.  Does this have anything to do with his eyesight developing? Or anything else we should know or can do for him? "
2101,Trouble enjoying family time in the moment,"I have a 2.5 yo and a newborn. I find that when watching the toddler or doing everyone-together family activities I find myself stressed out managing everything and generally wishing I could be by myself. After the fact I’m aware that everyone had a good time, it was family bonding, etc (I’m not generally outwardly stressed, no one else’s experience is affected)  Anyone else have this? I’d love to be able enjoy time with my family instead of wishing I was somewhere else, and only enjoying it in retrospect.   If so, are there strategies for either a) dealing with the stress or b) being more in-touch with the later enjoyment, while the activity is still happening?  (I’m doing some mindfulness already so ‘try mindfulness’ is covered) "
2102,How do you determine safe (non-poisonous) toys for small children?,"Nowadays a good portion of seemingly quality products from known makers are manufactured in China (as I read see based on reading the labels). There are some info regarding the occassional dangerous materials used in making/painting the toys.  How do you choose a toy? Do you use pure wooden toys, or check for on-market time of the specific product? How about relatively anonymous products? "
2103,How can I tell parents of a 1-year-old that they're doing it wrong?,"Without getting into the circumstances, my wife's step sister and her husband are living with us while he's between orders with the US army. She's 28 and he's 42.   While they're living with us, it's very obvious that they don't know how to handle a baby. I'd be more than happy to share some wisdom, to offer suggestions, to just help, but I don't want to overstep the boundaries and make an already crowded and tense situation even worse.   How can I help these people how to be parents?  As a father of 5 (the 21 yo has his own place) I've been around that block a couple of times and my opinion is that they're doing it wrong. Of course I wouldn't tell them that in so many words, but it is what I think: if you're not truly trying to do it right, you’re doing it wrong.   Here are some examples:   There's no baby level stimulus. They will watch adult (not porn lol) streaming shows all day and holler at their kid for getting into my kids' things (I've told them it doesn't matter; the things won't be damaged). Not even so much as Dora or even Pixar or the odd baby centric website. They have actual expectations on the baby's behavior... ""you know better than that"" with pulling the laptop off the couch and ""screams and screams when he doesn't get his way"". At 1 year old, no baby is capable of knowing better than anything other than what you teach them on a very basic level, nor is he capable of any level of manipulation. At all. There's no attempt at routine nor any baby level interaction. At that age, my kids were amazingly easy to care for once major daily rituals were developed. Want him to go down for the night without a fuss? Start doing about a half hour bedtime ritual.  And therein lies the prompt for this post. Tonight, the baby lay there crying for prob 30 minutes in bed. It was a different cry... wasn't pain, but something was wrong. They said, ""he's just crying because he didn't get what he wanted"". Dude, he's 1, man... he doesn't desire something, he needs something.    I have attempted to talk about these things once or twice, but the response is of the ""he's just"" type. Dismissive. Yes, he's their kid and no I'm not the parent. I can accept that. However, being in the unique position of knowing that the approach I'm using for my 9 yr old was successful for my 19/21 yr old, I do have a little experience.   I can just see where all this is going to be in 4, 8, 15 years, and I'd like to help the boy by helping his parents. How?    [update edit june 20 2013]  I had to actually confer with the wife and it was only 5 weeks ago that this whole thing came to a head and I basically told them I'd had enough and it was time to go. The wife was 100% with me. It was the week of the Boston stuff, and the mother was irate that she couldn't talk about having a bad day. You know what? Sure, you can have a bad day. However, basic decorum says that you should just keep that to yourself while the news of extraordinary suffering is fresh on peoples minds. Bottom line is that I don't want to be around the person that I have to explain that to nor do I want them around my family. And with that, they were gone the next day.  Sad thing is that as good as I felt about not having to deal with them any more, my heart goes out to that child. "
2104,How does one address Christianity with their children in a mixed faith marriage?,"I am Christian (though admittedly, liberally so) while my husband is Agnostic.  He agrees that it is appropriate for our child to receive some education in my faith, but we have been unable to find a Church community in our area that we both feel comfortable regularly taking our child to as most of them would not teach tolerance of, and respect for my husband's beliefs (we've tried, we are in a VERY conservative area).  For this reason, we are not attending church regularly so teaching my daughter about my faith and beliefs is largely up to me.  I want her to know about Christianity (as well as other faiths for that matter) and to teach her how to think about faith, belief and values that allows her room for some choice when she is older.  Of course I hope my example will also have a positive impact, but I do specifically feel she needs to know that stories and traditions that make up part of her heritage (and a large part of our culture) in both an academic (most Sunday School Curricula don't seem all that ""academic"" to me) and ""fun"" way.  What kinds of things should I consider when choosing books, videos, games and activities to use with her while teaching her values both my husband and I share as well as the more faith-based values only I hold to?    Update Due to ""questions"" asked about why teach it then?  I thought this further clarification was needed.  I will reiterate the wish for an ""academic"" look. This isn't about discovering faith, it is about having a relevant literary background.  I believe knowledge is key in understanding.  This relates to building empathy toward others and combating prejudice based in ignorance.  Knowledge can be used to defeat fear mongering against ""the other"" whoever that ""other"" may be.  I believe in also exposing her to other world religions, but I believe in starting with what you know best (as a teacher).  She has even joined in with friends for Hanukkah this year, and knows a little about Divaali.  We both have learning to do in regard to non-Christian religions.  As a scientist, (Botany) I believe in evolution and can also explain this standpoint easily.  I want her to know The Bible well - whatever her choice about it.  Eventually, I intend to have her read at least some of the Koran as well.  When you know some of the basics, it is a lot more difficult to be overly judgmental about those that believe differently than you and a lot easier to find the commonalities as well as easier to make an informed decision about what you accept yourself.  Finally, she is moving into a study of Medieval Europe.  She is a huge History connoisseur and just can't get enough.  At six, she can rattle off names of Greek Philosophers, Roman Emperors, describe Myths from both traditions as well as from Babylon, Egypt, China and Japan.  She can't necessarily remember every date and every name, but she can offer a surprising amount of information from any Human History between the first farmers to the Fall of Rome.  Ancient India and China have not been forgotten in our studies either.  To fully grasp the upcoming period in her history studies, she has to have some understanding of the basics of Christianity and its story and will also need to gain some understanding of Early Islam as well.  ""Skipping it"" until she is an adult is not realistic even if I wasn't Christian myself if she is to be well-informed in the subject she loves most, History. "
2105,How can a parent remain sane? How do you keep your energy and temper?,"I'm sure every parent has days like this:       Your child has been a troublemaker all day. You are exhausted, and at your wits' end. It would be nice to just take a break, to have someone else take over for an hour - or a day. But you're alone and the partner is at work for another ""X"" hours. The weather is bad; you can't go to the playground or zoo.       You feel like screaming.   What would you do to keep sane? Let's hear some ideas.  Update: ""Taking a break"" is what I'd do too, but sometimes it's not easy. My reference situation is a toddler -- too young to be ""parked"" in front of a TV, and too old to be placed in a crib. Lock him in his room? Doesn't feel right.  "
2106,How can I get my mother to recognize that I've matured?,"I can't convey to my mother that I've grown up already.   Is it possible to explain this?   I think that my mom has trouble leaving me on my own, because she can't live with thought: ""my child has become older now, and I not need to spend so much time with him.""   Maybe I need to make a decision or something?   Thanks for the advice! "
2107,How to encourage toddler twins to share?,"Our twins are just over eighteen months and are having issues sharing. Given their shared age the answers provided to ""how do you encourage siblings to share?"" is not specifically aplicable. So far it's mostly minor and we've been able to coax the children into doing the ""right"" thing when they've taken something from the other. However, we see this sharing issue as having the potential for becoming a larger problem. How can we encourage sharing between toddler twins? "
2108,What are the (dis)advantages of parents and children sharing a bedroom?, What are the advantages and disadvantages of parents sleeping in the same room as their child(ren)? For both parents and child(ren)? Until what age (months? years?) would you prefer to have your child     sleep in the same room?  
2109,How long should one wait between pregnancies?,"I've read What is the least problematic age difference between siblings? but I had a different question.  That question is rather ""from a child's point of view: what age would you prefer your siblings to have"".   Mine would rather be:    Are there any advantages/disadvantages of becoming pregnant right after giving birth? How much time should be left between pregnancies? Why?  "
2110,Where/how can I find out about public breastfeeding facilities?,My wife and I were going to plan our first family outing with our newborn. The easiest way for us to breastfeed is still with the breastfeeding pillow and a chair. So no hooter hiders quite yet and my wife is modest about whipping 'em out in public. We're trying to figure out online where/what stores might offer breastfeeding facilities. My google-fu is failing me.  Is there some place/way to find out (in the US) where we can breastfeed? Is there some common signage or online place where breastfeeding locations can be easily located so you can plan your day around feedings? 
2111,Is 5 Year Old Exhibiting Bullying Signs?,"My SO and I are concerned about his 5yo's recent behavior.  She has become sneaky, rebellious, defiant, manipulative, and slightly physical with her 4yo sister, but never with other children. It truly feels like we are dealing with a teenager.    He and their mother divorced almost a year ago, and we know the disruption of what was once their normal life has some place in blame (even though the mother was very absent.)  When they are with us (50/50 custody,) they have a clean home, daily routine, balanced meals, family game/movie/story time.  We are strict but also very loving. At the children's mother's home, however, she has basically moved in her boyfriend of 3 months, who has 4 VERY rambunctious children, she does not promote routine, allows her children to eat only what they want (fast food, mac-n-cheese for all meals, etc,) only pays attention to them when there is a camera around, the list goes on.  She has also began emotionally caring for her new beau's children more so than her own.  There is no talking to her about this issue, as she swears it only happens in our home, and it's the 4yo that acts up.  When she doesn't think she can be seen or heard, the 5yo attempts to make her sister do things she knows are unacceptable.  The other day she quietly told her sister to mess with the bathtub faucet, while the 4yo pleaded with her ""No, I don't want to get in trouble! I don't want to!"" And she kept trying and trying until we walked in. When her sister asks her questions, she either ignores her or yells at her.  She'll lie several times to our faces and say that her sister did something we caught HER in, and when she finally stops lying, she rolls her eyes, huffs, and says things like, ""Ok, look,"" or ""Fine, I did it.""  When she's put into time out or privileges get taken away, she is well informed on what she has done wrong, but when we ask her what she did, she looks away, smirks, and just says, ""Don't we go to mommy's today?"" or ""I don't know"" until we sit there for 5 minutes, and she decides to admit she knows what she did. Even when we have our heart-to-hearts and she starts acting like a well behaved child again, she explains, in great detail, why NOT to do things, but not why she did them.  I'm a full advocate of spanking, as it was done to me twice in my life, and it only built respect, not fear, for my grandmother, however, we both feel it inappropriate for a non-blood relative to physically chastise a child.  He is nervous to spank because the ex would probably claim he was being abusive so she could get full custody. (Luckily we are in a state that wouldn't go for that, but it would still be a hassle.)   Does anyone have methods they have tried for these behaviors and the kids who JUST DON'T get it? We know she's seeking attention, but she gets so much positive attention from us, that we don't know why or how to deal with her acting out like this.  I've been a professional nanny for years now, and I've never experienced such manipulative and dismissive behavior from a child, even ones from divorced homes... My SO says the way she boldly manipulates others, and lies so quickly and firmly reminds him of his ex.  HELP! "
2112,"Are there any trustworthy, less profit-driven baby product review sites?","As a future parent of twins I was glad to run across this site.  While looking through answered questions I ran across the, Is an expensive stroller worth it?, question.    Looking through some of the answers I realized that many of the brand names were completely new to me. And made me realize that the best brands may not necessarily have a huge presence on the web.  That brought about my question, What are some of the better ""parenting""/""baby product"" sites on the web?    I know this is something I could just search for endlessly on my own and everyone with a commercial interest would surface.  But I'm hoping for more trustworthy less profit driven outlets like the stack exchange.  Something like a Consumer Reports for baby products that could introduce me to what's out there without an immediate profit motive would be well appreciated.  Thanks "
2113,Can I give my baby a bottle of breastmilk straight from the fridge?,"I'm exclusively breastfeeding my baby, and occasionally give him pumped bottles. I generally try to warm them up before giving them to him, at least to room temperature. (I was once told as a tip to get babies used to room-temperature bottles right away, just in case sometime you don't have a way to heat it up...) Sometimes, though, he is frantically crying as I'm trying to warm up the bottle... Is it ok to give him a cold bottle? He doesn't seem to mind, and drinks the whole thing. Are there any problems with feeding a 2-3 month old a cold bottle? "
2114,Which is the best formula for gassy babies?,"Which formula milk is the best for gassy babies? I have 11 month old twin girls and I give them Aptamil. It's nice but they don't like the flavour and get gassy.  So which is the best milk out of these: SMA, Cow &amp; Gate, Aptamil, Nestle NAN or Enfamil? "
2115,Dad-to-be needs help finding a changing table,"My wife and I are setting up a baby room for our first child (due in June).  We've so far been very fortunate in finding great deals on a matching crib and gliding rocker/ottoman!  The only major piece of furniture we have left to buy for the baby's room is a dresser/changing table.  Here I'm at a loss.  Should I be looking for a dresser, and then look for a changing table thing that sits on top to match?  Should I be looking for a dresser/changing table combination set?  Do such things exist?  If I should look for separate pieces, what should I be looking for in a dresser?  What's the right height for these things?  (I should add that I'll be mainly looking for something on craigslist and the like, unless there's a good reason not to, or unless you can give me a better source for something like this.)  What's your experience, and what advice would you give a dad-to-be?  Thanks! "
2116,At what point are children developmentally able to understand long periods of time?,"I know that every kid hits milestones at different times, and there's no real ""right"" age, but roughly when should by son (now 4) start to really understand things like ""next month""?  He kind of, sort of, knows his days of the week, but still has trouble conceptualizing ""we're going to visit your friend a week from tomorrow... today is Monday.  Tomorrow is Tuesday, then Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday again, and then Tuesday again, and we'll see her then.""  Trying to explain things like ""how long until Christmas"" seems pretty futile.  At what point should we start to see him being able to make these connections?  Are there things that we can do to help him gain a better perspective on time? "
2117,What are these? Received from children's centre in free pack,"A friend received this baby pack from our local Sure Start center (they're a UK children's initiative for those who don't know).  It contained various, obviously useful items for people with a baby and these (pictured). We don't know what they are but we're assuming they're some kind of baby proofing device? Does anyone recognize what they are? There's no information or instructions in the pack.   "
2118,Should we feed the 3MO on demand at night with more frequent wakes?,"As is common with 3-4 month olds, we've gone from a very good sleep schedule to more frequent wakes.  Depending on fussiness she will get to sleep between 630 and 730, and she used to sleep for 3-4 hours at a time. She would wake, eat, and fall immediately back to sleep. The process repeated until 7 or 8AM.  Now she has started waking every 1.5-2 hours. Light and noise conditions have not changed. She will eat (in smaller quantities!) and fall immediately back to sleep.  During the day, however, she does not demand to be fed this frequently.   I have only a few trial runs but I've tried soothing and rocking her to sleep (which puts her down for 15 minutes or so) before she cries again. This on/off repeats until we close in on the 3-hour mark.... upon which we've been feeding her and she falls back to sleep.  Is this comfort feeding?  Should we feed her at these wakes?  "
2119,How can I teach my child about Christianity?,I am a Christian myself but my husband is not. I would like to teach my child about my religion and I have been thinking of ordering books from online Christian bookstores.  Is this the best option?  Which other methods can I use? Do you think children would enjoy Christian-themed toys and games? 
2120,Why does my baby grind her face into my shoulder?,"During episodes of fussiness, my 6-week-old daughter has started grinding her face into my chest or shoulder. She shakes vigorously from side to side like she's trying to burrow out the other side. When this started with my wife's chest, we assumed it was a hunger cue. However, after watching it for a week or two we haven't found any correlation between the grinding behavior and the need to eat or suck. She will facegrind against a shoulder, chest, arm... it doesn't seem to matter (though she always looks quite determined).  Has anyone else here experienced this sort of behavior with an infant? As with most baby issues that come up, my question is what the hell is she trying to tell us?  It's worth noting that she will also swing or bang her head during fussy episodes. Disconcerting though that is, I'm told this is a strange but not uncommon attempt at soothing. Is facegrinding possibly in the same category? "
2121,Is excessive saliva production during pregnancy normal?,I am 10 weeks pregnant now and getting excessive saliva. Does that mean something and will it stop some time soon? Anyone had the same issue? 
2122,Just found out my daughter might be gay. Now what?,"I recently came across a photo on my 14 year old daughter's iPod of a letter from a girl friend of hers that expressed her feelings for my daughter.  Words like ""I do melt in your eyes"" and ""I can't stop thinking about you"" were in the letter and I was quite shocked.  I thought the time they were spending together were like most girls…just friends and someone they would hang out with and talk. But when I saw this, it obviously is a little concerning for me…on so many levels.  From a religious perspective, we taught our kids to be tolerant and that being gay shouldn't be looked at as a bad thing and that we should all respect each other. But something inside me is saying that this type of behavior at this age can be confusing and I'm not sure if I should encourage these two spending so much time with each other. I know I'm going to have to bring it up at some point and my reaction needs to be one of support, but I think I need to ensure she is aware of the complexity of such emotions and that making a commitment at this age is just too soon. It's not that I'm against that lifestyle, I'm just not sure that at this stage that I need to be encouraging it either.  Also, what of the other girl's parents? Should I bring it up to them? I know as soon as I say something to my daughter, she'll text the other girl and if it gets out, I'd hate for her parents to be blindsided or even worse, she may do something drastic. Not sure what I would say, but again, trying to minimize the interaction with each other might help them to step back and reflect of these emotions and not jump into anything without fully understanding the affect on them. Being a teenager is already stressful enough without adding the emotion weight this can carry.  I would appreciate any feedback. "
2123,How do you teach a toddler not to share?,"Normally, my son (2 years old) does very well sharing with other kids.  In fact, he's remarkably social, even with children he's never met before.  And therein lies the problem.  On a recent trip to the museum, he was very excited by everything that was going on, but mostly by what the other kids were doing.  The problem is that he wanted to play with other kids, including older ones, but not everyone takes kindly to a 2 year old running over and ""helping"".  I definitely don't want to discourage him from the idea that sharing toys is the best way, but how do we address him running over to strangers and expecting to share?  In some cases, that's appropriate, but when an older child is carefully arranging velcro stars into specific constellation patterns, my son running over and moving stars around or slapping new ones over the other child's isn't appropriate.  Similarly, if there's a bin of blocks or Legos, my son wants to contribute to the other kids' projects, even though there's enough space/materials for him to play on his own.  Some kids are going to be alright with this, but others may not be.  How do I approach this with my son?  Ideally, I'd like him to ask the other kids if he can play with them, but at this age not all of the kids he wants to play with are verbal enough to respond appropriately, plus he moves so fast that its difficult for us to anticipate where he is going, in order to get him to ask first.  What if the child he asks says ""no""?  When we taught him how to share, we tried to be clear that he doesn't have to share, but he should.  This may be a little harder to grok coming from the other direction, particularly if the toys and designated play areas clearly are communal.  Its much easier to say ""this other little boy/girl is playing with that now; let's find something else to play with"" than ""this other little boy/girl is playing in this area; you can play too, but you have to stay over here and leave them alone."" "
2124,Should I expect a boy to ask me for permission for prom?,"As Prom season quickly approaches, I've begun to wonder about who will ask my daughter.  In particular, should I be expecting someone to ask me for permission before they go with my daughter, or do I have no say in the matter?  She's a high school junior (16 years old, 3rd year of high school)  Back when I took my date to prom, I asked her father for permission.  Is this still expected in the modern era?  I'm in the San Francisco Bay Area, California "
2125,"As a parent, how should I react to someone asking me for permission for Prom?","Following up on my question Should I expect a boy to ask me for permission for prom, I've decided to ask, considering how my daughter hints that he'll ask her within the next week, if he asks me for permission, how should I react?  I mean, apart from the yes/no answer, how should I feel/react? "
2126,Establishing bed time routines?,"When is it best to start establishing bed time routines?  I.e. Bath time? Reading a book? etc?   I've read Save our Sleep, which mentions its best to do it from early on, but i've had doctors tell me that after 3-4 months is better.  "
2127,How often should I take my 18 month child out of home,"I live in a rented apartment in HongKong and work 6 nights. The only time i get during week days is after 10 AM, that too if the weather permits.  How often shall I take my child out?  Is it that the kids who stay indoor too much become introverts? "
2128,"How do you respond to a toddler who endlessly says ""why?""?","My wife and I had joked about expecting endless ""why?"" questions from our son while we were expecting, and I thought I was prepared for it.  In fact, I thought the stereotypical constant flow of ""why? why? why?"" would be trivial, since I enjoy explaining things.  I was confident that anything I couldn't explain, I could answer by ""let's look it up!"".  Now that my son has entered that phase, though, the reality is that there are lots of ""why?"" questions that completely flummox me.  ""Why?"" has become a catch-all response in some situations, and I simply can't answer some of them (e.g. while trying to explain something by pointing out a previous example: ""remember when we went to the park?"" followed by ""why?"").  Other times, it seems almost reflexive, and the answer seems fairly obvious to me (e.g. ""Do you want french toast or pancakes for breakfast?"" followed by ""why?"").  I don't want to discourage his curiosity.  On the contrary: I want to answer as many of his questions as possible.  Is there a good strategy for dealing with the ""why?"" questions that simply don't make sense? "
2129,How do you manage free time when you have kids?,"My problem is I have almost zero free time.  I have two young kids 3 and 2 when they where young my wife didn't want to let them fall asleep by themselves so now I take the 2 year old and my wife takes the 3 year old and we spend 1-2 hours per night putting them to sleep.  Then after they are asleep my wife wants me to spend time with her watching mindless reality TV.  Most of the time she passes out on the couch.    I'm asking when should have have some time not to watch TV but to take care of the things that are important to me.  I need some time when I'm not exhausted to work on things around the house or doing some strategic planing for the group that I manage at work.  We both work and I'm expected to take care of the dishes and do 90% of the meal planning (shopping,cooking,cleanup) To top it off my wife is a very picky eater and will only pick something to eat that day.  I can't do any advanced planning.  I also bring in 3 times the income she does and I'm required to be at work for 1.5 hours more per day than she is.   I don't know what a normal evening with young kids would be like ?  After the kids are sleeping my wife is exhausted and her ideal evening is me rubbing her to sleep on the couch.  Then I have to rub her to sleep again when we go up to bed.  I really thing this is not balanced.  I need some amount of time to just decompress.  Also, each weekend I wake up with the kids and she sleeps in I'm just tired at this point.    I'm curious what the average evening is like ?  "
2130,Baby awake in the morning but quiet?,"Our baby is nearly 6 months old, and generally when awake during the day (from 8-9 AM) he needs attention and care (at least periodically, otherwise he is pretty good at inventing occupation for himself). However I recently noticed that he is also awake around 5-6 AM when we are mostly sleeping, without trying to get our attraction (just grabbing the rails of the bed, rolling, or just staring around).  What do you think, should we convert this awaken period into a playtime, or just let him observe the world as he wishes? Any similiar experience? "
2131,How to handle my baby boy urinating in bath?,"I bathe my two weeks old baby boy every evening. Very often he will urinate as soon as he touch the water, obviously because of the temperature change.  So far I just ignored it, letting him pee into the water and hoping it's sterile enough.  What should I be doing? I considered using a towel to absorb the urine but is it really necessary?  Any tips and/or ideas are welcome. "
2132,"Can a son share a bed with his girlfriend, at 27?","Your son is 27 and due to financial problems, you've invited him to move home. His 30 year old girlfriend is coming to stay. Should you oppose them sharing his double bed during her visit?  This question involves much older people than most others, but, I feel it is very much related to parenting, since, this behaviour isn't shared by wider society/friends/relatives.  I ask because my parents are asking (if not telling) me to sleep on the floor downstairs.  Am I unreasonable to expect both us and my folks to respect personal space?  None of us are religious and I'm unsure of the origin of their concerns.  How would you handle this discussion?  My parents and I have an otherwise happy relationship. "
2133,Do babies who watch TV start speaking late?,"Our baby girl just less than two years old but she can't speak like another babies of the same age.  We are not worried about this, but we have question. My baby girl understand anything but when she want to speak, she screams.   She start to standing and walking in her 8th month, but other babies start speaking sooner than ours.  People say:     Babies who watch tv (more than 1 hour per day), starting speaking late.   Is this true?  They said:     Because TV is a monologue and not a dialogue, baby always listens and will not try to speak,  as there is no need to speak and no need to engage in conversation.   We have had a specialist look at our child, but he said that there was no problem.  We want to know whether  you have had the same experince or  any information about this? "
2134,My ten month old boy wakes up three times a night for milk - How can I night wean my baby without a struggle?,"I am weaning my 10 month old boy. We seem to do well during the daytime. But during the night-time he cries a lot until I breastfeed him.  How can I night wean my baby without a struggle?  I have introduced solids for dinner. Does his frequent night-waking mean that he's hungry at night?  My grandmother suggests giving him only plain water, is this correct? Can I use formula instead? "
2135,Explaining a c-section scar to a toddler,"Our 3-year-old son noticed his mother's scar from the cesarean section and wondered what it was. We didn't really give him an answer but diverted his attention instead. Now we're talking about how should handle that question.  On one hand, we don't want to tell him exactly what it is because we don't want him to think all babies are born that way (even though both our kids were). On the other hand, it's a reasonably natural thing - but he's too young to understand it.  When's the right time to explain this? I figure there'll be a point where we feel he's mentally ready to grasp the idea.  What answers can we give until then? We need to provide something when he asks because we don't want to avoid the topic as if it were a taboo. "
2136,Can coconut milk or scraped coconut be added to my baby's food?,"I am from India where coconut plays an important role in food. My son is currently 10 months old; when can I start adding coconut milk or scraped/shredded coconut to his food?  I would like to add it so he gets used to it and also for the new flavor.  In summary, when can I safely add fresh coconut to my child's food?  "
2137,My 4-year-old keeps telling me she peed herself but she's dry?,"I'm at a complete loss. My 4-year-old daughter is potty trained and all is well. But recently she keeps moaning and complaining she peed in her underwear but upon checking, she's completely dry. This is an ongoing thing that can last hours where she'll repeat the same thing every three minutes. We tell her to go to the bathroom and she'll pee or claim she doesn't need to. It's exhausting. I have no idea what's going on. I've had a lot of urinary tract infections and it doesn't seem to be the case for her, as she's not in pain or anything of the sort. She's been doing it at daycare as well.  I just tried to put socks on her feet in case she's cold and made up a story telling her she won't feel like that if she wears socks. It's lasted 10 mins but who knows? I'd think if it was some form of UTI I haven't experienced or diabetes, she wouldn't be dry...  Any suggestions? Has this happened to any of you? "
2138,22 month old goes to bed and wakes up an hour later,"Has anyone dealt with this before? Our 22 month old daughter is put to bed at 10:30 pm everynight. She sleeps for about an hour and wakes up, crying.  Our best efforts to ignore her have not succeeded.  We usually succumb and take her out to the living room with us where we put her on the high chair, where within 15 minutes she falls asleep and we put her back to bed, this time until the morning. Why is she waking up an hour later? She has a full bottle before going to bed and doesn't need to go to the washroom when she wakes up (she's partially potty trained). "
2139,What do I tell my child about her Learning Disability?,"My daughter is 10 years old. Shes in the fourth grade. She was held back this year because she is having difficulties in Math and English Language &amp; Arts (ELA). She was suppose to go into fifth grade this year. I became aware of her learning disability at the end of last year. Her school and I are diligently providing help for her, in school and out of school. She receives one hour of tutoring in both subjects everyday at school. And I also take her to a highly recommended tutoring program on the weekends.   I haven't told her that she has this problem, but she is starting to ask me, 'Why can't I seem to make good grades and why is it difficult to retain information that I've learned?' I dont know what to say so I just change the subject and talk about something else.  How can I tell my daughter that she has a Learning Disability? "
2140,Three and Half years baby talking and playing in the class room alone due to less family support,"Age of my sister's daughter is 3 and half years. From her berth itself she was very active and played with us usually. Last month my sister delivered a new baby and so our family members are very busy taking care of the new child so no one is playing with the first child. One day her school teacher called my sister and informed that she is not normal like other children.   Even though there are so many children in the class room, she is playing alone and speaking with wall which looks abnormal for us. In our home also she is playing and speaking alone. Is this a normal behavior for a 3 and half year child? Will this become a serious issue? One thing we noticed is She don't like her new brother as her mom spending most of the time with the new baby only. "
2141,Should I be expected to love my new step-granddaughter instantly?,"My son has been living with his girlfriend for 4 years.  He has an 11-year-old daughter and his girlfriend also has an 11-year-old daughter. They live in another state and do not come to see me.  My granddaughter and I have an extremely close bond and I try to stay in touch with her to hold on to that beautiful relationship. Two weeks ago my son and his girlfriend got married. My new granddaughter is a beautiful loving child, but should I be expected to love her the same as my son's daughter?  I called my granddaughter the other day, and when she answered the phone I said ""How is my favorite granddaughter?"" My son called me the next day to tell me I should not have said that and that I was on speaker phone and upset my new granddaughter. He also told me I could not send a gift to my granddaughter for being on the honor role this year unless I sent a present for both of them.  Please help me understand all of this because I think real love takes time to grow and I also know my granddaughter would be hurt if I all-of a sudden stopped telling her she was my special girl. "
2142,"How to kick a twelve year old's shopping ""addiction""?","My family has never had much money, so I'm quite concerned about my sister's shopping habits. I assumed it was quite average behavior for a young girl to plead for money for the school book fair, the ice cream shop, makeup, etc., but she recently was given a dog-walking job by our neighbor and has starting spending every cent she makes.   Almost as soon as she's paid she'll bike over to the mall and start buying little trinkets and things. Sometimes she'll lie about how much money she has and beg our mother for some amount of money to buy something she desperately needs. She does the same once she's spent all her money and there are often long circular arguments that end with our mom getting too stressed out to continue and just caving in.  I've tried talking to her as her older brother and explaining why she needs to save money, how she'll want things later that she'll need to save her money for now, and how it's unwise to be wasteful of any resource, especially one that for us is scarce. This didn't work.  I tried explaining to my mother that arguing for hours about the same thing and then just giving her money is counterproductive and that she needs to make a decision and then consistently follow through with it. This didn't work either.  How normal is it for a preteen girl to spend money like this and to beg for that money when she doesn't have it? What can I do to stop it?  "
2143,Bananas. How many is too many for a toddler?,"My 22 month old baby is a the stage where she is becoming a picky eater.  One thing she currently has no resistance to, however, is bananas. She'll eat a whole banana, ask for another, power through a second banana if I give in, then ask for another, at which point I usually resist. More than 2 bananas a day seems like a lot for a 28 pound baby. I have nothing to back me up on this though.  How can I determine how many bananas is too much? Are there any negative consequences of allowing her to eat bananas to her heart's content? "
2144,Sleep training and consistency,"Our son is 7 months old, and as he frequently still needs our presence to go to sleep at night, we've decided that it's time for sleep training. The problem isn't that he needs our presence - the problem is that he will wake up after one sleep cycle, and need us to fall asleep again. And again. And again. A little more than a month ago we've transitioned him from falling asleep while sucking our fingers (god, this sounds embarrassing) to falling asleep with us present, and that transition went fairly quick, so we're hoping that he'll adjust quickly again. We're planning to use the controlled crying method and go in after 1, then 2, then 3, then 4 minutes.  However, we're not quite sure what to do during the day. Once we start controlled crying, we feel we would also need to do apply the controlled crying method during the day to be consistent. During the day he will often, but not always, fall asleep on his own. In addition, he still only naps for about 30-45 minutes - he's never been a brilliant napper -, and as per this blog, we've been trying to teach him to connect sleep cycles by going in as soon as he wakes up and soothe him back to sleep (her options 1 &amp; 2, waiting X time before going in, didn't produce any results for us). For the midday nap, this works about 50% of the time. I'm worried that we won't be consistent if don't also apply controlled crying during the day, but that if we do, he'll be crying 24 hours a day.  So, what should we do during the day, if he doesn't fall asleep on his own? Controlled crying, or help him fall asleep by going back in and staying until he's fallen asleep (usually about 10-15 min max)? And should we continue to try to teach him to connect sleep cycles? If we do and he doesn't fall asleep again within a reasonable amount of time, how long will we need to do this? Until he finally falls asleep whenever that is? "
2145,possible disadvantages of being very silent when baby sleeps,"Is there a disadvantage if the parents try to be very very silent when the baby is sleeping? For example making sure that TV and mobiles are muted, no dish or clothes washing is taking place and all conversations are being very silent even if they take place very far from the baby's room?  I'm afraid that if the parents do this for a long time (e.g until baby is 2 years old) afterwards the child will be very easily woken up by noises. Does this theory hold? "
2146,4.5yo - self-deprecating talk,"My 4.5 year old son has begun to say things like ""I'm always a bad boy."" and ""I don't like myself.""  They only get said when there is already some upset happening, but I don't know whether that feeling or thought has anything to do with the source of the upset.  A little context - he probably has something like ADHD, and  watching his behavior, I often find myself wondering if he might have Aspberger's or something similar.  And for at least 60% of the time, he seems perfectly ""normal"" - he is sweet, intelligent, compassionate and enthusiastic.  I think it is hard to evaluate my own parenting, but I don't think either my wife or I are overly critical - closer to the opposite.  That said, for sure we have lost our temper with him and yelled at him.  I think it's possible that it's a manipulative thing, but I'm not sure.  Does anyone have any insight on    whether this is common? if not - what should I do about it? in general, what is a good way to interact with this?  "
2147,How can I undo the bad behavior my 2.5 year old daughter learned from 5 year old children?,"We went on a trip with some friends for 2 days, and there were three 5-year-old girls.  After returning from the trip, my daughter has been pushing her brother 5X more, kicking her mother 5X more (for when she doesn't grant her wish), and mimics an angry face from one of the girls.  The behavior of the 5-year-old kids is somewhat understandable. I guess those 5-year-olds can manage when to turn the switch on and off. But my daughter and another family who had a 3-year-old haven't matured enough. We are both seeing much increased impulsive behavior in our daughters. We're almost certain that this is the reason, because when I told my wife, she, like I, had the same thought and when we saw our other friend she said the exact same thing.  My question is:   For future, should we not communicate with parents that have older children (We do see them bi-weekly, but it's just only for 2 hours. The duration of our visits, was never 2 days)? Or if we do, then we have to micromanage everything and let her know immediately this/that action was wrong.  Can I undo this behavior? And educate her? If so how?  "
2148,How do I react when my 2.5 year old hits me?,"My 2.5 year old has started hitting me in the face, on the body (anywhere) during tantrums and sometimes even when we're having a nice moment together. What is the best way to deal with this?   I know toddlers love reactions and I try not to react but it's so hard! I've tried walking away; I've tried telling him we don't hit/hitting hurts and makes mummy sad; I've lost my cool and put him in his room to 'calm down' (which doesn't work); I've raised my voice (not good, I know); I've held his arms down; I've taken away toys, etc. I know consistency is key — what's the best way for me to respond to being hit? "
2149,"How to deal with my 6 year old son is who ""over attached"" with a girl?","Here are some facts:   My son (1st grader) does not have any boys of his age to play with in my community.  Most of the boys are either too small or too big for him.   So, he has made friends with 3 girls who are 1 or 2 years younger than him. Out of these 3 girls, he is particularly interested in one girl. Whenever all 3 of them leave our house, he will wave goodbye to her by calling only her name. Even when playing, he will always show things, etc. to her only.   Also at 5:30 in the evening, he will follow a routine to go to her house and ask her and her sister (both are twins) to come play at our house. If we try to stop him meeting her, then either he will cry or throw a tantrum, which is what's worrying me.  Well, it may be too early, but should I be worried about him getting a little over attached to this girl?   How can I remove over attachment for her? "
2150,My 5-year-old daughter was verbally forced by another 7-year-old girl to show her bottom in daycare,"My 5-year-old daughter was verbally forced by another 7-year-old girl to show her bottom in daycare.  She told me today about this while taking a bath with me. She doesn't remember when this incident happened.  She told me that three of them were together when no maid or teacher was present in the room. There were small children there.  The eldest (7 years old) verbally forced two other girls to show their bottom. The other two initially refused but then gave in by stretching their panties so that the eldest could have a look.  I asked my kid whether she wants me to complain to teacher about this which may also risk the accused girl not to talk to her. My kid replied yes, I should complain to the madam.  Lately my kid has asked me that ""when we grow up do we marry?"", ""when a boy and a girl get married does a child come out?"" I suspect all this is coming from the 7-year-old she is in touch with in the daycare. She isn't in touch with any other older child. At home, there is only her father and me.  Question: How should I take this up with daycare authorities? How should I safeguard my kid from this 7 year old?  "
2151,My parents are upset that I don't visit enough. I live four hours away and I do not want to spend time with them. What should I do?,"I am 26 and I moved out of my parents' house almost three months ago. I am happy that I am finally out on my own, supporting myself financially and starting my life as an independent adult.  My parents are upset that I ""never"" visit them. I did visit them for the holidays, and it is clear that they would like to spend more time with me than I am comfortable with.  To be clear, I love my parents and we keep in touch. My mom and I frequently text each other and speak on the phone every week or two. My dad and I have phone conversations every week. This is more than enough contact for me. Oftentimes when we talk it is just idle chitchat as none of us have a whole lot going on. Our conversations usually cover how we are doing (always ""good""), how our jobs are going (""good"") and if I'm seeing anyone (""no""). Still, it is nice to keep in touch and I know that they enjoy these check-ins. Even when I lived in their home my parents felt that I did not spend enough time with them. I spent most of my free time with my friends, on the computer, or playing video games. I would always talk to my parents in the evening when we were all home from work, and again before going to sleep. We would often have dinner together as a family, but some nights it would not work out. I figured that this issue would stop when I moved out, but it has not. If anything being four hours away has only made the problem worse, and in hindsight I can see why.  Recently my parents have been pressuring me to visit them. I do not want to do this. I live over four hours away from my parents and I do not like to travel. They have offered to come to my apartment but they insist on sleeping in my bed and booting me to the couch.1 These issues aside, the main reason I don't want to visit is that I do not like spending time with my parents.  The major reason that I do not like spending time with my parents is that we often argue. We have not argued since I have moved out, but it was so frequent while I lived with them that I fear it will continue when I visit. Without getting too far into the details, my arguments with my mother are usually civil but often end with at least one of us crying. My arguments with my dad are not like this. My dad would often get mad at me for things outside of my control, or be mad about something else and redirect it at me. One time he got upset because I had plans for my long weekend and he had expected me to clean the garage that weekend. He did not tell me until I was walking out the door Saturday morning and expected me to cancel right then, even though my friends were waiting on me to pick them up. During this argument he told me to get out of ""his"" house2 and then got angrier when I left. This may sound extreme but this is an average case. The only thing making this particular argument any different is that I stood up for myself and left for the day.3 To be fair, I also redirect my anger at people when I shouldn't. We are both working on this problem. Still I would rather not spend too much time with them because I think that the odds of this happening is too great and outweighs the positives of my visit.  I have explained to them that I do not want to travel just to come visit them. I have explained that I would rather that they not come to my apartment just to visit. They do not seem to care.  One of my parents' birthdays is coming up soon. I knew this, and I had made plans for the weekend before as I had not planned on going back for the birthday.4 After my parents found out I had plans, they moved the date of the celebration to another weekend in hopes that I was available then. To be absolutely clear, I do not want to go back and visit for this birthday. This is not a party for our extended family and friends just my parents, my brother, and me. We will be going to the beach5 for the weekend and I get the feeling that they expected me to come even before checking with me.  What should I do? I feel like I am on the hook for the birthday weekend now, despite not yet committing to going. I do not want to set the precedent that I will come back every six weeks. I don't even want to set the precedent that I will come back for everyone's birthday. I was hoping that living far away would exclude me from being expected at events like these, and I do not think that it is unreasonable for me to skip these events. Am I in the wrong here? Should I go back for the birthday? Should I tell them that I don't want to go back because I am avoiding arguing with them and hurting our relationship, in addition to the other reasons I've already explained to them? Do you have any other advice for me in this situation?  Thank you for taking the time to read though my post.    1 They tell me that the norm is to let a guest sleep in your bed, but I have never seen nor heard of this before. In the past when I've visited friends or other family members I've slept in a spare room or on the couch. Even when my parents have guests they do not give up their bedroom and the guest sleeps on the couch. I slept on my air mattress when I visited for the holidays. 2 My mother and father both contribute to the lease payments for their house, which I no longer live in. I live in an apartment that I pay for myself. My mother has been the primary wage earner in my parents' house for a long time now. This is neither here nor there. 3 I did end up cleaning the garage in case anyone was curious. I did not care about having to clean up the garage, I was glad to lend a hand whenever I could. I just was not okay with my dad expecting me to drop my plans and abandon my friends for something so trivial and not time sensitive. 4 It is not a ""major"" birthday that's a multiple of 5 or 10. I am not a huge fan of birthday celebrations myself but I understand that I am not in the majority here. 5 Yes, we are going to the beach in winter. I do not like going to the beach as I find it quite boring, especially so in the winter.  I apologize if this is off-topic. I checked on meta to see if questions about parents are on-topic, and in this case I think it's a solid maybe. "
2152,How should I tell my 8-year old not to put the shop-vac hose in their mouth?,"What should I tell my 8-year old who thinks that it is amusing to stick the shop-vac hose in their mouth?  For the record, I took it away and said if they did that again, they don't get to help with vacuuming. (We were doing pretty good as a team cleaning up the family car.) We talked about how dangerous it could be, but it was one of those times when my child pretends not to hear what I'm saying and then argues, so I gave them a different task.  I am actually not sure how dangerous this is. Could it cause suffocation or ear damage? Regardless, I don't want my child doing it, and I also worry is that my 8-year old may trick a younger child into doing it. "
2153,Baby sleep associations - how important are they?,"We are working to try to help our 9 month old baby sleep better. I have read a lot of information online as well as baby sleep books such as Weissbluth, Ferber, Pantley. We are not interested in leaving our baby to cry at this stage but prefer to try more gentle methods and we understand this can take longer.  However, my question is, most of the sleep experts talk about sleep associations i.e. that the way the baby goes to sleep to start with is the way he will need to go back to sleep when he wakes at night. I am not convinced. A few examples why not:   although I am breastfeeding, we have had some success with separating the feeding from baby going to sleep (e.g. as proposed in ""the no cry sleep solution""). However, this doesn't mean he doesn't look for milk when he wakes at night. I think most sources agree that a 9 month old shouldn't need to feed at night so why is he still looking for milk? He eats reasonably well in the day. I know many people are not keen on the idea of co-sleeping but in the case that I am desperate for sleep and don't have the energy to try something else, if my baby can go to sleep with a cuddle and not be picked up, why does he not go back to sleep with a cuddle if I am sleeping next to him even when he has been recently fed? often during daytime naps, my baby wakes up after the first sleep cycle, crying and seemingly not ready to finish his nap. However whether this happens or not doesn't seem to relate to how he went to sleep.   sometimes when our baby wakes at night, he can be settled easily with a little patting in his cot. Other times he cries a lot and needs to be picked up. This happens for different wakings in the same night or wakings at a similar stage of different nights and seems independent of how he went to sleep.   So are sleep associations as big a deal as everyone seems to say they are? Is there actual evidence for this or is it just something convenient that people have made up to try to explain the mysterious world of baby sleep? Does anyone know of any studies on baby sleep associations? How can we tell if sleep associations are causing our sleep difficulties or if it's something else?  "
2154,Should I stop pirating TV in order to better role model for my toddler?,"I regularly pirate TV shows and occasionally music or movies.  Other than that, I lead a crime-free life. Like many people who pirate things, I'd never go into a store and steal a cd or dvd, which is ironic and not logical.  I know it's wrong, but honestly, if it were just me I would continue to do it. A lot of my friends and family do too, it's quite common these days. However, now that I have a kid, I'm second guessing myself. As a toddler (15 months), I'm sure she has no concept that I haven't bought the things I've pirated. Some day she will though. I want to help her develop a strong moral compass, and I also want to ensure she has a good understanding of the reality of the world we live in.   Edit for clarification: By ""pirate"" I mean downloading tv from websites or torrents. The vast majority is tv or movies that have aired on US tv stations, either network tv or cable.  Should I stop pirating now? Should I stop later? Should I keep doing it and explain that it's wrong but it's something that a lot of people do? "
2155,Our 6-year-old is talking down to herself. Why would she do that and should we be worried?,"I have a 6-year-old daughter who is wonderful and basically your normal 6-year-old. One behavior that she has been exhibiting that scares her mother and me a bit is that she will occasionally talk down to herself.  This typically happens when she's having a big drawn out argument with her mother or me. For example if she's being mean to her younger brothers over and over again or doing something that she isn't supposed to and ends up going on time out. Once she's on time out I'll hear her saying things like:     ""You can't do anything right!""   or      ""You are always bad {her name}""   It doesn't happen every day - maybe once a month? And it only seems to be on the days where she misbehaves over and over again. I suspect that it has to do with the fact that she's being told her behavior isn't acceptable over and over again, but no one has ever said anything like that to her. We've made it clear to her that no one is perfect and that we all make mistakes from time to time and that no matter what happens we will always love her.  Time outs are usually 2-3 minutes. Afterwards we talk about why it happened and what we should do next time instead (""Instead of hitting your brother come and tell daddy that he took your toy"" etc.)  We give each other a hug and go back to our day.  It really has her mother and I freaked out. There is some depression on my mother's side and I worry about this being some sort of early sign of that.    I've never really heard of this type of thing in children this young before. Is anyone aware of reputable sources that discuss why this might happen and how to address it? Should we consider taking her to see a child psychiatrist? Any help would be greatly appreciated. "
2156,9 month old baby girl sleep habits,"My 9 month old daughter is giving mommy &amp; daddy the sense she's fighting her sleep.   This is causing us to lose sleep. My daughter wakes up, or at least moves and makes noises in her sleep. She will do any of the following or a combination of all: moan, cries, whines,  throws her head from one location to another, rolls her entire body from one location to another.   I need help! Why is this happening and should I be concerned?  Keep in mind she was a premi. Should I discuss this with her pediatrician?  "
2157,"How to explain the ""brutal"" ways of wildlife and nature to a kid and when?","I would like to expose my kid to a lot of different animals quite early on (starting from 2-3 years), mostly through telling them about it and showing photos/pictures. Even though screen would be limited, I would like to show them wildlife shows too, like those on NatGeo and animal planet. (Not a parent yet, this is all just a plan)  But I started wondering if and when this would be appropriate for kids when I was watching one such show with my 3 year old nephew. They first showed a mother owl and her chicks, and how she goes out to look for food for them. He related to that pretty well, observing thats the way things work with people too. Suddenly, a bald eagle swoops down on the mother owl and makes a meal out of her.   He's seen wild animals eating other animals before, and didn't get too worked up over it, though he did seem surprised. But this was different because it had a familial structure that he could relate to. He seemed very distressed as he asked what will happen to the baby owls now, they're waiting for their mother! He was about to cry when I blurted out that this was probably a different owl, and that the mother owl is fine. Disaster averted.  He hasn't had to deal with death yet, but he seems to know that when you end up as a meal to another animal, you're not coming back anymore. Now, when I raise my own toddler, should I wait for him to be familiar with the concept of death and how its the natural way of things before showing him shows like this which depict animals hunting each other? What age/developmental milestone would be appropriate? How do I handle stressful situations arising from this?  P.S: There are many questions on here about dealing with death, but I find that the deaths associated with natural food chain of animals in the wild is very different from dealing with the death of a person or a pet. "
2158,"A religious teacher slapped my son twice for refuting God, what should I do?","First, I am an atheist and so is my husband, and our 8 year old son is taught religion in a school since it is mandatory for all students, we didn't object because we thought that we could tell him about the ""fallacies"" later when he grows up to become a teenager.   But he didn't need us for that and during a class in which the teacher was explaining how ""kind"" and ""merciful"" God is, my son raised questions and then making the conclusion that God is not at all merciful, leading the teacher (who is extremely religious) to angrily go over to the seat of my son, grab him by the shoulders and slap him furiously TWICE.  The teacher then accused us of ""degrading"" his mind and that it is ""not normal for such a young boy to naturally behave in such a way, unless he has been taught to do so"", when we haven't done nothing. My son has never used a computer so he did not get the ideas from the internet, and he has no friends in the class as he's very introverted and usually extremely quiet. And I do understand that perhaps his words may have been inappropriate, but for the teacher to just abuse him like that is totally unacceptable.   We argued with the teacher since I was very angry, and the principal intervened to let it go and advised us to correctly teach him the Bible and to teach him some ""manners as well"". This ofcourse came to us as extremely offensive, why should I teach him the Bible? The school is entirely on the teacher's side, and I feel that the teacher will continue to misbehave with my son. And I think we should report him to the police for this. But...would it be right to do so? Are we just really making a big deal out of this? What if the teachers behave rudely or just don't give enough attention to my son after this, should I say something to them?  I must also stress that we cannot take him out from the school since we live and work in a very small town distanced away from the city, and there's only one elementary school here. "
2159,What factors should I consider when deciding to let children fly unaccompanied?,"Some family members have invited my two older kids to visit for a week next summer. The plan is that the children would fly there, and then we (and the youngest sibling) would drive up a week later to pick them up, visit a few days, and then drive home again. While they've been on vacations without us before (the same relatives drove them to Disneyworld a year ago), neither one has flown on a plane.  We are (happily) not being pressured to send the children if anybody is uncomfortable with the idea. I've spent the last few months going back and forth in my mind. I think this could be a fun adventure and positive experience for them, and a way to help them both feel responsible and mature. On the other hand, I'm freaking out about plane crashes, kidnappers, what happens if they get in a fight -- mostly things that my logical side considers to be overprotective and dramatic, but my emotional side can't stop fretting over.  My daughter will be 11, and generally responsible and conscientious. Her younger brother will be 8. He's terribly forgetful and doesn't like being in unfamiliar situations, although with his sister along he'll probably cope. I am assuming that parents will be able to escort them to the gate and other relatives will allowed to the gate to meet them, so really the only alone time will be on the plane itself.  I realize that there's no ""right age"" at which kids are old enough to fly on their own. What are some things I should be considering as we come to a decision? Since neither has ever flown before, how can I help prepare them for the experience -- particularly the younger who might freak out about pressure changes, thumps as the landing gear deploys, turbulence...? "
2160,what to do when parents agree on parenting but one can't stick to agreement?,"When it comes to most things, at least the big stuff, I think my wife and I agree on how we want to raise our kids. Ours are age 3 and 2 now. Whenever we don't however, we seem to find a common ground and we both agree on the rules and a parenting style. The problem is that I still see my kids doing things we agreed they wouldn't do but not because my wife let's them, it is because she doesn't see them. for example, we agreed no sharing food with kids who are not close friends at the park but the other day I arrive and the 1st thing I see is some strange girl sharing her food with her. What should I do about this if it happens all the time. I get upset with her but maybe I shouldn't because she doesn't do it on purpose she just is less of a control freak than I. Must I just back off and accept that she is going to be less vigilent and more relaxed than I and see less of the things we are trying to avoid our kids doing? Or should I insist that she get her act together and stick to our agreement? I make a great effort to teach my kids so if they get to do these things in her care, it seems like a waste of effort.  "
2161,Is it potentially harmful to a 2-year-old to still sleep in a room with her parents?,"My daughter is 2 years and 4 months old and still sleeps in our room in her small bed. I told my wife many times to try to put her in the other room and if she cried at night, go to her or I can go to her to see if she wants anything. Then we can come back to sleep.  One thing I noticed about my daughter's behavior is, she won't go anywhere alone at home, but will always stick around us in the same room wherever we are.  We both (father/mother) work in the early morning.  Could this have any impact on the child? Is there any risk/harm in letting children sleep in our room? "
2162,Where can I find good research on long term health impact of different types/brands of infant formula (in the US)?,"My wife can no longer nurse our infant due to her health issues. Is there an online resource I can use to research different types/brands of infant formula? I'm looking for independent, and preferable long-term longitudinal studies of child health similar to the ones which compare formula feeding vs breastfeeding. Do such studies exist? Where can we find them?  "
2163,"If a pregnant woman's tummy is pressed hard, can the baby in her womb get hurt?","I am 22 weeks in my pregnancy and my baby does kick and stretch at times. Yesterday he poke a limb/head/butt out on my tummy which I could see a firm lump. I showed my friend, and she pressed on the lump quite hard , causing the lump slowly disappeared and the baby to reflex a kick on another spot.  I am worried if my friend had pressed too hard on the limbs/head/butt of my baby, will my baby get injured or broken limbs?   I do still feel kicks after that but no more firm lumps since (1day ago) .. Should I be worried? "
2164,At what age should I enroll my child in dental and vision plans?,"Background: Most insurance coverage in the US has separate policies and payroll withholding for health, dental, and vision insurance plans. One can typically decide who's covered independently for these plans (or pick and choose these plans from one spouse's employer to the other's). Coverage is usually either employee, employee+spouse, or employee+family (spouse and children).  One can also typically change these things after a life event (birth of a child, marriage, etc.) or annually during the enrollment period.  Question: My wife and I had a daughter last month. We're obviously enrolling her on our health plan immediately. She doesn't yet have teeth and is too young for any vision correction (or even to know whether she'll need any), so it doesn't seem to make sense to include her on the dental or vision plans yet. At what point would it typically make sense to do so? Is there any compelling reason why she should be included on the plans now? We'd just be paying the higher family withholding without being able to take advantage of any of the services, right? "
2165,What material is available to teach a toddler how to read?,"My 3yr old has been asking us to teach her how to read. She can recognize a decent amount of the alphabet, and picks stuff up pretty quickly (when she wants to.)   We have thought about picking some basic words and teaching sight reading, but we would rather go straight to phonetic reading. Is that possible, or should we stick to sight reading at this age? I have had people tell me (anecdotal at best) that it is a little more difficult for a kid to go from sight reading to phonetic. Is this true? Is there any good material to help out?  Is there any good material to help out?  "
2166,Are similar-sounding names a good choice for siblings?,"We are deciding on a name for our newborn son and wanted to get some feedback on whether Ava and Evan are too close names for siblings, as it's a possible choice.  Do you think these names are too similar?  What are the pros and cons of giving siblings similar-sounding names?  "
2167,"Potential unsafe environment for toddlers, how to keep them safe","I am not one dislike remote place, country site and simple living and I am not overly fond of metropolitan life. But when I have to spend in some places with fireplace, piles of firewood, some wild natured domestic animals which are potentially unsafe for my wandering, curious, active toddlers, we parents have to watch them at all times. Are we overreacting? Do we let them explore new environment with their own even if there might be small fell-offs, bruises?  "
2168,3 languages family,"My wife and I speak English together because I don't understand her language and she doesn't speak mine, although we are both fluent in English.  We're having our first baby son soon and we were wondering is there any way we can teach 3 languages?  English will be the main house language first reason you already know it. Second reason because we're moving to an English speaking country.  I want to teach him my language so he can communicate with my parents and my wife wants to teach him her language so he can communicate with hers, is there any way around this? How can we start and what's the easiest way to do that? "
2169,When are kids old enough for an electric toothbrush?,"We are brushing our (nearly) two-year-old's teeth with a normal, non-electric kids' toothbrush. That works well but I am wondering if it might not be more effective (and fun?) to use an electric brush, provided that I can buy bristles suitable for small children.   I'll ask my dentist on my next visit, but that's not anytime soon. What are your experiences with electric toothbrushes? How soon can one start using them?  Update/clarification: My son is still too young to brush his own teeth -- he just chews on the toothbrush. So we do it for him, and I'd like to know if there's any argument against going electrical there.  I'm not disputing that an electric toothbrush probably makes things more fun for kids when they brush their own teeth, but we're not that far yet.  "
2170,How to encourage speech of minority language for bilingual child?,"Note: I am going to use 3rd person plural pronouns (e.g. ""they"", ""their"") when referring to my child as I think gender is not important here.  Situation:  My wife and I are using the One-parent-one-language (English &amp; Hungarian) approach to raising our child bilingual (since their birth) in a country where my wife's language (English) is the official language.  I am the only one who speaks Hungarian in our environment (house and community), besides the occasional video-call to my parents.  As our child did not start speaking until after we started wondering whether their non-speech has any other causes besides the two languages being used, to encourage their speech, I did not ""demand"" Hungarian to be spoken to me (essentially interpreting the child's English words as if they were spoken in Hungarian).  Our child is now 2-and-a-half years old.  I am spending about 30% of my child's awake time with them (more on weekends, less on weekdays).  This approach was effective enough that our child understands both languages, but when speaking, they prefer English (which is to be expected, given the above).  They do use Hungarian words sporadically in their sentences (mostly ones they do not seem to know the English equivalent of, and mostly nouns).  My wife is fully supportive of our approach and goals so far, although she does not know Hungarian (due to busy schedule this isn't going to change anytime soon).  We are not planning to move any time soon, although a short (e.g. one- or two-week long) trip about once a year to Hungary (to visit my parents and other relatives) is planned.  My mother is currently scheduled to help us out for two months (my wife's usually part-time work schedule will increase during this time), arriving in a week's time.  Goal:  I would like to encourage our child to start speaking (more) in Hungarian to me (and to my parents).  What I have tried:  Speaking and reading a lot of Hungarian, and playing/singing Hungarian folk and child songs to our child.  I am planning to start playing some (read-aloud) children's stories in Hungarian as well to introduce a variety of voices speaking the language.  My attempts to suddenly ""enforce"" the use of Hungarian (wanting to hear them ask for their wants in Hungarian and/or ""not understanding"" non-Hungarian) was met with active resistance on my child's part to the point where they would rather chose to abandon their wants instead of speaking the words in Hungarian, even when all they would have had to do was to repeat the (Hungarian) words I intoned to them back to me.  As this ended in a lot of frustration (on both ends) and in even less exposure to Hungarian, I gave up on the idea in a few day's time (further reinforced by comments to other questions on bilingual child raising on this site). (*)  (*) The above behavior on our child's part might not be (solely) related to speaking in Hungarian as they today exhibited the same behavior (refusal and giving up on the object of ""want"") when my wife wanted them to start saying ""please"" and ""I would like"" instead of ""I want"".  I tried to look for other Hungarian-speaking people in my community, but I was so far unable to find a community that would regularly organize meetings where we could go to for more exposure to Hungarian (I have heard of other Hungarians being in the area, but it appears there is no ""organized"" community to speak of).  Sometimes when I genuinely did not understand what our child was saying, I told them (in Hungarian) that I did not understand, and sometimes they repeated their request in Hungarian.  I have not yet tried to actively ""exploit"" this as an attempt to get them to speak in Hungarian.  Questions:  What options/methods do I have to encourage our child to start/try to actively use their knowledge of Hungarian?  The result does not have to be in the short-term (although that would be preferred).  How can Grandma's upcoming visit support the above options/methods?  Besides the obvious benefits (she is going to be with her grandchild almost 24/7 while visiting, so exposure to Hungarian will be increased), how can we transition these benefits to after her departure? "
2171,How important is the pronunciation of an infant's first words?,"My 11 month old son has started to talk.  He currently has a two-word vocabulary: ""uh-oh"", and ""balloon"".  He clearly understands the meaning of the word balloon, and uses it appropriately (his use of ""uh-oh"" is a little less consistent, but it is improving).    However, his pronunciation of balloon is, well, bad.  Usually it sounds more like ""boon"", although sometimes there is a buzzing ""raspberry"" sound to it (""bzzoon""), and sometimes it does sound like he's trying to extend ""boon"" to two syllables (it is hard to tell if there's an ""l"" sound in there or not, but it is the version that most clearly sounds like ""balloon"").  Given that he is only 11 months, and he just started talking, I am not particularly worried that the mispronunciation indicates any problems.  It is my understanding that many, many toddlers come up with their own unique pronunciations of words they have difficulty with (and it is also how many people I know got their nicknames: younger siblings were unable to pronounce their names, and instead came up with unusual nicknames).  My question is: should I put effort into trying to correct his pronunciation, or is it okay to simply accept that balloon==""boon"" (or any of the other variations)?  Should I continue to use ""balloon"" myself, rather than mimic his mispronunciation? "
2172,What is Heuristic play?,"I've been looking at lots of different nurseries (day care) for my one year old child.  Most of them are proud to offer something they call ""heuristic play"".  What is heuristic play?  Why is it so popular in the UK at the moment?  What research supports the use of heuristic play? "
2173,How to choose  rainy weather clothes for multiple seasons?,"We are going to buy autumn clothes for our child (4y). There are so many technologies (waterproof,etc) and options available today that we are having a hard time choosing from the options. What are the most important features, and what are the least important features? Are there some outfits that would be good for both autumn and winter?  I know that weather can vary by region, but here the weather tends to be quite rainy during autumn, and cold during winter. "
2174,How lasting is adult behavioral influence on toddlers?,"My mom always told me ""toddlers are soft clay and you, parents can mould any shape desired"". I know it was an old idea with little information about how-tos but it is not easy to ignore because my toddlers behave like the people they see. I saw almost all behaviors are copied from parents, grandparents, relatives and friends of them. Imitating and adopting behaviors seems based on their genetic tendencies and instinct although I haven't found any strong reference so far yet.    How can parents control this?  How long will poor behavior persist if toddlers took it up from others (toddler to preschooler, to teenager, to adult)?    I am looking for some experiences with and evidence of the persistence of bad or poor behaviors since early years of a child so that we can behave well (which is a big task to accomplish and we need guidance, no one is perfect).   My idea is we can't totally get rid of bad or poor behaviors but don't want them to persist while the child is psychologically immature. If she grew up and she got some reasonable intellect, it would be on her own. Am I correct or there are some flaws in my reasoning? "
2175,At what age should parents stop showering/bathing with children?,"I know this will likely depend on different cultures. I am looking for that input.  Both my wife and I shower with our son - not all 3 a once, but one or the other accompanies him. Someone recently expressed the feeling (not a strong conviction) that it would be more appropriate for same sex showering to extend to this age and even beyond, but that Mother/Son showering didn't seem like a good idea after 5 or 6.  I had never even considered the notion that there might be something inappropriate in such co-showering. I recall my brother and I showering with my Dad until we were old enough to remember doing so - maybe 6 or 7. It never felt weird. But I have no recollections of bathing with my mother even though I know that I did so - so it must have stopped at an earlier age.  Am I in the minority? Should Mom/son co-showering be restricted/phased out sooner than Dad/son?    I don't believe this is a duplicate of When should parents stop changing clothes in front of children? because I am trying to learn more about whether the genders involved would affect the age at which it would be inappropriate to shower together. Also, showering has a proximity and physical component that changing clothes or simply being naked doesn't. "
2176,What are the advantages and disadvantages of letting the child experience the effects of his decisions?,"Disclaimer: I do not have a child yet. But this method has been in my mind for me to put to work if ever I do get a child.  So how does this work?  Basically, instead of the parent dictating to the child what he should and should not do, the parent educates, but ultimately lets the child decide what to do. Of course, when health/potential accidents are involved, the parent should take in control.  However, in smaller cases like these :    Situation: Way past bedtime  Child: But I still wanna watch TV  Parent: Tells child that he'd be tired tomorrow for school if he doesn't sleep, then asks the child what he wants to do  Child: decides to keep watching TV  The next day, the child is too sleepy for school and had a hard time with his classes.    Premise: The best teacher is experience — letting the child know the consequences of his actions by himself, rather than just his parent telling him that it shouldn't be that way.  Right now, I see more advantages than disadvantages to this method, but I believe it is not widely used.  Am I missing out on some important points here? "
2177,"How to encourage my 3rd grade son to be more calm, respectful, and responsible?","I would like to ask two related questions:   How can we encourage a child who is in 3rd grade with ADHD/ADD to do his own homework without relying on his mom? How can we teach him to behave more calmly, to listen to and be more respectful of others?  "
2178,Extrovert child forcing his company on others,"My seven year-old son is extremely extroverted.  My wife and I are both introverts, so we have a hard time relating to his behavior.  We have a quiet time every day for a couple hours, when my wife naps or takes a bath, my elder daughter takes a nap, and the other two kids can do pretty much what they want, subject to the following restrictions:   They have to be quiet enough not to wake anyone. They can't go into each other's rooms.   The latter rule is all the time, not just at quiet time, and is mostly so my younger daughter can get some personal space when she needs it.  She plays with her brother most of the day, but likes to use quiet time for her ""introvert recharge"" period, which means my son doesn't have anyone to play with during that time.  Yesterday, my daughter started screaming.  Turns out, she had locked her door to keep her brother out, but he had used a comb to unlock it and was forcing his way in.  He only has benign intent.  He says he feels ""lonely"" and wants to play, and honestly doesn't understand why his sister wouldn't want to play too, despite the screaming.  Still, using force like that and completely ignoring his sister's screams gives his behavior a very creepy vibe.  We have to remind him to leave his sister alone two or three times a day, which I don't find particularly unusual, but this is the first time he has gone so far as to ignore her locked door (to our knowledge), and it feels like he's not getting any better at taking a hint.  He has grabbed her before to keep her from leaving.  First of all, for those of you who have experience with extroverted children or are extroverts yourselves, is this behavior normal for his age?  Second, this alone time is obviously very difficult for him, but it's important for the rest of the family.  What can we do to help him endure it better?  Third, what can we do to help him learn to take a hint? "
2179,What are the advantages and disadvantages of time-outs?,"What are the downsides and the advantages to using time-outs to discipline a toddler? (My daughter is 21 months old.) Are there reasons to use them? Reasons to avoid them? What are the pros and cons either way?   I've read that they are good when used immediately and consistently, but I've also read that children don't necessarily associate them with a reason to behave better and they're just a punitive measure. I can't really see how any alternative forms of discipline (that mostly seem to involve talking to them and validating their fears) would work with a toddler.   "
2180,Should Disney princess movies be avoided?,"I recently read an article entitied Are our girls suffering from 'Princess Syndrome'? which makes the point that many Disney Princess movies send a message that:     Children as young as two are taking away unrealistic ideals from   fairytale books and Disney cartoons that can affect their self esteem   later on... traditional stories   like Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella promote the idea that if a girl is   pretty enough and has fancy clothes and shoes, she find love and   popularity.   So my question is, should Disney princess movies be avoided?  Do they do more harm than good? "
2181,Can you get a toddler to be nice to his friends?,"My 2-year-old son is in daycare with several other boys.  He seems to spend the most time with the two boys who are closest in age to him (and who are also the most consistent in attending).    One of these two boys (the one closest in age to my son, being only one month younger, who we'll call ""Joe"") is clearly very attached to my son.  He gets extremely excited when my son arrives, and sometimes gets very upset when my son has to leave.  The moment we walk in the door, he runs over to greet us.  Which is actually part of the problem.  Joe has some developmental delays (he was several months premature, and is still completely non-verbal), and has some trouble understanding social boundaries (perhaps even more so than is normal for a two-year-old).  As a result, he tends to immediately run up to my son, get right in front of him before we can even get my son's coat off, and starts reaching for whatever toys my son has brought with him for the day.  My son picked up the concept of sharing fairly well maybe 6 months ago or more.  Joe is still working on the concept, although he's very much improved over the past couple of weeks/months.  Most days he starts off by handing my son whatever toy he's brought with, and only then reaching for what my son may be holding.  Usually my son will share his toys in return, although he always shows a preference for the older boy who isn't nearly as pushy (if my son brings 3-4 toys, he'll give the older boy several, and give Joe only one, and only after sharing with the older boy first).  All of this sounds well enough; however, my son has pretty clearly demonstrated that he doesn't like Joe's behavior at times (which is fair enough).  The problem stems from how my son expresses that.  For a while, my son would respond to Joe running over to greet him with ""No!  Go away, Joe!"", while holding up a hand, palm facing Joe's face.  I told him repeatedly that that wasn't very nice, and explained that while I know he doesn't like that Joe is so pushy, all he has to do is say ""wait, Joe, wait!"".  That, coupled with the daycare provider consistently telling both other boys to give my son some room when he comes in, seemed to have helped.  However, I have noticed that my son frequently isn't very nice to Joe.  Sometimes he'll yell ""No, Joe!"" and point angrily at Joe.  Sometimes I'll see him sharing with the other boy, but refusing to share with Joe.  Most recently, I saw him put his face right in front of Joe's and growl loudly at him (!).  None of this seems to deter Joe, or even upset him, but it bothers me.  I understand that Joe doesn't respect boundaries as much as my son would like, and I think it is appropriate that my son stand up for himself, but I feel there may be more constructive ways to express it, even at his age (my son has a pretty good grasp of language for his age, and regularly uses fairly complex sentences; sometimes he will use sentences of a dozen words or more).  The thing is, I'm pretty sure my son likes Joe.  Almost every day when we ask him what he did that day, he says he played with Joe.  He almost never mentions the other boys, and when we ask him if he had a good time playing with Joe, the answer is almost always an enthusiastic ""yeah!"".  Of course, this is frequently followed up by complaints about Joe ""taking his toys"".  The daycare provider has told me several times that the problems we see in the morning almost always resolve themselves within a few minutes, and they (all three) seem to get along very well throughout the day.  Is it possible to get my son to be nicer (no yelling/growling/comments like ""go away!, etc.)?  How?  Should I be looking to fix this? "
2182,How to bring my 23-year-old daughter to an adult discussion with me and her mother about issues?,"Summary  I was witness to a banal argument between my 23-year-old daughter and her mum which has lead to a three month impasse, whereby my daughter has installed herself in my small apartment with the intent of ejecting me from it. She refuses to make peace with her mom in order to move back and is putting me in the difficult position of needing to evict her.  Background to Issue  Up until two months ago, my 23-year-old daughter had been living with her mum and her 11-year-old brother in a large 4 bedroom house without much quarreling. She is a ""full-time"" student (5 courses for a total of 15 hours in Cegep [between high-school and college]).   My daughter approached her mum two months ago for advice about whether she should take a part-time job (15h) offer with a bank. I told her that it might be good for her to realize what it is about, to eliminate a field of study. Her mother was equally not keen on the idea as it was a selling job and it would be stressful for my daughter, bringing this stress home to the family as she already did in the past. My ex-wife was concerned about her youngest son who has Autism. At this point my daughter unexpectedly, exploded in anger, shouting, slamming the door and breaking it.   The next few days consisted in her continuing the dispute coming out of her room to challenge her mum while I was a witness. After 4 days, her mom decided to put an end to this by saying that if she didn't want to talk about issues instead of shouting about them, she would have to go stay with me for a while, with which I was in agreement. She said she wouldn't leave but made no attempt to explain her outbursts which continued. Her mom then decided to give her a week to decide whether she wanted to stay under the condition that she talks, or to leave. She also gave her a professional therapy toll-free line in case my daughter needed to talk to someone. In addition, her mom also called a family therapist to ask advice on the impasse. The therapist advised that the daughter, since she was 23, should leave the house.   After one week of ignoring everyone, she called a friend to take her to my place, expecting to take over my bedroom. I was annoyed at this and refused to give her my room, having decided to put a lock on my bedroom door when I found out her plan through my 21-year-old son, who shares the apartment with me. She had ordered her older brother to dump my stuff on the balcony, in the snow, while I was out. I still don't understand how she thought it would be OK to evict her father from his appartement, and that I would comply. But when she saw the lock, she started to cry and left to stay 3 weeks with the friend. After 3 weeks, her friend said that was enough and that she had to go back and stay at my place with me and her brother.   Her mum reminded her by email, that all she had to do was talk to her or apologize and she could come back to the house. She told her mum that she is tired of apologizing for things and that it is the mother who has to apologize to her instead (for what, she won't tell her). I have never heard my ex-wife ask my daughter for an apology about anything. This was the first time. If anything my ex-wife is quite a tolerant person, in fact too tolerant one could say.  Presently she is camping out in the living room of my apartment under cramped conditions and is refusing to negotiate with either me or her mum. I cannot have her living there indefinitely and have repeatedly asked her to just talk to her mum or find her own place. She did end up taking the bank job and is able to afford a modest rent.  We are at a loss as to how to handle the situation with my daughter as she is not flexible. I don't really want to force her out but I have given her 4 months to find another accommodation or to address her issues with her mum or with me. For the moment she is refusing to budge or talk constructively to us and continues acting out. She pays no rent or utilities at the apartment except for her own food. On the other hand I think that it is maybe time for her to grow up and to become an adult and learn to be appreciative, and that a belated adolescent outburst went too far.   She still refuses to this day to communicate with her mum stating that her mum has first to apologize. I don't know what she is complaining about and don't think that her mum should apologize - for what? She gives no details, just this blanket demand. The long term issues that she is complaining about are not going to get resolved if she doesn't want to enter into a discussion and even seek a free therapeutic advice.   We did already try family therapy in the past but after a few sessions the therapist said that the two older kids were not invested in it or interested to solve issues with us.  How can I convince my daughter that it is in the interest of the whole family to communicate our issues without me resorting to drastic measures like forced eviction? "
2183,How to teach greater attention and the ability to delay gratification?,"The school recently held one of its regular parents' meeting, the first after our 8 year old daughter started her new class with a new teacher. She dislikes this teacher, complaining she is overly strict.  The feedback we go is that while our daughter is very clever, she does not pay attention, and is prone to minor misbehaviour. This is beyond the standard ""bright kids get bored in class"". She does it at home, for one thing. And the teacher gave other examples, such as daughter sitting reading a book when the rest of the class had been called to attention. She is very unaware of her surroundings, often lost in her own world.  he knows what the ""right"" thing to do is, and I suspect the root cause is essentially being unable to delay gratification. It's more fun to read a book than listen to the teacher. It's so tempting to whisper with your friends rather than paying attention. It's great to go whereever you want in your head rather than pay attention to the here and now.  I know this is very common in children, and it's something they learn as they grow up. But the teacher seemed very certain she expected better at this age. I was very much like this as a child myself. But my parents were never able to successfully teach me how to be more focussed, better at delaying short term gain for longer term rewards.  I'm still not very good at it now, and I often wish I could have learned more about how to do it as a child. But I'm not sure what my parents could have done differently, or what I could do as a parent myself. Lectures and positive reinforcement have had only minimal effect. What else can we do?  I found this question on the subject: In what ways can you help a child develop self-control and delayed or deferred gratification? But it's for a younger child. We're beyond that stage now. "
2184,"How do you curb ""tattletale"" behavior in a toddler?","My 2-year-old son seems to be fascinated by the behavior problems of other children.  He will tell anyone and everyone around that such-and-such was bad, and if he sees another child having a temper tantrum, it's almost impossible to put a stop to the ""what's wrong with him?"" questions.    I understand his need to understand the behavior of his peers, and that this is no doubt influenced by the fact that he is still learning about what is and is not acceptable behavior, and the best way for him to do so is to observe the behavior of others.  However, it can be awkward and embarrassing when my son is loudly demanding explanations for other kids' (or parents'!) behavior. Worse, though, is when he goes around repeating everything ""bad"" other kids have done, including behavior from hours earlier.  What is the best approach to dealing with this?  Will it sort itself out on its own, or is there something I should be doing to keep his observations a little more private? "
2185,My toddler seems unable to pay attention for longer than 15 minutes; should I worry?,"My son is 16 months old now. He is a very energetic boy.   When he hears music, he automatically will shake both of his hands as if he is dancing. There is no TV in our house, but sometimes, we watch youtube. While watching youtube I noticed that my son can only focus for around 15 minutes.   After 15 minutes, he will get bored and want to move on to other activities. Based on this first finding, I tried to do some investigations as to whether it is true or not that my son is only able to focus for around 15 minutes.   The result is that this is true regardless of whether he is playing with a book, his toys, etc. Should I be worried about this?  What is actually the average attention span for his age? If it needs to be improved, any suggested ways to improve his attention span?  Any good references will be welcome. "
2186,What are the risks of surgery for a tongue-tied toddler?,"My son is 22 months old and he is several tongue-tied. We only found out because I have a 4 month old and when he was first born they noticed he was tied, and asked if our other child was.   My 22 month old is having problems with speech, which he is working on with a speech therapist now.  It is hard for him to eat, so he just throws food on the floor. We had to go back to baby food. He has lost weight, so now we have him on pedia-sure to help him get what he needs.   He is having the surgery on march 7th 2013.   I wanted to know what are the risks? My husband took him to the appointment and didn't ask ask any of the important questions. I couldn't get off work to go otherwise I would have asked all these questions.   They also found out my son is partial deaf in the left ear but they could not tell us how much of a loss it is. But they know it is not 100 percent because his ear drum was responding. Could this all be connected/related?   He will be retested for his hearing before and after surgery.   What are the odds that my next child will be tongue tied?  How do you deal with your baby being so frustrated?  Any tips are greatly appreciated. "
2187,Why do kisses stop a child from hurting?,"Whenever my son gets a minor injury (scraped knee, stubbed toe, bumped head, etc.), the fastest way to get him to stop crying is to kiss wherever he got hurt.  It almost always immediately stops the crying, and when asked ""does that feel better?"", he'll almost always say ""yes"".  Why does this work?  I'm interested in answers that address both the child's perspective (i.e. if a child asks why kisses from mommy and daddy make small hurts feel better, how do you answer?), and the psychological perspective as to why this approach is so effective.  Are there any down-sides to kissing injuries to make them feel better (aside from the pitfall I ran into where my son fell on his butt, then pointed to it and demanded that I kiss it, that is)? "
2188,"Anxiety, Anger, and Major Sleep Issues in 2.5 Year Old Following Long Holiday – Is This Normal?","We went to Australia from Canada for two months to visit (and stay with) family when our son was 2.25 years old. He is now 2.5 years old.  Now he is terrified to go to sleep, screams if we leave him (even if we keep the door open) and wakes in the night screaming for mama (me). I have taken to sleeping on a mattress next to his crib when he wakes in the night because he becomes so hysterical and seems confused – screaming, crying, banging the wall, jumping up and down, demanding things that seem to make him even more upset – that I cannot leave the room because it’s so distressing to everyone and only makes him worse.  We have never seen him so angry – he almost seems possessed. He also wakes up very angry in the morning and after nap, throwing his stuffies and drink.  Some background: He was successfully potty trained a month before we left. At six months old we sleep trained him using controlled crying/CIO and then again when we night weaned him at 14 months. Both occasions worked effectively and quickly and he slept like a dream from 7:30pm–6:30am every night, happily putting himself to sleep in his crib with the door closed, and very rarely waking at night. He would also go down for nap in the same manner and sleep for up to three hours, usually waking up happy.  During our trip he had a few experiences that we think may have caused some prolonged anxiety:   Our flight to Australia was awful, he barely slept the entire time and vomited all over himself. It was his first real vomit. He then vomited in his sleep one night when we were at his grandparents’ house (a month after we arrived). I brought him into bed with me that night and from then on, for the rest of our holiday, had to sleep with him from some point in the middle of the night because he would wake up crying and we couldn’t let him disrupt the people we were staying with. He still talks about when he vomited at his grandparents’ house. The day following the vomit in his sleep, he fell and hit his head on the concrete and vomited twice right afterwards. After monitoring him for signs of concussion (of which there weren’t any that stood out) we decided to take him to a doctor, but the doctor didn’t think he had suffered a concussion. There was an occasion after the night-vomiting episode when I went out for dinner with a friend and his dad put him to bed. He was hysterical and nothing his dad did helped him, so dad left him to cry himself to sleep. This took over an hour.  Behaviourally, he seemed to change in Australia. We stayed with various family and friends and in a few hotels, and travelled a bit but still tried to keep our routine as close as possible to our regular one. Tantrums and mood swings started and he seemed quite unsettled. He also started biting his nails (which he saw his cousin do) and still does.  We have been home six weeks now and we were making progress where we could leave the door open and he’d fall asleep without me, but he got a terrible flu two weeks ago which has set us further back and added this night time anger to the mix.    Prior to our trip he was a very happy, kind, well-behaved child who never had sleep issues or displayed any separation anxiety. I am his primary caregiver; he does not attend daycare; his dad works away for weeks at a time; and we have no family close by to help.   Our bedtime routine is solid: book and milk, brush teeth, pee pee, bath, PJs, white noise, night light, goodnight song, kisses and down.   We thought things would return to normal when we got home to his familiar surroundings. We are at a loss as to how to handle this. I am exhausted and worried he will never return to the great sleeper he used to be.  Questions: How can we help him get back to sleeping well again (going to bed and sleeping through the night without me)? And how should I be handling these distressing nighttime wake-ups? I want to be firm/not give in all the time, but I also don't want to exacerbate any fears/anxiety he's experiencing.  "
2189,Should we gently take away thing from a baby's hands before she can eat them?,"My almost 1-year-old baby grabs whatever she can from the ground and tries to eat it.   Should we take it gently from her and tell her ""No""? Should we ""hit"" it out of her hand with a finger, I am worried doing this may seem a bit violent?  "
2190,My 5-year-old son seems to lack in comprehension,"My husband and I have 7 children ages 24, 18, 12, 12 (adopted niece), 5, 3, 2 (adopted niece).  All of our biological children who are school aged and beyond are well above average in school except for my 5-year-old.    He seems to have issues with comprehension.  I said to him yesterday, ""a big purple elephant rides a green bike.""  I then asked him what color the elephant was - I cannot recall the exact answer, but it was not related to the question at all.  He seemed like he had something else on his mind (like he had some playing to do); but the question seemed so simple...why couldn't he answer it?    He just turned 5 in March and started school this year.  His comprehension papers are always low scores; like a 75%!!  I admit there was some neglect during his most crucial years (19 months to present) because we had to take in my 9-year-old niece nearly four years ago with severe behavioral problems (and all symptoms of Asperger's that I feel was due to neglect at home from an eccentric, overreacting type of mother who took Rx meds, illicit drugs, and slept all day).  We spent so, so much of our time trying to correct her that I feel my son was neglected; and that kills my heart to know he was sacrificed for her!   Since my son was 2, he has known his colors, ABCs, and numbers because I always put on videos and would sing and dance with him to learn these, he can write letters, he knows their sounds, etc., but it's just comprehension he struggles with.   I don't know if this matters much, but he loves hugs and kisses and loves to snuggle; but I do have to force him to look into my eyes.  He whines about having to do that, squints his eyes, and makes crying sounds.  If I don't force him, he seems to have his eyes to the side like he's really taking in what you're saying (or maybe he's thinking of the toys he wants to go play with, I don't know...)  He's also a very picky eater...very!  I have to force him to eat dinner every night!  I have a suspicion he's not eating lunch at school, so I send him with an extra snack...that he isn't eating because it comes back home.  When I ask him what he had for lunch, he'll say milk - when I ask what else he had, he'll say, ""I don't know.""  How can he not remember??    Some days he comes home whining, pitching fits, and screaming about whatever it is that's not going his way.  I notice on those days, he falls asleep early (he usually gets about 10 hours of sleep per night). He wakes up every morning saying he's not going to school...but once he's up and ready, he runs toward the door.     When he comes home moody and whiny, it's hard to get him to calm down because everything I say he misinterprets and gets more upset!  Why can't he understand simple comprehension?  I have started reading 2 to 3 books to him per night in hopes this will help.  I ask questions (that he answers incorrectly), I animate the story, use voices, and even sing and clap.  I suppose only time will tell if that helps any.      My husband is extremely upset about this and very remorseful for adopting my niece, who he says essentially put a dark cloud over our home since day one.  We adopted her mainly because I am very loyal to my family...but my husband did not want to adopt her and wanted her gone (we found out she was secretly hurting our son when no one was looking).  Either way, I couldn't just let her go (the state labeled her as ""unadoptable"") and my husband reluctantly agreed to adopt her for me.  He is now regretting allowing the adoption because he feels our son's issues are related to him seeing my niece's behavior the last nearly four years, and I think he's right.   Does anyone have any insight, input, suggestions, or even possible reasons for his lack of understanding?  I love my son so very much!!  Any help would be GREATLY appreciated!! TIA "
2191,How do I handle my toddler's temper tantrums?,"I have a 19-month-old daughter. She is a very active child, and usually very well behaved. But in recent times I have noticed that she is constantly whining and also throwing temper tantrums - if she doesn't like something, if she doesn't get something she wants, she starts to hit herself. Very badly. Or she ends up hitting me, her mother. I have tried telling her she shouldn't be doing this, I have tried being firm, I have also expressed my displeasure. She immediately cools down, and her immediate response is to try and appease me because she thinks I am angry with her, but the behaviour continues.   I take her to the park to play with other children every evening. While she is great with kids who are seemingly older than her and enjoys playing with them, with kids her age or slightly younger, she tries to beat them and push them away. I end up constantly trying to control her, tell her she shouldn't be doing that.   I am at my wit's end as to what to do? How do I handle her whiny nature and her temper tantrums? How do I discourage her from hitting people? How do I explain to her that this is not acceptable behaviour? How I do ensure that she learns to say sorry? Please help. "
2192,How to handle a child who acts out trying to reunite separated parents,"I separated from my spouse few years ago. Our youngest child has begun recently to act out (eg swearing or being mildly violent). After careful and tactful inquiry, he stated that he is doing so as it thus hopes to reunite me and my spouse.  How should I handle him?  Should psychological support (and if yes, which type) be sought? "
2193,My 13 year old daughter says she wants to be a boy. This is out of character for her. Is this a phase?,"My daughter, 13, has said she wants to be a boy. A little background: we moved to a new state a year and a half ago. In her new school, she felt isolated among her peers until she met a girl in art, and became good friends. She joined the drama club, and made  friends with some 8th graders. They joined “the diversity club”. This club is a LGBT club. The kids put on a play they wrote and starred in, which had homosexual connotations. “Romeo and Juliet”, but script  rewritten to include  2 females as the couple, for instance.   My daughter got so wrapped up in it, that her life was as if she was copying the play. She’s no longer friends with the friend from art, but remains close with the 8th grade crowd. They all labeled themselves. One week, my daughter said she was gay, then, changed to bi, then onto pan. (I had to google that one). Now she is emphatic about being disgusted with her body and wants to be a boy. She wants to donate all the “girly” clothes she picked out last year, and tossed out all the makeup she bought a few months ago.   All her life, she was the classic girly girl. She had crushes on boys, and she and this boy were inseparable since first grade. She was sad when it came time to move away. When we settled here, she became sullen and angry, putting herself down. She now sees a therapist who she really likes. We’ve been working on her self esteem issues. She’s wanting us to call her “he” and by a male name. I can’t do that. She’s my daughter. She is female. Had we seen this coming, maybe I could come to accepting. But it happened out of the blue.  Sometimes the old her comes back-I got a makeup sample and she was interested in trying it, looked at me, then quickly put it down and said “ewww, makeup”—just a few months ago, she bought a bunch. She’s now wanting to wear boys clothes and talks of wearing a suit to her prom. She is very impressionable, and seems affected by viral YouTube videos about kids coming coming out to their mothers, and the mothers gleefully embrace with happy tears. She has told me when she’s 18, she’s having her breasts removed.    Nothing seems normal to me anymore-in terms of how she always was-this new situation just doesn’t fit.  My gut tells me this is a phase.  I’m hoping it’s a phase. But with all I’m seeing in the media about this, I’m not sure. I love her; this is too much for me to process. I’m a stay at home mom; we were inseparable. I knew her. Until now.:(  She cut off all her beautiful hair, and wears boys shorts, baggy tee shirts, and bought this awful men’s deodorant spray. Please help me sort this out. I’m at my wits end.  Do you think this is a phase? Is this common? "
2194,How to keep a 2 year old toddler entertained throughout the day?,"The child is 2 years 3 months old, and she loves following 4 activities:   Getting read books.   Making sketches with me. Going outside to play. Watching cartoons on TV.   The problem is that these activities require me or her father to engaged all the time.  I cannot read to her throughout the day (she would be extremely happy if I did so though), but I can't because reading books in a dramatic way to the child consumes a lot energy. Besides I have read all these books multiple number of time so I am bored to death but she is not.  I read 3 books at max and then I get tired and bored.  We do take her outside to play but that also requires terrible energy from our side because we have to be constantly run after her and be watchful of what she is touching and putting in her mouth.  Her father takes her out for 45 minutes in the evening. While drawing sketches she wants me to participating all the time.  My problem is that these activities can be done only for a limited period of time. What should be done after that? When there is nothing to do she tells me to switch on TV. I comply because I know there is nothing for her to do.  She has got toys non mechanical toys but she doesn't play with them. Previously she used to enjoy playing with blocks but now she is bored of it probably because the only thing which she can build is a long tower! How many times can I expect her to build that tower?  She is very social.  This problem is only for Saturdays and Sundays when the daycare is closed and she is at home with us. "
2195,7 year old still sleeps with his mother,"My wife and I sleep in separate rooms because I snore too loud and she can't sleep. When we had our son he started sleeping with her and he still does now that he's 7.  A few years ago we moved to the US, we could only afford a 2 bedroom apartment so the situation continued. We now have to move and I want a 3 bedroom so our son will get his bedroom. But the 3 bedroom apartments in our area are too expensive and if we move to another area that is cheaper then he will go from a top school in the state to a crappy school. The main reason we moved to this area was for the great schools.  Is it terrible that at 7 he sleeps with his mother and doesn't have his own room? Should we get a 3 bedroom apartment so he has his room no matter what? If we get another 2 bedroom apartment to keep his great school, how long can we keep this up? Until he's 8? 9? "
2196,My toddler wants to watch the same shows over and over,"My son (2 and a half) watches about 3-6 hours of television a week at home (usually closer to 3 than 6).  However, most of that time is spent watching the same shows or movies time and time again.  We generally let him pick what he wants to watch (so long as its something we approve of), and he has some clear favorites.  However, even within those favorites, he'll have specific episodes that he wants to watch (for example, almost every time we watch Dinosaur Train, he'll want to watch the ""spooky Night Train"" episode; any time we watch Mighty Machines, he wants to watch either the train episode, or the race car episode).  It's the same way for movies: he has a handful of movies that he wants to watch over and over again.  I try to get him to watch new shows, rather than the same over and over, but he usually is very insistent that we watch the favorites instead.  I feel that if he's going to watch TV, it should at least be something he can learn from, but how much does he learn if its the same show he's seen 20 times?  Granted, the movies aren't educational, but in those cases its more about my not wanting to have to sit through viewing #18 of Cars.  With a movie, usually I can get him to watch something new if we can make it through the opening credits (during which he'll be protesting loudly, and sometimes on the verge of tears), but I usually relent if he gets too upset.  I want to ensure that my son grows up willing, or, better yet, eager, to try new things.  Perhaps this is too early to really matter, but I'd still like to encourage him to try new things.  How can I best break him out of this pattern? "
2197,When should we transition second child into first child's room?,"Our first child ""A"" is 3½ years old and has his own room in our apartment. Second child ""B"" is 3½ months old and sleeps in a crib in the parent bedroom. I'll use letters for names to make it clearer in the text below whether I'm referring to the older or younger boy.  ""B"" will soon outgrow his newborn crib in our bedroom, so we need to get a crib that has room to grow and has taller sides so he can't climb out (once he starts to move on his own). Such a new crib will have to be larger and therefore can't fit in our somewhat cramped bedroom. We need to move the crib out of our bedroom.   We want to put the new crib into ""A""'s room although it will become a little cramped and won't leave much space for playing on the floor. We are also going to move from an apartment into a house, but the move will be after ""B"" outgrows his current (small) crib. We want the boys to share a bedroom in the house, too. That leaves another room as their shared playroom where they can be loud (that makes their bedroom a quiet room).  The move will have essentially zero social impact (neighborhood, playground, friends, kindergarten, etc.) because the house will be within walking distance of the old apartment but any move is a big change and ""A"" has a significant aversion to change.  Every toddler benefits from solid routines and structure &ndash; ""A"" very much so but not quite to an autistic degree. Still, change is difficult, and he is not old enough that we can rationally discuss options and opinions with him.  Should we move the crib into ""A""'s room now (before we move), simultaneously with the move, or some months after the move?   We're thinking that moving the crib into ""A""'s room at the same time as the home move would be too much change at once for ""A"". However, if we move ""B"" into a separate space for now (in the apartment) and move him into ""A""'s room some time after the home move, then how do we ""sell"" that idea to ""A"" when he has had his own room in the house for a while? Finally, ""A"" is not a deliberate bully but he doesn't yet understand that he must be careful with the baby and that he can't step on him, for instance. We're worried that ""A"" might hurt ""B"" in the crib when they share a room, and that we might not be able to protect ""B"" enough.    Because we're both twins, neither we nor our parents have relevant experience we can use. We still have some months before we need to decide, but we need to consider our options now in order to prepare for the change. "
2198,"My 11 year old step daughter is making troubling comments about my newborn twin daughters, her half sisters","My husband and I have been married for 5 years. It was my first marriage and I did not have any children. He was married before and has three children with his ex-wife. We had tried for 4 years to get pregnant and decided to go through IVF which resulted in a pregnancy with twins!   During my pregnancy my 10 year old step daughter made several alarming comments, such as ""What would you do if one of the babies were dropped over the banister?"", ""What would you do if a poured cleaning solution in their mouths?"", ""What would happen if someone gave them a whole bottle of drugs?""   Now the twins are here and are 3 months old. She has continued the scary comments and questions, with the last being when I said I might leave the babies in their car seats to sleep for a bit if they were still sleeping when we got home. She said if you leave them in the garage to sleep we should pour gasoline over them and it might start a fire"".   All of this is very stressful and keeps me awake at night when she is here. Her two brothers (one older and one younger) ask similar questions, but not as often as her and not a violent.   My husband won't talk to them about it because he says it's just their way of dealing with jealousy toward their new siblings. I just don't think it's something to take lightly and I don't think it's normal!  Does anyone have advice who has been through a similar situation? "
2199,My 16-year-old daughter has new personal items she hides - how can I make her to be more open?,"I am a single mother of one 16-year-old daughter and I am very attentive to how my daughter develops as a person. We both work on it with constructive approaches.  But from time to time I discover in her school bag or drawer unfamiliar items and when asked she says she bought them on her money. She can buy something like a watch or other personal items and will not say or show them to me. We are on small budget so I am not giving her money every day. She has her own small savings though. She says she bought it but sometimes I have thoughts what if not?  She says she does not have a boyfriend but what if she has and he is giving her little gifts but she is hiding it from me?  We have these kind of issues. I may be too controlling or authoritative but we are living in the conflict zone and culturally as well the place is dangerous. It is a war zone in Eastern Europe. Also culturally and by mental development of people, it is not a safe place. This is the reason of my concerns and I am attentive to the environment my daughter is in the school, school mates and friends she connects with etc.  Related to hiding things from me, I don't want her to make poor or bad choices or get in dangerous situations. Most of all, I am worried she distrusts me which can cause more closeness of her and facing issues alone that can lead to incorrect direction, behaviour, mindset. I totally understand that she is 16 and can have some freedom, but it is unnecessary to hide things and items from me, and if told and shown it will avoid both of us fussy and unpleasant situations.   What steps should I take to make her to be more open about things and prevent her to tell little lies I noticed she says sometimes?  "
2200,Step grandma name,   Possible Duplicate:   What should children call a step-grandparent?       My stepson and his wife (both in their early 20's) recently had a baby.  My son does not want me to be called Grandma and I must admit I find it to be a bit awkward as its not my son or daughter who had the child ( nor do they have any yet). I also don't want to be disrespectful to my stepsons mother.  So my question is what do I call myself when sending cards etc ? 
2201,What kind of obedience is to be expected from a 2-year old?,"My daughter is 2-years old, with what seems a good development overall. We also have a 7-month old son. My wife takes care of them at home most of the time, and they also see their cousin (also 2-years old) one day a week, and my own mother 2-3 times a week.  We are reading a lot about child development and it seems quite important to give the kids some discipline so they have some sort of frame to build upon.  We try to put ourselves in the middle about discipline, and her granny is very cool and patient with her grandaughter.  The question we keep asking ourselves at the moment is when is discipline useful, when is it too much ? And how is this going to change in the next years, i.e. what should we enforce when she is 3 or 4 ?  Some examples of situations where we wonder if insisting to have her obey is a good idea :   At every meal, she takes off her slippers (which she never takes off herself at another time) and puts her feet on the table Since 3 weeks, she does not want anymore that I give her bath, she keeps asking (crying aloud) during 30 minutes for her mother if I take her to the bathroom Sometimes, randomly, she stops to obey when asked to go to the bathroom to change her diaper, or to climb up the stairs with us, or to tidy her toys, or any simple activity she used to do willingly the past months. Instead she runs away from us in the house she would roll on the floor and cry when she is forbidden to go to a game such as bouncing castle she wants to jump on beds she sometimes completely refuses to use her potty (baby toilets, I miss the word in english) when my wife is on the phone, she climbs on the table which is quite dangerous! (no really doubts on this one)   On the other hand, here are some situations in which we found her well educated :   she usually repeats some sort of polite sentence when asking for something, and repeats thank you, hello, good bye and so on she keeps our hand outside the house she usually agrees to tidy her room and her toys she gives some toys to the little brother and gives some kisses to say hello and good night she sleeps well and very rarely disturbs us during the night or her nap   Note : I have seen this good one about how to enforce discipline. My question is really about which subjects are suitable to enforce at the ages of 2,3,4 ? "
2202,"Kid standing up in crib but unable to get back down, affecting sleep","Our 10-month old child up until recently slept pretty well.  We had an established nighttime routine that she reasonably quickly adapted to and eventually (by about 5 months?) went to sleep without fuss when we would put her down in her crib.  And then, about a month ago, she started sleeping through the night after a gradual night-weaning process.  For both going to sleep and staying asleep at night, a pacifier is an important comforter for her.  By this point, she is able to find pacifiers in her crib and put them in her mouth herself.  A few weeks ago though she started climbing up on furniture.  Then she learned this neat little trick where when she woke up in the morning before her normal wakeup time, instead of finding a pacifier and going back to sleep, she gets up on the side of the crib and cries.  She isn't confident in her ability to sit back down yet after standing up, so she just stands there and cries.  And no, she is not waking up because she no longer needs to sleep: she is very drowsy and cranky when she gets up, and will fall asleep with one of us if we get her out of the crib.  And in the last few days, she's started doing this same thing (stand up in crib, unable to sit back down) when we put her down in her crib to go to bed, and it takes several times of laying her back down (waiting 10 minutes or so in between putting her back down) before she falls asleep.  And again, she is actually tired when we put her down to sleep.  How can we re-sleep train our baby?  How can we get her to go to sleep again without fuss at night, and (more importantly, see below) get her to sleep until her normal wakeup time again?  She wakes up 0-2.5 hours early, it varies from day to day.  My question is different than this one, since that question focuses more on baby's safety when climbing up on the crib wall rather than how to get baby to sleep.  My question is similar to this one, but the specifics of the situation are different enough that I didn't find an answer there particularly useful for my situation. "
2203,My daughter repeats the same 2 numbers and when asking me questions tells me what to say and how to say it. Is this just a phase?,"I'm looking for some advice. My daughter has just turned 5 and from her being very young she has always known how she wants things and what she likes and dislikes. She's been repeating the same sentences in the same tone over and over, singing the same songs many times, putting certain toys in specific toy boxes or sitting in a certain chair to eat and having tantrums if things aren't done her way.   I used to think that behavior was normal but it's becoming progressively worse as she's getting older. For the last 3 months or so I've noticed she's become fixated on 2 certain numbers (89,000 &amp; 189,000) and randomly puts the number into any sentence she can. An example would be if I said: ""Do you want to wear this dress?"" And she'd reply ""Yes, it's been one hundred and eighty nine thousand days since I wore that dress!""; if she's coloring she will randomly say ""what if I had eighty nine thousand crayons!""  She makes me say the same sentences over and over again. For example, if she says to me ""do you know what animal I'm pretending to be?"" Or ""where have I put my shoes?"" If I reply with anything other than a very animated ""I don't know, what animal are you pretending to be/where have you put your shoes?"" She says ""no you have to say…"" and tells me what I have to say and how I need to say it.  If I repeat it, but not in the same tone or speed she used, she makes me say it again until she's satisfied. It's the same with other questions she asks, it's as though she's asking the question to answer herself but she needs me to say that in between her asking and answering.   I'm not going to lie - this is becoming really frustrating on top of other issues we've had to come to terms with in the past (behavioral problems, high energy levels, and an eating disorder). I'm concerned this might not just be a phase she's going through and would appreciate any advice from others who have experienced this kind of behavior.  "
2204,Shall I be worried about my 6-year-old girl still sleeping with us from time to time?,"My six-year-old younger daughter still sleeps with us from time to time at the early morning hours.  She gets to sleep in her own bed each and every evening (with the exception of some rare cases, like when I am on a business trip away from home for a few nights). She sleeps very well through most of the nights and wakes up happy in her very own bed.  But from time to time (I'd say once per a month or once per 2-3 weeks) she gets up some time between 3 AM till 5 AM, grabs her pillow, ""checks in"" to our bed and immediately falls asleep as if it was as normal a situation as can be in the world. No arguing, no asking questions, no nothing. Sometimes she does this as silently as possible and I simply wake up in the morning, finding her next to me, to my extreme surprise.  (I'm a bit worried about her security due to my oversized body and high weight, so most of the time, when I'm aware that she came to us, I'm packing myself and I'm going to the living room to sleep.)  Her older sister (now 9) is not doing such things at all (again, except for my business trips, when both my daughters sleep with my wife for an entire night) and was not doing so when she was at her younger sister's age (5-6 years). I don't quite recall this now, but I think that she stopped coming to our bed around being 4 years old.  Shall I be worried with this situation, by any means? Is there any ""scientifically proven"" age when such behavior should stop? Or when it should become a concern for parents?  I recall a book that I read some time ago (around eight years ago, when her older sister was around 1 and younger one was not with us yet) which possibly claimed that an over 2 years old baby, still sleeping with their parents, shall be a concert. But, I must underline that since it was around 8 years ago, I might have forgotton or messed up things that I read.  My wife claims that this not only isn't a problem, but it is in fact a good blessing for us. That I should stop worrying or even thinking about this and cherish each of such nights, because it might not last for long (giving our older daughter as an example). "
2205,"Is there any scientific evidence for TV being intrinsically harmful to children, or is it the loss of what TV replaces that is harmful?","It’s commonly accepted that responsible parents should regulate children’s amount of TV time closely.  Is this because there is something particularly problematic about the actual act of watching television that is problematic?  Or is it rather a problem simply because of what the children might otherwise be doing if not watching TV (e.g. reading, socializing, physical activity, and so on)? Does this imply, for example, that even “large” amounts of TV can be benign if, say, the TV is enjoyed with others (a form of socializing), or is itself educational (a partial replacement for reading)?  For the purposes of this question, let’s assume that any and all material seen on the TV is entirely appropriate for the child’s viewing, and that the parents are aware and involved enough to be monitoring and ensuring this fact. I am particularly interested here in any scientific literature on the subject; any personal stories or anecdotal evidence would have to be very clear-cut and explicit to be of interest to me.  My interest here is in encouraging “careful thinking” with respect to TV. Certainly, we can agree, there are some children who spend “too much” time in front of the TV—but I think it’s important to distinguish between that being inherently bad, and that being bad solely because of what it means they aren’t doing. Is it sufficient to simply limit TV time, or is there an implied assumption that limited TV time implies more time spent on other, more beneficial activities?—and if so, does that mean that parents ought to be not only limiting TV time, but also either providing superior alternatives, or monitoring how a child spends their time away from the TV to make sure the child is actually finding their own alternatives? "
2206,How to help my 10-year-old daughter who is upset because her dad is not in her life?,"The last time my 10-year-old daughter saw her dad she was 6. He would come and see her whenever he had time or when he wanted to show off to his friends that he is a dad.     When I got married, he started tripping, because my husband was raising my daughter. He made problems for all to the point my daughter was scared because he threatened to take her and kill us. Police got involved, it was crazy and I try to keep it from her but she overheard some of the threats her father was saying. He is not in her life and when he was, he was there barely. She remembers when he promised her on her birthday he was going to come and never showed up.   Now she is 10 and she cries every day asking me ""Why can't I have a real dad like everyone else? Why don't he want me or don't love me?"" I tell her we all love her and her step-dad loves her very much but she is missing her dad but she doesn't want anything to do with him. What should I do?  "
2207,Is it good to give food or drinks to a toddler at night after weaning off breast milk?,"I am in the process of weaning my toddler from breastfeeding. At the moment he still drinks milk (breastfeeds) at night. Once he stops breastfeeding completely, what should I do if he wakes up and seems hungry at night? Is it OK to offer milk, juice, or cereal?

2208,How To Address Disagreements In Parenting With Non-Custodian Parent,"I have full-custody of my daughter (age 7). We're call the other parent 'X' for ease and anonymity.  This past Saturday I granted overnight access since X's other child was going to be over too. After picking up my daughter on Sunday, I found out the following:   She puked twice One of the times she threw up was on herself She didn't have a shower or bath afterwards I found puke in her hair She didn't brush her teeth that morning or afterwards She didn't have lunch Her hair wasn't combed during the visitation (she has long hair and it should be combed at least twice daily) She didn't have lunch Didn't have anything to drink on Saturday or Sunday before I picked her up Her half-brother can't sleep without a TV on and she can't sleep with a TV on; my daughter was the unlucky one and stayed up a few hours extra because of that She was awakened a few hours before her normal time and had to start her day accordingly She watched a lot of TV   Some other minor things happened. This is not an atypical synopsis of a visitation. X is an absentee parent. Despite a custody agreement granting them generous access, they schedule two visitations a month on average (sometimes zero, very rarely 4). Usually they are afternoon access without an overnight. We don't get along well.  I'd like them to take better maintenance of our child while they have her but I don't know how to start or broker the conversation. Well I try to be nice to them, they are hostile towards any perceived criticism or outright denies any issue. Or will attack me.  How can I talk to my child's mother about how I'd like her to properly take care of our daughter's physical needs while she has our daughter in her care? In other words, how can I convince the other parent to not be neglectful while they have our daughter? "
2209,giving birth at home-- how to deal with an older child?,"we're expecting our second child and -- as with number one -- we're planning on staying at home for child labour and birth. I have a good midwife and there's no medical reason to go to a hospital.   There's another issue though that we need to tackle: Our first child. Is there someone here who has experience with giving birth at home while there's already another child (will be about 22 months old then) in the household?  I read ""What can help prepare a 15 month old for the birth of a sibling?"", but that's about the time before and after giving birth, not during...  Close family lives 3 to 8 hours away (depending on whom we're talking about...), so ""go to granny"" is not an option for a quick birth.  Thanks for all suggestions, ideas and sharings of own experiences!    EDIT to answer the comments: I was in search also for ideas on how to explain the kid that I will give birth and that during this time, I will be too occupied to care much for him. I'm hoping not to have him in the same room with me, but as you said -- babies have their own schedule, so if it comes to the toddler being in the room with me, I'd also like to hear suggestions on how to handle that.  The ideas about incorporating the midwives sounds good (as long as they agree to it), because they can also explain what#s going on -- and they have experience in caring about people who are around (normally husbands, but well, also maybe kids).  "
2210,"As a step parent, what should be my role in dealing with a volatile five year old?","About a year and a half ago I met a woman who was going to school full-time and raising a 5 year old little girl. I really just fell in love with both of them and we all bonded relatively quickly. We spent a lot of time together going on outings and enjoying life together. After about 6 months we began to consider moving in together. We both recognized that things were moving fast, but it felt right and circumstances aligned such that it seemed to make sense. We found a new place and moved in together.   We have been living together for about 8 months. I have committed myself to being a good Parent and partner, and they are both a huge priority in my life. I really want our new family to be happy and to thrive.  The fist month of co-habitation was a little rocky, but we got through it relatively easily. The next couple of months were actually pretty great (in hindsight). However, over the past few months, while my girlfriend and I have grown closer and more connected to one another, my relationship with her daughter has become somewhat un-stable.   She has frequent meltdowns that culminate in her breaking things, stomping around the apartment (wood floors), banging on doors so loudly that the neighbors have complained, screaming at the top of her lungs, throwing things at us and our dog and trying to hit and kick us.  These episodes can last for 30 minutes sometimes and usually happen as a result of either her mom or I asking her to help out with something such as cleaning her room or saying that she can't do or have something that she wants.   Early on, I tended to not get too involved in these situations. I would let her mom handle it, simply because I wanted to focus on building trust and a stronger bond before becoming an authority figure. Her mom does tend to get a little wrapped up in the drama and she is working towards handling these situations with more patience and thoughtfulness. That said, I always support what her mom says and back her up 100%. We are working together on this.  More recently, I have stepped in and have begun to handle more of these situations. Sometimes I'm able to get in front of a meltdown to divert it and other times she seems entirely bent on causing havoc. I never raise my voice or treat her un-fairly. I stick to the original point and focus only on the fact that I am simply asking her to do something or I'll explain why she isn't allowed to do something. That has been my approach thus far.   If she get physical with me, starts pushing furniture around, knocking things over or throwing objects I will tell her to stop and go to her bed to relax. This typically only enrages her further or causes her to out and out mock me. We just can't have a child breaking a bunch stuff in the house, so if she doesn't listen I will pick her up and move her to the bed and tell her that she needs to stay there until she is calm. It is then that she will kick, scratch and hit. Once on her bed, she will jump off it and run around screaming in a piercing tone. It is unbelievably loud! I know my neighbors can here it and one of them has complained about the noise.  I will admit, I am getting frustrated by this. I want to have a calm, loving house and this little girl seems to want the exact opposite (though I know that she really wants love and attention). I spend a lot of time with her doing art projects, playing in the park and building things (she wants to be an engineer, which I'm really excited about). We can have stretches of days that are really enjoyable for all of us.  Lastly, she has never met her bio-dad. The only male role models she has had in her life have been her grandfather who only recently moved to the U.S., a previous boyfriend of her mom's and an uncle or two that she sees periodically.   We did try some family counseling but the emphasis was on play, which didn't seem to address the behavioral aspects. I am completely open to other types of counseling though.   My questions are:  What can I do to get this child to treat me with the same respect that I show her, to listen well and to help out? Where should I focus my efforts in terms of bonding, direction and discipline? What kinds of counseling would be most effective in this case?  Thank you. "
2211,Is a parent expected to be emotionally and socially supportive for the child?,"I'm 26, and feel the need to sort and process my childhood. I grew up in Norway. I have always felt a bit low, passive and lacking self-confidence growing up. I was polite, kind, and quite normal; I was okay at sports, good at music and school. I feel I wasn't able to accomplish even 10% of what I wanted to do. I felt stopped.  My first question has always been, ""What's my problem? Why am I not able to accomplish more?"" I've been undergoing treatment for anxiety and depression for the last 1.5 years, so that subject is already being treated.  The second question has been, ""What's wrong in my family?"" As long as I can remember, something felt wrong. I feel I'm getting close to answering this. My parents were very good at some things, not at others. They were good at caring for us financially, our physical health, and our intellectual development.  I feel that they were less successful at being ""there"" for us emotionally and socially. The things they could easily understand, they've sort of been there. But once it became difficult, they came with all kinds of apologies, but never tried solving the problem. It was simply forgotten.  I've never felt openness to discuss anything that really matters, only school, economy, practical and material things only, never more than that. The most consistent topic was ""how was school today?"" (asked by my mom; my dad didn't participate much in this respect.) However, my mom was very interested in the superficial stuff; she just wanted to hear that everything was okay, and that I did something fun with my friends. (The truth was, I found it hard to communicate with others in my class.) I needed her to listen to what I talked about, not ignore me or get tired and leave, then just forget about the topic like I never talked about it. So I started to not talk. I avoided the question. I started to say ""Great!"" ironically, or just barely answer at all. I had nobody to talk to.  And my father wasn't there. He went down to his office almost all day. And if it were something he wanted to be a part of, it was very specific topics. He wanted to tell me about mathematics, or he wanted me to go to football training and speed skating. Never wanted to talk, or establish a proper two-way connection with me.  Actually, that goes for both. Lot of them, little me. Not much communication, and if there was some, it was one-way. From them to me. And that stopped me from talking quite quickly. I felt inside me, are you not gonna listen? And so it went.  I've been talking to my parents about my feelings about the family growing up. They sort of simply didn't/don't accept my version of the story. I can count on one hand the times my mother was a tiny bit open, but it never went anywhere. My mom listened to me (kind of stony-faced), but didn't really engage. I felt that she believed everything she did was perfect, and she wasn't open to hearing anything else. I had proper hopes for someday establishing honest communication with my mom, maybe in 10-20 years, maybe confirming some of my feelings, but then she got cancer and died two years ago..  My dad is worse. He gets defensive immediately, derails the conversation, twists things I say, often interrupts me telling me ""how it was"", seems unable to talk about relational difficulties at all, and defines my subjects as ""useless"" and ""meaningless"". He has a small set of things he thinks is important as a parent, and the rest he strictly and firmly doesn't want to think about. This is very difficult for me to deal with.  I've concluded that for some reason both my mum and dad failed in some important parts of parenting, namely the emotional and social support of me and my siblings. My father did what he felt was important to do, but the emotional and social part that I needed, being me growing up here in this place, he feels he had no responsibility to provide.  I feel that I see this in other families as well, and that it's somehow accepted by many parents here in Norway. It's a one-way communication, and you're not responsible for being totally present as a parent, like emotionally and socially, and the more abstract things.  Are parents supposed to be emotionally and socially present and supportive, or is it enough that they are physically and materially supportive and generally just kind?  "
2212,How can I help my 6 year old learn patience,"My 6 year old daughter could use some help developing her ability to wait or be patient.  Understanding that most of us, and especially children, could use help with that, she does need some help beyond her peers.  In fact, it's enough so that her first grade teacher asked to have a meeting about it.  She is almost always great and wants to please, so I just want to help her let that part shine through more often.  She often struggles with raising her hand and waiting her turn in class.  At home, she struggles to wait for her turn to talk, resulting in interrupting others (usually my wife and myself).  Obviously, all of this gets magnified when she's tired, so we will often have a sense that it could be a rough day when she's heading off to school (though she's working at it and getting a bit better).  Interestingly, she is pretty self aware of this.  Her teachers had picked a couple of things with her for her to work on, and she is responsible each day for giving herself a grade.  Currently, her tasks are raising her hands and being respectful.  Each day she talks with the teachers about her rating for those things, and they have commented that she pretty much always picks the same grade they would have given her.  I take from all this, that she is generally a really good kid who wants to be a good one, but who doesn't posses the skills to handle herself when things start going bad.  I think patience and being willing and able to wait her turn are the main things that will help her (as do her teachers).  We do our best to recognize when she does well and comment on it to her.  When she interrupts we point out that she has to wait her turn.  We had also started letting her earn a sticker for each ""good"" day at school, and had been talking with her about letting her buy things she wants with (like having a ""downstairs campout"") after she gets enough stickers.  (Her teachers didn't seem to like that idea as much, seemingly thinking it separates the reward too far from the act--though I think I disagree with that since she loves getting the sticker itself each day as well.)  Are there other things we can do to help her develop those skills?  Are there good games we could play or activities that will help?  Aside from attempting to be patient and show ourselves to be waiting for things we want to model the desired behavior, are there other things my wife and I can do to help her? "
2213,How to talk to my 6-year-old son about his biological father?,"My husband and I have been married for 10 years, and we have three kids.  He is not the biological father of my oldest son, who is 6.  I am confused about the best way to talk to my son about his parentage.    The biological father of my son is black. My husband is white. Naturally, my oldest looks very different from his brother and sister, who have blond hair/blue eyes. Because of his different coloring, my son has had people ask him if he is adopted. As he gets older the difference between him and the other kids only becomes more pronounced.  I have no contact with the biological father. The biological father does not know my son exists. It was an isolated incident about which I have some personal confusion. I was overseas away from my husband. I was very drunk, I told the biological father I didn't want sex, but he had sex with me anyway. I have wondered if I was raped, but to call it rape seems like a cop-out since I was acting horribly and am responsible for being in that situation in the first place. I have thought about the fact that if I call it rape, then that looks better socially for me (with my in-laws, etc). But then what does it feel like for my son to eventually hear that his biological father raped me? Besides, as I said, I was very drunk and cannot be 100% certain that it was rape. I also want to make allowances for the possibility that my son way want to contact his biological father when he grows up. My husband and I reconciled shortly after I found out I was pregnant. He is wonderful and loves my son as his own. He is the only father my son has ever known.  I am biracial myself. When my son was born we thought his darker coloring might be due to my mixed heritage. However the subsequent birth of two very white children now has everyone wondering. When my mother in law suggested my husband might not be his father, my husband got angry and basically told her to mind her own business...which she does for now. I don't think we can avoid it forever and and still have a relationship, though. Especially if the child himself knows.   I am feeling very confused by all this. Please, does anyone have suggestions about a non-damaging way to explain to a 6-year-old why he looks so different from his dad, brother, and sister? "
2214,My 13-year-old daughter is talking to a 20-year old girl on the internet. Is this normal?,"She’s not very open so I have no idea whether their conversations are age-appropriate. She is a really intelligent and responsible kid, and she's definitely smart enough not to give out any personal information, and to disengage if things got creepy. But I also feel like an adult who chats with 13-year-olds on the internet can’t be normal, and might not have a normal sense for what is socially appropriate, so I'm pretty concerned about what they might be talking about.  She lives with her mother, so I can't take away internet access. I could tell her mother, but I don't want to break her trust. I know telling her mother would completely destroy the trust she has for me. I could talk to her about the dangers of talking to adults on the internet, but she already thinks I overreact to everything, and in the future I doubt she'd tell me anything anymore.  So 1) is it normal for a 13-year-old to be friends with an adult? And 2) if not, what can I do about this? "
2215,rules for a tea party,"Im a dad of daughters.  They are native pink/sparkly/rainbow/fairy/mermaid/pink.  As much as it is the opposite of who/what I am, I love them and it is who they are.  So they love ""tea parties"".    Being a lunk, I don't know the basics.  What are the ground rules?  Is there is ""tea parties for dads"" or something?  How should I do this so I don't mess it up or teach them bad habits? "
2216,Why is my eight year old daughter trying to hurt my feelings - and how should I respond?,"I am the father of two children - an eight year old daughter and a four year old son.  I have been very close to them, in that they both play,share and trust me.  Both also have special activities that they engage in with me specifically.  As a rule both children are are also respectful and caring, both towards others and towards their parents.   In the last couple of months, though, my daughter, while continuing to play and talk with me, has started suddenly inserting comments into conversations that seem clearly intended to hurt me.  She always does it with a big smile like she's joking, and she clearly knows she is crossing a line, but she does it anyway.  Some examples include:   ""When you're unhappy, I feel happy"" ""You're leaving [for out of town] in half an hour? Why don't you go now?"" ""My brother might miss you, but I'm not going to miss you"" ""Mama is nicer than you anyway""   I emphasise that this is combined with other loving and normal behaviour - this is only about 5% of the interactions.  The obvious connection here is to the fact that I am in a somewhat complicated marital situation at the moment.  My wife (w/ the kids) lives in a different city from me, and I visit almost every weekend. My wife was emotionally abusive for the last several years (see for instance this question or this one) and in November last year I took a separate place to stay for the days I come to their city.  Since then however my wife's behaviour has improved, and while she still is egoistic and distant, she is no longer openly contemptuous and does not engage in threats or abusive language etc.  I think chances are higher than not that our marriage will survive.  I now spend more time in their residence then in mine when in their city, and my wife has started joining the kids in coming to my residence as well.  My daughter was initially very frightened by the possibility of us breaking up, but doesn't raise that now.  But it is in fact as things were improving between us that this behaviour has now started.  How should I respond to this?  I tackled the first statement (""I am happy"" etc.)  by saying I didn't think that was true, and I really hoped it wasn't true.  When she interrupted me repeatedly with ""BORING"" while I was talking, I told her this was disrespectful conduct, and she has largely stopped that.    What else should I do?  On my next visit I think I may take her aside when this kind of thing happens, tell her that if she is angry with me or scared about us she needs to tell me, and that trying to hurt me is not acceptable and doesn't work in a family either.

2217,How to encourage a 2 year old toddler to complete colouring a sketch?,"The baby is 2 years 3 months old. She is utterly interested in drawing. She has now been put in a playschool where I was told that she will be given homework regarding colouring pictures.  I have noticed that the colouring books meant for small children contain giant drawings. Most of them have big square, cirle, and other shapes etc. Other do have some animals but they are also very big.  My opinion is that if someone asks me to colour a big rectangle, I won't be interested because:     It is very big so it will take a long time to colour it.   It is does not represent anything so it is not interesting.   Now considering the above logic, I have brought the colouring books meant for bigger children for my toddler. These books have smaller pictures of animals, birds, and people.  I show the parts of body of animals, birds, and people to the child and then ask her to colour the specific part.   She seems to enjoy this. She enjoys colouring horns, eyes, feet, hands, ears. The problem starts when I ask her to colour the torso. She loses interest. I can guess that the reason is that the torso is big whether it is of an animal or a human. It is big.  I have tried the following to encourage her:   I have given her oil pastels instead of wax crayons because of the smoothness and bright shades they have. She loves them.   I tell her that I will colour x part of the body, and then ask her which part would you colour? She responds happily to this too.   But these steps do not work when colouring the torso. Also, according to the second point listed above, I colour half of the sketch and she colours the other half.  Right now, she hasn't been given any homework but when she does get the homework I am not sure if the second step I follow will be considered cheating(?) I am also not sure if this is proper way to encourage her!  Also, her school books have big rectangles to colour. I don't know how to force her to colour that giant rectangle, and animals which have giant torsos, when I myself think that colouring that giant rectangle/area is wastage of time. I never do it myself even though I am very much interested in Arts!  How to encourage a 2 year old toddler to complete colouring a sketch? "
2218,Avent manual breast pump problems,Has anyone had problems with the avent manual breast pump? Our's is losing suction. We think it's a problem with a small silicone valve. Has anyone experienced the same? 
2219,Should a 5 year old excuse themselves after farting?,"My five years old daughter sometime farts silently, and she doesn't excuse herself. Every time I detect such a situation, I remind her that she should try to avoid it and leave the room, going to a toilet, but if she fails to do that, she should excuse herself.  My wife says this is wrong. She claims that we need to keep teaching our kids (that one and younger one) that they should hold in the gas and leave to toilet, but if any escapes, they should remain silent. In my wife's opinion, excusing oneself for farting in a quite young kid is a bad attitude.  Which one of us is right? Is there any general advice to handle such situations? "
2220,Should I play Minecraft with my kids?,"All three of my sons, who are elementary-aged, enjoy playing Minecraft. We have two computers and two accounts, so we can play in multi-player worlds. They really seem to like it when I play with them in the same world.  My issues with this are these:   I view screen time as more of a necessary evil than anything else. My boys get 30 minutes each per day, and I would be happier if it were less. The interactions we have are not very high quality: occasionally sharing resources, sometimes planning together. I'm concerned about communicating that interacting over video games is quality human interaction.   So, this is basically a conflict between my understanding of what's best for my kids, and what they enjoy. How should I approach this? Should my priority be to push for my values, to do something that seems to be meaningful to them, or find some middle ground? "
2221,"I got a vasectomy after our 3rd child. Now, my wife wants a 4th child, but I don't","My wife and I (both 38 years old) have been married for 8 years now and we have 3 amazing kids (all under the age of 8). We really could not ask for more. Like any couple, we have gone through our ups and downs throughout our marriage. We made a point to see a counselor through our ups and downs just so that we have someone to talk to (like a 3rd party).   In terms of children, our original plan was to have back-to-back kids which I must admit was tough at first but we managed to work things out over the years.  About 4 years ago, my wife shared with me her dream of having a 3rd child. It took me a long time to come around and agree to this. We talked, argued, went to see a counselor. After some soul searching, I decided to compromise and decided to say yes to baby number 3. Part of the agreement was to stop after our 3rd and for me to get a vasectomy. Naturally she was ecstatic and promised me the world! Once our 3rd was about 6 months old, with the consent of the wife and as agreed, I went ahead to get the vasectomy. Fast forward to 3 years later, we have an amazing family and no regrets about having a 3rd. She is an amazing little girl.  Recently my wife shared with me her dream / desire to have a 4th. She asked me if I could make the ultimate sacrifice to reverse the vasectomy, try for a baby and get a vasectomy again. I have been going back and forth for over a month now with my wife about this. Clearly we have different views on this matter and I frankly feel trapped. Unless I say yes (she refers to as having an open mind and trying), there is no way out of this difference.  She continues to tell me this is her dream and I am the roadblock to that. She is disappointed in me that I am not even trying. Personally, I feel that I compromised with having a third child and now she is moving the goal post on me. Everything she is promising and telling me now is a recurring pattern from the time we were discussing about having our 3rd child. She is asking me to make the ultimate sacrifice, again she said the same thing the last time around. How do I know this will not stop after the 4th? She keeps making me all these promises which I have heard before. I went from the guy that made the ultimate sacrifice with having our 3rd (top of the mountain) to the negative/no-can-do person blocking her dream and that I do not love her enough to pursue this dream (I am at the bottom of the mountain all of sudden... How can this be?).  I am feeling very frustrated with the situation. All I want is my wife, back on the path we were on and enjoy the family/life we have now. Also to continue to work on our marriage and deal with all the ups/down coming our way raising our amazing three children.  Up to this point, I have listened to her, we exchanged views many times and we even went to see the doctor to inquire about the reversal of the vasectomy. The bottom line is, I do not want another child, which I have made clear to my wife. I would like her to honor her word/promise to stop after our 3rd child and I feel that it is her turn to compromise and make the sacrifice just like I had to dig deep to come around to change my mind 4 years ago. I understand she is not feeling this way on purpose and I would like to support her 100% to overcome this together. At this point, we are both just hitting a brick wall and I am so lost, not knowing what to do. I am getting the silent treatment now and she is really upset with me. I just don’t understand why I am in this position? Doesn’t her word/promise from 4 years ago mean anything anymore? I have shared with her my reasons for not wanting another child and reminded her about what we agreed on. She seems to think people are entitled to change their mind and I am fine with that. It just baffles me that she can be so casual about going back on her word and I’m all of a sudden the bad guy. At the same time, I think we need to address this void she feels. Clearly, if we were to have a 4th child, this desire of wanting another baby will not go away. Everything I’ve said to her makes logical sense to me but she just doesn’t seem to see my point of view. Or perhaps she is simply blinded by wanting another baby?  Any advice or insight on this would be greatly appreciated. "
2222,Take a 3 year old to funeral?,"Would you take a 3 and a half year old girl to the funeral of her great-granddad?    She knows about death and heaven... Death belongs to life, right?   On the other hand, I don't want to overstrain her...   Edit: I would like to share my experience with you after everything has happened:  One day before the funeral I took her and explained very clearly what we are going to do, why and what will happen. Children have a very clear language. So I explained that he died, that means we will never be able to visit him, talk to him again or even see him anymore. We were going to say goodbye to him. He will be inside of a box that is going to be put under the earth. People are going to be very sad for a while. She accepted all of this easily. So I was not absolutely sure about the grade of understanding, but since I know her and she is pretty smart, I was sure there should not be anymore suprises for her in what is going to happen. So we took her with us. Inside of the church she was pretty calm and curious. Never frightened or something. Sometimes a bit simpering. Lateron during the funeral the same. She dropped some flowers into the grave and said bye. That's it.  I am sure her presence was helpful for some of the relatives although I cared that she was not instrumented for anyone to feel better at any time. She decided herself who to talk to and where to go.  Lateron she explained her little sister that gran-grandad has ""decended in a box and is now gone"". That's it. Maybe she will remember this experience in future, maybe not, but I am very sure she will defenitely not remember it as something very scary.  The benefit is that she was a part of the process and I am sure she will never wonder where he is and why he is not there anymore because she simply knows what happened and was a part of the process to say goodbye. I am happy about the decision.  Thank you for your attention and suggestions. "
2223,How to help a 1-year-old learn words and phrases of a foreign language?,"Several months ago we started watching English video lessons on YouTube. My 1-year-old son was trying to push keys on the keyboard, not concentrating his attention on the video.  I'd like to save in his early memory English words by fixating them with video shows and cartoons. I don't know whether it is OK to demonstrate with a computer to such small children.  What are effective methods to fixate words and phrases in the memory of a very small child?   And I know, his vision is limited. Is it OK to show him videos from YouTube? "
2224,At what age can you let kids go hungry till the next meal if they don't want to eat?,"There's a lot of content on this site and others, which basically tell you never to force feed your child. Your job is to provide healthy food, it's their job to eat it. Allot a certain time limit in which to eat their meal, say half hour. If they aren't done eating within that time or don't eat at all because they don't like what's being served, then they go hungry till the next meal, and learn from the consequence. This way meal time is not a constant struggle - which aggravates the struggle more.   See : 6 Year Old meal Time expectations, Should I really be insisting that my daughter finish eating her meal?   I'm generally on board with this idea, but have a few questions:   What age is appropriate to start enforcing this? That is, not worrying about kids starving? How should it be handled for kids below that age, who are slow, picky or disinterested eaters?   This specifically asks the 1st part of the question, but the answers sadly do not suggest any suitable age. "
2225,Explain to a 4-year-old how magnets work,"My 4-year-old daughter would like to know: ""How do magnets magnet onto things?""  How can I explain this at a level she can understand?  (I'm asking this here rather than on physics.SE because this is fundamentally a how-to-explain-to-my-children question rather than a physics question. I'm not asking how magnets work, I'm asking how to explain to a 4-year-old how magnets work).  A friend has referred me to this Feynman video: [website]which is great, but my 4-year-old wouldn't understand it.  So any suggestions? Any advance on my current 4-year-old interpretation of the Feynman video, which is ""They Just Do""? "
2226,Should I expect my 20 year old son to get a job while at University?,"My son is now 20 years old, still living with us at home and goes to University three days a week. He has never had a job. Since he was a child I have tried to encourage him to do tasks for pocket money but he just wasn't interested and he hasn't changed his attitude since.   At junior school he was one of the brightest in his year and showed such promise with leadership skills. He became quieter at secondary school but still did well with his gcse's. By the time he was at college we started having problems with him, getting phone calls from his tutors saying he wasn't turning in for his lessons.  We managed to get him to stick it out although he lied to us constantly, he even lied to us about getting accepted into Manchester university when he hadn't and let his dad look for accommodation for him knowing that he hadn't been accepted. We were gob smacked when we found out he was lying and he only told us the truth because he found out that he had been accepted into another university which is local.   Last year he was only turning up to uni one day a week as he said he didn't need to go in the other two days as he could do his work at home. I have trouble believing him with this as he has lied to us so many times, but I think as uni is costing him so much in loans and that he is hardly there, that he should get a job alongside uni as otherwise he just sits in his room all day playing games and constantly making a mess in the kitchen.   I cook his meals, wash his clothes and don't charge board. I'm getting so depressed about this because I feel like I'm working so hard to earn money to keep the roof over my family's heads but I get no thanks for it.  I feel like I'm the bad guy for bringing it up time and time again that I want my son to contribute and get a job. I'm horrified that my other 18 year old son seems to be showing the same lack of responsibility in regards to getting a job.  Though he has applied for many jobs he just thinks he tried and failed, so what? And it's a constant headache trying to get him to try a bit harder and to keep on looking.  What can I do?   Update:  I cook for him as I cook in large quantities for all our family. It would seem awful for the rest of us to sit around the table eating a nice meal and to tell him that he has to buy and make his own food separately to the rest of us. I wash his clothes as this takes no extra time or effort on my part, and he is expected to bring his laundry down to the utility room and to iron his clothes. He will do, and does do daily chores but only when asked. I can't expect him to take the dog out every day as his duty for example, he has to be asked every day. He doesn't put up a fight or argue, but does the task in whichever way takes the least thought or effort and then goes back to his room.  He is an intelligent boy academically, his teachers used to describe him as being a sponge, soaking up knowledge easily. The problem is in his social skills. He is introverted and likes his own company, dislikes and avoids talking to people if he can help it, and I've tried to encourage him to be more sociable with some improvements but he's very stubborn about it.  This is one of the reasons behind why I'm so worried about him never having had a job yet. When I was young I was also shy and lacked confidence but I'd still managed to find myself several jobs starting when I was 12 and did babysitting. I was motivated to do this as I wanted to earn the money. My son lacks this motivation. When he was at college I stopped giving him money or buying him clothes hoping this would make him desire money and give him the motivation to get a job, but he just made his bit of Xmas money last all year and wore the same old clothes all year.  When he started uni he spent his student loan on a computer, a holiday and the rest covered his travelling fares so there wasn't any left to charge him rent. I was feeling annoyed about the holiday but also thought as he doesn't mix with friends often that the experience might be good for him socially, and I also hoped that having the student loan as a contrast to having no money while he was at college might make him learn to appreciate the difference some money makes, and to give him a desire to earn some for himself.  He has applied for jobs but half heatedly as he is only doing it to appease me and his father, and in the current climate I don't think this is going to land him a job any time soon.   I can't tell you just how relieved I would feel if he just got a job, anything, even just a temp job over Xmas or stacking shelves in a supermarket, just for him to take that first step.  I've tried everything and where I'm going wrong is probably not being tough enough on him. The next thing for me to do is maybe taking away all his games, TV and devices so that his comfort zone is a little less comfortable, and last resort would be to kick him out, which I know I haven't got the heart to do as just the fact that he has made it as far as university is an achievement, (I dropped out of college after one year and ended up in a dead end job working unsociable hours for next to nothing for most of my life so far), so I don't want to do anything that causes him to drop uni, which I'm sure he will if he's pushed too hard as it was difficult enough getting him to complete college.   Instead I think I may have a chat and work out some rent while he's living with us, and then in his next year tell him that I expect him to move into student accommodation unless he has by then managed to find himself a part time job, in which case I'd be more than happy for him to continue living with us. I like him living with us in any case, despite him being messy and unsociable he is still my son and I love him. I just want him to take some responsibility and get a job for his own sake and to ease my worried mind. "
2227,"Imitating parents behavior, is it safe",My four year old girl imitates parents behavior. She likes to keep things from younger two years old sister and tell her if she doesn't behave well she won't get back her toys.    Is it too young for her to imitate parents behavior?  Is it not right to discipline younger siblings because it is not time yet?  How our parents should response such reward/punish behavior between siblings?  
2228,"One Year Old Son, Cries with Mum but not me (Dad). Is it Separation Anxiety?","For a while my 1 Year old son has been a bit of a ""Daddys Boy"" and we have had a similar experience to this question:  However its gotten worse lately:   He cries with his mum (for long periods) while I am at work Doesn't like me to put him down (he cries and clings onto my shirt/clothes) Much worse at eating his food (even when I feed him).    With the food sometimes the only thing that works is to put food in front of him and ""ignore"" him, he cries for a bit and then starts to eat when he figures we aren't looking (I hate doing this but its better then him not eating). As a weird coincidence, when I make the food (as apposed to his mum) he seems to prefer but I can't imagine he notices ..I think this is just a false correlation we are spotting  Whenever we ask a healthcare professional, the answer is ""babies cry"" but I am worried my wife can't take much more of this constant lack of affection + crying.  Are these symptoms of separation anxiety? Or is it a teething phase (which partly explains the food). Or a mixture of both.  Does anyone have any advice for this situation?  "
2229,How do I handle my Roommates child bullying my child?,"I have been living with roommates since March due to financial situations, my roommate has two children 8 and 9 and my child is 5. At first everything was great but suddenly I find myself stuck in a situation. My roommates daughter, 9, has begun picking on my son. It started when my son broke her phone. Of course I immediately replaced it when it happened.  But about a week ago, it had been smashed again.   This time, it happened on a Saturday. My son goes to his dads house on weekends - Friday through Sunday. My roommate's daughter has told everyone my son broke it and demands I fix it again. I said no, because my son wasn’t even home when it happened. He couldn’t have possibly broken it. Ever since then she has been locking him out of his room, telling him it isn’t his anymore. She locked me out of my room. She’s broken his toys, hit him, told him mean things, and Sunday when he gets home he discovers she poured tide laundry detergent and blue food coloring on all of his toys, ruining them.   My child went to her and told her he forgave her for doing that, which was very sweet of him. However, I don’t know what to do? I’ve tried talking to her, she was very rude. Her mother will not discipline her and is not on my side. I can’t afford to live on my own right now, money is tight and it will be a few months before we can afford to move. Until then I feel so so frustrated and angry.   My son loves my roommate's daughter and wants to be her friend but she is so mean to him. The other child of my room mate is very sweet and plays well with my son. I just don’t know what to do. Has anyone else experienced this?  "
2230,Can it be unhealthy to deprive a child of sugar?,"My youngest son just turned five. For years he's had a relentless craving for sweets.   He's constantly requesting/demanding sugary food and drinks If we walk by somebody eating anything in a wrapper, he stops and stares (at the snack) His first stop every morning is the pantry   Recently, he (Matthew) began throwing a tremendous tantrum out of the blue. Rolling on the ground, crying, heaving, and appearing to have convulsions. My wife and I were about to call for help, but we decided to try a lollipop first. He took the lollipop, calmed down, and within a few minutes was back at play with his brothers.  His fraternal twin brother and older brother (6), also like sweets, but don't have any addictive characteristics (i.e., when we say no, they get over it and move on).   All three are on the same diet consisting mostly of natural, fresh foods, plain water, white milk, diluted fruit juices, and the least sugary, salty snacks. We also allow them to indulge occasionally on sweets (chocolate, ice cream, birthday cakes, etc.).  However, we have never allowed Matthew to fulfill his craving for sugar (assuming that's even possible). There's always been a limit, and he's always unsatisfied.   His craving isn't confined to refined sugar. He devours peaches, grapes, watermelon and other fruits with equal pleasure.  So here's my question:     Considering that Matthew's craving for sugar is relentless, intense   and has been ongoing for years, is it possible that his craving   represents a legitimate nutritional need?      In other words, is it possible that his body genuinely needs more   sugar, and by limiting his consumption we are actually stunting his   growth and development?  "
2231,What are the pros and cons of colouring books?,"What are the pros and cons of colouring-in (as opposed to freehand drawing) for pre-school and primary age children?  I'm asking in response to this question: At what age should I tell my child to colour within the lines? where it looked like there was an interesting discussion kind of 'waiting in the sidelines' but a bit off-topic for that specific question.  When I was a kid my parents avoided colouring-in - I remember the good old 'anti-colouring book' - but it's not something I've ever thought about in a lot of depth.  I know the standard criticism is that it inhibits creativity in drawing - but is that true? What's the research evidence, for and against? Maybe there are other pro and cons that I'm not aware of (e.g. perhaps it encourages fine motor skills). "
2232,"Best age for watching ""Once Upon a Time...""-like series","I have 3-4 full series of ""Once Upon a Time..."", for example ""Once Upon a Time... Life"". I played it to my 5 years old daughter and she didn't find it interesting. That isn't much surprising for me, but I'd like to know about best age, when I should consider another attempt with this?  Would 7 years be better? Or maybe 9? Or maybe even more? Maybe this is teenagers-oriented serie? "
2233,"Somewhat unemotional, destructive pre-schooler; shows no strong attachment to things. How can we help him?","My 5 year old pre-schooler exhibits some behaviors that have my wife &amp; I a little concerned, but we're unsure whether there's a real problem or not.  I'll try to summarize some of his behaviors and/or personality traits (positive &amp; negative), then go over some of it in a little more detail.   Destructive behaviors   note most of these behaviors occurred between ages 2 - 4; over the last year we've noticed a decline in his destructive tendencies, though he still peals stickers off things, and his toy breakage is roughly on par with his older brother at this age.  Furthermore, as we've tried to understand the ""why"" of this, as best we can tell he does it out of pure curiosity. Peeling stickers, paint, &amp; other decorations off his property, or off the wall in his room (peeling the paint off his room was one we've only recently arrested; he was regularly destroying the paint job in his room). Tearing pages out of books, and tearing other paper things (posters, calendars, etc); these are always his property, I've never seen him destroy someone else's property Breaking his own toys -- usually by playing rough; I don't recollect him destroying / breaking toys just because he was curious.  Personality traits   He does not have trouble bonding with people -- eg, he does not avoid physical contact (likes hugs/kisses from parents, sometimes hugs/kisses siblings), and enjoys hanging out with parents / siblings. He's very curious and talkative; loves to read, play video games, and especially loves cars and other vehicles (tractors, monster trucks, etc) He doesn't usually understand humor.  He often mistakes playful situations for offensive behaviors. Punishments generally don't phase him, except to upset him; we learned a long time ago that taking things away, spankings, etc, do not encourage him to alter his behavior.  Furthermore, his lack of interest in ""things"" (discussed below) negates the possibility of rewarding him with treats, toys, etc; however, rewards such as spending time with mom/dad, or doing other things do seem to motivate him more. He has a very high pain threshold; if someone hurts him (eg, rough-housing), he doesn't cry/scream [typically], he just gets angry.   On a related note, there's one particular quirk I've noticed lately that concerns me.  My wife and her [biological] brother have a 'tick': they pick at their thumbs to the point of bleeding/cracking.  This behavior has been around since they were both young teenagers, and neither one can explain why they do it other than it being a nervous habit.  So far as I know, my son has never observed this particular behavior, and now he's started doing it.  He's always been very defiant about swallowing his food.  When he decides he doesn't want to swallow something, he'll keep it in his mouth for hours if you let him.   This defiance extends to other things as well; when he makes up his mind that he does not want to do something, he'll just clamp his mouth shut and ignore you.  He does not form attachments to things.  I'll talk about this more below. Our pediatrician suspects he may fall in the class of children with Opposition Defiance Disorder. He exhibits ADHD symptoms -- inability to focus / concentrate, etc.    The main thing I want to explore is his lack of concern w/regard to personal property.  We're concerned it may grow into something more serious as he gets older.  Recently he got a ""slot car"" track for his birthday and destroyed it by playing too rough with it (within about a month or two).  He helped throw it away without argument, and kept talking about something unrelated.  My wife was helping him organize his bedroom and purge it of old/unused and broken toys.  He spoke fondly of many of the toys, but showed no interest in keeping them; it didn't seem to bother him that they'd be gone permanently.  It doesn't matter if it's something he plays with regularly, how long he's had it, who gave it to him, where he got it, etc.  He's never attached himself to any one thing (eg, a security blanket).  When I've taken things as punishment he'll make a show of being upset, get over it very quickly, and thereafter shows very little interest in getting it back.  He has had trouble getting along with his older brother the past few years, though they've been getting along better the last year or so (we tried having them share rooms a few years ago before they were clashing; we put a stop to that after they destroyed a room (pealed paint, peed on carpet, poop in heater vents, peed in radio, etc) and one of them bit the other).  He gets along with his other siblings quite well (for a 5 year old).  In short, we're worried his behavior could grow to encompass more anti-social behaviors.  My wife says it almost seems like he's less caring/emotional in general, and is worried he has (or may develop) a similar inability to place value on people or relationships.  What are we dealing with here?  What can we do to help him?  If he grows into an adult who doesn't particularly value 'things', but is an otherwise well-adjusted person, I'm ok with that.  However, if there's something going on I can help him with I don't want to let him down.    update 8/4/2016  A commenter requested an update on our situation so here it is:   Family dynamic   5 children: 2 older siblings (girl, boy) &amp; 2 younger siblings (girl, boy) 1 working parent, other parent part time college pets: turtle, dog, currently 1 rat (the others have been getting old &amp; dying on us)  Personality traits   Emotionally speaking he seems to be developing.  My post has ""somewhat unemotional"" in the title, though I would now amend that to ""emotionally reserved"".  Sometimes he seems not to understand either what he's feeling or how others are feeling, but he does seem to be learning to understand emotions.  This was probably my largest concern when I originally wrote this post and I'm happy to say that aspect of his development doesn't concern me nearly as much as it used to. He has begun forming some attachments to objects; there's a stuffed seal he carries around everywhere and loves to rub his mouth/nose against it -- especially when agitated. He's a fast reader and when he chooses to he reads a wide variety of books -- when he chooses to. Like many children he has explored lying, cheating, stealing, etc.  I do not feel as though these behaviors are more or less pronounced than any of his older siblings has been. He tends to be more willing to take responsibility for poor decisions as compared to his older siblings.  We had an incident earlier this year with money missing from my wife's purse.  Since I didn't know who was responsible I stopped paying allowances.  He didn't fess up until I helped him realize everyone would be punished.  I was concerned at first he wasn't responsible and was just trying to spare his siblings' the punishment but he knew details no one else had. On the one hand I feel as though it's not usually obvious to him when an action or situation will cause someone discomfort.  On the other hand, when he is aware of it he'll usually go out of his way (sometimes a little too far) to make them happy; exceptions being anyone he perceives as a perpetual irritant. He tends to be rather easy to take advantage of; some examples:   Kids in school have been able to convince him to do inappropriate things (eg, pull down pants in class) His brother convinced him to pay $5 to hear a ""secret"" that wasn't useful Our children were participating in an AWANA group at a local church we don't attend.  He had difficulty getting along with some of the kids and they started bullying him.  He would become aggravated then they would complain to leaders &amp; their parents that he was upsetting them.A few incidents in particular made it fairly clear they were intentionally egging him on so they could get him in trouble.  We tried to work with the leaders but they eventually asked us not to bring him back.We felt as though they had less interest in his welfare and more interest in getting rid of a difficult child; we removed all of our children from their organization.   Destructive behaviors   He still exhibits some destructive tendencies but they're far more infrequent.  The paint peeling in particular is still a problem and mostly manifests when he's agitated. He likes to fidget and we've found it's been more constructive to allow him access to things he can destroy than trying to teach him not to When reading books the book often doesn't survive.  If you watch him while reading he'll be absently bending/unbending, wiggling and sometimes tearing pages.  He's usually not aware he's doing it.    His school has put him on an individual education plan (IEP).  Among other things they've begun using occupational therapy techniques when he seems agitated or is struggling to concentrate.  They finalized everything at the end of the school year and we're on summer break, so we don't yet have a clear idea of how much it's helping.  In addition I've been trying to apply the nurtured heart approach as described in the book ""Transforming the Difficult Child"", though I'll readily admit I've struggled to be consistent.  Overall I feel as though things are going rather smoothly all things considered.  While it's sometimes difficult to work with him I also feel encouraged; some of the things that make it hard to work with him can be leveraged as strengths instead of limitations.  As an example my brother once remarked that he considers his (and my) ADHD to be like a super power: yes it's quite hard for us to concentrate, but when we can pull it off we become hyperfocused (concentrating to the exclusion of all else).    update 8/9/2018  We believe we're dealing with Aspergers.  Some years back we tried to get an official diagnosis from a trained psychologist but we couldn't afford the test (~$1500).  There's a charter school nearby (K-12) that specializes in dealing with children on the spectrum, but they allow any student into the school that expresses an interest.  I believe transfering him to that school was the right move as they're far more patient with him (eg, if he wants a wobble chair, they provide it) and provide him with regular access to an occupational therapist.  He has a hard time interacting with kids his own age mostly because they don't have patience for him (he always has stuff to talk about with anyone who'll listen), but overall things still seem to be progressing smoothly (relatively).

2234,"Why is my one month old kicking, grunting and eventually crying when I hold her?","My 1 month old daughter has starting something I am trying to understand. While I am holding her, either in a blanket or not, she will start grunting and kicking her legs. Crying usually starts soon after a few minutes of this.  I thought this was gas or pooping, but that doesn't seem to be the case, unless she's having trouble passing whatever has got her so unhappy.  Could this be a hunger cue? Any thoughts? "
2235,Why does my toddler pull hair to calm himself? How can I make him stop?,"My 2 year old toddler loves to pull on hair.  He pulls on mine and his own, usually to calm himself to sleep.   He has always loved pulling hair - which most babies do, but he didn't stop. I tell him gently he can't pull my hair, and he usually stops, but then soon he does it again.   I am especially concerned about the fact that he does it to calm himself (I wonder if it is a form of Trichotillomania, though it is not that severe). He doesn't actually pull out big chunks of hair, if any.   I usually move his hands from my hair to his if he is about to sleep (I don't want to say firmly 'no' or even talk to him when he is half asleep). I don't know if that just reinforces him in pulling.   As a complication of this, most nights he comes and sleeps in our bed (I am not looking to end the co-sleeping). Around 4/5 he gets half awake, and starts pulling my hair. This makes it hard for me to get my sleep. I usually just remove his hands from my hair. Again, I really don't want to get him to a wakeful state.   So my questions are:  Why does he like pulling hair?  Will it stop? How can I get him to stop, especially when he is not really awake? Is this something I should be concerned about other than the annoyance for me?  as a side note: He loves the hair of other toddlers too, but mostly remembers not to pull it.  He also doesn't have any developmental issues we are aware up, and as far as we know all his behaviors and milestones are within the norm.  "
2236,Is it prejudicial to introduce a child to a new environment soon after a separation?,"Are there any studies showing how the reactions of a children (ages 2-4) are to new environments right after their parents separation?  How soon would it be ""too soon"" for the introduction of a new stable environment that includes another parental figure? Time, stability and love are key points on the adaptation process, I am aware of that. But would it be prejudicial to include a different, stable relation to that process? "

2238,"How to teach a potty trained 2-year-old, who pees every 20-30 minutes, to ask to go early enough?","We have a 2-year-old son. We have potty trained him when he was about 22 months old and thought we were over the hill - it went quite well although he never learned to ask to the potty, we just put him on the potty often and he peed.   However, after a few weeks, he started to pee his pants and he tells me too late that he needs to go - he either tells me a second (literally) before he actually goes or after he has already peed his pants... he does not mind being wet or dirty, just comments on what he has done.   I have gone through a lot of advice and forums and articles and I have no trouble creating a potty schedule but they advise every 60-90 minutes, while he often pees his pants like 20 minutes after peeing on the potty and peeing! It is getting unbearable as he pees really often and I feel like it makes no difference whether I pee with him before or not.   The trouble is I think it was like this from day one - he peed very very frequently. He goes to daycare twice a week and has almost no incidents there. When we go out, he rarely pees himself.   I guess I am wondering if this could be a Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) or its consequences. But that does not make sense with how long he can hold it when we go out. I have a doctor's appointment scheduled in two weeks but cannot get to a doctor sooner unless it's an emergency (doctors aren't as accessible where we live. Do you think this could be normal and we started potty training too early?   I do not want to go back to napies, like no way after all that trouble! What could I do to teach him to ask to go early enough? Because a potty schedule of every 30 minutes is exhausting! Yesterday he even went number 2 on the floor and hasn't happen in like 6 months...

2239,Using the sink dish cloth to wipe infants face and hands after feeding,"My spouse gets very upset when I use the common kitchen dish-cloth to wipe my baby's hands and face after his feedings!!! The dish cloth is used to clean dishes in soapy water and wipe counter tops to clean up after cooking meals. The dish cloth is always rinsed with soapy water during most of its daily usage.  My spouse insists that I use a fresh or separate dedicated baby cloth to wipe my child's hands and face because she thinks the ""general purpose dish cloth is dirty germ factory"" and risks exposing my child to germs and unsafe/unpredictable risks to his health.  What do you think?  I for one think the obsession of ""germ free"" and ""anti-bactirail"" does more harm then good in the longer term.. and I for one have been wiping my face and mouth after a meal with the ""Kitchen Dish Rag"" since I can rememebr doing it on my own.. maybe since the age of 4 or 5.. so I am thinking that what's the harm with using the dish cloth with a 6 month old and later?? "
2240,5 month old not eating enough,"My 5-month old daughter started taking bottles of expressed breast milk about 1 month ago, since her mother needed to go back to work. Up until 5 days ago, she takes about ~24 oz per 24 hours (3 feedings of 5-6 oz during the day, and 1-2 feedings of 4-5 oz during the night).  Starting about 5 days ago, she would only take about 2-3 oz per feeding (turns her head away or refuses to suck on the nipple after that), with the last feeding of the day (~7pm) being especially bad (only take 1-2 oz from bottle, and her mother then breast feeds her after that, which she does take). The night feeding is ok, once for 5 oz.  As a result, her total intake now is only about 15-16 oz per 24 hours.   She doesn't really cry out of hunger, and does not show any other signs of distress (smiles, no cries for no reason, reasonably energetic) during the day or night.   What can be the cause? Should we be concerned?  "
2241,Moving to US with a 5 year old child,"We are considering moving to US with our only 5 years old daughter. We are likely to get a L-kind of visa to secure our stay for 1-2 years. None of us is a native English speaker. Parents do speak English, the child does  only know a few English words though, as she has been taught in her local preschool and heard English stories read or songs played. She's definitely an avid learner and eager to learn English and eager to learn in general.  There are so many questions to ask...  What is the good timing in the year of such move?  (I guess not in the summer, when the school is just about to start and it might be too late for her to accommodate).  How to make sure she overcomes the language barrier enough to start her school education in English-spoken primary school in US?  Any other practical advice is welcome as well. "
2242,My toddler has a kind of facial spasm/seizure - how to find out more about it?,"I have twins aged 14 months. Recently my wife observed that one of them while sitting on her lap was having a kind of seizure / facial spasm (I'm not sure how to explain it): His mouth was open for a while, kind of frozen with no other activity. Has both hands applied some strength.  We checked with doctor. He told us to try and take a video next time this happens. This again happened twice after this, first after a gap of maybe about a month and second after 1-2 weeks. But we were not able to record this as we were not prepared. We spoke to Doctor again who asked:   Was biting his teeth? - No Was he conscious? - Yes   He told us this might be a behavioral disorder and may be an attention grabbing technique. Another possibility was Calcium deficiency which he was not suspecting. Basically he asked us not to worry but to record it next time.  I am yet to see this myself but yesterday while he was playing with Lego blocks, while trying to connect two blocks I observed that he was putting some effort. His hands were close to his chest and he was trembling a bit.  Any idea what this might be? This may be a bit dumb question, but how can I be prepared to record this if it happens again? There is a camera kept at the room where they spent most of the time. All knows how to record it. "
2243,How to deal with my 12 year old son being allegedly caught cheating at school,"My son, 12, is a good student who always gets A's. He takes his schoolwork very seriously and does his homework on time.   Today I received a shocking call from his teacher that he was caught cheating. I'm shocked; this is so not him. I don't know how to deal with this situation.   Should I punish him? He loves to play Xbox games, so should I stop his games for a week? Please advise me on how to handle this situation. "
2244,3-year-old wants to 'do it herself' when it's already done,"My daughter (three and a half years old) has developed a strange behavior recently and I think she's passing it on to her younger brother (almost two). At odd times throughout the day, she decides she wants to 'do things herself'. The problem is that it's usually something someone else has already done.  For example, she needs to wash her hands so I turn on the sink. She has been happy and having fun but suddenly starts crying and, when I can get her to talk, she says she wants to 'do it herself'. I say ok, and she turns off the sink, waits a few seconds, then turns it back on and washes her hands but with sniffling and occasional tears. She feels a little better but is still vaguely unhappy after she's done. Is this a normal development? If so, what should I do?  She's a good kid, pretty clever, listens well, and likes trying to help when adults are doing things. I just don't know if I'm encouraging bad behavior by letting her cry to get her way. Perhaps I shouldn't let her do it but should instruct her not to fuss for silly reasons. "
2245,Should you let a toddler win?,"We've started playing some simple games with my 2-year-old son, including a simple age-appropriate matching game.  He enjoys playing, but seems (to me, at least) more focused on playing over winning.  I think that's perfect.  However, I noticed last night that he always wins.    It turns out that my wife has literally been stacking the deck in his favor.  When the game gets towards the end, she starts looking at the tiles, and checking to see if the next one dealt (she's the dealer) would be the winning card.  If it would end the game with either her or I winning, she sets it aside and picks the next one.  In at least one game she apparently deliberately put all of the tiles that matched her card at the very bottom so they wouldn't get drawn.  When I asked her about it, she said she thought he should win, and that winning would be more fun for him.  Setting aside the implications of lessons about cheating (let's assume that it was subtle enough, and that my son was distracted enough, that he had no clue that the deck was being manipulated), is there any problem with ensuring that he wins each time?  My concern, which I expressed to my wife, is that I want him to enjoy playing games for the sake of playing, and not for the sake of winning.  I don't want him to expect to win each time, and then become disappointed when he doesn't.  Is this a legitimate concern at his age, or is he simply too young to focus on the competitive side of games, and letting him win is nothing more than a harmless incentive to enjoy playing at this age?  If it isn't a problem at this age, when does it become a problem? "
2246,Are clothes needed for a newborn?,"Provided that I have a warm enough home, can a newborn live there with only diapers, or does he still need clothes on? If so, why?  "
2247,Toddler Plays in Bed and Won't go to Sleep,"I have a 2.5 year old daughter. She sleeps great once she's asleep. We do the nightly routine and put her to bed. She gets into bed after story time and cuddles her stuffed animals and closes her eyes.  After my wife and I leave the room she will play in bed - sometimes it's kicking the wall, sometimes talking to her stuffed animals, sometimes singing, etc... She may do this for 5 minutes to an hour. Even when we're sure she's tired she will stay up and play.  My wife and I have taken to standing in her room and saying ""Shhh"" or ""Lay still."" when she's been going for a while without falling asleep. Usually after 15-30 minutes of this she will fall asleep.  We got the idea of standing in there from people who's kids kept getting out of bed - recommendations were to put them back in bed and sit there quietly without getting upset or emotional.  Are we doing the right thing by staying in there? I'm hesitant to try any kind of bribery like ""Go to sleep and you get X in the morning"" or ""If you don't fall asleep you won't get Y tomorrow"" since I'm not sure she'll remember the cause or reason for them the next day.  She doesn't show any signs of being afraid or reluctance to get in bed. She's never climbs out and we don't play in bed. We read stories on a rug near the bed and after hugs and kisses she climbs into bed. Any thoughts or suggestions? "
2248,"5 year old always yells when excited, and isn't learning when to use quieter voices","I'll start by saying I don't think it's a hearing problem, as she uses a normal voice in non-excited conversation, and can hear questions asked to her in a normal voice (aside from what I suspect is normal tuning-out of my voice...)  When my daughter is in situations where she's excited, she frequently yells at a volume that's way louder than appropriate, given her proximity to other people. It sometimes happens when we're in groups, playing outside, or if she's watching TV and she wants to tell me about something she saw that she really liked. As a specific example, I was helping her off the swing today and her sandal fell off - she shouted ""MY SHOE!!!"" right in my face as it happened. It comes out sounding angry, though I'm pretty sure that's not intentional - it's just really loud.  I know it takes time to learn what's appropriate for a situation, but when can I expect my child to start using an appropriate volume when speaking in excitement? I feel like I'm constantly asking her to speak more quietly, and constantly giving reminders, but any improvement is minor at best, and it usually only applies to her current thoughts - the next time there's an exciting situation she's back to yelling.  Is continual reinforcement and reminders the best approach here? Is she too young to understand the concept at 5, and I should just relax? I feel like I'm constantly shooshing her, and it's not my intent to curtail what she's saying, but sometimes my frustration manifests itself as stopping her speech rather than adjusting her volume, so I'm hoping for a new approach. "
2249,Teaching and enforcing moderation when a kid is given too much junk food,"This is a consideration for any event or holiday at which kids are given an excessive amount of candy, sweets, or junk food. However, it's on my mind since Halloween is coming up, and the amount of candy they get is going to be much greater than other occasions.  In previous years, I've let the kids keep all their candy but rationed how much they can eat every day. I hate this for a lot of reasons:    It takes up a surprising amount of space in the pantry. There are fights over which bag belongs to who, and the ""better"" candy mysteriously moves from one bag to another. They take extra when I'm not in the kitchen.   Instead of learning self-control and reasonable portions, they learned to sneak.  Last year, their dentist had a ""buy back"" program, where they ""sold"" a pound of candy to the dentist for [tex]5 per child), and got a toothbrush and some floss. What I found particularly funny was that I broke this took them weeks in advance, that I had a plan to get rid of the majority of their upcoming haul and they could have lots of candy Halloween night, but the next day we'd be trading it in. They didn't believe I would go through with it -- I pulled into the dentist's parking lot and my nine-year-old commented that I was really committed to this joke-- until we were actually in the dentist's office and they were handed a few bucks.  Unfortunately, the dentist's office isn't doing it this year.  I realize that every parent has their own definition of ""too much,"" so I am not concerned with knowing exactly how many candy bars your kids are allowed at any given time -- just what happens when you have to deal with quantities far greater than normal. What are some strategies to avoid having a giant stash of candy in the house for weeks? How do you encourage your children to enjoy treats in moderation when an external situation -- holiday, school party, indulgent relatives -- is creating an opportunity for excess? "
2250,How can parents improve a child's behavior outside their presence?,"This question is hard to word correctly without sounding like we're trying to avoid responsibility.  That's not the case.  The issue is that our children behave better for us than for their teachers.  You only have to think about how differently the exact same class behaves for a substitute teacher to show that discipline is highly dependent on the adult in the room at the moment, but obviously parents also have an effect.  My question is how much of a parental effect is reasonable to expect, and how can it be increased?  Some things we have tried:   Discussing respect and behavioral expectations before and after school. Discussing peer pressure and how they should deal with it. Attaching rewards and consequences at home to behavior at school. Communicating what works for us at home to the teacher:  motivators, etc. Trying to uncover environmental factors (are they too tired, hungry, etc.)   What else can we try?  At what point do we just have to depend on the teacher to maintain discipline in her classroom? "
2251,How to get my sister to use correct spelling while typing on computer?,"I am sure that I am treading on eggshells here as this is a matter of opinion, but please do read on.  I absolutely resent when people use incorrect spelling for 90% of their words, on purpose. My younger sister, who is a teenager now, has been dragged into this strange world of ""text spelling"" / ""short spelling"" or whatever it is.   This is just one of her written sentences:      i do agree wid dis..coz evn i hav xperienced !! u will defnetly c d change   It is probably acceptable when you're typing on your phone where it is inconvenient or if you're typing to save the words (texting) but she does this pretty much everywhere and I'd like her to get back to using her regular language.   When I had a quick chat about this with her, she thinks that it's ""cool"" to write like that, and that google+ / facebook is not an exam so she doesn't have to stick to a format of writing. I didn't want to argue about it because if I do, it would only worsen the situation and she'd probably avoid it when I'm around. Probably.  I think that this way of speaking could seriously harm your real language skills (English is not our first language, but we literally use it everywhere) I have friends who've gone on from, ""it's only messenger!"" to, ""Oh snap, I just mailed my potential employer with my chat language"" (I am not even making that up)  Instead of just telling her what to do, I'd like her to understand why she should avoid writing like that. How can I get her to stop writing this way?  ps: I tried looking up but no one seems to have an opinion on this matter.. may be I am taking it too seriously?! "
2252,Is it normal for a toddler belly to last into the pre-school years?,"My daughter has a tummy that sticks out. She is taller than most kids in her class, even the boys. My Wife is 5'9 and I am 6'0. We have tall family members as well. However, she constantly seems to have what you may call a 'toddler belly'. She is in the upper percentiles in weight and height. We don't feed her junk. However, if she has a Sprite (soda), then her tummy does get bigger. We try to keep her active as much as possible and she is involved in minor athletics such as cheerleading.   Is it normal to have this belly sticking out? Will it ever go down? "
2253,Encouraging independence,"My seven year-old son is highly dependent on us to tell him what to do.  We had thought it was an age thing, but his little sister already grew out of it.  How can we help him be more independent?  An example from this morning.  This time of year in our area we often have highs in the 80s and lows in the 30s, so it's difficult to keep an even temperature and our house is often cold in the morning.  My son decided to dress himself in shorts and a thin T-shirt, and was huddled shivering in the common area when I came out of my room this morning.  We asked him, and he knew exactly what he needed to do to get warm, he just hadn't done it.  We expected these kinds of struggles for things parents want kids to do against their will.  I'm completely baffled when we have to tell him to do things he wants to do.  His five year-old sister handles those situations easily, and has for quite some time.  What can we do to help him?  What we already do, with relative consistency:   Let him suffer the natural consequences.  This feels cruel in cases like him being cold, so we reserve it for consequences that don't cause physical suffering.  It works so slowly that it sometimes feels cruel in other cases too.  For example, it took him 5 months to remember to bring his birthday money when we went shopping. Ask him questions that lead him to discover the solution for himself.  For example, this morning we asked, ""What should you wear if you're cold?""  He always knows the answer, which makes the questions feel like a slightly more tactful way of bossing him around.  "
2254,Is my toddler becoming too concerned with health issues?,"My son, 2 years old, has recently started some behavior that is concerning me.  This morning he was upset (this isn't terribly uncommon for him in the morning, when both my wife and I are getting ready for work).  In between tears, and demands for milk and to be picked up, he told me he needed his temperature taken.  I took his temperature (we use a non-invasive temporal thermometer), and it was perfectly normal.  He didn't even wait to see my reaction, though.  As soon as I ran it across his forehead, he walked away.  He's also been complaining about stomach aches which go away 30 seconds later:     ""My belly hurts.""      ""Where?""      ""Here."" (points to a spot on his belly)      ""Do you have to poop?""      ""No.""      ""Does it still hurt?""      ""No.""   These two things by themselves probably wouldn't concern me, but there's a family history that factors into this which is why I'm worried.  My wife's family is, in my opinion, somewhat obsessed about health issues.    Illness and injury are perpetual topics.  Any indication of something out of the ordinary seems to result in my wife evaluating symptoms to determine if she should worry.  If he seems unusually cranky, she takes his temperature.  If he seems ""out of sorts"" (defined as any period lasting more than 5 minutes where he isn't smiling and wanting to play), she takes his temperature and asks if we should take him to the doctor.  When he was 6 months old, he was incorrectly diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis.  Our specialist warned us to watch for ""bulky, greasy stools"" as an indication that he might be having pancreatic enzyme issues.  This led to her obsessively monitoring his bowel movements, and asking for constant evaluations of ""does this poop look normal?""  I think that worry was understandable at the time (we tried to get a better description of what to look for, but the best we could get was that it may ""explode out the top of the diaper"").    However, we verified over a year ago that he doesn't actually have CF, and our specialist agreed that he was merely a carrier.  He's had no symptoms, yet every time I change a diaper, she asks ""did he poop?  How did it look?"".  Granted, I tend towards the opposite extreme when it comes to medical issues.  I don't go to a doctor unless I'm really sick, and feel that I can't get better without a prescription.  I try to be less reluctant to go to a doctor with my son, but I still feel that a cold, for example, is not a reason to go to the doctor.   Yet I fear that my wife's worries about his health push me even further into the ""its not something to worry about"" spectrum.  So, my main concern is that my wife's worry about health issues is not something I want my son to pick up.  My wife's attitude towards health issues is a somewhat watered-down version of my mother-in-law's, and my two sister-in-laws, so I feel that this behavior does seem to be learned.  Is it normal for a 2-year-old to ask for his temperature to be taken when he's upset, or complain about phantom pains?    How can I make sure that he doesn't grow up to worry too much (or too little) about his health? "
2255,3 year old tantrums in public,"Yesterday we (wife, 3 year old son, 6 year old daughter, me) were at a mall. After we stepped off the moving pavement my son decided that he wants to go another direction, and pulled his hand out of mine. I told him OK, but we'll go away, and stepped away from him about 5 meters. He stopped and started yelling: father, come here. I said him without loud voice that if he wanted to come with us, then come to me. But he didn't come to me, he sat down to the floor instead.   Me and my wife started a conversation while my son was sitting there. BTW he is very loud. (I had asked other parents about it previously and they said that it is true; I'm not making it up.) Anyway after a minute some woman wen't to him and started asking him about his father. I told her that he was yelling to me. That lady came to me and said that if I were in Canada - I'm Hungarian - some police man would punish me.  A minute after that two other lady joined her giving me advice what to do with my son. They told me the mall isn't the right place to educate my son.  For me it was a clear situation: my son wanted to go away from safety, after that he had the choice to rejoin us, but he choose tantrum instead. He was loud, he looked desperate, but I knew he wanted to be the boss. But in those ladies eyes I was a heartless father.  So my questions: 1. If I am in public do I have to stop my son's tantrum at all cost, even if I lose that ""battle""? 2. I didn't understand that Canada thing. Did she just make that up? "
2256,What games are good to play with teens in the car?,"I will be travelling with two kids aged 15 and 18 in a car this upcoming month, and I would like to play some games in the car with them.    I know the game where you look for different license plates, and the alphabet game where you work your way through the alphabet by looking at road signs and such. I have heard of some other games which include something called ""ghost""?  where each person says one letter to try and complete a word, making sure the final letter doesn't fall on you.  Are there any other stimulating/involve the whole car type of games? "
2257,When to tell a child he didn't really win,"My five year-old son has started this phase of turning everything into a contest.  Partially this a result of our encouragement.  We will sometimes ""race"" him when he is dragging his feet and slowing down the family.  However, I think some of it is fueled by his friends at school, because he's started some unsportsmanlike behavior, like singing ""I beat you, I beat you, na na na na naaa naaa.""  We've been correcting his unsportsmanlike responses, but I'm wondering if we should be looking deeper.  In a lot of the cases, he only wins because one of us has helped him, or because he has two years more experience than his sister, but he doesn't recognize that.  For example, we ""beat"" my wife to church yesterday, but only because she helped all the kids, including him, get ready before she took care of herself.  So my question is, should we burst his bubble about his ""winning,"" or should we let him think he's won and just continue to teach him to be sportsmanlike about it?  We do make a point to praise him for wins due to his legitimate efforts, or even failures if he tried his best.  My question is related to Should you let a toddler win?, but different in that I'm not wondering whether to let him win, but to what degree we should point out when winning had little or nothing to do with his individual effort. "
2258,On what surface should a baby crawl,"What's the best surface for my daughter to learn crawling ? We usually put her on our sofa, but we are afraid it is too small and too soft. Also, the risk of falling is too high, now that she's becoming mobile.  We also tried the floor (wood flooring) but we are afraid it is too slippery and she could bang her head on it.  Would a carpet do the trick ? "
2259,How do I calm a frustrated 6-year-old?,"When our 6-year-old daughter is trying something new and hard (homework, reading a hard word, video games, etc.) she can get into a cycle of frustration and anger that ends with her crying in a ball on the floor.  It starts with her making a mistake, and me correcting it. Normally she's successfully pushed through several hard points already or is tired going in. I've tried variations on ""stop"", ""no"", ""wait"", ""hang on"" and ""just a second"", but they all have the same result: a sharp burst of vocal frustration from her, followed by me realising where this is heading and trying to defuse it.  Along the way she may try and take the work somewhere I can't see, or try and complete it quickly even though it's incorrect. She'll complain about not understanding something, but not allow me to explain anything.  Things I've tried to stop the spiral:   Suggesting taking a break Pointing out that it's easy to rub it out and try again Walking her through the problem from the start Shouting back (?!) Pointing out this always ends with her being upset and we should try to avoid that Using a calming tone of voice Suggesting I do it for her and she copies! Noticing when she's tired and prone to frustration and trying to stop the exercise early (""I can do it!"") (maybe I can try more forcefully to do this? one time it ended with a similar tantrum)   It ends with her in full-blown tears and one of us leaving the room. It can take 30 minutes for her to calm down at which point she can normally do it.  Has anyone got any more tactics I could try? "
2260,Does the baby in the womb get effected by the mental state of the mother?,"Yesterday for some reason I was quite depressed and frightened at night. For the first time I felt the baby kicking all night in my womb (6th month).  Well, that can be a coincidence.     Anyways, does the baby in the womb get effected by the mental state of the mother? In what way if yes? "
2261,How can I ask my parents to help us by watching the grandkids on occasion?,"Background  I am a happily married mother of two, ages 3 and 4 respectively. My parents are in good health, mom is 62 and dad just turned 70. They have a good marriage and my mother lives in a house, which is one hour away from where I live, for most of the year. My father stays there, too (he occasionally travels there), esepcially for the whole summer.  I don't expect anyone to help raise my children or to be a secondary caregiver. My husband and I provide and pay for our babysitting. I have never asked my parents for money.  Even when there's been an emergency, they have not helped. For example, last summer, I was admitted via emergency in the hospital for three days and they never showed up to visit, asked who was taking me home or if my husband needed help. They never showed up or mailed a card when my 3-year-old broke his collar bone. Because of this, I don't even feel like I could ask either of them to watch the kids so I can go get a mammogram, PET scan or a haircut.  At this point, I feel that my parents are a source of irritation, not comfort. They feel entitled to our help when they think they need it and they don't reciprocate. I usually don't have the time to talk to them on the phone, but they don't understand that. Yet they often ask why it might take me a whole day to call back. They refuse to email, to text or to read texts. They've also asked me to bring the kids to visit more this summer, though I went at least once a week last summer. It's just too much this year with current circumstances but they don't want to be part of any solutions, unless the solutions exclude them making an effort. I wished I had any help from them or felt as though I could depend on them for help.  What I tried so far  I've asked them in the past ""why"" and I get the too tired or too busy excuse. But they are not too tired to travel 2 hours to go to a scrapbooking convention or visit a friend at the same times.   When I ask them what I could do to make things easier for them to be with us, they reply that they think everyone is doing their best and one day things will be easier for me.   In contrast, my paternal grandmother, who was widowed and worked full time, was there for my parents, even taking us for whole weekends several times a year before she retired at age 75. Besides, my parents have raised us to be religious, teaching us that it is ungodly to ignore family needs.  I've tried to explain to them how such would benefit them. I've tried reasoning that their help could free up time for me to help them, call them back sooner, or socialize with them more. I've even outright asked for it. Nothing has seemed to work.  The straw that broke the camel's back  My parents have been back for over a month and we've seen my mom once during this whole time. I'm overworked due to several events, like our children having been sick for two weeks etc. This month, no one offered to help or agreed to help when I asked. I cancelled us going to a family cookout in 2 days, because I'm simply overwhelmed and it sounds like more work to go at this point. I'm not doing it to punish anyone. It doesn't sound relaxing or fun to me and I told them so without anger. So, my parents are now boo-hooing. Their response shows they obviously value our involvement.  Question  Is there another way to get what I need from them, aside from what I've tried? I wonder if, by responding with ""no"" more frequently when they ask for non-essential involvement, they would start missing us and be more likely to drive up here and/or help when asked so we can stay involved. Or should I come out and boldly negotiate with them that unless we have more of their presence at our house, we won't be present at theirs? Or is there another way to nicely ask?  Goal  The less I'm busy and the more I'm at home, the easier things feel on my end and this is a solution to me feeling less overwhelmed that doesn't involve my parents directly providing help. I personally don't really want to do any of these options or be that person, but nothing else has worked for me so far. I have a hard time not believing that there is another, nicer way to solve the problem.  I would love my parents to be present more frequently and to reciprocate help, when they are back in the state. We offer to help them and agree when asked because we want to. "
2262,15 mo old son becomes very fussy every evening when I come home from work,"​​​I'm a working mom of 15 month old baby. We are lucky to have our grandmas to help us babysit our child while me and my husband are at work.  Recently we had a grandma's swap, one grandmother left for 2 months, and we have another grandmother in our house instead. My son missed his first grandma a lot, she was with him since his birth, and that's the first time when she is not around him for such a long time. He didn't even want to accept his second grandma, was pushing her away and running around the house trying to find his favorite one.  Since that time he got extremely attached to me, would want just me to hold him, didn't want me to be too far from him. he started pushing away his dad if dad was trying to help me carry our son. I understand that it's a shock for a baby to loose a person he got used to, so I was trying to comfort him as much as I can, spend more time with him, hold him and hug. We moved his crib in our room, because there were times he would scream at night.  Everything seemed to get better in 2 weeks: when I'm not around he is quiet with his second grandma, he likes to play with her, eats well, everything good, though he still is very alarmed next to her and won't fall asleep if she is near.  But what started is: he will be pretty quiet the whole day with grandma, but when I come home he will gladly meet me and then he will start whining and fussing, will get very annoyed, won't let me eat or even wash my hands. He would cry while I'm holding him, and would cry even more if I put him down. Nothing works: distractions, another people entertaining him, just putting him on the floor and leaving him. He can cry for more than 30 min nonstop and then he can't stop at all.  I'm lost in guesses what it could be, is it me spoiling him with attention when he cries? Is it just an evening meltdown and if so why it didn't happen before? What do I do to stop it and help him? "
2263,What are reasonable expectations and reasonable ways to be supportive for an young adult with a sleep disorder?,"My 22 year old child has recently been diagnosed with a sleep disorder, namely, idiopathic hypersomnia.  What this means is that he sleeps for long periods of time (in my child's case, sometimes in excess of 16 hours at a time), often multiple times per day, and the sleep is largely not restorative or restful.  My child has had these symptoms grow in intensity over a year or two without remitting.  Now, I am in no position to challenge the diagnosis as I am not a doctor, but it seems to me that my child's problem is that he doesn't have any motivation to or doesn't want to be awake.  I've tried talking to him about this and he claims that his sleep issues are affecting his capacity to think (he was a straight A student up until his junior year of college) and that the sleep inertia he experiences stops him from wanting to do anything.  He has no real sleep schedule--it's a crap shoot whether he'll be up at a given time.  He has fallen asleep doing dangerous tasks like driving.  Due to his sleep issues, he has dropped out of college.  The fact that the skills he has that are employable require degrees and he has no such degree implies he has no real future for employment.  He currently lives at home with me and he does not have any source of income.  He does do small tasks around the house, such as fixing things that are broken and cooking and whatnot when he is awake.  I guess I'm just in denial about his sleep disorder.  My insurance is pretty poor for more exotic illnesses and whatnot so some of the treatments that have been prescribed for my son are not covered due to being classified as experimental or not indicated by the FDA for his specific illness.  Some of the prescriptions are very pricey and I can't afford to pay for them.  The few that he has been able to try have been absolutely ineffective for my son.  Outside of the ineffective or expensive medications, there's practically no treatments for people with my son's condition.  The condition itself is also not considered a disability by many, so he's unlikely to get protection from the ADA or to get concessions from any potential employers.  Before the sleep issues, he was set on graduating on time and with good grades, getting out of the house, and being able to support himself financially.  Now, he seems to be stuck here with no way out.  And not to sound like a bad parent, but I want him out of the house; I just don't want to kick him out in this condition.  However, the condition (according to his doctor), in most cases, does not go away or lessen in intensity at all.  It seems like he'll be here forever.  How can I accept that my son really has this illness and isn't feigning it to get a free ride?  How can I be reasonably supportive of my child while not allowing him to get too comfortable?  What things are reasonable for me to expect him to do around the house or towards getting a degree or a job for himself?  I'm not the best writer in the world, so if you would like more information or clarification, let me know and I'll gladly do so. "
2264,Why does my mother expect me to behave like others and herself?,"I am 30 years old married.   My mother (50 years old) keeps on telling me that *""Your cousin didn’t have problems with that then why are you having problems with the same thing/situation!""* *""I (Referring to herself) didn't have any problems with that, then why do you have the problems with the same thing/situation!""*  When your cousins don't have a problem going to their house to meet their parents, why do you have a problem to coming to your house to meet your parents!  No, she is not illiterate or step mother. She has two graduate degrees and one master's degree. She is a teacher too.  Example cases:     During my honeymoon my parents kept on ringing me many times per day to ask whether I had eaten lunch, what I was doing, why didn't or did I go there etc. When I returned back I told her that she didn't need to keep on constantly ringing me since I was on my honeymoon and wanted some peace alone. She replied, ""I had called your cousin too many times when she was on her honeymoon, she didn't any problems, then why are you having problems? Now, I have told her that I'll be having a Ceserian delivery and therefore won't be comfortable much and in a presentable situation at that moment so I won't like other relatives to come to the hospital the very same day for seeing me. I requested her to tell them to come some other day. To which she again replied that ""I and your cousin didn't have any problems with relatives visiting in the hospital then why are you having problem?""   Does she actually need to be told that I am NOT a clone of anyone in this world? Is her behavior normal? HUH! And after all this she keeps on wondering why I don't love her and welcome her in my house! "
2265,4 years and 9 month old is shy when away from parents or grandparents,"My son is quite sociable and plays with other kids, when either of us (father or mother) or either his grand-dad or grand-mom is near him or in the vicinity of the play area.  But when we are not around (parents\grandparents), then he becomes an introvert (at school, at daycare). He does not talk to other kids or play with them.  Teachers and other kids have told us that he is quite shy and does not talk with anybody at school or the daycare.  I am wondering why he displays this behavior? Is there anything I can do to help him overcome this behavior? "
2266,Should you secretly drill your children?,"A lot of situations we teach our children about come up all the time.  They get plenty of practice looking both ways before crossing the street, for example.  However, there are some situations that you hope never come up:  finding an unattended gun or medication, being solicited for personal information online, etc.  We roleplay these situations, but not very frequently.  It occurs to me that a secret drill might be the only way to really make sure they've internalized your teaching.  Sort of like a fire drill except they don't know it's a drill.  Should you secretly drill your children?  Why or why not?  If so, what's the best way to go about it?  How should you react if they ""fail""?  Is there a better way to test them without testing them? "
2267,Punishment for stealing?,"I'm in a situation where I'm really not sure what the best course of action is. Today I promised my younger sister that I would give her $100 if she worked up to running 3 miles. As proud as I was that she ran the distance, I was a bit disheartened that she was able to run it on the day I made the deal with her. I was expecting a few weeks of training with the hope of her building momentum towards exercising regularly. Reluctantly, I paid up.  Problem is, just a few moments ago, she was caught stealing makeup from a store. Not a huge deal it seemed at first, but she had about [tex]1000 worth of it over time.  Our father is deceased and our mother is too lenient, so the responsibility of disciplining this sort of thing often falls on me. So, I took back the $100.  My sister is, of course, in tears about the whole ordeal and accusing me of breaking my promises/going back on my word, etc. Our mother, unfortunately, decided to defend her position and argued that I was now untrustworthy and liar for taking back the money.  I'm trying to teach my sister the consequences of stealing by disciplining her for it. I don't think it's questionable whether this is necessary, but my concern is that there's some truth to their argument and that I'm breaking her trust in me.  My personal position is that this is, if anything, too lenient. Stealing, especially the amount she's stolen, is a very serious problem and by being passive, I believe I would be making it too easy for her to brush this off.  Is taking the money back a fair punishment? Does it damage my relationship with her? "
2268,How does a 3-year-old learn to wear glasses?,"My 3½ year old son has been diagnosed with a mild eye defect, so he is getting corrective glasses (with non-shattering plastic lenses, obviously). As I've never worn glasses myself, nor my wife at that age, we're not sure what challenges this creates.  Of course he should be wearing the glasses whenever he's awake, but given that he can see very well without them, how can we motivate him to wear his glasses?  What tricks are commonly used by parents? What pitfalls should we be aware of? "
2269,Why does my baby moan every 3-5min during sleeping?,"My baby girl is 2 weeks old. She starts making squeaks, moans, yawns during sleeping every 3-5min. She did that as well before, but not as often as these two days. She also gets more difficult to settle and fall asleep these two days. Asks for breast right after feeding.  I realize this might be a growth spurt, but how about the noises she makes every 3-5min? Is that normal as well or does it suggest that she has sleeping problems? "
2270,How/Should I deal with the playschool teacher who makes the toddler colour by holding her hand?," Why should I be hell bent on educating my toddler when she's going to learn the stuff anyways when she grows up?   4 year old refuses to color     Considering that the answers linked above say that we should not force the child to learn something, I am concerned about my 2 years 3 months old toddler.  Her playschool teacher had given her a colouring homework which my child coloured incompletely. The child coloured only the eyes of the ant, not her body.  I told the teacher today that the child doesn't like colouring big areas to this that teacher replied the child doesn't have any problems in colouring big areas in the  playschool since I hold her hand and make her colour that area and you should also do the same.  From: [website]  I think that a toddler is way too young for mandatory homework, so the first thing is not to worry about getting it done or doing it ""right"". It turns something that should be a pleasure into a chore, and will guarantee that she won't want anything to do with art in later years.   I also told the teacher that I can draw the object myself at home and have her colour it. She didn't want that. She said that the rule is to color what has been told, though she agreed that she will draw smaller objects for homework in future.  Changing playschool is not an option for monetary reasons as well as I do not expect any different treatment in other schools in India. Education system here is not very great.  Do I need to deal with that teacher about her holding the hand of the child and making her colour? If yes, how? If no, why?   Or am I making a mountain out of a mole hill? P.S. This is the same child who coloured the goat, blue. "
2271,Why aren't pacifiers used to stop infants from crying in airplanes?,"WebMD says that     Parents have relied on pacifiers for ages to calm crying infants.   However, pretty much every time I fly in an airplane, there is one child screaming (and screaming) a few seats away. I've never heard children starting to scream and stopping (or toning it down) after a minute or two, as if the guardian(s) used a pacifier. Do pacifiers not work on planes? Do the parents just not care (hard to believe)? Do they not know about pacifiers? "
2272,What qualities should be looked in a bedding for an infant to prevent the crib deaths?,What qualities should be looked in a bedding for an infant to prevent the crib deaths?  Does sealing the bedding with a strong polythene sheet provide any benefits or risks? 
2273,"My wife wants a 4th baby, but I don't","My wife wants a 4th baby, but I don't.  We have been talking about it for the last few days (talking strongly).   I have raised points such as:   We will get less time to spend with our current kids. The age gap between the first and the last will be too wide. It will cost more money. She will be out of work longer. We will need a bigger house. And we don't even have our own house yet (we are still renting). We will have to start again. Sleepless nights, nappies, feeding, new cot, car seat, etc etc.   She says:   She feels like she is missing something. She has always wanted a large family. Things will be the same regardless of having 3, or 4 kids. She agrees that money will be tighter, but wants to push through it.   Our current kids are 9 months, 2 years, and 4 years. We are young married couple (25), and I have a fairly decent job.  What would be the pros and cons of having another child?   How can we rationally talk to the other about having/or not having another child?  And what should we do if we cannot agree? "
2274,"Is it normal for a 2-year-old son to like hitting, biting and fighting?","My son is two years old now. Somehow he likes fighting. His mornings start with hitting and biting. I know for him it's a game and he enjoys it. Also, sometimes he becomes angry and throws whatever is in his hand.  As of now I don't have a problem, but is this normal behavior for kids? Should I try to stop responding to him when he fights? "
2275,Thinking about a divorce,"I'm a girl, younger than 16 years of age, and live in a country where getting divorced is considered VERY BAD in the society for both the parents and the children. My father can't cope up with my mother and we hear an argument daily where he almost every time says to give a divorce to my mother. My mum is very egoistic,and doesn't understand that we could perfectly live happily and there is nothing wrong with dad (she thinks he has an affair although he doesn't and has explained to her like a gazillion times...). If they get divorced it would have a greater effect on me and my brother's life than theirs as they are both about the age of 40.  WHAT DO I DO???!!! I'm so confused and tensed and scared.... Help me, PLEASE! "
2276,My child wants GTA V for his birthday,"My 10 year old son wants to play Grand Theft Auto V, which is PEGI 18.   My son has ADHD and I'm really worried that he will start acting like his favourite characters in the games and I don't want him to play it.  Should I let him play it or not? It's his birthday really soon, so should I give him the game?  "
2277,At what age can a child be left alone in a parked car?,"I have heard that in some areas it is illegal to leave a child unattended in a car, even for an instant, and possibly even if you are within direct sight of the care.  It seems that the laws for this vary from area to area.  Barring specific laws, how old should a child be before they are left alone in a car?  Under what circumstances is this acceptable (within sight, out of sight but reachable by cell phone, under a certain duration, etc.)?  At what point does an older sibling being present count as not leaving a younger child alone? "
2278,I don't know if I love my parents,"I'm 17 now, I was always close with my mother, there was an immediate bond and we got along great, similar personalities, sense of humour, etc. My dad on the other hand was an alcoholic, he will always be even though he's not a heavy drinker anymore. When I was little I didn't know what this was so I loved him, then my mother would start telling me and my older brother horrible things about my father. They don't love each other you see. She stayed with him so we would have a financially secure childhood.    But she despises him, they can't be in the same room together without fighting, yes me and my brother have had enough money for some of life's little luxuries, but at what cost? My home is broken, my mother can tell you countless horrible things about anyone in our family, except me and my brother of course.     I remember, when I was little how she would make me laugh, I can still hear my laugh as a little boy, it's contagious, but now, now it's different. She still makes me laugh but I don't feel quite so, happy.  This may be due to the stress due to exams or my not knowing what I want to do in the future but I also feel a lack of an emotional connection with her, I feel less remorse after an argument, I'm less interested in her stories, i want to say I love her dearly, but I'm not entirely certain what the love a child has for a parent feels like. And you can't exactly google that. I read online that it may be the developmental schism, but I don't know if that happens to someone my age.  As I've gotten older I've seen more of my mothers flaws, things that as a child you would call mummy's magic powers or something, you'd put it down to how mothers are. But I wonder if it's just her? There are different rules to her that the rest of us, she can say how something we do is perceived negatively but we can not by any means do the same. She can use attitude with us first but the second we do it back we did it first and it's a nightmare. Then there's after an argument where I've supposedly done something wrong she gives me something, sort of passive aggressively, like she'll argue with me and then come into my room with something small like a toothbrush(new) and say 'I got this for you today because I saw your old one was just about done', and I can hear the venom in her voice and its shocking, when I do something 'wrong' she never wants to talk to me about it first, she just gets angry and it feels like she doesn't listen.  I can't wait to move out, rule free is one reason, another is to want to see a therapist, I want to know what's up with my mind cause I dunno if it's normal, and I don't feel comfortable asking.  I don't feel comfortable telling my mother a lot.  She only discovered about my first 'girlfriend'(together for 5 months, not official, no sexual relations) when I was to emotionally destroy get to hide it, not for lack of trying though and the next week when I could hide it I did, I was only gonna tell her about them if we became official. And even then after a 'safe zone' of time cause a lot of relationships my mates have at my age end after 2 weeks.  I don't always trust her. I don't know if I love her, cause I'm not sure what that feels like.  Additionally, if it helps I have also compiled a list of things as a parent I would do like her and another list of what I would do differently. "
2279,TV shows for toddlers that don't teach bad gender and race dynamics,"My daughter is almost 1 and for various reasons outside the scope of this question, I like putting on TV shows that she'll watch on and off while she's playing. My current options are things available on Netflix and Youtube but I'm open to other subscription services as long as they're ad-free and reasonably priced.  Anyway, everything I've found so far is pretty disappointing from a gender and race standpoint, even PBS shows which I thought would be above average and designed with these sorts of issues in mind. Here are some examples from things I've found:   Super Why: Despite there being 4 super readers, the white male is clearly the hero and the girls are more like sidekicks. There's only one person of color and she's even less of a main hero. Barney: Not too bad on gender, aside from the central character and source of knowledge being male(ish). There's not really much of a power dynamic at all between the kids. Having the girl dinosaur be the baby who's always having to learn from others is a bit imbalanced, and there are certain activities like ""playing house"" that seem to be presented as ""girly"" (initiated by girls), but it's all pretty mild. Some of the ""diversity"" and ""sharing culture"" come across more as racial caricatures than egalitarian. Sesame Street: Old classic episodes definitely reinforce gender role stereotypes. And there's a big gender imbalance in the characters (almost all male). I haven't really found enough episodes online yet to get a general feel though.   Are there any good shows for kids my daughter's age that normalize girls being center-stage and assertive rather than deferring to the boys (and especially white ones) taking up all the space? I'm sure she'll get shown the latter plenty in real life if/when she goes to day care or preschool and later in school, but when that happens I hope it will come across as abnormal and objectionable rather than just a reinforcement of what she's seen on TV up to then.  I've already looked at other questions about TV such as:  What TV shows are wholesome for primary-schoolers?  But didn't find anything specifically about gender and race issues in children's TV. "
2280,Should an infant be washed with turmeric powder?,My in laws have a custom of washing the infant with Turmeric powder rather than any soap.   Should an infant be washed with turmeric powder? Any side effects?  How long duration can this be prolonged? 
2281,Does a baby cry inside the womb?,"Considering Music for gestation - what should baby be hearing while in the womb? that babies can hear sounds inside the womb, I also expect myself to hear the baby crying or making sounds inside the womb. I cannot hear anything from the baby's side.  Does a baby cry inside the womb? Or the crying process starts once he comes out? What's the logic behind this? "
2282,What qualities should be looked in cloth diapers?,What kind of cloth should be preferred? What should be the thickness of the cloth? What should be the shape and size of the cloth?  Do we have to use a polythene cover on the outer side of the diaper to prevent leakage? 
2283,What should be the ideal sleeping posture in the third trimester of pregnancy?,"I have observed that in the seventh month when I lay down on the floor and turn right side (for a while), the baby starts kicking.  Then when I turn on my back, the kickings decrease noticeably. Have observed this behavior many times.  Does this indicate that baby feels discomfort in my particular sleeping position? What should be the ideal sleeping posture in the third trimester of pregnancy? I don't have a big belly yet  nor do I sleep on my stomach. "
2284,Is it okay to let a baby cry at bedtime?,"My 4-month-old has a set bedtime routine and will generally go happily to sleep - but occasionally (for no particular reason) he'll work himself up into a fit and cry for long periods of time, refusing to go to sleep. He can keep it up for quite a while.   My husband believes that we should just let him cry it out. I feel that you can't let such a small baby cry indefinitely without at least coming into the room periodically, although when he asks for a reason I find it hard to put my finger on why. I generally go into the room every few minutes, stand there for half a minute, and then leave, without talking or touching him - just as a sort of ""I'm here"" statement. Of course, when I do this he cries harder. (I think it makes him calm down faster in the long run, but my husband doesn't agree and I can't prove it :) )   Is it okay to just let a 4-month-old (or even an older baby) cry? Why or why not? Is it something terrible, like I seem to think, or does it make no lasting difference to the baby (besides teaching him to sleep :) ), like my husband claims? "
2285,ADHD-friendly occupations,"I recently read A Natural Fix for A.D.H.D., which discussed the idea that certain occupations are much better suited to a person with ADHD than others.  This idea is interesting to me, because my son has not been officially diagnosed, but has all the symptoms of ADHD.  We would like to tailor his education to steer him toward occupations that will take advantage of his strengths, but there is very little information available.  Most ADHD literature presupposes a traditional classroom setting and curriculum.  The main reason we homeschool him now is because his ADHD made traditional classrooms all but impossible.  So my question is exactly what kind of occupations are better suited for people with ADHD, and why?  What would a curriculum look like that was designed specifically to prepare a child for those occupations? "
2286,How and when do I teach my son to use chopsticks?,"Even though I live in the U.S., I find using a fork inefficient and clumsy.  I'd like to teach my son how to use chopsticks as an alternative.  What is the best way to do this without interfering with his learning how to use a fork?  Being proficient with a fork is still the higher priority, as chopsticks aren't very common around here (although we keep some at home).  He's 2 and a half now.  When should I start?  How do families from cultures where chopsticks are the norm teach their children to use them?  I've seen a variety of ""children's chopsticks"", where the two sticks are connected, but are they effective at teaching? "
2287,Reasons for parents to pierce their son's left ear,"There is a family that I have known for over 5 years.  We have very different views on parenting, discipline, child rearing, etc.  But one practice of this family (that I thought to be interesting) is that, about 1 month after each of their sons were born, they would pierce their son's left ear.    Normally, I would write this off as something unique to these particular parents, except there is no central motivating reason for the parents (i.e. neither of the parents have any piercings).  Also, I recently encountered another family who seems to have the same practice of piercing their sons' left ears when they are about a month old.    Not having seen this before and knowing that this is not a common practice among parents, I just want to learn more. Are there reasons (other than preference) for parents to do this?  Or is this just a new fad that is on the rise?   "
2288,Should a parent delete a teen's social media account if it was handled badly?,"My 15 year old daughter has created accounts with Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Tumblr and Wattpad, all without my knowledge, six months ago or more. After discovering her using a laptop in bed at 4am, and probing into the browser history, I found the following worrying issues (below) out last week. I am currently thinking that it is appropriate to delete the accounts, and that is my question to this community - is it the right action?   Foul Language: The comments/posts in all those social media accounts included strong profanity that disgusts me; she does not talk like that at home. It is way harsher than necessary. I appreciate we all swore as teens, to our friends, and kept a clean mouth at home, but this is too much. It is my job as a parent to tell her off about this. Failure to Protect Identity: My daughter has used her real name in one account, a nickname in another, and revealed her age in some places. In her profile she links each account to her Facebook and/or Twitter account, so anyone can hop from one to the other and make the connection between these disparate bits of info.  When talking about her school in comments, she doesn't give the name, but gives away far too much other information (school religion, current musical performance, name of courses she takes). She has failed to take the standard precautions that I know the school have warned her about. Already, one group of her 'real life' friends have discovered something she was trying to keep very secret, because of this online carelessness. Talking to Strangers: These accounts have 'followers' or 'friends' who she does not know in real life. Most of the interactions were inane (I've now been through all the inboxes) but some contained advice about serious issues to do with growing up, from people who were adults she didnt know. Sleep: She has been using these accounts between 1am and 6am when she is supposed to be asleep. No wonder she struggles to get out of bed, and struggles to concentrate at school. This has been going on for several months if not a year.   So...  We warned her about most of this when first given a phone and a laptop. She knew we wanted to look through the records at any time (but we never felt the need, until this 4am revelation). The school teaches kids how to avoid cyber-stalking etc. She has not acted responsibly at all.  I've explained some of this already (calmly) but there is more to go, and I need to decide on a suitable punishment, so she learns from this. A stern talk cannot be followed by handing the laptop straight back to her. I've already confiscated it until further notice.  I think that these accounts should be deleted. Not to meanly ""teach her a lesson"", but because their content endangers her, or creates a large risk. She could start again next year - when we think she has matured - and build a more cautious online presence, keeping some bits anonymous if desired, doing it all safely.  However, I can imagine how this would have felt to me at 15. It would have been a massive loss: people I'd struggle to locate again, words I'd written which I thought were clever or profound, links to thinks I'd want to keep. Maybe it is not the right thing to do.  EDITS TO ANSWER POINTS RAISED:     I did not talk to her about permission to create accounts, but I did talk about safety online and social media pitfalls.   Keeping her activities in secret (to me) suggests she knew we would not approve.   Yes, she can create a new account... but by then I will have hammered home the right way to do it. (Which she may ignore!)   Yes, she lied. This is a biggie.   I have now set the router to disallow internet access when people should be sleeping.   Does she need more privacy? She has proved she wasn't ready for it.    I am not merely worried about online predators. It is far more likely she will blow all her secrets to school enemies, and be miserable. I doubt she can see far enough ahead to think about potential employers looking at her nonsense.   She just didn't THINK enough. And whilst all teens do that (and the neuroscience backs it up) it still isn't acceptable for parents to say ""never mind darling, you havent developed your frontal cortex properly yet"".   "
2289,Should I allow my preschooler to play with other parents at the playground?,"My 4 year old daughter played with another parent and his son (around 3) at the playground. They started jumping on the dad's thighs as he was sitting on the ground, so the play was physical for a short time. I paid close attention when to cut the game short, but it was all innocent. I was also surprised, as I have not seen such openness from my daughter towards an unknown adult previously. At home we discussed with mom that next time I should tell my daughter to play with kids her age. This course seems to be the best way of handling such situations. Is it?  Somewhat related question: Is it allowed to play with unfamiliar child? "
2290,Why do kids pick up on violence in cartoons/movies?,"Why is it that children seem to pick up and mimic even the tiniest examples violence on TV?   It's like a golden beacon of what not to do and they seem to be just magnetized towards it.  Let me try to give an example.   I know a younger child in the 4-6 age range. They watched Wreck it Ralph and immediately started bopping everything and everyone he can with anything he can and repeating ""I'm wrecking you."" Why is this the take away from the movie? There are plenty of other activities going on but the kid chooses the hitting other people activity.  A friend of the family (this was a couple of years ago) had issues with older boys maybe 8 and 11 ish in age. The dad likes to watch pro wrestling (like WWE) and at EVERY opportunity those boys would be body slamming each other and any other kid they could. And I mean these were some heavier boys who were slamming all sized of kids by leaping off the couch at full speed. No amount of explaining that wrestling on TV is an act, that these are trained professionals or do it again and you're grounded would make them stop. They finally had to stop watching wrestling all together, it was really a big issue; which is odd to me because I thought at that age they could reasoned with.  I can't even tell you how many times I've been ""Hi ya""ed or karate chopped by kids mimicking ninja turtles / super heroes, not to mention how many times I've been pretend-shot by kids pretending to have a gun.  Why is violent play so attractive to young children? I know the wrestling example is kind of a ""well dua they see it on TV"" moment but why couldn't a 10 year old grasp the concept of falling on and hurting someone smaller? And what about the 4 year old that suddenly starts hitting everything with a pretend mallet?   Before being around kids, most of this TV/media didn't even strike me as violent and now I see kids pick up on these things in shows that I would have never thought about censoring before. "
2291,Challenges of being a step-father,"Background:  Almost 6 months ago I met a great woman and she has a son, who just recently turned 7. His biological father is out of the picture, and essentially has been for his whole life.  I am 24 and I have no experience with children, other than having been one once.  It is also worth noting that our relationship right now is long-distance and I visit them every third weekend.  Question: I seem to have a number of challenges arising from my lack of ""knowing"" him, as well as what I'm guessing comes from his expectations on how he'd like to interact with me.  1) Rough Play - I'm not a very strong or physical person, but he seems to like to play-wrestle and I am considerably larger than him. It makes me nervous that I will accidentally hurt him, especially since the playing seems to escalate until basically I tell him to stop. At this point he doesn't stop, and then he gets in trouble for what we were just doing 5 minutes ago. Should I even play this way with him or how do I de-escalate the playing?  2) Attention, possibly jealousy? - Last time I visited I spent nearly the entire weekend playing with him (legos, dinosaurs, etc). Then I try spending one hour with his mom and he can't leave us alone. He doesn't like it when we spend time together without him. One example (which was amusing at the time), is when I'm playing with him, his mother may call for me - to do something or another. He tells me to wait there and goes and does what his mom wanted me to do. I think he believes I'll do whatever she wanted and then I won't come back. Admittedly, it may take me an extra minute so I can give her a smooch, but not more than a minute. At this point it isn't really a problem, but i get the feeling he's developing an expectation that I should spend all my time with him. I've watched some of his movies with him, and occasionally it shows the ""perfect dad"" (to a kid) and he does everything the kid wants. I'm worried his expectations may come from this.  I'm also wondering if there are other things I'm not even aware of that I should be looking out for, since I am becoming a part of his life and I have no prior experience with children.  In particular, things to be aware of since I am coming into his life now (as opposed to when he was born). Any advice is appreciated. "
2292,How do you childproof electrical cords?,"I let my 6-month-old roll around on the living room floor.  She almost always heads for a cord of some kind (laptop cord, xbox controller cord, etc.)  I hide the power strip, so she doesn't have access to the outlets, but what can I do about the cords?  She doesn't have teeth yet, so I have a little time to figure this one out before it gets really dangerous.  Also, how bad of an idea would it be to get her a toy of some sort that looks like wires? I can't tell if that sort of toy would be a good distraction from the real wires, or an encouragement to play with wires in general.  "
2293,Should imaginary friends be accepted or discouraged?,"As a professional working with families, I am often asked about imaginary friends. I never experienced this behavior with my own son so I have little personal information to share.   One child required that a place be made for the ""friend"" at mealtimes complete with chair and food. She scolded people for sitting in her friend's chair or sitting in her place in the car. This lasted for several years. She is now a middle age lady who can tell you the names and description of her friends.   This lady has struggled with relationships and inappropriate behavior over the years. I am wondering if there is any relationship between her imaginative friends and her lifelong behavior.   Should parents ""adopt"" their children's imaginary friends or discourage their presence? If they should be discouraged, what strategies are helpful? "
2294,Dentist for a baby?,"   Possible Duplicate:   At what age should I enroll my child in dental and vision plans?       I'm sure this in a question only relevant to the US since we have to think about stuff like this, but what would be a reasonable age to sign up for dental insurance for my boy? Is this something that you would want before the teeth even erupt? Or are there only ever issues after you've moved to solids?  I guess a more general question would be: When do children start having issues with their teeth where they would need a dentist? "
2295,Too many languages?,"I am actually a language researcher, but when it comes to my own situation I have a hard time being objective and make some choices for my own family.  My husband and I are expecting our first child, and I am really confused as to which languages we should speak and when.  I was raised in Denmark, but have Iraqi-Kurdish roots, and my husband was also born and raised here but has Turkish roots. Thus, my native language, and the language I learned first, was Kurdish, and I do speak it with my parents and the rest of my family. However, I am more proficient in Danish.  I know a little bit of Turkish, but only speak Danish with my husband.  So my question is, would my child be confused if I spoke Kurdish with it and Danish to my husband, and my husband spoke Turkish to the child? Also, if I know myself well, I would probably speak Danish to the child outside our home, since Kurdish is not valued in the Danish society - I know that´s a bad excuse. What are your suggestions? "
2296,Is my son's school ignoring his intelligence?,"I'm not sure if this is the best place to ask and I suppose this is going to be an outlet for my frustration, but I could also do with some advice from people that may have been in the same situation  My son is 4 years old and has always been a quick learner - he was walking and saying words a few months old and now at 4 years old he's a lot further ahead than some other children of his age. He is not a genius, but he's certainly  very gifted when it comes to learning through observation and retaining knowledge.  He's just started primary school after attending nursery at that very school for a year. At the end of the nursery year the workers praised his speech, knowledge, behaviour and reliability and said that he was hitting targets that they would expect at the end of his 1st year.  Now that he's moved into 1st year, his new teacher has started giving him books with no words (where he must describe what's happening in the pictures) and is saying that he must learn phonetics by the end of the school year (we are only a few weeks in at the moment). They are also teaching them how to write letters and numbers and how to count...  This would be great were it not for this tiny detail.  My son can read, write and count already and has been doing so for over a year and a half.  Now let me just clarify:  He is not completely fluent with more difficult words and has to take a moment to absorb them (e.g. Roald Dahl books he can struggle with but kids books he hasn't much of a problem with)  His writing is not perfect, he does need to work on it. The letters are all well formed and correctly oriented but they don't always sit on the line and he occasionally starts letters from the bottom rather than the top.  However, he is definitely much further ahead than some of the other children and often complains that he's bored at school or that school is ""too long"". We all know that days drag when you are bored and fly when you are occupied, so I can only conclude that he is not being challenged.  They want him to learn around 30 phonetic sounds and also learn some other ""tricky"" words such as ""to"", ""the"" by the end of the school year. He can read these words with no problem and he can also spell them (and much more difficult ones) using letters - not sounds.  We've been in numerous times to argue the point that he needs more challenging  work, to which we are always given the same answer ""he is being challenged"".  I don't agree - he tells me they are learning to write numbers at the moment. He's been doing that for more than a year (and they are all formed correctly with the correct orientation)  The teacher also let slip at parents evening that they ask my son to help the other children when he's finished his work...  Last time I checked he wasn't getting paid a part time teaching assistants wage, I'd rather they gave him additional work...  (interestingly the teacher denied making that statement the next time we met - categorically denied it yet both myself and my wife were present)  My wife made a point that I disagreed with. She was of the opinion that it's the schools duty to push and challenge my child. I'm of the opinion that it's quite the opposite: they don't really care about individuals - as long as they can show that X number of children achieved a certain standard their job is done, if that means leaving the bright ones to their own thing whilst the others catch up, then so be it.   i.e. It's completely up to the teacher to have the passion and drive to deliver what my child requires at school above and beyond what the government require.  Are the school taking me for a ride? Does the teacher really just not care?  I'd love to know if anyone else is experiencing the same problem and how they are dealing with/have dealt with it in the past. "
2297,Can I use an hourglass to make my kid eat faster?,"TL;DR version: My daughter eats quite slowly. Can I use an hourglass to teach her to eat faster? When this time is out, I take her plate away even if it's not finished.    Longer version: My daughter is 4 years old and eats quite slowly. Nothing serious, she's just not very fast (unless it's lasagna or spaghetti). She eats lunch at school every day.  This night she woke up crying, and we (her parents) asked her a few questions to understand what was wrong. She told us it was the school. According to her answers, everything at school seemed fine (teacher is great, she has friends, etc.) except one of the ladies that supervises the lunch time (the other one is fine).  More precisely, she told us that ""she turns the hourglass"" (the other lady does not) and it makes her anxious. It turns out that the kids have a limited time to eat and their plate is taken away when the time is out.  One day, my daughter had to go to the bathroom during lunch time, the hourglass still running. She could not finish her meal.  My wife and I are quite upset about this. First of all, we pay for the meals and we find it unacceptable that the kids don't have time to finish it and it is thrown away. But, more importantly, we feel that this way of doing things is very wrong without knowing exactly why and we'd like to have your insights on this. If this really was not a problem, why would she tell us, let alone waking up crying at night for this?  Thank you.    Additional information:   My daughter enjoys school very much, her teacher is great and she has a lot of friends. She wants to go every morning and she would like to stay more when we get her back at the end of the day. Apart from not eating very fast, she has no problem eating. She likes almost everything, she eats vegetables and meat easily, etc. She almost always finishes her plate. She rarely wakes up during the night, we could say she a heavy sleeper. She's used to eat with friends. Between the age of 6 months to 2.5 years she was at a caregiver, then at school since she's 2.5 (she's now 4 years and 3 months old)     EDIT (after I spoke with the teacher)  This morning I spoke with my daughter's teacher and she explained to me how the hourglass is used.  In the room where the kids eat, there's a sonometer. When the kids are too noisy, it beeps and the supervisor turns the hourglass. During 3 minutes, everyone must be completely silent.  This technique has been put in place after a training that the teachers had and they think it is effective. They tried the same with a one minute period of silence and it didn't work (the noise came back immediately once the minute was up). "
2298,What are ways that I can donate my extra breastmilk?,I am an overproducer which is a blessing and a curse. Has anyone had any experience donating breastmilk? What are the different types of milk donation programs and organizations?  
2299,My kid cries when nanny arrives. Is this a red flag?,"Our nanny has been with us for over a year and she had been getting along with our almost 2-year-old kid very well. About a few weeks ago, our kid started to cry when she arrives and does not want to even say hi or good morning to our nanny.  During the day, they still play, read, dance, and do other activities together. Our kid does not cry when we leave her with our nanny.  What I don't understand is why she cries when nanny arrives but not the other time like playing and during the day. She still hugs our nanny and acts normal for everything except this one.  Is this a red flag? Is there something I can to do ease my mind? "
2300,Does this method of potty-training work?,"According to this article, my three-year-old son is ""resistant to potty training."" That is putting it mildly -- he was getting so good, and then in the past month or so he's gotten worse than he ever was. So, my question is do steps like the ones outlined in that article work? It almost seems counter-intuitive.  For reference, here are the major bullet points:        Transfer all responsibility to your child.   Stop all reminders about using the toilet.     Give incentives for using the toilet.     Give stars for using the toilet.     Make the potty chair convenient.   Diapers, Pull-ups, or underwear? (use underwear).     Remind your child to change his clothes if he wets or soils himself.     Don't punish or criticize your child for accidents.     Ask the preschool or day care staff to use the same strategy.        I feel like my wife and I have tried some of the things on this list. I know we've done 3,4,5,6 and 9 is a no-brainer (school needs to cooperate here). "
2301,My toddler used to love bath time and now he hates it (or is scared of it),"My toddler seemingly has developed some fear to bath time.  My toddler (16 moths) used to love bath time. He would be smiling when I carried him naked to the bath and loved to play with his bath toys. Once or twice he had an unpleasant situation with soap on his eyes but apart from that, bathing him was enjoyable for him and easy for us.  He gets a short bath every other day. Around a week ago, at bath time, he started crying while sitting in the bathtub. We thought that maybe his bum was hurting (it looked a little bit red). We took him out, dried him and put the diaper with some butt paste. Two days later, he started crying as soon as his feet touched the water, and didn't event want to sit an play in the tub. We took him out, but a couple minutes later I put one of his favorite toys on the far end of the bathtub and he didn't mind being put in the tub and helped to reach the toy. He did not seem afraid of the water, just didn't seem in the mood for a bath (which was weird for us after the previous episode, specially since he always seemed to love bath time).  Tonight, after stripping him I held him to take him to the bath and he started crying when he understood where he was going. He was crying a lot and hanged really tight to me, never letting go. He got more upset as he got closer to the bath tub. He never made it to the bath and it took him a while to get calmer. He is not that upset when he falls or the like. Just being taken close to the tub seemed a very upsetting experience. If it wasn't because a week ago he loved bath time I would have said he was scared of it.  I don't know if he is going through something developmental at this stage that specifically makes him hate the bath now. He has not had scary or unpleasant experiences in the bathtub before (expect for the mentioned soap in the eyes).  Could it be that he is afraid of bath time now? If so, how do I help him to overcome this fear? "
2302,How to make a 6-year-old stop being too competitive for his own good?,"My colleague's  6-year-old son has just started elementary school. He is a bright boy, however, very competitive, so much so that he started resisting going to school, even attending any activities, social and active. He says he is scared he will not  be the best of the class, get the highest grades or win that particular race. The family is trying not to be aggressive but even the psychologist and the principal of the school couldn't talk the boy into attending the classes.   Any suggestions of how to fix this problem? Could this have anything to do with jealousy? "
2303,What are guidelines for parents to use in giving advice/guidance to older teens?,"My friend asked me for guidance regarding her son, so I am passing the question on.   Her very talented son is a senior in high school. Since it is his last year at home, he feels that he no longer needs input from his parents. His is a very bright, well-mannered and popular young man who was home-schooled until 9th grade. His parents feel he has had limited exposure to ""the real world"" and that he would continue to benefit from their guidance.   They do not want this transition to mar their very good relationship and create a problem between them. Yet, research indicates that the human female brain is not fully mature until between 21 and 22 years of age and the male brain is not fully mature until nearly 30 years of age.   My friend recognizes the importance of the decisions her son will makes at this time in his life for impacting his future.   What are your suggestions? How can they promote his independence, but provide parental guidance and the benefit of their age and experience?  "
2304,How does having a second child change your life?,"Most parents would probably agree that having a child will deeply change your life. But how does having a second child change your life?   Second-time parents won't be much surprised about the smell of diapers, or the lack of sleep. But surely there are some things that will put your life upside down again. What should we expect and what should we not expect? "
2305,What type of co-sleeping product hangs off the side of the bed?,"We're on our third child.  The first two would nurse and then go right to sleep in the bassinet.  This one seems to sleep well in the bed, but not in the bassinet.  My wife looked online and found these co-sleeping things that help prevent bad things from happening: rolling on top of them, suffocating on blankets, etc.    I asked our doctor and she said she's comfortable with the ""side"" co-sleepers, but not the ones that lay in the middle of the bed.  It sounded like the doctor described something that hangs off the side of the bed.  When searching Amazon, though, I can only find full-size bassinets that pull up to the bed or co-sleepers that just lay on the mattress - nothing that hangs off the side.  We're probably not interested in buying a whole new bassinet at $150.    Do you think the doc was just mixed up?  Have you used one of these products?  Do you feel safe with them? "
2306,How do we teach our toddler that it's okay to go on the potty?,"My son has been potty-training for about a month or so, with pretty good results.  It started with a few days of wearing underwear instead of a diaper, and having accidents, since he didn't know how to go on the toilet, even though he was pretty good at holding it in.  The big breakthrough came when he learned how to go on the toilet, and since then he's been pretty good, with accidents now and then.  One of the first things he learned was to ""stay dry"" &mdash; in other words, no poop or pee in his pants.  However, this has led to an interesting dilemma for him &mdash; he thinks he can ""stay dry"" forever to avoid ever pooping or peeing.  Lately, he has been expressing just how much he hates pooping and peeing.  He will tell us he ""has wees"" and then run to the toilet, but when he gets there, he changes his mind and gets very upset - saying ""No wees! Stay dry!"" (He wants to try to stay dry and not ever do wees again.)  How do we teach him that staying dry is important, but that he has to go when he feels the urge and that's ok?  This has led to a couple accidents, because he believes that he can stay dry, but then leaves it too long.  He usually does tell us when he gets the first urge, but then when he changes his mind, we don't like having to fight to force him to sit on the toilet at that moment (though, when we have, once he is on the toilet he will go just fine - it's just the anxiety of expectations that seem to be getting to him).  I feel like a fight to sit on the toilet is a bad thing to associate with something he should be willing to do.  Any suggestions? "
2307,Is it usual to meet with a nurse practitioner instead of a doctor for a first prenatal visit?,"I have scheduled my first prenatal visit since I am two-months pregnant. One of my friends referred me to one of her doctors. I have been told by my friend that the first visit is the most important, and the longest of the series of visits throughout the pregnancy.   My understanding is that I am supposed to see my doctor so he or she can answer my questions and concerns. The appointment I make is supposed to be with that specific OB/GYN doctor.  However, my doctor was not available at the time of my scheduled appointment. The nurse told me that she had an operation to participate in. Instead, the doctor's office suggested that I should see the nurse practitioner instead of my doctor.   The office also says that right now I can not choose any specific doctor for my visit. There is a team of doctors and nurses working together, so they actually don't know who I can meet each time I visit because my doctor maybe not available then. But there will be one available to take care me. Is these standard procedure in US? How can we be confident about the doctors since I have no single point of contact? Any one have any experience like this?  I come from another country. In my country, there is a one doctor who is with you for all the steps from beginning to delivery. Is that valid here?   I am not sure that I misunderstood anything. Can any one help me explain what it supposed to be a usual process? Can a nurse practitioner replace an OB/GYN doctor?  Addition Information: I am in PA. The hospital that I went to is about 300 beds.  "
2308,How to deal with head lice?,"We have found (against all reason) that we have an infestation of head lice at home. I don't know where my kids got it (and at this point it doesn't matter) but I've never had to deal with this before. When I was a kid I never got it, nor did anyone I know. There were never any reported cases in any of my schools.  Anyway, we've treated their heads and spent hours (upon hours upon hours) picking nits out of their hair. Bed linens have been washed multiple times, pillows and stuffed animals are put away in plastic bags, and we've sprayed the furniture and car interiors with a lice-killing spray. Oh, and we've called the parents of all the kids mine have been in contact with.  Am I missing something? How long does it take to ensure they're truly gone? "
2309,Where is the line on helping with homework?,"Here's something I know a lot of parents with school-age children struggle with. What's the line between ""helping"" a child with their homework versus out-and-out doing it for them? At what point is too much help a problem? How would one know if they're starting to do the assignment for the child rather than providing guidance/assistance? "
2310,When and how is circumcision done?,"I am not looking for judgment or opinion. I am looking for information.    When is circumcision done? Do we need to set it up in advance, does it happen at the hospital after birth, who does it at the hospital, and so on...? "
2311,How should an infant refer to its biological father and step father?,"Ex-Wife and I separated when our only child was two.  She quickly found another partner and they are now living together as married.  I still have regular visits and sleepovers with infant. Relationship between ex-wife and I is workman-like, but not particularly difficult.  Infant referred to step-father as ""Daddy"" or ""DaddyName"" (the forename of the stepfather) as soon as step-father moved into their home.  This is fine with me.  I am glad they have a strong bond.  But infant's mother started directing infant to stop calling me Daddy.  First she asked infant to call me ""DaddyName"", then she went further to ask child to call me just ""Name"".  Now, at age four, this seems to have stuck firmly.    Before anyone asks the obvious questions: I know this.  She said it in front of me.  She said it to me.  She has asked me to remind infant to stop calling me ""Daddy"".  I'm not getting this from the infant but from the infant's mother.  I would prefer to be called either ""Daddy"" or ""DaddyName"".  I don't care what step-father is called and I use the term ""Daddy"" to refer to him.  Infant's mother is reluctant to gently introduce this small change, claiming it causes ""confusion"" for infant.  Is it normal for a biological father to be excluded in this way?  How do I persuade infant's mother to let me be called ""DaddyName""? "
2312,"Encopresis, I'm at my wits end? Does anybody have suggestions?","My 12 year old daughter has been dealing with retentive encopresis since age 6. She avoids going to the toilet at all. This results in soiling and the production of an amazing huge toilet-clogging log-like object every week. We have been trying for years to get her to talk about this, but when we do talk about this, the response is ALWAYS ""I don't know"" despite what her pedi, GI doc and psychologist tried to do or suggested we do to get her to talk about it. We switched psychologists last year after a year of not talking about this, no luck.  We have tried so many treatment plans since diagnosis, specifically tailored to her, such as enemas, scheduled toilet sittings, rewards, consequences, psychologist, etc. she just keeps holding it in. Right before summer, her pedi and the GI doc laid out a clear treatment plan of laxatives, regular bathroom visits, and a rewards program. She did take the Miralax (2 table spoons) but she just kept holding it in and soiling her pants. She avoided going to the toilet. I made her stay at the toilet and told her ""if you poop, I will buy you XYZ"" (something she REALLY wants)"" you can do XYZ only after you poop"" and not letting her do things ""you can't do XYZ until you poop"" and XYZ would be something she LOVES to do. I wouldn't let her leave the toilet until she pooped, so she sat there for hours, no luck. When school started, she refuses to take the Miralax.  Now we laid out a new treatment plan. We TRIED to involve her, the response is again ""I don't know."" She is supposed to take an enema every morning and sit on the toilet, but she fights daily about taking it. When she does take it, she holds it in and won't sit on the toilet. There is also a diet plan she refuses to follow. She is not supposed to drink dairy, but drinks milk at school. Now the past 2 weeks she refused all treatment which we fight daily about. She refuses to sit on the toilet, no matter what we try. 2 years ago we tried ucanpooptoo, didn't help.  We asked her why she holds it in. Does pooping hurt? Does it scare you to poop? Does it feel good to hold it in? The answer is always ""I don't know"" and you can question her for hours and hear ""I don't know"". We explained to her digestion and she knows why she needs to poop. We ruled out any physiological reasons for retention. Luckily her friends don't notice, but one day her friends might smell her soiling, and I talked to her about this, how it would affect, boys , high school, etc. Her response was ""I don't know"" and she would not talk about this.  Does anybody have suggestions how to get her to start pooping in the toilet regularly? "
2313,How should a toddler be encouraged to walk (if at all)?,"My 11 month old son has been ""cruising"" for the past two months.  He pulls himself up to standing quite readily, and walks quite well while holding onto something with both hands, or even one hand (although there is a clear lack of confidence in his balance when he's only holding on with one hand).  Should I just be waiting for him to decide to try and walk on his own?  Or are there ways to help him develop balance and encourage him to walk on his own, since he seems ready? "
2314,"Is it better to send your child to school with lunch, or lunch money?","I remember my school cafeteria food as being, well, not what I'd consider ""food"".  At the same time, I know how hard it is to consistently pack lunch as an adult without getting bored with the same meals over and over again.  It takes time and planning that can be in short supply for a busy parent.  What are the pros and cons of packing lunches vs. having a child buy their lunches from the school cafeteria?  How good (or bad!) is the food at school cafeterias?  Have there been improvements in taste and nutrition? "
2315,How do you handle a conflict between your child and a teacher?,"How do you approach resolving a situation where a teacher and your child are having a major conflict?  When your child comes to you complaining about ""unfair treatment"" from a teacher, how do you identify where the problem is really coming from, without making your child feel like you aren't supporting them? "
2316,My child doesn't want to be seen in public with me... what should I do?,"I drive my 10 year old child to school each day.  However, lately he has been complaining about my dropping him off at school.  He says it is embarrassing to be seen being dropped off by his father, and wants me to drop him off 2 blocks away.  I'm concerned about his safety, and don't feel comfortable dropping him off out of site of the school entrance.  My feelings are also hurt by these comments.  Is it normal for a child to be embarrassed by being seen with their parent?  Is there any way I can help make him less embarrassed? "
2317,"Baby takes so long to wind, is there a solution?","Our baby was born prematurely and had to be bottle fed.  The nurses joked that she was a 'windy baby' when she was being nursed.  Now she's home and nearly six weeks old, she's devouring ample amounts of breast milk via a bottle.  The problem is that she can take up to two hours to burp after a feed.  Sometimes I fear this takes so long she actually starts getting hungry again.  During the night this is reducing our sanity.  All our friends say that their babies burp within a few minutes after feeding.  Can anyone offer any help?  We've replaced the cheap supermarket bottles that were recommended for premature baby, with Phillips Avent, and now with Tommy Tippee anti-colic varieties with a medium-flow teat.  We've also tried Infacol (which made her worse!) and now Dentinox, but we're still not much better off.  She's growing fine, so maybe I shouldn't worry and just deal with it?  Update  I can't believe I only asked this 8 days ago, it feels like a lot longer!    Anyway, the difference in that time has been amazing.  She's winding loads better (between 5 and 45 minutes) and seems a lot calmer after feeding.  Tommy Tippee was the bottle that made a difference, although I think it was more due to a phase of growth and stomach development :-) Anyway, I had 6.5 hours sleep last night and feel like a new person :-) "
2318,Are bribery/threats effective and are there alternatives?,"   Don't bribe her (chantage / faire chanter)   said my sister while I was talking to my almost 3-year-old daughter.  It's bad, but what are the alternatives?  I read that threatening and bribing reinforce a kind of Pavlovian reaction between some situations and their consequences (e.g. quiet => candy, bad action => punishment, etc.), and worse, can give rise to culpability (e.g. a child could make himself believe his parents wouldn't have separated if he had been well-behaved).  On the other hand, a suggested alternative I read, when discussion doesn't work, is to make a rule (the child must obey), which doesn't seem to me like an improvement.  Where does one draw the line when threatening, bribing or rewarding? Are they to be avoided at all costs? What are efficient alternatives to threatening/bribing when the child cannot be convinced and/or there is a hurry?  NB: I can see at least three levels of threatening (level 1) and bribing (levels 2 and 3), but there are probably more:   ""if … then I call Big Bad Wolf"", phone in hand (found it mentioned in comments of an article…) ; ""if you do x, then [reward]"" (the child being asked to do something but not asking for a reward.) ""[I let you do something or we'll go somewhere] if you do x (the child already asking to do something or go somewhere.)   Forget about the first category, which seems terrible, and let's focus on 2 and 3. Can threatening and bribing be considered blackmailing? "
2319,Which is better - a Minivan or a SUV - for a 4 kid family,"We have 3 kids and are currently managing fitting them in an Accord (Mom) and a Civic (Dad). The civic is tight but most of the time it's one parent with the kids in that one.  We recently found out number 4 is on the way and the great debate over Minivan or SUV has arisen again. We have a few months to battle but I (Dad) want the Minivan and Mom wants the Pilot.   What are some obvious and not so obvious pros and cons of each?  Are there any reasoning to convince my wife that the van is preferable or am I off base?  Are there any other options for a third row seat other than van or SUV?  Ages are 12, 7, 1.5, -6 months. And no scientific possibility for anymore. :/ "
2320,Are ExerSaucers/walkers/jumpers bad for children or is that simply a misconception?,"I have heard my whole life that the above mentioned types of toys delay walking and/or independent sitting (depending on the age they're used). I've even heard that they can hurt the infant's legs. I've never seen any research to suggest this is true and I'm skeptical, but it also makes me nervous about buying one for my son--even though he'd likely enjoy it at this age.  Is there any research, or even individual cases of it, that would suggest this is true? How about evidence to the contrary? "
2321,Raise babysittable kids,"Background:  My wife and I babysat 4 children and the parents made it sound like a) there was a schedule and b) if there were difficulties to just say something like 'are you listening', 'are you being respectful', etc. Trying to follow the schedule did not work and the phrases did not work, one child continuously wanted to be not in her room because it was uncomfortable, but didn't have any answer on what would make her comfortable. Our approach was to attempt to block her in her room with our body or the door, but that involved staying there. I was not particularly close to the family so didn't want to go out of bounds with a punishment/discipline so didn't end up doing much else.  Question:  What are some strategies to raise children that can be more easily babysat by others? Or will it just depend on the child and I should have a list of allowed punishments for the babysitter? "
2322,What to do with a first grader who cannot sit still in school?,"A first grader (7 1/2 years old) has trouble sitting still.  Often, he stands up when everyone else is sitting, squirms around, but is not verbally disruptive.  At home, he similarly has little patience for sitting still during dinner, standing up frequently, but not always.  In other settings, he has a long attention span, such as when putting together a lego toy or the like.  He can read books (or play video gamesor watch videos) for long periods of time.   He always sits for breakfast.  How hard should the family try to get the little fellow to sit still?  I presume that this standing up will be more disruptive in 2nd grade, if it persists.    His 1st grade teachers say he also is not paying attention to the work.  Rather he is frequently distracted, so he is often the last to finish.  What are the various options and their pros and cons?  These come to mind: Find a less structured school, try behavioral techniques to encourage sitting in his chair.  Other?  Or just let him be? "
2323,Can you effectively influence the behavior of a 6 month old?,"I've just started feeding my daughter solids, and I would like to teach her to not blow raspberries while there is food in her mouth (which is cute, but messy.)  Is it possible to communicate to her what it is she shouldn't be doing, or is she too young to understand?  If she is old enough to understand, should I make an issue of this? "
2324,How to decide whether I should buy whatever the child asks for?,"I never faced this situation when I was a child. My father tells me that I didn't have a habit of asking for things.   I remember asking for 2 things as a child. They were expensive so my parents refused and I didn't pester.   Now the situation has changed. We live in a big city. We are a middle class family, and have only one child.  Now, when child says that I want this because my friends also have it, or I saw that thing in the shop and I like it so get it for me, how am I supposed to respond?  On what basis should I decide whether I should get the child what she wishes or not?  This is not about any teenager. This is about a child who is grown up enough to ask for things but isn't grown up enough to understand that how money is earned and what can happen if we waste.  The child is currently 2 years 4 months old, so currently the situation is not applicable to her.  If I decide not to get her the thing she asked for, then what would be the way to explain her why? "
2325,How to deal with beggars in front of the children?,"Beggar problem in India is real. I do not give anything to beggars in order to discourage begging. My mother does.  I don't want the child to think that I am cruel and it is okay not to help the needy. The child is currently 2 years 4 months old.   When (at what age of the child) should I start getting concerned about dealing with beggars in front of the child?   How to deal with beggars in front of the child?   What should the child be told about me not giving anything to the beggars?   What should the child be told about my mother giving money to the beggars?   I am yet to find a place here where there are no beggars, so avoiding such places is not possible.  Also, we don't carry food around to give to the beggars. I tried to give food to a beggar once, she threw it down and moved on.  I am an Indian - if it matters at all. "
2326,"From what age do children start having permanent memory of incidents, and what is the maximum long term memory at what age?","From what age do children start having permanent memory of incidents such as mother slapping her very hard, father reading her stories, doing drawing and other crafts, meeting an accident?  What is the maximum long term memory at what age?  Example: My child is currently 2 years 4 months old. I read her story books daily. Will she remember this when she is 32? "
2327,Handling husband’s 15-year-old daughter with Reactive Attachment Disorder,"Two years ago, I met my husband. We are both in our 30s. He’s been married before. I have not been. He has a teen daughter from a relationship he had in college. The mother of the girl abandoned the girl and him under rather still-confusing to me circumstances when the girl was 2. The girl has not seen or had her mother in her life since then.  He then fluctuated through a bevy of relationships until 2008, when he met his now-ex-wife. The ex-wife and her parents effectively adopted the girl (legally wasn’t possible for various inter-state laws). The new family had the means and interest to have the girl diagnosed with ADHD and RAD. My husband’s marriage with his ex-wife collapsed due to, predominantly, her infidelity. Once separated, the girl came to split time between her dad and her step-grandmother (and no, not her stepmother).   Fast-forward 3 years since his divorce — he meets me. I am a survivor of rather extreme abuse. Otherwise—well-adjusted, eccentric, children-loving educator. Almost one year into our relationship, I met his daughter. She seemed enchanting but I knew very well of her problems — deliberate urination (not caused by neuro or physical problems), refusal to comply with norms, and an aloof persona with most anyone. But she was enchanting with me when we met.   Approximately 6 months after we met, I moved in with them — him and his daughter. Very quickly, I discovered the relationship between them was toxic — constant fighting, yelling, arguing over simplest things (like getting her to pick up anything after herself). I established a rule of no yelling and yes to picking up and being civil.  Initially, the girl mixed compliance with horrific bouts of anger outbursts at me — she would snarl or yell or cry tempestously when asked to do basic things. Keep in mind, I never yelled or raised my voice with her. In between the tempests, she did improve dramatically and showed me quite a bit of affection — that is, in between the bouts of drama.  My husband, with my insistence, toned down his own proclivity for anger and a lot of surprising peace was established.   To get closer to my question — in all the time that I was doing what I did, I was not declared or recognized or defined as anything in the house beyond a “fiancée” and, later, “wife.” That is, no one — including the girl’s therapist — specified my role in the household. I never gave it much thought either but, in practice, behaved maternally.   About a month ago, the tempests from the girl resumed, and, during one, she told me she doesn’t want me to be her mother or to behave like one or to do any of the things I have done so far in the home, such as requesting chores of the girl and such.   I was stunned. Hurt. And I stopped. Since then, things between me and my husband’s daughter have rapidly deteriorated. She has become more rude and dismissive of me — almost as much as when I first moved in. Ironically, she hasn’t lapsed back into toxicity with her father.   What do I do?   Btw., for anyone curious, my husband’s ex-wife does not have any active role in the girl’s life. She does get referred by the girl as “mom.”  Does anyone have ideas on how to be a second maternal presence to a RAD teen? "
2328,What should I consider when getting tympanostomy tubes (grommets) for my child?,"My son likely needs (tympanostomy) tubes for his ears for chronic ear infections.   I was wondering what I need to know about them and maintaining them.   For instance, I know it can limit your swimming activities unless special earplugs are worn. Does it affect bath time? Are those earplugs expensive? Are other activities affected?   I'm not concerned with the procedure itself, or seeking advice on whether or not to have the procedure done.   I'm concerned with lifestyle adjustments, inconveniences and extra costs that may be associated with tubes, so that we can prepare mentally and financially for this situation. In general, any health, hygiene and safety considerations I should be aware of. Specifically, the kinds of adjustments or inconveniences parents discover during the course of this, that general knowledge wouldn't prepare you for. "
2329,Better to struggle taking Honors/AP courses or take easier courses?,"My son is filling out his schedule for his high school sophomore year. He wants to take Honors/AP courses, but the honors English and History class he's in now, he struggles to maintain a B and got a C- last semester. Much of it is not due to capability (he scores high on English standardized tests) but due to procrastination, poor time management and missing or partially completed assignments.  This is the schedule he's considering.   Honors English  Honors Geometry   AP World History   Chemistry   French 2  PE   Since he wants to pursue a Science major in college, I don't see the benefit taking AP World History and maybe Honors English.   What do you think especially if you've gone through or are going through a similar situation? Is it better to stay challenged and get a B/C, or take an easier course and apply his efforts on other classes? "
2330,How to handle 3-year-old's fear of failure?,"The boy is now nearly four years old, and he has a tendency to not wanting to try anything new or doing things he's not good at. Here are some examples:   If you give him a coloring book and some crayons, he will draw for a couple of minutes before saying ""I don't know how"" / ""I'm no good"" and gives up.  He doesn't want to taste anything new, so there isn't much he eats He likes to ride a bike (with training wheels) downhill, but pedaling is too difficult, he doesn't want to do it He likes to climb and is good at it, but if you try to get him to walk a balancing beam (just a foot high), he doesn't want to do it.   I don't know what he's thinking, but I assume it's a kind of fear of failure. He prefers to not even try over trying and failing. That would explain the eating problem as well, like he's thinking ""What if I don't like it? Better to not even taste it.""  How can we help him? "
2331,Why does my daughter spin around for fun?,"My 20 months old daughter is in very good shape and is growing very well.  She has discovered how to play the music sound system and we are listening to the same record over and over again. In the course of these moments, sometimes she starts enjoying it very much to the point of laughing, running around the living room and, eventually, spinning around.  This last thing is the one that impresses me the most: how come spinning around is this enjoyable for her? I have talked with other fellow parents and they also recognize this behaviour.  To make my point clear, by spinning around I mean her rotating around her axis many, many times (say ten or so). Then, she tries to walk normally and the effect of the rotation makes her wobble, walk strangely and sometimes even fall down. To her fun, of course, because she laughs while doing it.  Her spinning also includes us, the parents, from time to time: she will grab our hand and start running around us, so we also do rotate. To me this is hard because I get sick after the second turn, so I just stop myself.  I assume this is not dangerous, so my concern is: what is the reason for her spinning around? Is there any kind of feeling they get at this age that I cannot perceive as an adult? "
2332,What can a parent do when his child has an incompetent teacher?,"What can you do when your child comes back from school with tears in her eyes or her heart because of an incompetent teacher? Three examples to illustrate:    she told her class that humans can hear radio waves. Without a radio! She teaches physics in high school. On another occasion she said that if the moon was not around the earth, it would not have a great influence on ocean tides because the sun was also responsible for ocean tides on the earth. She often has to stop her explanations in class because she is confused herself about what she is teaching. The correction of her exams and labs changes from one copy to the other and she rarely accepts to make corrections. There are mistakes or missing elements in the questions of her exams. On three occasions she did not try the lab herself before the class and, therefore, could hardly explain it. She forgets regularly to check the material for the labs. The list goes on, growing since September.   I am a parent, but also a retired teacher. The only bright light: my daughter has 11 weeks to go before being liberated from high school. She is one of the best students of her school, so you can imagine the other students.   What can we do and say, as parents, when this happens? "
2333,Bottles at night are bad for teeth but what about breastfeeding?,"I’d say that most people know that putting kids to bed with a bottle of milk will cause tooth decay but what about older babies and toddlers who fall asleep at the breast?   My daughter is the most gluttonous of all my children at the breast. She refused solids at all until 10 months old. We co-slept (as I did with one other of my 4 kids) and she was literally attached to me all night, suckling off and on. At 22 months, she still falls asleep in our bed, “boob-n-snoozing” for a few hours until I move her to bed. We brush her teeth before bed and every morning, but, I wonder if I should more aggressively try to “break the seal” for the sake of her little pearly whites?   To be clear, I’m asking if there’s any research or evidence that breastmilk is as bad as any other milk at night for teeth, or if it’s the delivery method, the bottle that causes a problem? I’m not asking for advice about breaking her nighttime feeding habit per se, as we are both happy with our arrangement (for now) but if it’s bad for her teeth I’ll just interrupt the suckling and stick with snuggling. :) "
2334,Should I babysit my step granddaughter?,"I have been married for over 20 years and have been a stepparent for all of these years since my stepdaughter was just 3 years old.   My husband's ex-wife despises my husband and myself and has always taken every opportunity to say so, including always calling him just the sperm donor to everyone (stepdaughter told us what they call him and laughed at how funny it was) and for the most part pretending I do not exist at all.   He was not allowed to walk her down the aisle at her wedding, we were allowed to stand at the back of the ceremony but not allowed in any pictures. What her mother and grandmother say goes, and it has always been that way. When their baby was born we were not allowed to go to the hospital, so that her mom and grandmom wouldn't get mad.   She asked me to babysit when she went back to work and I thought it would great, and things would change and I could be grandma; but after watching her for a few months, now I found out my name is just the babysitter by her and all her family.   I honestly thought we had a great relationship and all this other stuff was just her not willing to stand up to her mom, but now I am just hurt and mad.   So do I keep up the free babysitting, knowing full well we will never be invited to a birthday or graduation or be allowed to be called grandparents even, just to be able to see our grandbaby some? Or do I tell her I cannot babysit and get attached to a child that will be taught to just use us for what she can get, like her mom was raised to do? "
2335,Difficulties in Raising Religious Children With Non Religious Fiance,"Background: I was raised in an intellectual Catholic household where religion quietly infused everything we did. At the time it seemed totally normal but as I have grown up, I realized that my siblings and I had a a very good childhood. I'm thinking about getting married now and I'm starting to worry and appreciate how difficult maintaining that quiet cohesion must have been. My fiance was raised baptist but is now an atheist. I suspect he doesn't care more than he doesn't believe.   As I'm thinking more about getting married and having children, I'm realizing how formative religion was for me. My mom was an atheist but converted after meeting my dad, which certainly made things easier, but I can't count on that with my fiance.  I wanted to know if there are others here who raised religious children with a non religious spouse. If so, how did the parents negotiate it? Did the kids turn out religious or agnostic?  If my fiance and I didn't want children, this would not be a problem. I wish it wasn't a problem. "
2336,How to deal with children going to friend's houses to bypass rules,"In our house, as with most households I assume, there are lots of rules that we decided on, which might not be agreed upon by other families. Our son is 9 at the moment.  For example, to prevent video game addiction, our son is not allowed to play when it's sunny outside. Without going into details as to how we came to this arbitrary rule, it's basically because we want to promote playing outside, but there is really very little to do Inside of our house so disallowing it on rainy days felt unfair.  Another rule we have is that treats should be eaten for dessert. We allow eating between meals only if it's a healthy snack, like fruits or vegetables. Ice cream, for example, is only to be eaten at the end of a meal.  Unlike in this question, our son never displayed a problem with that. He usually abides by our rules without complaining. But of course, many of his friends have different rules.  What we have noticed is progressively happening is that our son is going more and more at his friend's houses, especially in summer, and they are coming less and less here. They don't spent more time together overall, but this time is starting to be almost entirely spent at their places.  Of course, I can't decide what happens in another house, and my wife and I agree that trying to tie strings to our son will only result in him lying. We can't possibly check on him, and we can't control the other parents, so either he's allowed to eat sweets and play video games at their friend's places, or he's not allowed but will keep doing it behind our back.  The obvious reason why this is happening is that our son wants to do thèses things, therefore he tries to spent as much time as possible in households where this is allowed. That's totally logical from his perspective, he found a loophole and is using it. If I could temporarily move to a country with much lower taxes for 2 weeks when it's taxes season to save much money, I'd certainly do it too.  But another possibility is that the friends themselves find our house ""boring"", and are pressuring our son to play at theirs, where the fun is.  So my question is vague, mostly because we are constantly second-guessing ourselves with our first kid. What are we supposed to do?  Specifically, should we loosen our own rules at the expenses of what we believe is good for him? Is there a variation that wouldn't have negative conséquences that we could put in place (Ex: ""You can do these things only when there are guests"" would certainly increase the frequency of guests).  We, obviously, do not want to alienate his friends and isolate him, but changing our rules because another family did so seems particularly unfair, as if they were raising our children.  We are open to any and all suggestions, and will try to answer any question raised in the comments without compromising privacy. "
2337,Backed into a corner with 9-year-old and tablet confiscation,"My 9-year-old son spends as much time as he can get away with using his iPad (in this case watching Youtube videos). His iPad is also required for school.  This evening, after giving him ample warning he needed to stop watching videos, I advised him if he continued I would confiscate his iPad for 1 week - which in hindsight was not a wise move. He continued watching videos, and I have confiscated the device, despite his - impressive as always - tantrum (I very seldom need to discipline him and when I do I follow through. Unfortunately, his interactions with his mother have taught him he can control the outcome using histrionics/drama - and this is beyond my control - but I need him to know that when I do discipline him histrionics/drama will not work).  If tomorrow I ""soften up"" and allow him limited use of the iPad (for use only in class - but as I am not always present I may not be able to enforce this behaviour), am I undermining my parental authority? (I am worried, he will see that as me ""buying in"" to his drama about being kicked out of school etc. etc.) If so, is there any way of handling this, other than enforcing what is probably a disproportionate punishment and consequence? "
2338,How can a long distance parent boost an eight year old's confidence (custodial partner uncooperative/negative?),"I'm a long distance father to an eight year old daughter and a four year old son, whom I see on average most weekends.  My daughter has periodically lost her sense of confidence, and recently has begun to say things like, ""No one wants to partner with me in school"", ""My friend K is just better than me, she's so popular,"" ""I need to learn how to be popular,"" etc.  As a long distance parent, how can I help with these situations, and what can I do to boost my daughter's confidence?  When I'm around, I try to respond to statements like the above by asking for more specifics, by talking about my own experience of rejection in school, and saying to my daughter that while she might believe she is dumb or inferior, I don't, and as I've taught her many things I know that can't be true, etc.  But often I feel like I'm going about this wrongly, as she'll just switch off or change the subject.  Sometimes I feel like I get through, especially when I can manage to have a conversation (I try to avoid lectures).  The problem is that I'm not around all the time so I'm not there when these things strike her.  Talking about this face to face itself is difficult and in a phone / video call, which my daughter anyway does not like, it is impossible.  So what can I do to contribute to solving this?  Some more elements of the context are important.  I've posted a number of questions here so my messy situation may be recognisable. My wife has what I think I can best sum up as mild narcissistic tendencies.  She was also emotionally abusive towards me for much of our marriage, until very recently, when I stopped staying with her during the times I visit.  Her abusive behaviour has improved since (we may save our marriage), as well as her aggression with the kids, but with our daughter she still will:   React at times to our daughter's tears at rejection / bullying with ""What is there to cry about?"" Harshly rebuke our daughter in front of others for small mistakes like dropping something or being absent minded, including at times using mild force, like squeezing her arm painfully Internally compare our daughter to some friends of hers in a way that implies the others are superior because they are confident and ""strong"" (she doesn't explicitly say this to our daughter)   In these ways I think she is possibly contributing to the problem.  In light of her personality and our marital situation I can't have a really productive conversation with my wife about these issues (NB: hence, please don't provide me with advice around communicating with my wife).  What can I do as the long distance parent to help here?  I'm very worried about her.   Edit: An additional question. Would it be helpful to provide books about assertiveness etc? My wife may contradict them, but will that destroy their effectiveness? "
2339,How do I help the neighbor's kids not be so scared of me?,"My husband and I are in our early thirties and have no children. I don't really have much experience with kids. I am happy to talk to them but have never had any of my own so don't feel super comfortable around them.  We know the neighbours, have visited with them before, but are mostly on acquaintance-level familiarity. When we've been over to visit, their kids have been painfully shy (which isn't too surprising). I decided it was just because they didn't know us and thought it'd take time and they'd be fine. They're a boy and girl, both ages 7/8 ish.  Occasionally, they'll hit a ball over the wall into our yard and come over and ask to get it back. And even now, they seem really unsure of me. Almost scared.  They'll run in, grab it and run out as fast as possible. We've visited with their parents a couple of times and they've always been really painfully shy. It's been 18 or so months now and it's still the same.   Now naturally, they have their lives and it's not really any of my business. My husband and I are happy to just leave them be. But I don't want to be the scary neighbour that they're too afraid to talk to. Is there anything I can do to be less scary? Or should I not even try? "
2340,Stand or collar to hold bottle for warming in pot,"Does something exists for bottle warming that is, essentially, just a collar that attached to the rim of a pot in order to hold a bottle upright while it is being warmed on the stove?  The real need: something hands-free, small or dual-use, and stove top. (Maybe a small double-boiler?)  Does this exist commercially (and what is it called)? It seems like a simple problem: what creative solution am I missing? "
2341,6 year old is acting out with family,"My 6 year old son acts out: yells, throws, hits, makes faces, talks disrepectfully to my husband and I and his 4 year old sister (who he hits often).  We have talked so many times, disciplined, taken away privileges and toys, etc. Nothing gets through.  Today he asked me why he acts out so much and why is he a bad boy? This brought tears. What can I do next? "
2342,Where should boys aim their urine?,"We have been potty training our son. We got him comfortable going sitting down first, and now he is learning to urinate while standing.  What should I teach him to aim for when peeing while standing up, at the water, or at the side of the bowl?  I have always aimed for the water, but my wife just informed me, after 3 years of cleaning the toilets, that she noticed that sometimes there is splatter on the adjacent walls. Does aiming at the water create more splatter than aiming at the bowl?   I tried an experiment in the urinal at work today, and aiming at the bowl seemed to result in splatter also, but my theory is that at least the splatter from the water is diluted (or is pure toilet water), while the splatter from the bowl is at least 99% urine. I couldn't find much research, at least nothing I could take seriously. Is there any evidence to support either argument? I considered conducting an experiment to measure the splash, but having a hard time figuring out how to collect data.. maybe I could hang some sheets of paper around the bowl and look for spots. Any ideas? "
2343,How to constructively play with a one year old?,"I keep getting astonished on how my 1 year old LO's mental and cognitive abilities have developed recently. Suddenly she remembers things, understands yes/no, knows some words for some things, understands simple commands, and so on and so on...   But I feel like I could be doing more to encourage her development further, to teach her new things - since she is eager to play with me and learn new things it would be a great time.  What is a one year old capable of learning? In what ways can I work (play) with her to make sure she uses as much of her potential as possible?  I know there're few similar questions (how to better engage myself with my 15 month old and toys for a 1 year old), but they seem to only skim the subject. I'd like the answers to focus on developing and learning.  ok, I've listed what we already often do in my answer. I'm looking forward to ither ideas! "
2344,"Strong-willed, 14 year old. Caught with e-cigarette paraphernalia and a condom","My 14yr old son, youngest of 4 (other 3 are triplets), has always been a very strong-willed kid.  Over the years we have been able to channel that will thru his love of soccer.    He plays a very competitive level.  About 6 months ago, his Dad was diagnosed with Bipolar, its been an extremely difficult 6 months of betrayal, loss of trust and emotional roller coasters with his Dad.  I have tried to be his rock, stayed strong and made the best decisions I could during a VERY difficult time.    I have taken my son to 2 different therapists.  He responded very well to therapy, he actually was the most intelligent and communicative of all 4 of my kids.  Never fought me on going.  At the advice of the therapist, we are down to monthly visits now, prior we were going bi-weekly.  Within the last 3 months, my son has become very defiant.    Refusing to do chores, refusing to get ready for school in the AM, refusing to be ready to go to soccer practice.  He is VERY lazy, refuses to do chores.  He speaks back to me non-stop.  Tells me to shut up, tells me I'm stupid.  I recently allowed my son to have 2 friends sleepover during spring break.  At 2am, I was awakened by giggling in the kitchen and caught the 3 boys doing shots of vodka.    I was tipped off by his older brother that he was juuling. (a form of e-cigarette).  I searched his room and found e-cigarette paraphernalia and a condom in his wallet.  How do I now deal with this?  I feel like I need to send him to a boot camp for at-risk kids to nip this in the butt.    Do I approach him on my own, do I approach him at our next therapy appointment.    What if he says it isn't his?  Just looking for some advice on the best way to address this. "
2345,How can a single person take care of a fussy 6-month-old baby?,"Both my wife and I work full time. So when we had our daughter, for the first 6 months, my in-laws came to live with us and help out. Now, both of them left to take a break. And now my mom is coming for another 6 months to help.  But my baby is now entering a 'fussy' period that is making it hard for my mom to handle on her own during the day (we come home around 6:30pm every night and take over). Three major things that make it hard:   She will cry if anyone leaves her sight. Which essentially means my mom would have to watch her every second of the day. It'll be difficult for her even to go to bathroom or go to kitchen to heat milk for her every 4 hours. She has trouble napping, both going to sleep and staying asleep. She needs to be held for 15-20 mins and if you are lucky she may fall asleep. And once she is put to the crib, if you are lucky she may stay asleep for 30 mins, usually she would wake up in 15-20 mins and need to be patted and held again. If we need her to nap 3 times per day, you can see how this process would exhaust all energies from her care taker. (This may get better with time). While she no longer cries when with my mom (she used to in the first day when my mom arrived and inlaws left), she often doesn't want my mom with her alone for any extended period.   1) and 2) and 3) combined, it seems it's nearly impossible for one caretaker to handle my baby for 8 hours during the day.  Am I wrong in the above judgment? And what concrete steps can we do to address those difficulties, or are they more of a nature of a baby and not much we can do to change it at the moment?  She does not spit up when feeding, she feeds bottles of expressed milk 4 times a day every 4 hours. The first and last feeding are the most difficult (she would stop sucking after 3-4 oz's).  Napping: that is what I would say is the biggest issue. We are keeping her on a 3-nap per day schedule, with the aim of a total of 4 hours of napping each day. This is harder and harder to achieve: both getting her to fall asleep and stay asleep is a struggle. "
2346,9 months old baby wakes up 8-10 times per night,"From birth to 4 months, my baby slept very well, up to 12 hours without waking up, but after that, she wakes up several times per night, and last 2 months she wakes up about 8-10 times at night, is it normal? What can I do? "
2347,Can a 3-month-old baby get addicted to TV?,"I know that watching TV is bad for kids and babies, but sometimes I would carry my baby in my arm and then sit down to watch some TV programmes (typically for an hour everyday). I believe that TV is not yet bad for a 3-month-old baby, simply because she is not old enough to grow an addiction to TV.  Or is her sensory already developed enough at that stage to be fully captivated by what she sees and hears on TV, and the TV exposure will thus harm her development in other areas? In other words, can a 3-month-old baby get addicted to TV? "
