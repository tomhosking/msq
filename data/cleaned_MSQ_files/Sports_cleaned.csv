0,Are there official rules for touch rugby?,"Touch rugby is a sport widely played in New Zealand and Australia, similar to rugby league except the main difference is that the person with the ball is touched instead of tackled.  To the best of my knowledge (mine, and Google's), there is no official rules for touch rugby, or even a touch rugby federation or similar.  This is a big problem in games at school, where technical points get brought up and no-one knows how to handle this.  Are there official rules for touch rugby? If so, where can I find them and who were they made by? "
1,During what time period was the outcome of roller derby matches primarily fixed?,"One of the persistent stories I hear about roller derby is that there was a time when the outcome was entirely fixed. I have had many people involved in it assure me that that was a phase of the past, and that today's matches are legit. That said, I'm a fan of professional wrestling, and, well, the same has been said about that over the years, right up to current wrestlers maintaining kayfabe even with direct questioning.  While this may open me up to one of those ""well, if you know we're going to lie to you to preserve the myth, why do you ask?"" situations, but during what time period were roller derby match outcomes fixed and are they still fixed today? "
2,How long does it usually take to take a corner kick?,"After a corner is awarded (when ball is knocked over the goal line), how long is it before the corner is actually delivered, in the top leagues or in internation games?   Is there a maximum amount of time players can use up before taking the corner? What about time for attackers/defenders to get into position? "
3,What is the most match points saved by a tournament winner?,"Recently Martin Kližan won ATP tournament in Rotterdam. On the way to the final he saved 8 match points (5 against Batistuta Agut and 3 against Mahut).      What is the record for the most match points saved by a tournament winner throughout the tournament? (What is the record for ATP tournaments, WTA tournaments, Grand Slams?)      We have a similar question about most match points saved in one match: Maximum match point saved in a tennis match? From the players mentioned there, Adriano Panatta saved 11 match points in his first round match at 1976 Italian Open and also won the whole tournament. The tournament was a part of the Grand Prix tennis circuit, which was a predecessor of the ATP World Tour.  Wikipedia list number of match points saved by Grand Slam winners here, although I am not sure whether the list is complete. (Here is link to the current revision of the article.)  According to this answer at Quora, Grand Slam record is 5 match points saved by Manuel Orantes at 1975 US Open. (However, no source supporting this claim is given there.)  This article on the ATP Tour website and also this tweet say that Kližan's 8 match points is the most at an ATP tournament since 2001. But it is not mentioned who saved eight or more match points and still won the title in 2001.  EDIT: A recent article on ATP Tour website mentioned that Félix Mantilla Botella won 2001 Palermo after saving 9 match points in the semifinals.  EDIT2: On WTA tournaments, the highest number I have seen is 8 match points saved by Andrea Petkovic in 2015 Antwerp. WTA:  Petkovic Caps Dream Week In Antwerp (Wayback Machine) At 2001 Miami, Jennifer Capriati lost in the final to Venus Williams, despite having eight championship points. "
4,Was Messi's Penalty Kick against Celta de Vigo in La Liga 2016 considered a miss?,"Was Messi's Penalty Kick against Celta de Vigo in La Liga 2016 considered a miss, according to FIFA rules?  In Are players allowed to pass a penalty? it's established that it is possible to 'pass' a penalty kick, however does it count as a miss? "
5,Is the classic alpine combined used as a skiing discipline or now all drive super combined?,"In Wikipedia it is said that, Alpine combined is consisting of one run of Downhill and two runs of Slalom, while its variation Super Combined, can be Downhill/SuperG, plus one run of Slalom. From the past years I only see a Super Combined discipline, right? Is the classic Alpine combined used at all? I guess no, cause now it is believed that, even with one run of Slalom, the technical skiers have an advantage, therefore is bigger with two run of Slalom.  I'm also one of the guys, who contribute to the 2016 Alpine Skiing World Cup Wikipedia page, and in the Men's section I see that there are two Alpine Combined events, and only the third one is marked as Super Combined. I guess they are all Super Combined and this is a little bit unclear. I want to fix it, but I want to be sure about it. Thanks! "
6,Is the quarterback allowed to make an underhand throw in the NFL?,"Is the quarterback allowed to make an underhand throw in the NFL? If so, if the pass is incomplete is the play dead? "
7,Should Jorgensen have been sent off for his DOGSO foul in Croatia-Denmark (2018 FIFA World Cup)?,"I am of course referring to the foul that occurred at the 113th minute of the round of 16 match between Croatia and Denmark, when Rebić would have scored an easy goal had he not been fouled in the box by Jorgensen:    As we know, a penalty kick was awarded but Jorgensen was only cautioned. Everyone seemed to agree with this decision, on the basis that Jorgensen did try to play the ball. And trust me, I believe this. The following image makes it clear that Jorgensen was attempting to play the ball:     Yet the point I'm trying to make is different. Is the fact Jorgensen was trying to get the ball enough to downgrade the red card to a simple yellow card in this case? People who agree with the referee's decision end up quoting this part of the 2018/19 Laws of the Game (Law 12, p. 108):     Where a player commits an offence against an opponent within their own penalty area which denies an opponent an obvious goal-scoring opportunity and the referee awards a penalty kick, the offender is cautioned if the offence was an attempt to play the ball; in all other circumstances (e.g. holding, pulling, pushing, no possibility to play the ball etc.) the offending player must be sent off.   But read it carefully: this paragraph is only referring to situations where an obvious goal-scoring opportunity is denied. To see why this is important, let's have a look at what the rulebook says just one page earlier:     A player, substitute or substituted player who commits any of the following offences is sent off: (...) denying a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity to an opponent whose overall movement is towards the offender’s goal by an offence punishable by a free kick (unless as outlined below)   As you can see, the rule is actually about two distinct situations: denying a goal OR an obvious goal-scoring opportunity. It is also clear that 'denying a goal' doesn't only occur when a player deliberately handles the ball on the goal line, because   this paragraph is specifically about offences committed against an opposing player, and the situation where the ball is deliberately handled is already discussed in the previous bullet point, and again the Law makes a difference between denying a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity (""denying the opposing team a goal or an obvious goal-scoring opportunity by deliberately handling the ball"").   Now, as the first image clearly shows (and as everyone who has watched the match knows), the goal was empty (the goalkeeper, Schmeichel, was almost outside the penalty area): a tap-in would have been enough for Rebić to score a goal. And seeing how the Laws of the Game do make a distinction between    fouling an opponent and denying a goal, or fouling an opponent and denying an obvious goal-scoring opportunity...   ...well, then it looks to me that this is the clearest example of what 'denying a goal by fouling an opponent' should be.  So, why did the referee apply that special provision of Law 12 that allowed him to only give a yellow card to Jorgensen, when this exception is only valid in situations when an obvious goal-scoring opportunity is denied?  After all, that paragraph was added to Law 12 because a penalty kick effectively restores the goal-scoring opportunity that was lost, so sending off the offending player would have been too much (Law 12 FAQ #9): indeed, the chance of scoring on a penalty kick is roughly 80%, which is more or less the same chance of scoring that an attacking player has when facing only the goalkeeper during open play. But in this situation, the chance of scoring was easily 99%: the penalty kick does NOT fully make up for the previous situation, and this is why I think the Laws of the Game make a distinction between the two cases.  So, was cautioning Jorgensen a mistake under the current Laws of the Game? Or are there any other official rules/interpretations that justify a yellow card and that I'm unaware of? "
8,Who comes out of the penalty box after goal?," Suppose that Team 1 has players Adam and Bob. Adam takes a double minor penalty, and during the powerplay, Bob takes a 2 minute minor. Then, on the 5-on-3 powerplay, Team 2 scores a goal. Assuming that Adam still has more than 2 minutes left on his penalty, does Bob come out of the box, moving to a 5-on-4 powerplay for the duration of Adam's penalty, or does Adam's penalty time get reduced to 2 minutes, and the 5-on-3 continues? Suppose that Team 1 has players Adam, Bob, and Chuck. Adams takes a 2 minute minor, then Bob takes a 2 minute minor during that penalty, and then during the 5-on-3, Chuck takes another 2 minute minor. Now, I believe that it's the case that Team 1 plays 5-on-3, but Chuck's penalty time doesn't start until Adam's is finished. Also, assuming that there's no stoppage in play, when Adam's time is finished, he doesn't immediately exit the box. However, if Bob's penalty time also finishes before a stoppage in play, then Adam comes out of the box to bring Team 1 to 5-on-4? Furthermore, if there is still no stoppage in play, and Chuck's penalty time finishes, then Bob comes out of the box putting both teams at even strength, and then Chuck comes out at the next stoppage in play? Also, how might things change if Adam or Bob had a major penalty? Suppose that we have Adam and Bob on Team 1 and Zack on Team 2. Adam and Zack take offsetting 2 minute minors, and while play is 4-on-4, Bob takes a penalty, but Team 2 scores before Team 1 can touch the puck. Does Adam come out of the box and Bob goes in, with 4-on-4 continuing until Zack comes out of the box, or does Adam stay in the box, and Bob doesn't go to the box?  "
9,Has a golf hole ever gone an entire round in a full-field event without any score worse than par?,I noticed when watching the 2018 PGA Championship that the short par 3 3rd hole had 20 birdies and 25 pars so far during the day's play.  And that got me to wondering... has a field ever gone perfect for a round in a tournament?  And/or what's the longest streak of par or better for the field? 
10,Can you choose to play a fault serve in racquetball?,"Scenario: My opponent serves the ball short, but I'm in a good position to return it.   Does a fault serve automatically end the rally? Or can I choose to return the serve and continue the rally? "
11,Is chalking a snooker/pool stick a recent habit?,"I was watching this video from 1987, so I wonder if chalking the stick is a recent discovery that they didn't know about back then? Jimmy  is drinking beer and frustrated but John is shooting very good shots and I didn't see him chalk once (I don't know anything about snooker but his shots seem good to me)   "
12,Can an athlete with double nationality beat two country records at the same time?,"There is a tweet about the recent European Athletics Championship in Berlin, 2018:     U20 World Record   Swedish National Record   American Record   #2 World Outdoor Mark All-Time   #4 World Indoor/Outdoor Mark All-Time      FloTrack, 13 Aug 2018   It links to the news Mondo Duplantis Vaults 6.05m To Win European Championship and talks about the case of Armand ""Mondo"" Duplantis, who is both Swedish and American. Apparently, his 6.05 in pole vault is a record in both the USA and Sweden.  There are a lot of comments asking whether this is true or not, so is there any official source that confirm or deny this? Would this be the case for any other athlete with multiple nationalities? "
13,Why do coaches reveal the actual formation of their squad in association football?,"Commonly, before a broadcast football game you will see the positions of each team's players on the field. Now since this can't be enforced as a rule, wouldn't it be strategically benificial that coaches lie about who's playing where ? Although the names of the players composing the squad are verifiable, their actual positions aren't. Does this ever happen ?  Typical pre-match TV display "
14,What will be the Davis Cup format from 2019?,"Currently, the Davis Cup consists in a series of heats throughout the year (on February, March, May and November, if I recall properly), each one where the winner needs to get three matches to make it to the next round. The location of the matches is the country of one of the countries in the heat.  However, on August 16, 2018, the International Tennis Federation approved a modification of the format of the Davis Cup. Instead of what I described above, there seem to be a kind of Final Four, consisting on a week of matches in a Round-robin system, to get into a final.  In A new era for international tennis as Davis Cup gets extreme makeover I see some descriptions about the system:     24 nations will compete in a home-or-away qualifying round in February, with the 12 winners advancing to the final tournament. They will be joined by the four semifinalists from the previous year, along with two wild-card teams, who need to be in either the top 50 of the Davis Cup rankings or have a top-10 singles player to be eligible.      The finalists will be placed into six, three-team groups for round-robin play, involving two singles matches and one doubles, all best-of-three-sets — instead of the current best-of-five format featuring four singles matches and one doubles. The winners, along with the next two teams with the best records, will advance to the single-elimination quarterfinals.   Still, I have some questions about it:   How will those 24 countries selected? What will the format be exactly? Will the results count towards the ATP ranking? (Since they 2016 do not) How will the hosting country be elected? Are there plans to extend this into the Fed Cup for women?  "

16,"Why do few teams use ""hybrid"" starters other than the Tampa Bay Rays?","The Tampa Bay Rays traded Chris Archer for pitcher Tyler Glasnow (and two other prospects).  The Rays have then ""started"" Glasnow in four games, for 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, and 6.2 innings, respectively. He is regarded as a powerful hurler with a good strikeout rate, but more of a long reliever than a true starter. Yet the Rays have used him in a ""hybrid"" role, with the hope of eventually developing a starter. In two of these games, other starters, Jake Faria, and Ryan Yarborough ""relieved"" Glasnow, and picked upt the wins.  The Pirates actually had three potential starters of this type: Glasnow, Chad Kuhl (now injured), and Steve Brault? Why not have a ""fifth starter by committee"" e.g. have Glasnow, Kuhl and Brault start on the 5th, 10th, and 15th day of a cycle, with the other two as backups during those games?  The Pirates are actually fairly good at turning long relievers into starters. Jos Musgrove, acquired in exchange from the Astros for Gerrit Cole is a case in point, and in an earlier era, James McDonald. But for whatever reason, they did not do so with Glasnow using a ""piecemeal"" approach, and the Tampa Bay Rays did.  What might Tampa Bay do this, not others, including the Pittsburgh Pirates? "
17,Where do I find the most updated NBA rulebook?,"What is the official link of the most updated NBA rulebook?  I connected to a section of the NBA website and it does contain a link for the NBA rulebook, but that link redirects to the ""Media"" seciton of the NBA website, which is reserved for journalists and media covering the NBA.  Is the rulebook accessible only to the media? If so, why? "
18,What do people with red flags signify?,"Watching the Montreal triathlon there's something bugging me    What do people with red flags signify? They seem to be part of the organisation since they are peppered throughout the course and being from Montreal, I don't remember any recent cause that could manifest itself through a red flag.  So what do they do? "
19,"Is is feasible to walk/run an average of 90,000 steps a day?","I use the Samsung S-Health app which has a global step challenge with a public leaderboard. To complete the challenge, you need to walk 200,000 steps in the month.  Looking over the leaderboard though, there are some people with ridiculously high step counts:    Fifth place has ~2.5 million steps. 2.5 million / 27 (days so far) = ~92593 steps/day!  As someone who walks ~8k steps a day, and has a record count of 40k steps in one day, 90k steps a day on average seems impossibly high. I filed a report to Samsung noting how the counts seem suspicious, and they replied, assuring me that they take cheating seriously and that the leaderboard is legitimate.  Is it remotely feasible to walk more than 90,000 steps a day, every day for a month? Is this something that someone may do in the course of training or some running sport? "
20,"What happens if a team returns a blocked extra point a long way, but not all the way to the end zone?","Suppose a team blocks an extra point. I realize that if the defense returns the ball to the end zone, it counts as a two-point score. However, what if the defense returns the ball to, say, the opposing 20-yard line? Is that the usual kickoff, or does the defense have the option to keep the ball at the 20?  I suspect that they don't, but I can't find any place that spells out the rule. "
21,Returning a blocked extra point for a score: who kicks off to whom?,"Suppose an extra point gets blocked, and the defense returns it for two points. Who kicks off to whom? The defense who just scored the two points, or the offense who scored the TD? "
22,Do goalkeepers return faster than field players from injury in football?,"Goalkeepers in football are of course not as physically active as the field players.   I was wondering whether this means that goalkeepers are allowed to return from an injury earlier than field players?  For example, imagine if Ronaldo and Buffon get the exact same ACL tear at the same time and go through the same sort of recovery phase... will Buffon be allowed back onto the pitch earlier than Ronaldo?   Or are all players more or less forced to wait until they are healed properly, regardless of whether they are field players or goakeepers? "
23,Multiple yellow cards at a single free kick for encroachment,Is it acceptable (or even permissible) to award more than one yellow card to encroaching players on a free kick?  My memory from 15 years ago is that we were told only the first encroaching player gets the card. Are there circumstances where multiple cards would be appropriate? 
24,Why did/do F1 racing teams wear face masks?,"I've seen this clip on Youtube here, were the box crew of Ferrari are shown all wearing protective face masks. The clip is from 1998 and I don't know if this is still the case.  I'm wondering why they do that. Surely it's not to stay anonymous, is it? "
25,"Can a batsman be out hit wicket on a no ball, and do runs scored count?","A no ball is bowled. The striker hits the ball, but in doing so accidentally puts down their wicket. Will the runs be considered or not? And will be the striker be out hit wicket or not? "
26,Why does the Australian soccer team compete in the Asian qualifiers for the World Cup?,"Today, the Australian soccer team plays a match against Saudi-Arabia in the qualification rounds for the World Cup. Qualifications for the World Cup are usually organized per continent; e.g. Europe (the UEFA) has its own tournament where only European countries compete. Presumably, Australia joined the Asian Football Confederation and since then competes in the Asian qualifiers, but why did they make this move? I can think of a few reasons:   Better chance of qualification (Australia's home continent, Oceania, has only 'half a place' in the World Cup, the winner of the qualifiers needs to win another play-off against another country) Better opposition during the qualification (this is actually mentioned on Wikipedia, but you can also play friendly matches against better teams) They expected more income (tickets sold, TV broadcasting rights)   Are there any references for these possible reasons, and what was/were the decisive one(s)? "
27,"What is the history of the term ""Alley-Oop""?","I realized I've been using the term for years but never realized that taken literally, it makes no sense.   ""Alley"" - other than the word alley, I have no idea what this could refer to.  ""oop"" - most likely a shortened version of hoop?  Is it a shortened version of another phrase? "
28,Why were Italy allowed to run offside in their Six Nations match with England?,"Observed in this video here, Italy were repeatedly allowed to pass the offside line and enter England's backfield. Rarely does a team do this in any other game, even if it is a ""tackle-only"" as the referee repeatedly calls out.  What rules allow Italy to do this?  As a side note, the referee states that there is a one metre offside line around the ruck. What rules cover this, and why is this restriction in place? "
29,Who will qualify for semi-final?,"I wonder which team will qualify if following scenario happen?

30,Hand setting a hard driven ball (beach volleyball),"In FIVB Offical Beach Volleyball Rules 2017-2020, which rule allows for a double contact while using an overhand finger action on a hard driven ball?  I see an exception for Extended contacts:     9.2.2.4 Extended contacts: In defensive action of a hard driven ball, the ball contact can be extended momentarily even if an overhand   finger action is used.     The only information I found supporting the double contact was from the 2015 Beach Volleyball Rules Casebook, case 5.3.11 (5.20)  Question     5.3.11 (5.20) Is it allowed to play a ball as a hard driven ball (i.e. by momentary extended contact with hands) if the ball is coming from   the opponent’s block? Ruling   Answer (emphasis mine)     Yes. This is legal if satisfying the requirements of a hard driven   ball defence. The ball rebounding or being deflected off the block is   considered as an attack hit and in this case the ball may be caught   momentarily with hands. It may also be double contacted with fingers.   Rule 9.2.2.1  "
31,Squash: Is there a 'correct' flow to a game?,"I see pro squash players, in a match, making many repetitive shots along the side wall, cycling in and out of position. At times, it almost looks like they're doing a drill, not actually trying to win the point. In my own games with my longtime partner, I frequently try to win a point with a kill shot off his serve, or otherwise try to win the point as quickly as possible. Our rallies often last only a few shots.  I guess my question is almost about the philosophy of the game. If elite players (not me!!) are capable of making a well-placed drop shot and ending the rally, why don't they? Or is their opponent's shot so difficult that they are only able to barely make a return shot? "
32,"In little league, can an umpire change their ruling based on advice from coaching staff?","In a little league championship game, there have been two outs, with a man on second. The batter hits a home run. The batter runs bases and gets home, but the outfield team notice that he didn't step on third base.   The coaches instruct the pitcher to go back to mound and throw to his third baseman, who tags the base. The umpire then calls the runner out. As a result, the home run doesn't count and this is the third out.   While the other team is celebrating, the team in the outfield leaves the field. The coaches of the team that just hit the home run start questioning what happened. After the umpire explains to them why the batter is out, the coaches start verbally disputing the decision.   After a long discussion with both team coaches, the umpire decides to change his call and allows the home run to count. This is in spite of one of the outfield coaches openly admitting that the player missed third base.   Is there any basis in the rules for the call being changed, or was the original call correct?  Even if the original call was incorrect, is the umpire permitted to change it at this stage once the outfield team has left the field?  Should umpires in little league be making decisions based on input from coaches from either or both teams? "
33,Intentionally being struck with batted ball to prevent a double play,"Situation as follows:  Runners on first and second, zero or one out. Ground Ball is hit to the shortstop. The runner on second intentionally slides into or kicks the ball, getting himself out, so that the shortstop cannot turn a double play.  Is this legal? Or would the umpire declare the runner at second out as well, a la the new interference at second play. If legal, has this ever happened? "
34,Why does the fastest racer typically start at the front of the grid?,"I've followed racing (cars and bikes) for years, and taken it for granted that the fastest qualifier would take pole position and start at the front of the grid.  A friend asked me why that is, because he thought it gave an additional unfair advantage to drivers that are already proven faster.  I realized I could speculate as to why (e.g. less frivolous passing makes the race safer, faster drivers are not bogged down and forced to lose by being made to pass many times in a limited-time race, simply a merit-based system, etc) but didn't have a concrete answer.  Friend asked why the fastest riders aren't placed at the back of the grid to force them to prove their merit.  Easy answer is, everyone would sandbag the crap out of qualifying, no one would give their best because they'd want to be closer to the front.  Friend asked why the grid isn't just randomized.  My answer is that it removes all merit from the process, as well as the other safety-related item mentioned above.  But I realized that's all my own speculation as to the ""why"" question.  So is it ""just the way it is,"" is it tradition, just a decision that was sort of arbitrarily made, or is there another reason why the fastest driver gets to be on the pole?  I'm aware that there are systems where the fastest qualifier isn't just given the pole, but for the purposes of this question, I'm asking what are the reasons (if any are known) that many high profile racing leagues/series place the fastest driver on pole? "

36,"Can the non striking batsman be out if he blocks the field, having been injured","Situation in a match was, the striking batsman hit the ball. It immediately hit the non striker, whilst the non striker was a few yards outside his crease. The ball fell to the floor, the non striker doubled up in pain, and the bowler picked up the ball and ran out the non-striker.   Was the ball dead after it hit the non-striker? If not, would the ball have been dead if the non-striker had fallen to the ground, or was otherwise clearly unable to continue? Had he fallen to the ground on top of the ball and blocked the fielder, could he have been out obstructing the field?  "

38,Are there statistics on whether finishing with a positive result has subsequent effect?,"Watching golf today, the commentators were emphasizing that finishing with a good 18th hole was critical towards the next day's play.  Got me wondering if there's any statistical evidence of that?  Whether it's a basketball player finishing with good points, a golfer finishing with birdie(s), a batter finishing with a hit (or pitcher with a strikeout), whatever... is there any data to show what happens?      I could also imagine a player coming off a previous roll to end a round/game/match... coming back and having a letdown snowball because an early stumble feels worse given the heavier euphoria coming into the day.    Seems like a lot of these sports clichéd beliefs end up being hard to quantify or blatantly disproven, but wonder if this one is any different? "
39,Why do incoming batsmen always mark the off-stump line?,"In cricket, I have often seen that incoming batsmen come in and mark the off-stump line with assistance from the non-striker. This is done by holding the bat in line with the stump till aligned, then scratching a line in the pitch with their shoes. It makes sense when done by openers, but I have often seen batsmen coming in at number 7 or 8 and performing this ritual before facing the first ball on that end of the pitch.   Why do incoming batsmen mark their line even if they come in lower down the order? Shouldn't the line marked by the previous batsmen be enough? "
40,Wording in MLB slide rule,"Forgive me if this question is rather obtuse, but it's been eating away at me, and I figured this was the place to go for help.  The last paragraph of the rule concerning sliding to bases on double play attempts reads:  ""If the umpire determines that the runner violated this Rule 6.01(j), the umpire shall declare both the runner and batter-runner out. Note, however, that if the runner has already been put out then the runner on whom the defense was attempting to make a play shall be declared out.""  I'm asking the meaning as to the last sentence (the ""note, however"" part). Does it, in rare cases, make another runner out in place of the batter-runner? I just don't understand it. I'll elaborate.  Does it concern, say, an offensive player sliding into third base who interferes with the fielder after being put out, with that fielder's subsequent throw going to second base to attempt to force out a runner going there? Is the player running toward second base out, instead of the batter-runner, since this was ""the runner on whom the defense was attempting to make a play"" on? Assume that the bases are loaded and the double play attempt is a put out at third followed by a throw to second, rather than your standard DP. Am I in the right ballpark, so to speak? This example isn't great, but it's nearly 2am here and it was the best I could do.  I understand the application of this rule mainly concerns cut and dry double play attempts at second, where the runner who was at first crashes into the shortstop or second baseman in order to break up the throw to first that would put out the batter-runner. But does that last sentence of the rule in some cases exempt the batter-runner from being automatically out, like in the case I presented above? Or is the batter-runner always out? Any help would be most welcome. Thanks guys. I'm thinking I'm right, but I could just as easily be misunderstanding the wording. I've only recently become interested in the rules and just want to understand them fully. "

42,Why did match referee award the 1996 Cricket World Cup Semifinal to Sri Lanka 'by default?'',I have wondered for 20 years on what basis the great Clive Lloyd as match referee awarded the 1996 Cricket World Cup Semifinal to Sri Lanka 'by default' when crowd violence ended the game with India at around 130/8 chasing 250 odd runs: Duckworth-Lewis Method had not yet been adopted by ICC and in any case the rain rule was not supposed to be applied to matches stopped by any reason other than bad weather (I think) -- so I cannot assume that Sri Lanka was awarded the match due to any calculation that they were statistically 'ahead' and therefore more likely to win.   What was the specific regulation followed by the match referee in awarding the match to Sri Lanka 'by default?'  It seems the officially recorded result of the match (mode of Sri Lanka's victory) has been since changed -- what is the official result now? 
43,Can a basketball player refuse to be chosen in a particular team?,"Is it possible that during the annual draft a basketball player do not accept the proposal from the team? I mean, e.g. if during draft 2017 there are more teams that would like to choose Markelle Fultz but he would like to play only for Suns is it possible that he refuse any team to be free when Suns has its choose? "
44,How frequent is high sticking in Ice Hockey?,Are there any statistics for how frequently a specific penalty occurs in Ice Hockey? (any League?) I am specifically interested in high sticks. 
45,NBA Draft - Are there any restrictions on signing an undrafted player?,"If a played goes undrafted, are there any restrictions on where he can sign?  Can any team sign him without penalty?  Example scenario:     Lonzo Ball wants to sign with the Golden State Warriors But Golden State doesn't have any picks Before the draft Ball makes clear that he will not sign with other teams The General Managers each decide that they don't need the trouble, and nobody selects him   After the Draft, can Golden State sign him?  Are there any restrictions/penalties to prevent players or teams from doing this? "
46,Do they use a specific organ to play baseball tunes live in the stadium?,What is the organ that is used to play baseball tunes live in the stadium called? Is there a common brand or model that they prefer for that? 
47,What is the scientific consensus of wearing ankle tapes and braces to prevent injuries in team sports?,The literature recommends different best practices. Some may say the best injury prevention methods are wearing tapes or braces. Other professionals are keep saying that the best way to prevent injuries is rehab.  What is the scientific consensus? Do professional players wear ankle braces anyway? 
48,Calculations of bat speed and pace of a delivery,"I have two questions:   How is the bat speed of batsmen calculated?  (I believe it is from change in position of bat in each frame divided by time) Does the nature of the pitch affect the pace of a bowler? (I know that ball behaves differently on different pitches after hitting the deck)  Generally the pace is calculated as distance taken by the ball till pitching or hitting the bat divided by the time taken; as the speed is calculated before the ball pitches the ground, Will the nature of the pitch/ground/soil play any significant role in the pace of a delivery?  "
49,Learning ski jumping,"Since visiting Calgary Olympic Park and seeing their exhibit on ski jumping within the ski jumping tower, I've wanted to have a go at the sport.  Do you have to be good at downhill skiing to start ski jumping as an adult? If so, which aspects of it are important?  Also, is it a sport where you can practice each day during a week-long vacation, or is it too intensive a sport on the body for that to be viable? "
50,Achieving the optimal strike in squash: Is the wrist involved at all?,"I am a sports enthusiast who has tried out many ball sports through-out my life with years of training in football (read: ""soccer"" if you are American) and basketball, as well as many hours of experience/play time in tennis and table tennis, although no formal training.   Several years back I decided to give a shot to squash with a friend, both never even watched a game at that point. By reading and watching and asking, I got to a level where I think I know the basics of the game. Since I am familiar with ball sports, I don't find it hard to follow the ball or use the walls/bounces to my best advantage. However I don't think I have the best technique.  So, the question; when I watch videos of pros or the people who compete in my town, I realize that they use the wrist to create a whip effect, or at least that's my interpretation of it. I believe I tend to be more stale in an effort to keep the racket in balance when striking the ball. I am not sure if I'd be able to deliver much power if ended up hitting the ball with a wrist-powered shot, compared to a whole-arm strike which puts much of the strain on the shoulders and the chest. Am I doing something wrong? Is it common practice to use the wrist in squash? Could it be so that my racket is simply too heavy for me (alt. I am not strong enough in my wrist to deliver proper shots with my racket?)  Thanks for any tips! "
51,"In college sports, why is permission needed to recruit other coaches?",It seems a big deal is made about athletic directors getting permission before recruiting other schools' coaches. Is this based on some rule or is it more of a professional courtesy? And under what conditions can permission be denied? 
52,Why are 5 runs awarded if the ball hits the helmet?,"Why are 5 runs awarded if the ball hits the helmet behind the wicket-keeper? Is it mandatory to keep helmet in ground? To avoid 5 extra runs, can fielding team  keep the helmet outside the ground? "
53,How are the number of laps in an F1 race determined?,"The number of laps in a F1 race seem to differ wildly. Obviously the length of each lap varies from circuit to circuit, but how are the number of laps for each race decided?  Additionally, is this number chosen by the owners of the race track, or something decided by the FIA/ teams? "
54,What does it take to earn the International Certificate of Competence?,"What does it take to pass the ICC? Must you be willing to sail through the Mediterranean or hold a skipper license?      An International Certificate of Competence (ICC) is a certificate   which may be issued to anyone who has successfully completed certain   national boating licenses or has successfully passed an examination to   prove the necessary competence for pleasure craft operation.       In very   general terms an ICC is required for the inland waterways of Europe   and for inland and coastal waters of Mediterranean countries. For the   coastal waters of Northern Europe the ICC is generally not required,   however to all of these generalisations there are exceptions.  "
55,Has the Olympic host nation ever been changed after it was announced,The stability of Brazil makes me wonder what will happen in 2016 if Brazil is not in a position to play host to the games.  Has this ever happened before?  Are there contingency plans for such an event? 
56,Can referees change their decision?,"Let's imagine an ideal situation:   A player scores a goal Before scoring, they deliberately handle the ball None of the referees notice the foul The referee validates the goal The scorer admits (before restarting game) to referee they committed a foul before scoring   My question is: what should the referee do in this case? Should they care about what the scorer said, change their mind and so changing their decision? Are there rules about this situation?  EDIT:  I'll make an example to explain better:  In the match Ac Milan - Juventus:     Massimiliano Allegri’s men were in the ascendancy, and should have been 2-0 up after 25 minutes, but for a controversial incident which saw a legitimate goal not given.      Buffon initially did well to parry a header by Philippe Mexes from a corner, but hooked out Sulley Muntari’s rebound with the ball clearly over the line, sparking Milan celebrations. However, referee Paolo Tagliavento did not signal, and play continued.   After the game, Buffon declared that he didn't notice the goal, but even if he had noticed it he wouldn't have admitted to the referee.   So my question: would have made any difference if Buffon had seen and had explained to the referee the situation? I mean, if someone tries to be honest/fair the referee wouldn't care at all? "
57,What players have the highest vertical reach,"What players currently playing in the NBA (2011-12) have the highest measured vertical reach?  And what players historically have had the highest vertical reach?  I find lots of rumours on the net, but is there a definitive source? "
58,Are there any rules regarding the position of the Wicket Keeper?,After watching an IPL match I had this doubt. In the match the wicket keeper stood close to the 30 yard circle and the umpire Simon Tauffel came up to the wicket keeper and asked him to move forward.   My question is:  Are there any rules regarding the position of wicket keeper? If yes what are they? 
59,What are characteristics of shoes needed specifically for table tennis?,I've been playing at the recreation center more often and see some of the more intense players buying table tennis shoes. Are there any advantages of utilizing table tennis shoes over regular tennis shoes?   What are characteristics one would look for in shoes specifically for table tennis ? 
60,"In the history of Formula 1, when has the fastest qualifier not started the race on pole?","Lewis Hamilton has a 5 place grid penalty for the Chinese Grand Prix this weekend, due to having to change his gearbox.  Harsh, but that's the rule.  He's been on pole for the first two races this season so has a good chance of making it three, if it weren't for the penalty.  My question is, when was the last time that the fastest qualifier didn't start on pole, due to a penalty or some other situation?  I don't think it's ever happened before due to a penalty but am not sure, hence the question.  When was the last time the pole-sitter didn't start the race on pole?  This has definitely happened due to mechanical problems or spinning off the track on the formation lap in the wet, San Marino springs to mind but I can't remember the year or who it was.  There is a reason for the question - the Fantasy F1 game I run gives the pole-sitter bonus points but I am not sure what to do in this kind of situation! "
61,What do all the climber-specific terms and slang mean?,"I've been hearing a lot of words thrown around by climbers like ""crimper"", ""gaston"", ""flag out"", ""whipper"", ""flapper"", and others.  What do these and the rest even mean?  Could someone compile a list of these definitions? "
62,What's the reasoning behind the Uncaught Third Strike Rule?,"In MLB, if a Catcher drops or misses the third pitched strike, the batter becomes a runner and can attempt to reach first base before tagged out or forced out at first.     6.09 The batter becomes a runner when -- (a) He hits a fair ball; (b) The third strike called by the umpire is not caught, providing (1)   first base is unoccupied, or (2) first base is occupied with two out;   -- Official MLB Rules   What is the reasoning behind this rule? Why does it only happen if first base is unoccupied, and what's with that crazy extra exception of two outs?  "
63,Is taking a step before dribbling the ball a travel?,"I've recently started playing basketball and was wondering about some of the comments made about this (pretty cool) NBA commercial featuring LeBron James. It looks like he takes 1 step after receiving the ball before dribbling it, is that considered to be a travel? I doubt the NBA would make a commercial showing a blatant violation so I'm assuming it's valid but want to know what the exact rule is. "
64,What happens if a ball is lost in cricket?,What will happen if a ball in play is lost or cannot be recovered? Does batting side keep any penalty for that? 
65,What's the justification for this rarely-invoked NFL fumble rule?,"Yesterday, at the end of the Packers-Bills game (2014 Week 15), Rodgers fumbled into his own endzone. Eddie Lacy recovered it, but was unable to fight his way out, resulting in a game-winning safety.  The TV coverage pointed out an interesting wrinkle: even if he had made it out, it still would have been considered a safety, due to this section of the NFL's fumble rule:     If any player fumbles after the two-minute warning in a half, only the   fumbling player is permitted to recover and/or advance the ball. If   recovered by any other offensive player, the ball is dead at the spot   of the fumble unless it is recovered behind the spot of the fumble. In   that case, the ball is dead at the spot of recovery. Any defensive   player may recover and/or advance any fumble at any time.   It seems to be little-known enough that Lacy himself didn't know it, since his recovery of the ball was what ended the play and sealed the game. Only Rodgers could have run it out of the endzone to avoid the loss. Of course, in the actual game, the outcome was inevitable, because Rodgers had no idea where the ball was.  My guess is that this rule exists to discourage ""intentional fumbling"" in desperate situations. Is that right? Does anyone know when it was added, and whether the league ever had an ""intentional fumbling"" problem? "
66,What is the legal basis for fining players for out-of-game actions?,"How is it that sports leagues are able to fine players for things like expressing their displeasure with the league or its employees, or wearing the wrong clothes? There must be some sort of special employee-employer thing going on, because I can't imagine any employer I've ever had being legally able to fine me for legally protected speech. Is this something the unions agree to on collective bargaining? Is there standard boiler-plate language in every contract?  Update: I'm referring to the US-based leagues (MLB, NHL, NBA, NFL, MLS, WNBA) since they operate under US law. Leagues based in other countries may operate under different legal regimes and therefore may have different ways of doing things. "
67,What is the Spider 2 Y Banana?,"In a Jon Gruden interview on ESPN, he calls a play Spider 2 Y Banana.  I have no idea what to make of this. What do the words even reference, and what do they mean? "
68,How are points in the ATP/WTA ranking computed in case tournament final is delayed (and finished during the following week)?,"It happens quite often that a tennis tournament is not finished on Sunday. Due to weather or other reason. A few examples (I wanted to include various leves - Grand Slam, ATP Tour, ATP Challenger Tour; I have no doubt that many other examples can be found):   In 2012 US Open the final match between Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic was played on Monday, September 10.. At 2012 Internazionali BNL d'Italia the men's final was played on Monday. The final of 2013 Traralgon Challenger was suspended on Sunday and finished on Monday. See here or here.   Basically my question is:     How are the rankings calculated when some event has not been finished on Sunday? Will they be published as scheduled, or only after the event is finished? Are the rules different for events of different levels (Grand Slams, Masters, ATP Tour, Challengers)1?   The solutions which I could imagine could be:    Delaying publishing new rankings.   Not dropping the last year's points for the players still active in the tournament.   Dropping the last year's points for the players still active in the tournament, but counting the points which they already have from the current edition. (I.e., if the final is finished after publishing the new rankings, the finalist would both have points for the final, in the following edition the winner would get more points.)     1I am aware of the fact that this is a non-issue for futures, since the points for futures tournamets are counted with one week delay anyway. According to 2014 ATP Rulebook, Chapter IX. Emirates ATP Rankings: The Emirates ATP Rankings or Emirates ATP Doubles Rankings period is the immediate past 52 weeks, except for: a) Barclays ATP World Tour Finals, singles and doubles, which is dropped on the Monday following the last ATP World Tour event of the following year. b) Futures Series tournaments that are only entered into the system on the second Monday following the tournament’s week.

69,What is the longest an NFL team has gone without a WR TD catch?,"The Kansas City Chiefs have not had a wide receiver catch a touchdown pass so far this season (through Week 15).  According to team stats, only running backs, fullbacks, and tight ends have caught a TD pass so far this season.  According to the NFL_Stats twitter account, the Chiefs haven't had a WR catch a TD pass since December 8, 2013:     The #Chiefs have not had a WR catch a TD pass since December 8th, 2013   That is 17 straight regular season games without a WR catching a TD pass (the Chiefs did have a WR catch a TD pass in their playoff game last season).  A December 19 article on Steelers.com confirms this:     A Chiefs wide receiver hasn’t caught a touchdown pass in 17 straight games, since Dwayne Bowe on Dec. 8, 2013 at Washington.   Has an NFL team ever gone an entire season without a wide receiver catching a touchdown pass?  What is the longest streak of games an NFL team has gone without a wide receiver catching a touchdown pass? "
70,What is the closest any team has come to playing a home Super Bowl?,"It's a well known fact that no team whose home stadium is hosting the Super Bowl has ever made it to the Super Bowl. My question is, which team has come the closest? (Closest in this case means how far they got in the playoffs.) Some Wikipedia trawling led me to the 1978 Super Bowl, played in Miami. The Dolphins made the playoffs that year, but they lost in the first round. Has any team ever gotten closer? "
71,What other materials besides plastic can be used to produce PDGA discs?,"I know that the majority of companies use various blends of plastic, and Vibram is the only one who uses rubber (as far as I'm aware). Is there anything in writing from the PDGA that prohibits certain materials from being used in disc manufacturing? (Metals, cloth, wood, for example.)  I understand that the PDGA tests each disc before approving them for tournament play, and each disc needs to pass tests regarding flexibility, but if a disc manufacturer could pass those tests with metal or wood, would they be PDGA approved? "
72,"What is a ""football move"" in the NFL?","It happens a lot: a receiver catches the ball, drops it, it is called a fumble on the field. Then there is some expert commentator giving his opinion on whether the receiver made a 'football move' after catching the ball.  It came up with Texans v Colts this year. Johnson's drop was called a fumble, a talking head confidently stated it would be reversed because Johnson clearly didn't have possession and make a football move. It was not reversed. This happens a lot.  Is this term 'football move' defined anywhere in the rule book? Are there explicit criteria to be applied? I looked in the online version and didn't find anything:  [website]"
73,Fielder tosses the ball after legitimate catch. What's the minimum time a fielder needs to hold the ball after the catch is taken?,"Sometimes in cricket a fielder immediately tosses the ball after legitimately catching it. Batsmen generally are out in such cases and I haven't yet seen anyone objecting to it. Is there a min requirement of time for the fielder to keep it in his/her hands? Also, What happens if the ball reaches/crosses boundary on such random throw ups in the air? "
74,Seattle Seahawks' Legion of Boom,"I've heard commentators and analysts refer to Seattle Seahawks' defense as the ""Legion of Boom"". I believe they call the secondary that name, to be exact. What is the story behind this? When and how did this name start to be used to describe the Seahawks' secondary? "
75,60-year old dad passes out after 1/2 an hour of badminton,"My dad is 60 years old. I have never played any kind of sports for 30 years.  However, he's working with geography and sometimes (maybe a week per month) he has to hike in the jungle as a part of his job.  Recently, a heart doctor prescribed medication for him. He now takes a heart pill every morning.    Today, he told me he wants to play badminton with me. This is the 1st time he played sports. So we played for 30 minutes. Then suddenly he felt tired and he sat down. Then, right at that time, I saw he fell asleep. I tried to call him but he didn't wake up. So I rushed out and call an ambulance, but my dad suddenly woke up.  He just passed out for 5 minutes. He told me that his doctor said he should do the walking exercise only.  My question is that ""Is badminton too much for 60-year old person?""  And ""What should I do now?""   Tell him to stop playing badminton Tell him to do the walking exercise only   I am very worried for him. I thought he could have a stroke. I thought since he took the heart pills everyday, that could help him recover. "
76,Pitchers as MVP,"Many argued, especially after Clayton Kershaw's amazing run this year that got him the NL MVP award, that pitchers should not be eligible for the MVP award as they don't even play most of the games. Here's the Wikipedia description of the award:      The Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) is an annual Major League Baseball (MLB) award, given to one outstanding player in the American League and one in the National League.    Not very descriptive -- one outstanding player? I'm finding trouble finding a more official definition of the way the winner of this award is determined and the two competing points of view on the pitcher-as-MVP theory. As a Kershaw fan, I find it hard to accept that pitchers should be ineligible for this award, but I'd like to know where this is heading, if anywhere. Are the members of the BBWAA contemplating about this and does such a change seem probable in the near future?  "
77,Why chasing team allowed to bat first in super over?,Super Over is the concept introduced in the T20 leagues to decide the winner of a tied game. It is basically a one over match with only two allowed wickets to the batting side. Why is it that the chasing team is allowed to bat first in super over?   Is there any specific reason or logic behind that rule? 
78,Can I place fielders wherever I want?,Can I place more than 2 midoffs or 3-4 silly points in cricket? I have seen no match with such fieldings? But there are no rules against it. 
79,Lateral Passes in the NFL,"Why are lateral passes so rare in the NFL?  I've seen quite a few situations in which it would seem advantageous.   For example in a 2v1, 2v2 setting when the ball carrier is about to be tackled, why not pass the football to another player who is wide open?  Is the risk of a fumble that high, even in a 3-10 yard pass? Or is it the risk of losing yards? "
80,Why is the cricket pitch made larger than 22 yards?,"Why is the pitch made larger than the playing area, which is 22 yards? The pitch is made an extra 122 cm past 22 yards for the return crease. After the return crease it is also extended to a green strip. Why is this green strip made and what's its use?  You can see pictures:-    "
81,Can i place slip in a wave like pattern?,Can i place slip in a wave like pattern? Can i place first slip ahead of keeper towards batsman instead of behind the keeper?  I have not seen these types of fieldings. 
82,Declining a delay-of-game penalty: what about an infinite loop?,"I was watching the Outback Bowl today when one team decided to punt from around its opponents 35 yard line. The coach decided to let the play clock expire to get a little extra room to kick after the penalty, and the commentators speculated that the coach on the defense might opt to decline the penalty, hoping to increase the likelihood of a punt into the endzone. The penalty was accepted.  Makes sense to me. But suppose a team takes a delay of game penalty and the defense declines the penalty. The play clock runs down again for another delay of game, which is again declined. Ad nauseum.  Is this even possible (forget likelihood)? If so, how would the referees get the game moving again? "
83,"On an onside kick, what happens when a return man signals fair catch and is obstructed from reaching the ball?","Team A is still down by two points with less than one minute remaining in the game and they are kicking off to team B after just scoring a touchdown. Team B realizes they are going to try an onside kick and at last minute brings their return man up right behind their first line of defense-men. As team A is kicking the ball, the return man raises his hand for a fair catch in accordance with Rule 10. As the ball is kicked sideways and the return man runs toward it, he is blocked both by his own men and players from the other team from reaching the ball.   And the question:  Would this be legal under the rules? Would the ref call some type of foul on either team? Is the return man entitled to a clear path to the ball under this scenario? And if not, please cite the rule.  Update: I'm intrigued by Michael's response; but not yet quite satisfied. Let's add another facet to the scenario. Let's say the wind is blowing hard when Team A is kicking off and they can't keep the ball on the tee and they opt to drop kick the ball as provided in the rules. So has the ball touched the ground and now the kick off receiver can't call a fair catch no matter where he is standing? And if that is the case; wouldn't be better for every team to drop kick the ball so they could run down and tackle the opposing return man? "
84,Shuttle getting stuck to the net after crossing,I've never seen this happen before but it happened twice in one game recently (by 2 different players!).  The shuttle hit the tape and went over the net but then got caught and never hit the ground.  None of us were sure what the rules said on this one. Does the shuttle have to hit the ground before anyone wins the point?  We played it as a let but I wondered what the official line was on this one.  Does it matter whether this happens during serve or mid rally? 
85,Why are the Argentinian and Brazilian Leagues split in two parts?,I remember playing championship manager way back in 99 and the Brazilian league was split into two different championships and I noticed that the league in Argentina is similar. They both have different names (Apertura and Claustura I think) and I was wondering what the reasoning behind this decision is? Are they considered separate to each other or does your final position in one affect your starting position in the second league? 
86,Are shoes mandatory while playing cricket?,"Are shoes mandatory while playing cricket? No doubt it will be difficult without shoes but I would like to know whether it is mandatory or not. Any idea?  Edit: Hundreds of rules are there in Cricket and I would like to know whether a player is allowed to play Cricket (in international level) without shoes or not. Is there a rule regarding this in ICC or MCC laws?  Edit: Here is my point. I used to play tennis ball cricket without shoes. Now a local tournament organizer wants every player in shoes. As I am not familiar, I have problems bowling with shoes. So, I need to file a complaint against this rule. That's why I need to know whether there is anything in ICC rules. "
87,Is it allowed to play a cricket match without positioning any fielder as a wicket keeper?,"In a cricket match , there are total 11 players which we called as playing eleven who will be there fielding and batting for a side.  There are different positions on which the fielders can be placed such as a gully,slip,third man etc.  In a standard cricket match we can remove fielder from slip and put him at the gully or anywhere else we want(of course within and according the ICC rules for fielding positions).     My question is can we remove a wicket keeper from his position leaving   his field blank(no one behind the stumps) and make him field at the   slip?      Is it required to have a wicket keeper behind the stumps every time?      Is there any rule?  "
88,Spin Clarification,"In comparing the bowling technique of Nathan Lyon and Graeme Swan, are both described as ""wrist"" spinners OR is Swan a ""finger"" spinner and Lyon a wrist spinner?   It seems to me that Lyon's delivery differs sufficiently from Swan's to suggest that he derives his turn (as Warn) from the the wrist?  If Lyon is a wrist spinner, does this mean that his off break is correctly termed as a ""wrongun""? "
89,How do I calculate the run rate in cricket?,"I know the run rate is calculated by dividing the number of runs scored by number of overs.  How do I calculate the run rate midway through an over? If say a team scores 223 runs in 43.5 overs, what would the run rate be? "
90,Why not go for a field goal attempt instead of a punt in some situations?,"I have noticed that in American football the ball seems to travel farther when launched from a tee on the ground, or from the fingers of a holder on the ground, than when launched from a punt.  What are the rules for if a field goal is not successful but the ball lands inside the field of play?  Then why don't teams use a field goal kicker to launch punts in that way? "
91,Bowled after scoring a run,"Today my colleague, a batsman hit a shot, a top edge which went high up, the wicket keeper and the bowler came for the catch, the batsman sneaked in a run, in the mean while both failed to catch the ball and the ball dropped in and since it a top edge, started to roll back in the direction of the stumps and ultimately hit the stumps.  We contended that the ball was dead once the run was completed, the bowling team countered that the ball had hit the stumps hence the batsman was out.  Is he out? what happens to the run completed?  "
92,Is a ball live if it bounces off the field goal and back into the field of play on a kickoff?,If a team kicks off and the kickoff hits the upright of the field goal (or any part of the field goal) and the ball bounces straight back into the field of play (never hitting the ground out of bounds). Is the ball live? Can the kicking team recover it? 
93,What kite-surfing equipment should I start with?,"To start with, find below some of my characteristics/equipement:   15 years of age 1.92 m / 6.3 ft 65 kg / 150 pounds I'm in, what I consider to be, reasonable physical condition Pretty good with trainer kite (3 m / 9.8 ft without bar)   Does this suffice for a beginner? What kind of equipment should I start with?  "
94,"If a batsman is bowled off a free hit, can he still score any runs?",I want to know about a cricket match result.  Last ball was no ball so next ball will be a free hit.   For no ball  SCORE is LEVEL. Now the batting side need 1 run from 1 ball. Bowler finishes his ball by hitting the leg stumps and both batsman on the crease go for a run and complete 1 run without getting out.  In this case the Batsman will be not out because it was a free hit.   But the ball hit the leg stump and then batsman completed 1 run.   It's a legal ball but also a free hit.  I think this match result will be tie because last ball hit the leg stump so no chance to run.  Is it? Am I right?  Who will win? Bowling side? Batting side? Or match tie? 
95,Is it Okay to Swim all seven days a week?,"I've been swimming on my own for about a year and am now training under a coach for about 2 months. Earlier I did not focus on swimming fast but now the coach measures the time taken to swim.  I swim all 7 days a week two days for about 2.5 hours and 1 hour the other days. Sometimes the day after the 2.5 hour swimming day, there is an ache on my shoulder but I still swim for an hour. The ache is not there when swimming but occasionally comes when lifting the arm.  My question is, is it okay to swim all seven days like this or should there be a rest in-between to recover? Will having a rest in-between improve my speed? "
96,What's the correct rule to serve in Badminton?,"I'm an ameture and don't know about all the rules in badminton. I was serving the backhand low service. But someone told me that I have to hit the shuttle when I totally release the shuttle. I debated with him that is totally impossible to serve if I don't release the shuttle totally.  Again he told me that I'm releasing the shuttle at last moment, not giving enough time to release the shuttle totally.  Now I want to know      Is there any rule that says that I have to give minimum x amount of   time to release the shuttle entirely before serving?       Or what is the minimum interval time to serve after realising the shuttle?   I was practicing like told in the Youtube tutorial and I'm pretty sure I was doing as much possible exactly like that. "
97,Why do most coaches save key defensive resources till the end of the game?,"This question could be asked of a number of sports, but the example I'm using comes from football.  Yesterday, during the wild card round, the New Orleans Saints called a time out early in the second quarter, to give their defense a chance to recuperate, after the Philadelphia Eagles had driven to the ""red zone.""  The results fully justified the move. The next two plays resulted in defensive sacks for long yards that prevented a touchdown, and drove the Eagles to the edge of field goal range. The Eagles kicked and missed a field goal that might have represented a victory had the made it (the final score was 26-24, Saints).  Apparently this is unusual. Why is that?  My understanding is that most coaches like to save key defensive resources (e.g. time outs in football, or closers in baseball) for the end of the game. Are some coaches now starting to move their key resources at ""critical times"" (e.g. time outs earlier in the game)? "

99,Rule on Being fouled shooting at the wrong basket,"Let's say a player gets fouled while shooting at the opponent's basket either intentionally or unintentionally (deflects it in or makes it accidentally passing it cross-court while bringing the ball up, or they are just confused after exchanging ends, etc.).  Is it a 2-shot foul if they miss?  Or 3-shot if they are in 3-point range?  Does the basket count for the other team if they make it while being fouled?  Is it only one free throw if the shot at the wrong basket is made, like it is when you make a shot at your own basket? "
100,Best steps for learning to ride fakie/ switch,"I've been snowboarding for about 4 or 5 years, long-boarding for about the same. I'm pretty decent at riding normal (goofie for me), but it looks like it would be super fun to be able to switch my stance, either mid-way down a hill / mountain or after.  Does anyone have advice on either:   How to ride normal after first learning to ride goofie? Practice techniques for learning new stances on a board?   Thanks! "
101,Foosball five-man wall bounce rule,"I've been playing foosball for a while now, but mostly in college and at friend's houses. Just recently I watched some friends playing in a state tournament, and there were some really funky rules about bouncing the foosball around with the five bar.  I remember them saying something like you can only bounce it off the wall twice, and on the second time you have to advance it? What happens if you accidentally don't? And what if the ball is stuck on the wall? "
102,How much can heat/weather affect a table tennis table?,"I live in Southern California, where the heat can reach up to 100 degrees (F) easily in the summer. I only have room for a table in the garage, and am a little worried about how the heat might affect the table via warping. I've ordered a 18mm table (Joola Tour 1800) - in general will it be okay or might it suffer? If so, would this be a slow process over many years or happen on the first couple of hot days?  The table should be in the storage position most of the time, and back in a corner that shares walls with the house - not in direct sunlight. It's very dry out here, and the coldest it ever gets out here is 40 degrees (F) or so at nights during the winter. "

So how come there isn't anything between the stands and the sportsmen in cricket, a net or something similar? When somebody hits a 6, it usually lands right in the middle of the crowd. Why doesn't it hit people? Why are the accidents so rare? Are people really just that aware of where the ball is at any given moment?  "

106,Can a sumo wrestler touch the ground before his opponent in the act of forcing him to the ground?,"According to Wikipedia (emphasis mine for clarity),      Sumo (相撲 sumō?) is ... where a rikishi (wrestler) attempts to force another wrestler ... into touching the ground with anything other than the soles of the feet (hereafter referred to as ""touch/touches/touching the ground"").   I was watching footage of a takedown in which the one giving the takedown nearly touches the ground  before his opponent (and was quite amazed he didn't touch the ground).   Can a sumo wrestler touch the ground before his opponent in the act of forcing him to the ground? Would this be forcing himself into touching the ground, and thus allowable, or unallowable due to touching the ground in any way?  "

110,Why are the salaries of professional athletes so public?,"Every major free agent signing ( at least in Baseball ) generates an enormous media buzz, and all details are completely available to whoever reads the paper.  Why are the salaries of professional athletes SOOOO public?       Is this allowed in all careers, and we just don't care about most?    Even so, it still seems that athletes are subject to a ridiculous level of scrutiny.  This isn't some new thing either - there are even quizzes you can take about the highest paid baseball players ( here is one of many ) on Sporcle.    Am I missing something?  This seems grossly unfair to professional athletes, who are subject to mockery and judgement from the media, fans, etc. if they are not performing consistant with their contract.  In this era that we live in, this appears to be a disregard for privacy so flagrant that I'd expect to hear more about it.  But I've never heard anyone complain about it other than the occasional groans by the players ( groans that are summarily mocked and dismissed by the media ).  Does anyone know why this is and how it started?  Additionaly, has anyone ever seriously spoken against it ( e.g. proposed legislature, lawsuits, etc. )? "
111,When/how did US professional wrestling transition from being competitive to being worked?,"As I understand it, professional wrestling was initially a legitimate sport. Up until around 1920, the matches were mostly competitive (though there was a healthy dose of match fixing even then.) These matches were being promoted and sanctioned by some independent sporting organization (I know there were athletic clubs in New York, LA, and Boston for example), as well as national groups like the National Boxing  Association and it's spin-off National Wrestling Association.   By 1938 and the formation of the National Wrestling Alliance, the sport has become entirely worked (barring the occasional unplanned double-cross), with outcomes and title changes being predetermined and key parts of matches scripted ahead of time. These matches were promoted by privately owned regional wrestling promotions (under what was called the territory system.)  What I'm not really clear on is how that transition happened. When did it begin, and how did the promoters in the athletics organizations convince the wrestlers -- and each other -- to go along with the staged matches? Did this transition happen all at once, or was there a long stretch of time where some titles were being contended legitimately, while others were entirely predetermined? "
112,How to properly fall FORWARD while ice skating and prevent wrist fractures?,"I've looked this up everywhere and cannot find a good answer.   In ice skating, they teach us to fall to the side or on our bottoms to prevent injury. However, what do you do when you're about to fall forward? e.g. tripping over your ice pick for figure skaters. My instinct would be to extend my arms to break the fall. This will likely hurt my wrists, if not fracture it. Is there a proper technique? "
113,"Why do lots of professional football players shoot with this awkward, tricky and ""unstable"" technique?","I've seen many shots like this one in real ""high quality"" football games. I'm wondering what benefits this shot does have in comparison with a ""normal"" shot like that.   I doubt the reason is of the shot angle or the precision.  Furthermore, I consider this shot as ""less safe"" against fails, because of the unstable foot positioning. (fail example) Initially I was thinking the shooting foot remains the same, but i was wrong - but still I'm wondering if that's really the argument for that kind of shooting?  EDIT I don't know if that technique has a particular ""name"", e.g. like the ""elastico"" trick, therefore I don't know a better title for my question. "
114,training and scoring of free throws in basketball,"In soccer, many coaches believe that it is impossible to train penalty shots, based on the argument that the pressure that is on a player who takes a penalty shot can not be simulated during training.  Essentially, there is little difference with free throws in basketball: the distance is always the same, the spectators expect the player to score.  My questions: do basketball players actively train for their free throws? How do they simulate the pressure on the player? What is the scoring percentage for free throws among the best teams? In soccer, the better players score 80 percent or higher. "

117,Do offences that lead a to a penalty inside the penalty box always result in a red card?,"I read somewhere that a red card should automatically be awarded if a defender hand balls the soccer ball in the penalty area. I do not know whether this is substantiated, it seems rather harsh if the handball is accidental.  It got me thinking, are all fouls in the penalty box which lead to a penalty kick always penalised with a red card as well? If not, what percentage of penalty kicks are awarded in conjunction with red cards, and for what offences? "
118,What happens if a player loses a shoe during a football match?,"Sometimes it happens that a football player loses the shoe during the match.

Sport climbing covers three distinct disciplines: lead, boulder and speed.  The 2020 event will be a combination of those three disciplines. Is there a standard way to combine the performances in those three disciplines? In each of them performances are measured in entirely different ways: highest hold reached, number of problems climbed and time. How will those three be combined to a meaningful result? "
121,"Third base runner gets hit by a foul ball, is he out?",The batter hit a foul ball that hit his own player?  Is the runner out? 
122,"Tag out of a forced runner to end the inning, does the run still score?","Bases loaded with 2 outs, ground ball hit towards 3B/SS hole fielded by 3B. The third-basemen elects to try and tag the runner advancing from 2nd to 3rd, but the runner sees the decision and stops running (while staying inside the legal base path) forcing the 3B to continue chasing him to apply the tag. Meanwhile the runner at 3rd base was blazing home and crossed the plate decisively before the 3rd out was made by a tag.  Umpire calls the runner safe at home because the 3rd out was not made by a FORCE out but instead a TAG out....  We realize that this 3rd basemen had a mental lapse as a force play is much easier even he has to go to second with it instead of touching 3rd....   I came up with another scenario which I think might happen more commonly in MLB, hopefully making it easier to find a record of this being called by a MLB umpire....  Bases loaded with one out, ground ball hit to SS, the short-stop fields clean and tosses it to the Second-basemen covering second who touches the base and throws on to first to complete the double play. The throw from the second-basemen is off the mark causing the first-basemen to come down the line toward home, he scoops it up and tags the runner for the 3rd out. However, the runner from third easily scored prior to the TAG being applied the batter/runner forced to first base. EDIT - In this case the batter/runner did not reach first safely so the run does not count according to According to MLB rules: 4.09 HOW A TEAM SCORES.  (a) One run shall be scored each time a runner legally advances to and touches first, second, third and home base before three men are put out to end the inning. EXCEPTION: A run is not scored if the runner advances to home base during a play in which the third out is made (1) by the batter-runner before he touches first base; (2) by any runner being forced out; or (3) by a preceding runner who is declared out because he failed to touch one of the bases.  However, I still can't find any specific wording in MLB rule book that states a tag applied to a forced runner still counts as a FORCE-OUT.  Can anyone verify this claim??  "
123,Why is hawkeye not allowed to automatically correct a wrong call?,"At tennis tournaments with hawkeye, a player is allowed 3 challenges to a call made as to whether a ball was in or not, and losing one challenge each time they are wrong.  I can understand limiting the ability for a player to make a challenge, but every call made is seen on the computer by the hawkeye technicians.  What is the reasoning behind the ATP rules for not allowing hawkeye to interfere whenever a wrong call is made? And moreover, why not scrap linesmen and simply have hawkeye alert the umpire? "

126,How many times a tennis player became world number one ranking without ever winning a grand slam?,"Tennis world number ones are usually grand slam champions, Roger Federer, Serina Williams, and Andy Murray are a few examples. But it's possible for a player to become the top seed by collecting points making deep runs in the grand slams and winning non major titles.

128,Why are there owners willing to pay so much for sports teams?,"I found a list of most valuable sports teams, and I was amazed at the valuations. Why are there owners willing to drive the value of these teams so high?  For example, Real Madrid is listed with a value of USD 3.65 Billion.    We know that they are getting revenue through sponsorships, television broadcast rights fees, Internet broadcasting, and match ticket sales. Do those together justify such high valuations? "
129,Tennis player sit-down (or other form of) protest?,"A few years ago, many Brazilian football teams sat-down right after the match started, in protest for extenuating scheduling conditions.   Has there ever a player protested in akin ways in a professional Tennis match? For example, by refusing to serve? Or maybe two players, by keeping the ball in game continuously?   If so, can the referee do something about it? "

131,What is the allowed tolerance for a jump start or is it a hidden rule?,"FIA said that Valtteri Bottas' start movement in 2017 Austrian Grand Prix was within the tolerances allowed, however we were not enlightened on the tolerances.  I saw the following sentence in an article (on autosport.com), which declares this rule is hidden to prevent any abuse by the teams.     The FIA does not disclose what tolerance is allowed before it takes   action, for fear that if teams knew what was allowed they would start   exploiting this to boost their getaways.   Is it really a hidden rule? If not, what are the allowed tolerances for a jump start? "
132,"High jump: Why is it not allowed to take off on both feet, do flip flops etc?","I realize that all sports have rules you need to follow, and usually there's good reason for these rules. Still, I wonder about the rules regarding high jump: according to What is the world record in high jump if you allow taking off on both feet?, you need to take off on one foot. It's said in the comments that gymnasts can jump higher than 2.5 m if they do flip-flops or something, however, the current world record for high jump is lower than this. This seems strange to me, as I would think it was interesting to see who could jump highest, not just who can jump highest using this particular technique. It seems hard to find references to this on the net.   In this clip (sorry, in norwegian) the gymnast is said to easily clear 2.5m: Brille season 2, episode 3, NRK "

What happens if more Spanish teams attain ""A license"" or Euroleague Basketball invites by wild card? Is there any rule or agreement that limits the number of participants from one country? "
134,"Offensive interference in baseball (""confusing"" a fielder)","The Umpire Bible website presents an interference scenario that is brought up under the base runner ""confusing"" an infielder:     You can think up lots of scenarios. For example, let's say there's one out and a runner on first (R1). Batter hits a weak grounder to the shortstop. Easy double-play, right? Well, on sliding into second, R1 shouts ""that's three outs,"" and the second baseman pulls up, drops the ball and starts heading for the dugout. Well, you might say the second baseman (F4) is a moron for not knowing his situation and falling for the trick (and you'd be right). That said, it's still interference.   I understand what's being said by this, but does this situation call for the batter-runner to be out, making for a double play, rather than putting out the base runner committing the act (since it seems like he's already been forced out, per the description of the play)? "
135,Uncaught Third Strike question,"When the rules say that a third strike must be ""legally caught"" by the catcher, does that include a situation where the catcher has a third strike glance off his glove, but he ends up catching the deflected ball in his throwing hand (i.e., non-catching hand) before it hits the ground? Would he need to transfer the ball to his glove? I ask this because the rule says:  ""'Legally caught' means in the catcher’s glove before the ball touches the ground."" "
136,How to select running shoes for performance?,"For the running shoe illiterate, there are so many different varieties of running shoes and so many different brand choices that it becomes overwhelming when looking for the right fit. Even reading online is tricky because what may be sound advice, easily gets lost in the vast amount of information and number running shoe choices.  So here I am wondering if you can help me solve this riddle, how can I objectively choose a good running shoe?   What type of running shoes exist, so that I may understand what I am looking at and how to select a shoe based on what it offers. How do you identify the superior shoe based on their longevity, quality, brand trust, and other factors?  "
137,Can a 5-yard penalty be conceded by the defence when the offence is less than 5 yard from the goal line in American football?,"Scenario: Line of scrimmage is at the defensive team's 12 yard line and the defensive team concedes a 15-yard pre-snap penalty.   Normally the offensive team would move up 15 yards, but what happens in this case? Is there a difference in NFL vs. AFL vs. CFL vs. NCAA? "
138,Why are second and third excluded from balk rule?,"Looking up the balk rules in baseball, I came across this line:     steps or feints from the rubber to first base without completing the throw   Why only first base? Why are second and third excluded from this? "
139,Question about batter's position in batter's box prior to pitch,"Since I've read two different interpretations of this, I'm going to ask a question about the batter's box and the batter's orientation in it prior to the pitch, even if I'm pretty sure I know the answer.  Under OBR, it says that a batter's legal position in the box while addressing the pitcher is when both feet are within the lines of the box (the lines themselves being part of the box). So, simply, prior to hitting the pitch, this means the batter cannot even have a toe outside the white chalk lines, correct? I read on some shady site that you just need your foot touching the lines, meaning you can have your toes at least partially outside the lines. However, all other evidence seems to be the contrary. So, must the batter have both feet entirely within the lines, no toes/heels, etc outside the lines? I realize he's able to have a toe outside the line when actually hitting the ball, by the way. "
140,"Does a penalty yardage greater to the ""yards to go"" always lead to 1st down in American football?","Scenario: The offensive team has 2nd &amp; 4 at the defensive team's 20 yard line and the defensive team concedes a 5-yard pre-snap penalty.  The offensive team moves five yards up the field, but what happens in terms of downs and yards to go? Is it always a 1st &amp; 10, or is there some condition whereunder the down and yards to go ""carry over"" (i.e. we get 2nd &amp; 4 at the defensive team's 15 yard line)?  Any difference between NFL, AFL, CFL, NCAA etc.? "
141,(un)restricted free agency in NHL,"I am trying to understand free agency rules in NHL, how the last two lockouts changed them, and how players may decide to behave with respect to them.  My understanding is that after the 2004-5 lockout, unrestricted free agents became those players how are either older than 27 or have at least 7 seasons of tenure in NHL. The shift to the new rules was gradual: before season 2004-5, it was 31 years of age without tenure requirements (is this correct?); then--after the lockout, in 2005-6 it became 29 years of age or with 7 seasons tenure; finally, in 2006-7 it became 27 or with 7 seasons of tenure.  After the 2004-5 lockout, younger players with less than 7 seasons of tenure remained restricted free agents at the end of the contract, if the current team offered them a qualifying contract (i.e. a contract of at least 1 season, with a salary that is equivalent to at least 100-110% of the last salary). Differently, without the offer of a qualifying contract from the current team, these players become unrestricted free agents.  The 2012-2013 lockout did not lead to any change in this free agency rules.  My question is based on the assumption that the above illustration is correct (if it is wrong, please, tell me what detail is wrong) and is grounded on a story telling that differs from the usual one--see below.  Many hockey fan claim that long contracts impact players performance. After a player signs a multi-year contract, in the first season he ""shrinks"" (i.e. he does not play at his best), then he plays a bit better in the following seasons, and finally (in the last season of the contract) he plays as well as he could to convince the team owner (or the owner of another team) that he deserves a new contract.  I think that this story is incomplete because it does not differentiate between players who qualify as restricted free agents and those who qualify as unrestricted free agents.  Let's consider a young good and nontenured player, in the last season of his contract. Since he is good, he expects the team owner to offer him a contract renewal that would be considered as a qualifying offer; therefore, he does not expect to become an unrestricted free agent at the end of the contract.  However, during the last season (or even a bit earlier), a different team owner comes forth and holds private talks with this player; this new team is better than his current team and wants to offer to him a better contract (much more money).  The question is: how likely is that this player intentionally plays bad during his last season in order to convince his current team owner to not give him a qualifying offer? Without qualifying offer, he becomes unrestricted free agent and can freely join the better team which offers him more money. What do you think? Is it likely to happen?  Are there some rumors about this behavior? "
142,Why are artificial chicanes placed at the run off for long straights?,"Why do tracks like Monza, Le Mans and Daytona Road Course feature run off areas that have several foam barriers that drivers need to drive around?  I understand that these were placed so that drivers need to drive around them when they misjudge their braking points instead of just cutting through the whole corner itself, but doesn't this pose a bit of a safety hazard in case a car suffers a brake failure?   Monza has them at turn 1, Le Mans has them at the entry to the two chicanes, Daytona has them at the bus stop, even the GP Course of Nurburgring has it before the actual chicane. All these spots in these circuits are at heavy braking zones at the end of long straights, so aren't the drivers put at more of a risk if a high speed collision with these barriers occurs at these locations as compared to just putting down gravel to slow the cars down? "

145,How much does a dropped NFL player earn while with a team during the pre-season,"In the latest episode of NFL Hard Knocks the Browns are dropping players to get to the 53 that are allowed during the regular season.  As I understand it, if a dropped player isn't picked up by another team, they will have to wait for the next season before getting the opportunity to play for a team (assuming they aren't picked up during the season to cover an injury).  We hear about all the multi-million dollar contracts that the top players sign but:   how much can a player that doesn't make the grade expect to get? Are they paid a fixed sum, a sallery, per game cheque or some kind of performance based incentive? Are they under contract during the pre-season?   From my limited knowledge, NFL seems to be more a way of life than a job, so what do dropped players do when not playing? Are there positions they can take up off the field or do they just get a regular job until they can play again? "
146,Tennis coaches can't coach during a match?,"Serena Williams lost a tennis match yesterday at the 2018 US Open, but not without some controversy.      [Williams was] penalized in the second set because of three separate game violations.   Source   The first violation is mostly where I'm confused.      Williams got the first violation from umpire Carlos Ramos, who ruled that Williams received coaching earlier in the set; she told him she'd ""rather lose"" than cheat.   What does that mean? Coaches can't ""coach"" during a match? Does that mean no communication is allowed between coach and player? Why have a coach then if they can't give you a second perspective during a match? Seems like such a strange rule.   How closely is this rule followed? Williams' coach seems to think it's both a bad rule and generally not enforced. Is this true? Are there other sports leagues with a similar rule? I'm coming from an American football and baseball understanding, where coaching is vital to play.  "
147,How to do a behind the back crossover properly?,"I have been playing basketball for years (I am in my late 20s now) but I have not done any serious training. Occasionally I find that I should take it seriously and start working from the basics regardless of being older. One of the aspects I focus on now is ball handling.  I have seen lots of tutorials, videos of handling drills, which consist of using two balls, using a tennis ball, doing reps of basic moves like crossover, in and out, between the legs, behind the back etc. I try to follow these drills and practice from time to time, then I found that I have a even more fundamental problem: how to do a behind the back crossover properly?  When I try to do these ""basic drills"", I find that I lose the ball often when I do the behind the back crossover, the ball will hit my butt or my ankle. Does that mean I should bend my shoulder to the back even more? Or should I bend my knee more? Or does it just mean that I need more practicing to get the ""feel"" of the move? "

However, Del Potro has more points than Federer in the Race to London. How can this be? Live ATP Race says Federer has qualified despite not having reached the cut; why is that?   "
149,How to find a climbing partner?,"I have recently started indoor climbing (doing beginners courses now) and noticed it's really a two person sport with one climbing and the other anchoring.  However, I don't have anyone to go climbing with yet and also don't want to be pinned down to much by someone elses schedule.   Are there any ad-hoc ways of finding someone or a small group to climb with at the gym? Are there any good apps for finding a climbing buddy (netherlands/europe based)? How would I approach others about this?   I will also be asking my instructor about this during the next lesson but want to go in as informed as possible.  PS: Solo bouldering is not a solution. "
150,What is the first billiards game ever rules?,The picture below is a drawing from 1674 of one of the very first billiard table that I could find in wiki said it had no information on this game called Ground billiards. Does anyone know or where to find the rules?    
151,"Who is the ""winner"" of each leg of a two-legged football match, or a match that goes to penalties?","Match #1  Europa League, quarter-finals, 2nd leg: After 90 minutes Besiktas was up 2-1 against Lyon. Because of the aggregate score of 3-3 (Lyon won 2-1 in the 1st leg) they had to play extra time and then use penalty shootout to decide who got to go on in the to the semi-final. Lyon won on penalties.  Match #2  World Cup, round of 16: After 90 minutes the score was 1-1 between Spain and Russia. To get a winner they had to play extra time and do a penalty shootout. Russia won on penalties.  Questions   Which teams are considered the winner of the two single matches? (What I'm really wondering about is if that penalty shootout in a two-legged match is considered to be part of that single match or not.) In a team form view of the team would you expect to see Lyon to have won or lost the last match? (Would you be able to say that Besiktas or Spain have not lost any of their X matches because of the full-time score?)  "
152,Is it a reception if a receiver hops twice on one foot?,"Assuming an NFL receiver catches a ball and maintains possession, if he hops twice on the same foot before going out of bounds, does it count as a catch?  Does the rule book specifically say it needs to be two distinct feet? "
153,What should a badminton line judge call if the shuttle hits the player?,"If the shuttle hits the player then lands, what is the line judge supposed to call?  If the player then hits the shuttle out on their own side (does not reach or go past the net), or hits it directly down, what should the line judge call? "
154,Can several games start at the same time in one tournament?,"In professional tournaments/championships and across sports, can different games be started at the same time?  When or why would the organisers do that? "
155,Who makes a decision to intentionally walk a batter?,"Say there are men on second and third with one out. So the pitcher intentionally walks a batter to load the bases and set up a possible double play. Maybe the pitcher didn't want to pitch to a good batter anyway.  Who makes the decision for an intentional walk? Does the pitcher make this decision on his own? Or is it somehow communicated to him by a manager or a coach? Or is it true that a pitcher makes this decision some of the time, but the manager or coach can order him to walk a particularly dangerous batter, or pitch to a certain, presumably weak, one? "
156,When did jerseys get dots on them?,"I thought jerseys have last names (or nothing) on the back of them. However, I recently saw dots on a jersey.    When did jerseys get dots on them? What do they represent? It sorta looks like scoreboard dots. "
157,Why does the game stop after the kicking team catches a punt?,"I am a occasional football watcher from Europe, so please excuse my stupid question.  My question is the following: The standard outcome of a punt is a catch by the defending team and some running before he goes down or out of bounds. Sometimes, however, a member of the punting team happens to catch the punt, in which case the defending team gets possession where the catch happened. I don't really understand why the play does not continue in this case. What does such a catch distinguish to a 'normal catch'? I have the following thoughts:   Kicking forward is generally allowed and could theoretically be done in 'normal play'. [EDIT: This assumption turned out to be wrong.] Sometimes, kick-offs are done in a manner to maintain possession (I guess this is called on-side kick?). If it's allowed in this case to catch the ball, why not after a punt?   Kicking the ball wide forward (and usually giving up possession) is often seen in Rugby as a means to open up the game. If a member of the kicking team gains possession, the game just goes on.   Based on my understanding, I'd hence assume the kicking team would at least be granted a new first down. I don't see a reason why the possession would change in this case. "
158,Brutal accident against goalkeeper (Andrada vs Dedé) must he have been sent off (as he was),"Here is the play.  It was yesterday in a Copa Libertadores match. The header ended in the goalkeeper's face. The referee decided to send off the player with the VAR. The rules of soccer are not really clear about this situation, or yes? The rule about excessive force or brutality makes no distinction between ""on purpose"" brute force but, honestly, I think the rulebook could have a modification regarding this kind of ""accidents"": why mustn't the not so clever incident maker pay for his ""mistake""?  "
159,"Has anyone been ""guaranteed"" a Super Bowl ring because they played for both teams during the season?","I was reading this answer to the question ""Who gets Super Bowl rings?"" which says      Also, in some cases, players traded during the season will get them too, if they suited up and played during they regular season. This is also by ownership's decision   Was ever a time when a player was guaranteed a Super Bowl ring because they are in the final game but they started the season for their opponents team? "
160,"In tennis, what is the percentage of broken service games?","Looking at Befair tennis, what is the percentage of broken service games? If both players are fairly evenly matched, how many times does a player lose his service game? "
161,Why are Indian news TV channels not showing coverage of cricket matches?,"During earlier IPL events, all Indian news TV channels were giving highlights, point tables, etc. We were getting too many updates.    During IPL 2018, there was no coverage in prime time on any Indian news TV channels. Even the England tour was not shown. Now Asia Cup is not shown. No updates on cricket, except for a line or two. Even the India-Pakistan match was not highlighted!    The Asian Games were shown prominently, but not cricket. Are TV news channels boycotting cricket? Or are sports telecasters demanding too much money from TV news channels?    Even the matches between India and West Indies is not shown prominently. On Day 1, there was prime time news only about the century scored by Prithvi Shaw and no other player was mentioned. Maybe broadcasters have taken very exclusive rights and want viewers to watch sports channels for cricket news.  EDIT: On 21/Nov/2018, morning, there was some news about India preparing for the t20 matches, and players were shown practicing; Not sure if that is stock video or current coverage. Evening, there were only few lines about India losing by 4 runs due to DLS. No video of the match, no news about wickets, partnerships, Australia score, top scorers  ....    Possible Answer: Pattern looks like news channels want to cover it, but they are not getting the live video; Maybe the charges are too high or the owners of the video want viewers to watch it through sports channels only. "
162,How is spike speed measured in volleyball?,"I've been eyeballing a volleyball match right now (apparently, it's world championships :), and have noticed that they show ""spike speed"" for spike replays. How is that speed measured? Is the ball stuffed with sensors or is there an array of hi-speed cameras to measure this? How much instrumentation is there for a high-profile match like this?  The main judge has three displays at his disposals, they look like three completely different things. At at least two times teams have contested a ruling, and a rudimentary 3D animation was shown on stream. It looked bit low-res, and definitely not like something the studio responsible for the transmission would do - so it must have originated from some kind of match-local instrumentation. "
163,Is a running back allowed to toss the football out of bounds to stop the clock?,"This question applies to all levels of American football from pee wee football all the way up to the NFL.   If a running back is past the line of scrimmage and is running towards the sideline with the intent of getting out of bounds to stop the clock but his path is blocked by defensive players, can the running back toss the football out of bounds to stop the clock?  I'm not talking about him passing the football over the heads of the defensive players into the sideline, but him tossing it like a softball towards the sideline and angling it a few yards back from his position on the field so its not a forward pass.  Will the ball be placed at the point where the ball entered the sideline and will this stop the clock? "
164,Time limit to serve,"Is there a time limit within which you have to serve the ball?  I experienced a strange game where one of the players just turned his back (as he was about to serve) to his opponent and said you took too long to serve.  Everyone around me said to replay the point? Was this correct as he ""wasn't ready""?  Or is this the server's point as he composed himself before serving? It was an odd situation and I can't find any official rules about it.  Any clarification would be helpful. "
165,When was baseball introduced to Latin America?,"I was watching Sports Center this morning and realized that baseball has a lot of players of Hispanic origin.   When was baseball first introduced to Latin America? When did recruiting Latin American / Hispanic players become fairly commonplace? Beyond that, why are/were so many Latin American players recruited for baseball? "
166,Do basketball players tend to improve at shooting free-throws over the course of their career?,"Today on Khan Academy there was a probability tutorial on how to figure out the likelihood of a given player making 10 consecutive free-throws.  Apparently Lebron's career FT% is right around 75%. A great free-throw shooter like Chauncey Billups is just short of 90% for his career, while Shaq and Ben Wallace can shoot as low as 40% to 50%.  Are free-throws something that NBA players spend a considerable amount of time practicing? And if they do practice a lot, does their FT% tend to reflect that and get higher over the course of their career? "
167,How does drifting work?,"I have seen drifting in many movies, and, in fact, one of the fast and furious movies was dedicated specifically to drifting (Tokyo drift)      How exactly does drifting work? What does the driver have to do to make the car drift? How does he control the car once his tires loose friction? Are there certain cars that are better at it than others? Is it really possible for someone do drift the entire way around a mountain (what they did in the fast an furious movie)? "
168,Skills in archery,"I'm a beginning traditional archer, and I'm wondering what the point of archery is.   As far as I can tell, it's about perfect form. If you miss, you adjust your scope a little and keep trying to get perfect consistent form.  Am I missing something? Is there some other skill involved other than perfect form? "
169,What is the world record in high jump if you allow taking off on both feet?,"The current world record in normal high jump is 2.45 metres, set by Javier Sotomayor in 1993.   I read somewhere that in normal high jump, jumpers must take off on one foot. But if you relax the rules a bit and allow jumping with both feet, I guess it might be possible to jump even higher.  How high is it possible to jump allowing taking off with both feet? Is there any such world record?  Update  I remember watching some international high jump competition in TV a few years ago. The Swedish TV commentator then made a comment about one of the high jumpers, that he almost jumped with both feet. The jumper clearly jumped with one foot, but I guess that by just changing his technique a bit he would jump with both feet. The height of his jump was somewhere around 2.30 metres. I would find it surprising if a two-feet jump would be significantly lower than that. "
170,What gives a left-handed pitcher an advantage over a left-handed batter?,"In baseball, a pitcher is often assumed to have an advantage over a batter based on his handedness (i.e. left-handed vs right-handed).  I think it is that right-handed pitchers have an advantage of left-handed batters, and vice-versa.  Why is this advantage?  If it is related to the break of the curve, is this advantage only relevant for pitchers that use a curveball, or does it also apply to pitchers that primarily use a fastball/change-up? "
171,What is the broadcast etiquette when a pitcher has a perfect game?,"When a pitcher has a no-hitter or perfect game going there is a lot of superstition and etiquette surrounding what goes on in the field of play and in the dugout. The pitcher is expected to always sit in the same spot in the dugout between innings, the opposing team is expected not to try to bunt for a base hit in the late innings, etc.   What amount of this etiquette/superstition does, or should, apply to the broadcasters or others who report on the game? Where does the duty to the fans and effectively communicating what is going on in the game (especially in radio where what you say is all you communicate) end? "
172,MLB no-hitter resulting in loss,According to Major League Baseball an official no-hitter consists of a pitcher having pitched at least 9 innings while allowing 0 hits.  In MLB history has a team lost while having a pitcher throw an official no-hitter? If so what were the team(s)? 
173,Double Minor Penalty Kill Counts as 1 or 2 Kills?,"In NHL hockey when you receive a double minor penalty (4:00 penalty given for example high sticking leading to bleeding) does this count as 2 separate penalty kills if no goals are scored during the 4 minutes or does it only count as 1 penalty kill? And for that matter if a goal is scored in the first 2 minutes but not in the 2nd 2 minute penalty, is it considered one failure and one kill?   I am just curious how this is kept statistically. But my guess would be that it counts as 2 penalty kills. "
174,Batting the pitcher 8th,"I've seen some managers bat their pitchers 8th. Tony LaRussa was one of the more noticeable ones. Is this move statistically sound? Why or why not?  Ignore cases like Dontrelle Willis early in his career or Michah Owings, both of whom are good hitters anyway. I'm talking about run-of-the-mill, bad at hitting, pitchers. "
175,Why are large MLB contracts backloaded?,"Many MLB contracts are backloaded. For example, Alex Rodriguez will be making over $30 million USD per year at the end of his deal in 2017, much higher than the average annual value.  I understand that clubs sometimes do this to ease the burden on the luxury tax at the beginning, but as players age, they typically decline, causing all of those dollars committed at the end of the contract to be an albatross. Why do we not see clubs front-loading contracts, where they will pay the most for a player while he is in his prime? "
176,Can the second-to-last defender cause an offside by leaving the field of play?,"I had a little conversation one of my football friends and we had this interesting situation come up during the conversation.   As I understand the offside rule, the offending player should not be closer to the goal than the second-to-last defender.   But, what if at the point of the player receiving the ball, one of the defenders go out of play? Like for example, the goal keeper or the other defender is injured or goes out of the field. Would it still be considered an offside because there is only a single defender between the offending player and the goal? If yes, why can't this rule be exploited to effectively nullify the goal scored, if any? "
177,"When selecting a bow, how can I find out what a good poundage for me would be?","I currently have a 30 pound bow which is rather light for me, and I'd like to purchase a new one.  I'm guessing 45-50#, but I'm not sure.  I'm thinking 60# would probably be too heavy (trying to imagine pulling twice the weight of what I have now), but I don't know about that either.  Then again, it might be 40#.  I'm 16 years old, 5' 9"", 140 lbs, and not quite in optimal physical condition (~25 pushups straight).  I'm not necessarily asking for you to give me a poundage off of those metrics, but I'd like to know what the right weight should feel like when I'm pulling a bow.  Also, does it matter if I go for a heavier bow, if I'm planning ahead for when (hopefully) I'm more physically fit?  Or should I plan to get a new bow after I ""grow out"" of the next one? "
178,Can a football (soccer) league decide to use video review?,"As a fan of ice hockey, I've become accustomed to the benefits of video review. The NHL does it right. There is one VAR room where all video reviews are done for the entire league, which leads to a high degree of consistency. The officials do not leave the playing surface or view the video themselves, but when the video review is uncertain the official ruling on the ice stands.  Why is this not done in association football? I suspect that the answer is that the people who make the decisions are, like me, over 60. This leads to my real question. Could an individual league such as the Barclays Premiere League, or MLS in North America, chose to use video review or does FIFA prevent this? "
179,Are cyclists inconvenienced by support car exhausts?,"During a road bicycle race, like Giro d'Italia or Tour de France, cyclists have to share the road with the support cars and often ride just behind them. Don’t they mind the exhausts from the cars, or do the exhausts inconvenience them? Do the cars have any special equipment to reduce the harmfulness of their exhausts (or, at least, is there regulation requiring the cars to fulfill some stricter norms)? "
180,What are the benefits of interlocking the fingers on club grip?,"When holding my clubs, I have always adopted a ""baseball bat"" style grip.  I've played like this for a few years and haven't had any noticeable issues.  However, a lot of players, both pro and amateur, use a grip with two interlocking fingers.  What are the benefits of this grip?  Is it worth changing or is it personal preference? "
181,Who owns a player that is on loan?,"Does a club still own a player when they loan him to different club?  For example, I know Chelsea loaned Fernando Torres to AC Milan, where he was disastrous and now is loaned to Athletico Madrid.  So is he still a Chelsea player or was he loaned from AC Milan to Athletico? "
182,What if a fielder stand on 30 yard circle?,"What if a fielder stand on 30 yard circle? Is he called an infielder or outfielder. I have also seen that some player also stand some steps outside of 30 yard circle. So if do not walks inside thd circle while the bowler delivers the bowl, is he counted as a fielder outside the circle? "
183,Is there any rule of lbw which considers 2.5 meters?,"Is there any rule which states that leg before wicket is not a violation when the batsman is 2.5 meters from the stumps? I have read the rule about the lbw but there is nothing stating that.  But there is an instance in World Cup 2011 in a match of India where I saw that because the batsman's distance from stumps was more than 2.5 meters, he was given not out.  So if that's the rule why it is not written somewhere? And is there any marking on the pitch so that the umpire can know that batman is out 2.5 m from the stumps? "
184,why do a bowler use a white marker disc?,why do a bowler use a white marker disc? I have seen that a bowler put a white disc on ground before taking run ups.So why do they use it? 
185,why 15 yard circle is drawn incomplete?,"why 15 yard circle is drawn incomplete? It is written in rules that the area reserved for slips need not to be demarcated since the slips can go further deep in undemarcated area for fast bowler. So what if the short mid off fielder want to stand near the 15 yard line,it is not drawn?  And why dots are marked it is only drawn till 45 degree ? "
186,What level of achievement is it to be able to always hit a single in darts?,"Never mind doubles and trebles, for me right now just hitting the number I'm aiming for is a challenge - playing round-the-clock for the first time today it took me 114 darts to hit 1-20 in order, which is almost 6 darts per number! At times I'd get 2 or even 3 in succession, other times up to 12 darts or more stuck on one number.  What level of skill and experience does being able to reliably hit a single demonstrate? e.g. to play round the clock with a perfect score of 20 darts. Is this so easy it's a ""if you can't do it, give up the sport"" thing, for instance? "
187,Placing a base runner on the wrong base after a mound visit,"Situation:   There is a runner on first base and the defense decides to have a mound visit or change their pitcher. The offensive players group up to talk about strategy and the coach tells the player to go to second base instead of first base when the pitcher is ready.   If the defense, umpire, or official scorer don't notice this and a pitch is thrown, it is my understanding that the player cannot be put back to first after the pitch.  This comes from an experience as a player in the past doing this same thing.   Is it correct that once a pitch has been made, the player cannot be sent back to first? What would be the official scoring for this? A stolen base? If someone does notice in time, is there any precedence or rule for punishment to the offense?  If not, why wouldn't more teams try this, especially at levels lower than professional baseball? Does anyone know of this actually happening in a major event? Say Professional or Major College baseball?   I understand that it would be seen as Bush League and often may be noticed by a member of the defense or an umpire.  However, it could be a way to sneak a better scoring opportunity if there are no repercussions.  "
188,Does the tackle box in gridiron football extend through all the offensive linemen even if they're a long way apart?,"On 10 January 2015 in the NFL playoffs, the Patriots lined up in a weird formation in which Shane Vereen, a running back, reported ineligible. Vereen was ""covered"" by a receiver on his team, meaning there was someone else on the line of scrimmage closer to the sideline than Vereen--see image below; Vereen is circled in yellow. So Vereen was effectively one of the five offensive linemen, although he was lined up a good ways from the other four. My question is, for the purposes of intentional grounding, etc., is the tackle box considered to extend all the way to Vereen? Does it matter that Gronk, not lined up on the line of scrimmage is between Vereen and the other linemen?   "
189,College football game - start time vs kickoff time,"I'm always confused by the times for which college football games are scheduled.  If a game (say, like the Oregon/Ohio State game tonight) has a start time of 6:30 PM, does that mean that the kickoff occurs, quite literally, at 6:30 PM?  Or, does this 6:30 start time signal the commencement of ""pregame"" procedures, such as teams running out on the field, coin toss, etc? "
190,Neutral field advantage for team with more fans in attendance?,"In college football, home teams outscore away teams by 3-3.5 points per game according to analysis by Matt Mills at SB Nation.  But is the advantage due to the home crowd or something else?  It's likely a combination of factors (familiarity with the stadium, girlfriend in the crowd, a good night's rest in your own bed), but I'm particularly curious about crowd effect.  Tonight Ohio State faces Oregon on neutral territory in Arlington, Texas. Ohio State fans in attendance supposedly outnumber Oregon fans 7:3. Is there any evidence this attendance disparity actually confers an advantage? "
191,"What is meant by ""ineligible receiver downfield?""","In (American) football, only the running backs and ends (but not offensive linemen) are supposed to (try to) catch passes.  Because of that fact, an offensive team can be penalized if its linemen are past the line of scrimmage, and not blocking someone. An important exception is the so-called ""screen pass.""  But what happens if a lineman crosses the line of scrimmage, starts blocking, say, a linebacker, and the defender gets past him so that he is ""loose"" in enemy territory.  Apparently that routinely happens in a screen pass, which is why there is no penalty in such situations. But why would there be a penalty on other occasions?  Of course there should be a penalty if a lineman actually caught a pass, but why would there be a penalty for his merely being ""downfield?"" Or put another way, what causes a penalty to be assessed or not when an offensive lineman is ""loose"" downfield? How might an official decide whether or not e.g. the ""screen pass"" exception applies? "
192,Transition from NCAA to NFL,"As a relative newcomer to the NFL I have some questions regarding NCAA players and their transition to the NFL.  1) Do some colleges have a reputation for consistently producing good players (such as Southampton's football academy in UK Football)? Why is this the case (similar reasons to football academies perhaps)?  2) How well does success in the NCAA correlate with NFL success ( in UK football the correlation fluctuates a lot, many 'wonder kids' fail to meet lofty expectations)? Due to the NFL being a very physically demanding league, surely some players may seem much better than their cohort only because they have developed much faster physically, how is this taken into account? "
193,NFL Draft Picks compared to the Success of Career,I have a couple of questions about the correlation between when a player is drafted and how well his career pans out.  1) How strong is the correlation between which round a prospective NFL player is picked and how successful their career is?  2) Do almost all first round picks have relatively successful careers? How rare is it that an 'Elite' player comes from the second round or lower?  
194,Why did the NHL ban the spin-o-rama?,"In 2014, the spin-o-rama shootout (and penalty shot) tactic was changed from 'explicitly allowed' in pre-2014/15 rules:     The spin-o-rama type move where the player completes a 360° turn as he   approaches the goal, shall be permitted as this involves continuous   motion. However, should the puck come to a complete stop at any time   during the shot attempt, the shot shall be stopped and no goal will be   the result.   (Rule 24.2) (Source: the above article)  The rule now reads, in part:     The spin-o-rama type move where the player completes a 360° turn as he   approaches the goal, shall not be permitted. Should a player perform   such a move during the penalty shot, the shot shall be stopped by the   Referee and no goal will be the result.   (Source: NHL Rulebook)  What caused the NHL to choose to change this rule?  And if the reason is considered solely the IIHF's decision to do the same earlier in the year or some other rule-making body's similar acts, what was the ultimate cause for that change?  Note that the NHL does still explicitly permit lacrosse-style moves (where the puck is picked up on the stick and then whipped into the goal), while the IIHF banned those as well.  I'm specifically looking for evidence (cited evidence from a reliable NHL source, or at minimum a sportswriter with intimate knowledge of the game) as opposed to theories. "
195,How can I wire a crane stock battery to a PEQ box?,"A while ago, I got a crane stock battery for the G&amp;G GR15. Of course, as things happen, I ended up getting a different gun (the ICS CXP-UK1).  Since the CXP is wired to the front, is there a PEQ box large enough to house a crane stock battery? Or would it be more sensible to either buy a smaller battery (to fit in the RIS), or a crane stock (and wire the gun to the rear)? "
196,How do teams and players adjust to changes in time zones on trips during season?,"There are several competitions where teams have to travel during the season and trips might even mean difference of several time zones. This is very prominent in KHL (9 hours between Vladivostok and Zagreb) but also in NHL (3 hours between Boston and Anaheim), probably some other competitions in USA, Russia and maybe some international leagues.   Do team and players have some strategies to help them deal with having to change time zones quite often?  As an example I can mention that I read here (article in Slovak language) that players of Slovan Bratislava (KHL) stick to the daily routine as if they were still in their time zone. (Which means, for example, going to sleep very late at night - local time - which would correspond to about eleven P.M. in Bratislava.)   Note that the question is not exclusively about ice hockey, similar problems might occur in many other sports. (I have mentioned ice hockey since this is where I noticed it.) "
197,Why Federer was seed #3 at Wimbledon 2017?,"Official seeding for Wimbledon 2017 shows Roger Federer at #3 while ATP ranking before the tournaments shows him at #5.  Considering that all 4 players ahead of Federer participated in the tournament, Roger should not have been the number 5? "
198,"Why is the last stage of Le Tour de France ""friendly""?","It hasn't always be like this, but these last years, the last stage is not decisive for the victory. The general rankings stay basically the same as the day before.  While officially racing in Paris, riders take pictures, drink champagne so this stage is more like a celebration and the stage victory is left to the final sprinters.  Is there a reason for this? Are there some implied rules to let the rankins stable on this day and not try to attack the yellow jersey? "
199,"What happens when a baseball player is ""DFA'ed"" and then signs with another team?","I'm asking specifically about Pablo Sandoval, who signed a five year contract with Boston Red Sox, and is now owed $18 million each for 2018 and 2019, plus the balance of his 2017 salary. He was designated for assignment because 1) he had become a ""replacement"" player, and 2) he was being paid way too much for a level of performance that a ""minimum wage"" player called up from the minors could match or exceed.  The San Francisco Giants may now want Sandoval back, perhaps on a ""trial"" basis. Will they have to pick up his expensive contract to rehire him? Can they pay him what they think he's worth and have Boston pick up the difference? Or can they pick up the full contract and dump it back on Boston if they DFA Sandoval themselves?  Have others in the past elected to play again when (in Sandoval's case) they could collect over $40 million (or some lower amount) over several years while not playing?  What has happened in these types of situations? "
200,"If two pitchers pitch to the same batter, who is credited with the result of the at-bat?","Let us assume a hypothetical situation in an MLB game. A pitcher gets to a 2-2 count against the batter. Then the pitcher leaves the game - perhaps he sustains an injury while delivering a pitch, or is ejected by an umpire. In this case, the offense is allowed to substitute a new pitcher during the at-bat because the old pitcher left due to injury or ejection.  Which pitcher is credited with the result of the at-bat? Does it matter what the count is? Clearly if the batter hits a home run that is the responsibility of the new pitcher, but if the batter walks after going 3-0, would the new pitcher be credited with the walk after the first pitcher put him in the hole? Same with 0-2 and getting a strikeout.  What do the official MLB rules say about this? Section 5.10 covers substitutions including some pitcher-specific rules, but I cannot find anything about during an at-bat. Section 9.16 is pretty thorough with regards to swapping pitchers between batters in ERA calculations, but I have been unable to find anything about pitching statistics where a single batter faces two pitchers during a single at-bat. "
201,When can a goalkeeper take the ball into their hands?,"A goalkeeper cannot handle the ball if a teammate passes ball to them.   But can the goalkeeper take the ball into their hands if it is deflected from the leg? Also, can they take the ball in their hands from a teammate's throw-in? "
202,Why is it that players of professional soccer leagues play in the FIFA World cup and other competitions without complaint from their managers/leagues?,"After the recent announcement by the NHL that there will not be a break in the season for the Olympics so that players can attend, I was wondering how soccer players (of all professional leagues) compete in the World Cup, or other major FIFA competitions without a complaint from their managers and leagues. In most cases professional seasons have breaks in them for players to compete in the World Cup or World Cup Qualifiers. In some cases, (for example with the MLS and the CONCACAF Gold Cup) there isn't even a break in the schedule but most players compete for their countries rather then their teams anyways.     So, I'm curious:   Why is this?         Do Soccer Leagues have less control over their players then the NHL does?   Is it just too big of a tradition to break?   Maybe there is complaint that I'm just not aware of?    Or something else?  "
203,Are there any goals scored by a referee?,"Are there any goals scored by a referee in a football match, meaning that a shot was rebounded from a referee and hit the target?  I know about this goal scored in the 80's in Brazilian league from this post, but I am looking for goals that were scored more recently and also probably in the matches that had high importance. "
204,What are the odds of seeing a grand slam in baseball,What are the odds of seeing at least one grand slam for any MLB baseball game? That is if I go to a baseball game what is the percentage chance (expected value) I'll witness a grand slam? 
205,How does the serving and swapping side cycle work after the first set?,"I know that when you start a match, you spin the racket or toss a coin and decide who serves first and who goes on what side. If you finish a set that's not a multiple of 4, say 6-3, does the person who served last now receives?  Example: Person A serves first on side 1. They keep on playing. Say A wins the set 6-3. A served in the last set on side 1. In th next set, do they swap sides and Person B serves on side 1 or does A serve again on side 1 like the start the first set?  I'm pretty sure it's the first option but when I play some people say you spin the racket again or start again like a new set. When they do it my way, they get confused when to swap sides because the rely on the number of games played, and they don't count the first set. "
206,Origin of Counter-attacking style of play in football?,"Counter-attacking is one of the most used playing strategies in football. After searching for history of this style of play I came across Wikipedia and Independent articles which mention the first use of counter-attack in football may have come from England's Keith Newton in 1970 World Cup quarter-final match against Germany, where he has set up goals for Alan Mullery and Martin Peters. So, my question is:  Is the aforementioned match the first one to use the counter-attacking style of play? And if not, which one was it and when did it take place? "
207,Which is the longest own-goal in football?,"In an recent International Champions Cup match between Chelsea and Inter Milan, Inter's Geoffrey Kondogbia scored 45-yard own goal.   Is this the longest own-goal ever scored?  "
208,How do top ranked tennis players choose ATP 250 tournaments?,"Are there a minimum number of ATP 250 tournaments top 50 players must play each year?  Also, do the players select the ATP 250 tournaments they wish to play in, or are the tournaments assigned to the players? "
209,Shortest time between grand slam walk offs,"Steve Pearce of Toronto Blue Jays hit game winning grand slam walk offs on July 27th and 30th 2017 against Oakland Athletics and Los Angeles Angels respectively.   With a 3 days span between Pearce's slams, is this the shortest time between 2 grand slam walk offs in MLB history? If not who has this record? "
210,Player with debut match perfect Hat-trick?,"Over the years in football there have been many players who have scored hat-tricks in their clubs in their international debut matches.   For example: Serge Gnabry and Dieter Müller scored hat-tricks on their international debuts, Wayne Rooney on his Manchester United debut in 2004.  Is there any player who has scored a perfect hat-trick, which is achieved when a player scores one right-footed goal, one left-footed goal and one headed goal within one match, in debut match for a club or a country? If there is one who is he? "
211,Why the pitcher (in baseball) doesn't wear a helmet?,"I am quite surprised, why the pitcher in baseball doesn't wear a helmet?  To express better, here are many heavy examples :   1st 2nd   Doesnt such incident happen often? Wont the helmet protect him?  (if wearing helmet is not comfortable, then he could just wear it only during initial seconds, and then quickly take off the helmet after ball is thrown away). "
212,Hitter reaching first although he is already out,"Something that I  noticed happening in almost every game  is the following: The hitter grounds out and the defense has an easy out on  first. The defense takes the out on the first base and the hitter, who has since become a runner, hasn't even made it halfway to the first. Yet he continuous to jog to first, he steps on it and then he retires.   Why does he continue to run, although he is out? Does it have any effect on statistics whether the runner made it to first or not?  Or maybe it is a way of the hitter to gain some confidence or even get into the pitchers/defense head. ""You didn't get me this time because you beat me to the first. Next time I will be there in time"".  Is this the case? "
213,"Tour de France general classification is identical across stages, but results are not. Why?","The general classification after Stage 5 in the Tour de France 2017 was   Christopher Froome (GBR) Team Sky 18:38:59     Geraint Thomas (GBR) Team Sky +0:00:12     Fabio Aru (ITA) Astana Pro Team  +0:00:14      Daniel Martin (IRL) Quick-Step Floors +0:00:25     Richie Porte (AUD) BMC Racing Team +0:00:39 Simon Yates (GBR) Orica-Scott +0:00:43     Romain Bardet (FRA) AG2R La Mondiale +0:00:47      Alberto Contador (ESP) Trek-Segafredo +0:00:52     Nairo Quintana (COL) Movistar Team +0:00:54    Rafal Majka (POL) Bora-Hansgrohe +0:01:01   In stage 6 none of these riders finished in the top (nor was the difference between them the same) yet after stage 6 the general classification and the time differences were identical. The only change was in Froome's time, increasing to a total of 23:44:33.  The same occurred after stage 7.   What am I missing here? Why has only the lead rider's time changed, despite several differences developing across the stages? "
214,Was Neymars transfer completely void even after committing to play until 2021?,"Is $262 million transfer completely void ?  Neymar had last year extended his contract until 2021 so is it really possible to break the contract.   If 'Yes' then why is there a contract in the first place?  If 'No' then were there any legal complications ?    Edit : I know the release clause amount was insanely undeniable, but there must be someone who had to respect the contract[either Barca or Neymar] "
215,What is the percentage of game won in alternating penalties format for team going first?,"What is the percentage of game won in current format of alternating penalties for team going first in top European football competitions?  Main reason for asking this question is ABBA system for penalty shootout. Which was recently used in FA Community Shield match between Chelsea and Arsenal. In this system, the order of penalties would see the the team going first in the shootout taking one spot-kick before their opponents take two in succession. (Trial system for penalties)  The reason for this new system is, to reduce the potential advantage that the team taking a first penalty in a shootout have. IFAB says that the experiment follows growing evidence that the current penalty shoot-out system, as laid down in the Laws of the Game to determine the outcome of a match, gives an unfair advantage to the team taking the first penalty in each pair of spot kicks.  Study of Mr. Ignacio Palacios-Huerta, Professor, London School of Economics, shows that new ABBA format cuts down advantage to 54%. While many articles claim that, in current format of alternating penalties team going first wins 60% of time.  And answer to this question will help to find out if the reason for this change is justified or not.  "
216,How is par score used in any variants of Stableford competition?,"I have seen some golf scoring systems that show the players' score in relation to par during Stableford competitions.  How is this calculated? The point of Stableford is to not worry about the number of strokes taken and just focus on the points. Is the par score in relation to the points scored or are the strokes still counted?  If the strokes are counted, how are blobs accounted for? "
217,"Serve deflected to the left hand court in a doubles match, is it a let?","In a doubles match, is it a let if a serve goes to the left hand court after touching the net?   What if the ball was heading for the right hand court and there was enough spinning to deflect it to the left hand court after hitting the net?  The ITTF Handbook doesn't clarify this edge case:     2.9.1 The rally shall be a let:      2.9.1.1 if in service the ball touches the net assembly, provided the service is otherwise correct or the ball is obstructed by the receiver   or his or her partner;   Question 5 in this link says it's not a let, but I couldn't find anything more concrete, like an actual occurrence in an official match or a more specific official rule. "
218,What is the sports bra looking thing soccer players wear?,"I've seen many male soccer players - specially famous players who play for well known teams - wear a piece of clothing that looks like a sports bra. They're usually worn during practice, and a few other times I've seen them worn under the jersey during the games. I'm guessing it has some training benefits, but what is the bra looking thing? What's the purpose of wearing it?  Here are 2 pictures of Lionel Messi and Zlatan Ibrahimovic wearing the bra.    "
219,"In Golf, can you choose to play down the 'wrong' fairway?","I am an occasional (and fairly terrible) golfer. I played a round the other day and was confronted with an odd situation. I sliced a ball through some trees and onto the adjacent fairway. I still had 200-250 metres left to the pin after this shot. When I got to my ball, I noted that the trees between me and hole or the fairway of the hole I was playing were thick and high, whereas about 150 closer to the hole, the trees really thinned out. I therefore played a shot up the 'wrong' fairway to a position where I could relatively easily chip to the green through the sparse area of trees.  This was a social game, so I wasn't too worried, but was what I did legal under the Laws of Golf? Is there any compulsion to play along the 'correct' fairway when possible? Also, aside from any letter of the law considerations, what etiquette issues might doing this present?   "
220,Why do batters sometimes chase balls well outside the strike zone?,"Here, I'm not talking about balls that barely miss the strike zone, being barely outside the plate or below the knees. More like pitches that go into the dirt, or six inches wide of the plate.  What makes batters sometimes chase such pitches? Do they really believe that they can hit them? Or has the pitcher fooled them into believing that they will be called strikes even when they miss by a wide margin? "
221,"In the NBA, why is the sign-and-trade a thing?","The sign-and-trade is relatively common when stars leave a team that they've been with for a long time. I don't understand why this practice exists. Take Lebron going to the Heat, for example. He was a free agent. He could have gone anywhere, but he chose to re-sign with the Cavs so that they could trade him to the Heat and get draft picks in return. Seemingly, this weakens the team that Lebron had just signed with, as they had weaker drafts in his first (two?) seasons there than they likely would have if he had signed with them outright.  Why does this practice exist? "
222,Any historical sports with instant-win moves?,"I was recently watching Harry Potter (because I'm super-cool), and it occurred to me: has there ever been a sport that had something akin to catching the snitch in Quidditch, where the game immediately ends in victory, regardless of how long you've been playing or how well you've been doing?  All sports I can think of generally end after a certain period of time (e.g. basketball), a certain number of turns (e.g. innings in baseball), or a certain number of milestones (e.g. holes in golf).  With all of them, though, victory is the result of earning points as you go, so the winner can be predicted with increasing certainty as the session progresses.  There may be a 9th-inning rally, but even if you turn it around in the last 2 minutes, you still have to close the distance and eventually overtake your opponent's score before you win.  Non-physical games often have instant-win conditions (e.g. checkmate in chess) where you could be doing horribly and then instantly be the winner, but are there any (or have there been any in history) physical sports that have similar potential?  I seem to recall that the ball game of the Aztecs had something like this, but the accounts I'm finding online seem to disagree with each other. "
223,NBA draft picks as a team rebuilding strategy,"I am reading about strategies that general managers use to rebuild an NBA basketball team. By rebuilding I mean the process of letting go existing players and signing new young players with the aim of making a competitive team in the future.  I was reading about the rebuilding process by the Boston Celtics, which seems to be centered around getting draft picks:     In the meantime, Ainge has been doing a great job accumulating future   draft picks, and that can only help accelerate the restocking of his   roster. When Ainge traded Jordan Crawford and former Net MarShon   Brooks to Golden State this past week in a three-way deal with the   Heat, the Celtics picked up two more draft picks. Between Ainge’s   deals with the Nets and Clippers and other moves, the Celtics now have   17 potential draft picks over the next five seasons. Some will be used   for their drafts, but others are likely to be included as sweeteners   in deals for established players.   [website]My question is: how important is it to accumulate draft picks in a rebuilding effort compared to any other available strategies? And are there examples of teams that have built competitive teams without giving up important players? For example, I would think the San Antonio Spurs as an example of a team that has had competitive teams without going through a rebuilding phase in many years. "
224,Is the WASP calculation in cricket logically correct?,"During the first ODI of India's tour of New Zealand 2014, I could see a new term named WASP on the right side of the TV screen on Sony Six - the channel broadcasting the match.    When I was searching about that, I found that it means, Winning And Scoring Prediction whose value will be changed during the match. ie, during first innings the predicted score will be displayed and during the second innings the winning percentage will be shown.   The formula for calculating WASP is mentioned here.  I can't understand it clearly. Can anyone explain it with an example?     Is it logically correct?   How does a mathematical formula differentiate   a player with form and without form?    How much values will be given for   pitch conditions according to the situation and climate?   The   performance of players like Kohli may be same in all countries, but   what about players like Ashwin and Rohit in overseas pitches?   I have many more questions, but all of them are under one topic,     Logical explanation of the formula used for calculating WASP in   cricket.  "

226,What set of rules say that scratching requires the player to take another ball out of a pocket?,From time to time I stumble upon pool players who think/thought the rule is to take a ball (other than the cue ball) out of the pocket every time you scratch but none of them knew where that rule came from. We're playing 8-ball here.  Is this a real rule or a myth? and if the former than what set of rules does it apply to?

229,Declaring Man of The Match and Man of the Series/Tournament Award,   Who holds the decision to declare Man of the Match/Man of the Series/   Tournament award?   Some sources say that it is decided by commentators and former cricket players.     How the Man of the match is decide when there are equivalent   performance from two players in the same match ?   a case in which a batsmen scores 100 runs with a good strike rate and a bowler takes a 5 wicket haul with an average economy rate.     What will be things considered while declaring a Man of the Match for   such case ?   I know it is possible to Award two man of the match. But how it is decided in other matches where there is only single man of the match award given.Any ICC rule for such case. 
230,"In volleyball when is it considered ""Reaching over the net""?","In volleyball, when is it considered ""reaching over the net""?  If my team serves, and the other team passes it close to the net, and I am front row. Can I reach over and kill it?  What about if just the slight edge of the ball crosses the plane but I kill it by reaching my hand over and touch the top part of the ball that hasn't crossed the plane yet?  I tried to read the FIVB rules and the USA Volleyball rules and I see nothing about the ball barely crossing the plane. "
231,What determines a double hit in volleyball?,"In volleyball, if the other team pass, set, hits it over to me and I kick it and then it hits my chest, but it's only one action/motion, would that count as a double hit fault?  What about if the other team attacks it, I go to set set it, and it slips through my fingers and bounces off my head - is that only one action on my part? "
232,Why do these players rub their hands on the table near the net?,"I am watching the 2012 Men's Table Tennis championship between Timo Boll (DEU.) and Ma Long (CHN.). I've never really watched a professional table tennis game, and one thing that I am seeing these two players do quite frequently is rub the inside of their hand on the table throughout times in the match. At the 15:28 mark in the video -- after an incredible rally -- both players partake in this practice. There are several instances before this point in the game, and presumably after as well, that they rub their hand near the net. In each instance both players have done it - close to simultaneously. I don't know if it has anything to do with ""being ready"", but it reminds me of in Soccer/Hockey when the referee has each keeper raise their hand to signal that they are ready to play.    Why do these players rub their hands on the table near the net throughout this match of table tennis? Is this related to a rule of any sort? Or is it more of a habit that professional table tennis players have adopted?  "
233,How are snowboard superpipe results calculated?,"While watching the Winter X-Games during snowboard superpipe, there was a scoring mechanism that wasn't clear to me. Looking into it, Shaun White had won the event six years in-a-row, and had a perfect score of 100.00 in 2012.  From what I had gathered, scoring seems to depend on difficulty of tricks, speed, height of jumps, and execution (landing tricks cleanly, etc.) among a few things. Outside of the occasional judge/commentator expressing how one can improve his next run, not much was elaborated on the scoring mechanism.  How are snowboard superpipe results calculated?   Extra: Do these calculations apply to other Winter X-Games events? "
234,What number of minimum overs bowled makes an ODI cricket match goes in record books?,"For example, a scheduled ODI 50 overs match has been reduced to 10 overs or 15 overs due to rain, and a bowler takes a hat trick in those reduced overs. Will that record or any other made or achieved such a record will go on to the record books or not?    So my basic question remains, how many minimum overs are required for a one day match to be recorded as a full one day international match? "
235,How is the WASP calculated in cricket?,"We know that in the first innings the predicted score and in the second innings the predicted winning percentage will be calculated in the WASP.   But there is only one formula for calculating both score and percentage.  V(b,w) =r(b,w) +p(b,w) V(b+1,w+1) +(1-p(b,w)))V(b+1,w)  How is this one formula enough to get two results?  This question is not related to the previous one. I’m not asking about logical explanation here; I just want to know, what is the change that they do in the formula to get the percentage for the second innings?  Providing an example is a great thing for this type of question. "

Is there a similar rule for the NFL? "
242,Why does a basketball ref raise the second arm when a 3-pt shot falls?,"When a basketball player shoots a 3-point shot, I've noticed that a referee will raise one arm straight over his head while the ball is in the air. This presumably signals to everyone that the shot is, indeed, a 3-pointer and not a 2-pointer.   But why does the ref always raise the other arm straight overhead when the shot goes in? There's clearly no need to give any indication that the shot actually was good - everyone knows that. The player who shot the ball knows it, the other team knows it, the other refs know it...everyone.   As an additional curiosity, they don't do that when a player makes a 2-point shot or a free throw. So why that extra (and seemingly useless) arm motion for a made 3-point shot? "

246,Which female football players have highest goal per game ratio for national team?,"We have similar question for men: Who is the best striker (best goals/appearances ratio) with 25/50/100+ national caps? So it seems quite natural to ask about women, too.  Which female footballers have the highest goal/matches ratio when playing for the national team? Are there players with more goals than than caps?  To avoid statistical outliers (e.g., a player who only played one match and scored two goals), it seems natural to add some restrictions. For examples, looking at players who have at least 25/50/100 caps. (Similarely as in the linked question.)  Looking at Wikipedia page List of women's footballers with 100 or more international goals (current revision) it seems that in the category 100+ there are no players with more goals than caps. Although both Elisabetta Vignotto and Marta got rather close to 1 goal per match. "

248,What is the cause for MLB regular season strikeouts to be more than hits?,"For the first time in the history of the MLB, the 2018 season saw the total number of batter hits be less than strikeouts.  See chart below:  Hits have consistently been about 10,000+ higher than strikeouts for the last 40 years.  Then, starting around 2009-2010, they have gradually decreased until this season, where strikeouts league-wide were more than hits.  What is the reason for this?  Is it a symptom of umpiring somehow?  I don't think it's steroids - it seems once a month a pitcher's name is called out for a lengthy suspension.   "

For example, in the 100m dash, all the recent Olympic and World champions have had Afro-Caribbean ancestry.  Why are so few goalkeepers at high level football black? Is there reputable scientific evidence that indicates a physiological difference between the different races which impacts their goalkeeping ability, or is the difference down to cultural factors? "
253,Can an off spinner bowl a googly?,"My question is specifically about Akila Dananjaya. He is termed as an off spinner. Yet I have seen some videos in which commentators quote few of his deliveries as 'Googly'. But, Googly is type of delivery used by Wrist spinners right? Also it rotates inward to a right handed batsmen (clockwise), so if any off spinner bowls such delivery, shouldn't it be called regular off spin delivery? "
254,Has anyone ever taken pole position without setting any fastest sector times?,"During qualifying for the 2018 Mexican Grand Prix, Max Verstappen very nearly took pole position despite not setting the fastest time in any of the three sectors.

If I tap it from above and get it bouncing again, is that a double dribble? According to the links below it seems that re-bouncing a rolling ball is allowed.  Also, does it make a difference if the ball is rolling or just sitting on the floor when I hit it to make it bounce again?  [website]NBA violations [website]Dribble definition in NBA [website]FIBA says [website]  Art. 24 Dribbling   24.1 Definition      24.1.1 A dribble is the movement of a live ball caused by a player in control of that ball who throws, taps, rolls or bounces the ball on   the floor.      24.1.2 A dribble starts when a player, having gained control of a live ball on the playing court throws, taps, rolls or bounces it on the   floor and touches it again before it touches another player.      A dribble ends when the player touches the ball with both hands   simultaneously or permits the ball to come to rest in one or both   hands. During a dribble the ball may be thrown into the air provided   the ball touches the floor or another player before the player who   threw it touches it again with his hand. There is no limit to the   number of steps a player may take when the ball is not in contact with   his hand.   and about Double Dribble:     24.2 Rule A player shall not dribble for a second time after his first dribble has ended unless between the 2 dribbles he has lost control of   a live ball on the playing court because of: • A shot for a field   goal. • A touch of the ball by an opponent. • A pass or fumble that   has touched or been touched by another player.   Reading the definitions above, it seems to me that when the ball is rolling on the floor (without bouncing) the dribble has not ended, therefore it wouldn't be double dribble to tap it and get it bouncing again "
259,Rolex Paris Masters 2018: Federer haven't decided,"This is something that really confuses me. Federer obviously still haven't decided whether or not he's gonna participate in Paris Masters. Now, how can this be, since all the other players already started? Djokovic, for instance, came to round of 16, and Federer still doesn't know whether he's gonna play?  Does it have anything to do with previous tournament score for a given player? Ie. higher ranked players don't need to start playing before the round of 8, for instance, so that gives them more time to decide whether or not to participate? If this is the "
260,Additional basketball qualification tournaments for 2020 Olympics,"Helo! I would like to ask for some help in understanding how qualifications for Olympic men's basketball tournament at 2020 Olympics work.   Firstly, i know that there would be 12 teams at basketball's tournament. One of the places is reserved for the host nation's team, in this case Japan. Next seven places is going to be determined at the World Cup in the China next year:  [website]I have a problem in understanding how additional wild card tournaments are structured. I know that the best 16 teams from World Cup that didn't qualified by the World Cup, will participate in these wild card tournaments. Now, things get a little bit more unclear, because of the following picture:    So, my question is next:  If it is going to be 4 wild card tournaments with 6 teams in each, how can they add additional 2 teams per FIBA region in addition to 16 teams from World Cup, because that gives the number of 26 teams?  Please, could anyone clarify this a little bit more? "
261,Possession in Basketball,"I am having trouble understanding possessions in basketball as it seems like there are 3 equations. One that is (FGA+0.44*FTA+TO) and another that accounts for Offensive Rebounds found here. Lastly, the main one created by Dean Oliver found here. Are the first two estimates of possession, as in a much simply way to calculate possession?  My question stems from looking at some formulas like TOV% and Points per Possession. Seems like TOV uses the equation found above and PpP uses Oliver's equation. Why does this difference exist? Also are players TOV%/PpP different than a team's TOV%/PpP? I feel like the calculation should be the same, but using the teams numbers instead of a players. "
262,Does the wide call moves with the batsman?,"If a batsman moves in his crease, right or left, does the wide also moves with him? If a right-handed batsman moves to his right and leave the stumps and the bowler bowls a ball which is in the reach of the batsman but outside the wide line, Will this be a wide call or not? "
263,How do you defend quick tap penalties?,"When a team is awarded a penalty near the in-goal, say at 5 yards, and they play a quick tap. How you defend against that? I have seen yellow cards shown for tackling the player (for example, against Argentina when playing the All Blacks at the World Cup). In that situation, what are you supposed to do? How do you avoid the try? "
264,"Can a pitcher switch throwing arms at any time during an inning, or in between pitches?","I have been playing baseball my entire life and I just thought of this question... if a pitcher is ambidextrous (can throw with both arms), is he/she able to switch throwing arms in the middle of an inning, game, or in between pitches?   I know that switch-hit batters are allowed to switch to the other side of home-plate at anytime before the pitcher is ready to pitch, but can the pitcher do the same?  Some pitchers like Billy Wagner had custom gloves made that had 6 finger slots so that he was able to use the glove on both hands at any given time, but when he pitched in games it was either left or right and not both.  Also, Billy could throw over 90 mph with both arms.  I mean if you have that god given ability why worry about changing your arm slot to try and trick the batter's view when you could just throw with the other arm? "

What is the rule on a team basket? Is there even such a thing? "
267,Why are Gabon playing in the African Cup of Nations 2017 qualifiers when they're hosts and how will group I work?,"I recently saw Sierra Leone beat Gabon in the qualifying competition for the African Cup of Nations 2017. Gabon and Sierra Leone are in qualifying group I.  But Gabon are the hosts of AfCON 2017, so they get automatic qualification.  How does this work?   Why are Gabon in the qualifiers, if they have already qualified? Can any other teams qualify from group I? Are qualifying games against Gabon the same as any other qualifying game?   I've looked on the official AfCON site but it seems to treat Gabon like any other team in the qualifiers, and I can't find any explanation elsewhere.  I read on a Sierra Leone news site that points against Gabon don't count:      The match was part of the 2017 African Cup of Nations (AFCON) group I qualifying schedule but didn’t count towards qualification as Gabon are hosting the finals in January   ...but that appears to be contradicted by the official table, which does include Sierra Leone's three points from beating Gabon:    So I'm confused about how this works. Can no-one else qualify from group I? Or are the Gabon-related points deducted and the highest-finishing team excluding Gabon qualifies? Or was the Sierra Leone news site wrong and it's simply the top team in the Group I (excluding Gabon) who qualify? Or something else?   And why are Gabon in a qualifying group in the first place when they have automatic qualification? "

Each set shall be 9 in/22.86 cm wide and shall consist   of three wooden stumps with two wooden bails on top. See Appendix A.

272,When do teams wear their away jerseys at international level?,"When will teams wear their away jerseys during the Euro Championships? Will France always wear their home jersey during the tournament?   For commercial purposes will all teams not want to play a match during a tournament in their away jersey at least once? I'm guessing that teams can wear their away jerseys if they want to as long as there is no objection from the officials. For example, Ireland wore their away jersey for three of their four matches in 1994:  [website]Maybe the players liked the jersey more... "
273,"In recent IPL T20 cricket matches, are the commentators in the stadium or watching a broadcast in a studio?","I have been watching cricket on tv for years and have occasionally seen the commentary box. Usually, the camera will be behind the commentators and the image will show the commentators watching the match from a small room, and the players will also be visible. There may be a change of commentators (somebody moving in and somebody moving out) and even then, we could see the field. More-over, commentators will be talking about events which are not visible to tv viewers, meaning it is happening outside the range of the camera. This type of video ""proves"" that the commentators are in the commentary box. Here are 2 views of general ""proper"" commentary boxes:   Surely, these commentators are in the stadium.  Now-a-days (atleast in T20 WC matches or IPL Matches) I feel that the commentators are not in the box, but are watching a broadcast stream in some studio. Here are 2 views of ""suspicious"" commentary boxes:   It is not really clear if they are in the stadium or in a small studio, pretending to be watching the match live at the stadium. The last picture is especially suspicious, because it looks like the camera will be blocking the view of the match.  My Doubt is based on 2 main points: (1) The commentators (and the change of commentators) will always shown from the front, and there will never be a view of the commentators with the field or players in view. (2) The commentators seem to say exactly what is shown on the screen and seem to be clueless of the ground situation. Eg 2A : On the tv, a ball going towards the boundary may look like it will cross it, while the commentators should be able to see a fielder running towards it. I have seen cases where the commentator was saying something like ""going to be a four [that is what we can see] ... no, a fielder gets to it at the last moment [that is when the tv shows the fielder]"", which I can make out without the redundant commentary. Eg 2B : A ball hit too high may look like a six on tv, and even the commentator will claim that it is going to be a six, but eventually we see that it has simply gone up and come down on the wicketkeeper, who takes an easy catch. After noticing this couple of years back, I have been waiting for similar comments in latest matches, but I think they have become clever and do not comment on these things now ; they wait for the tv to show what is happening and then they say what we can already see.  Beyond these two main points, I noticed two other minor points: (3) I noticed that occasionally there is the light from tv screen on the faces on the commentators. (4) I also noticed that commentators do not say anything which is not shown on the tv, Eg If umpire has asked for 3RD umpire Decision, but the tv has not shown him asking for it, then commentators too will be talking about other things, like ""boy-o-boy, at a time like this, a huge risk in trying to take a single [replay shows umpire asking for 3RD umpire Decision] and what will it be ? Out or not out ?"", where basically, they are trying to hide the fact that they are clueless until the tv shows what is happening.  We have English Commentary Broadcast (claimed implicitly to be from stadium) and Hindi Commentary Broadcast (known to be from studio) and both are similar, making me suspect that even the English Broadcast is from the studio.  In recent IPL T20 cricket matches, are the commentators in the stadium or watching a broadcast in some studio ?  I am not claiming that all commentaries are from studio, I am only saying that in some matches (especially T20 IPL) the studio is used, without informing the audience, but then they never explicitly claimed to be in the stadium, so they are not really lying. It may be that the studio is easier for bringing in Film Stars who do not want to get stuck in the huge crowds or traffic generated by IPL. It may be that commentary boxes are used as VIP seats, and commentators are asked to move out.  ((I originally asked this on Skeptics, where it was suggested that I try here, but the wording may still indicate Skepticism)) "
274,Is it a foul if no contact is made during an attempted reckless tackle?,"If a player in possession narrowly dodges a very reckless and dangerously attempted tackle, but ends up losing the possession, will this still be ruled a foul despite no contact being made?  P.S: I vaguely remember such a debate had taken place previously when in 2009 David N'Gog (Liverpool) won a penalty against Birmingham as the referee thought there was enough contact for foul. Videos proved there was no contact later and it was ruled as a dive by media. But N'Gog subsequently clarified that he didn't dive to win the penalty but rather to avoid a dangerous tackle. Many Liverpool fans claimed that it was right to award a penalty in that case while other called it blatant dive. But what do the rules say? "

Why isn't the combined discipline the same for both genders? I understand that individual events are adapted (like 110m hurdles for men and 100m hurdles for women, or a 800g javelin for men but 600g for women), but why don't men run an heptathlon or women a decathlon instead?

281,Why did baseball players start wearing gloves but cricket players not?,"From this article The Last American Baseball-Glove Maker Refuses to Die     In the early days of baseball, it was considered unmanly to use a glove. Broken bones were common. The first mass-produced gloves had little padding and no fingers. In the 1920s and ’30s, companies started producing gloves with a web between the thumb and forefinger, to create a pocket.   So there once was a time when baseball players didn't wear gloves. Hence the questions:   Why didn't cricketers ever start wearing gloves? Is fielding in baseball really more liable to lead to finger injuries than cricket fielding?  "

How the game would have been then restarted, namely, if Benzema was fouled at this very moment:    The possible outcomes that I think of are:   Penalty (benefits non-offending team) Indirect free kick from the nearest spot to the foul (benefits offending team) Dropped ball from the nearest spot to the foul (benefits offending team)  "

UP         Extreme caution is recommended regarding supplement use.      The use of dietary supplements by athletes is a concern because in   many countries the manufacturing and labeling of supplements may not   follow strict rules, which may lead to a supplement containing an   undeclared substance that is prohibited under anti-doping regulations.   A significant number of positive tests have been attributed to the   misuse of supplements and taking a poorly labeled dietary supplement   is not an adequate defense in a doping hearing.   And in PROHIBITED LIST:        CAN I TEST POSITIVE FOR INGESTING GLYCEROL FOUND IN FOODSTUFFS AND TOILETRIES OR FOR USING IT AS A LUBRICANT? UP         Glycerol is prohibited as a plasma expander. The consumption of   quantities of glycerol far beyond those commonly found in e.g. foods,   beverages, personal care products, medicinal tablets tuffs, cough   syrup is required to produce an Adverse Analytical Finding. Therefore,   its prohibition is not intended to prevent the ingestion of this   substance in the amounts commonly found in foodstuffs and toiletries,   as such small quantities will not cause an athlete to test positive   for this Prohibited Substance.      In addition, athletes with disabilities may use glycerol as a   lubricant agent for a catheter but this will not cause a problem in a   doping control for the aforementioned reasons.   Is there any cases like positive doping test because athlete ate some meat that was grown with hormones or steroids?  I am not asking about medicine. I am asking about daily food, is there anything that should be avoided? "

(Why does the clásico of Supercopa is played at 11 PM), they say (my translation from Spanish):     Because that day there are Champions League calification matches, which are played at the normal time 20:45, and UEFA imposes no official matches to be played while their own official competitions are being played. So Spanish Supercopa could not be played between 8.45 PM and 10.30 PM.   However, what is the reasoning for UEFA to have this rule? Since they are completely different competitions, what is the problem on having them on the same time? "

289,In Tennis rankings what does 10+45 mean in terms of getting ranking points?,"I have been figuring out the ranking system in tennis recently. I took a look at the page for the 2017 Men's singles for the US Open.  It has the current ranking points for each player, how many points they are defending at the US Open and the minimum number of points they will end up on afterwards (assuming they play and lose one match).  However, one line I could not figure out was:     30 | Argentina | Diego Schwartzman | 1,280 | 10+90 | 10+45 | 1,235 | First round vs.    So, he is defending 10+90 points from last year. Last year Diego Schwartzman got knocked out in the first round and did not have to come through qualifying so should have gotten 10 points surely? Also it says his minimum for this year is 10+45 but surely it should be 10?  He is the only player listed like this (everyone else has 10 as their minimum ranking points) and I can't figure out where the 90 and 45 points come from. "

293,Rank teams in different divisions when there is little inter-division play?,"How would one rank teams in different divisions when there is little inter-division play?  Basic ELO wouldn't work because if the lowest team in the top division beats the highest team in the lowest division there will be a huge delta for the top division team, even though they might not be that good. Also, the top teams in each division could have similar ELO ratings even though they are vastly different levels.  Also of note is that sometimes teams move up or down divisions through the season, so a team is not fixed to a division necessarily.  I'm thinking maybe some sort of strength-of-schedule, but that is also problematic with top teams in the different divisions.  Any ideas as to how best achieve this ranking? "

For example in Cincinatti Masters 2017 Fabianno took Federer's seed 2 place in the draw. No other rotations happened here. Why is it different in the US Open?  What is the criteria for these movements? Is it random, or do they answer to certain rules? "

So I had to decipher the game by myself.  One particular rule that I have always had hard times figuring out is the interference. So what I know is that when the QB throws a high/deep ball to a WR the defender who's running with the WR cannot interfere with the receiver until some arbitrary point.   Seeing as the sport is a physical, contact-based one how do you defense if you can't really tackle a player going for a touchdown or a major 1st? Could someone explain this rule in plain English (i.e. please no c/p from a rulebook)?  "
296,Coaching a (low-interest) collegiate fencing club,"I am the assistant volunteer coach for a collegiate fencing club.  The coach is keen on teaching fencing fundamentals and some advanced maneuvers.  I am his second set of eyes and goto for general fitness, for example, introducing new routines for warmups and conditioning.  We were/are working toward putting fencing back on the map at our university (about 20 core members in 2006, 4 in 2012). Last school year, we started from scratch, but we started out with good interest. As the year progressed, interest dropped and ""storms"" came. For next year (as it currently stands), we have about two chief members of the club.  During winter break last school year, we were brainstorming how to collect more interest. Two things that came up were:   The coach being too hard on the ""casual"" members. Lack of diversity within the club.....as in, each member had interest in rpg, magic the gathering, sword fighting, etc and held rpg gatherings twice a week. I would like to see a diverse team stay involved, feel included, and help one another out.   To combat coach being too hard, we ""cupcaked"" our drills, and that proved to be a huge mistake. We also made an attempt to include others interested in fencing without an outside interest in rpgs and such (this didn't work either...I can hang out with anybody, but this was overkill).  On top of all that, all the PR material I made had to be changed when the club president didn't reserve our usual spot for the semester (as volunteers, coach and I have no administrative say over this). That took the wind out of our sails and started a rough semester. At least we closed out the semester well, gathering interest and praise at a local children's festival.   As we brainstorm, I have a general plan of attack as we approach the upcoming year. This includes:   A monthly newsletter for our e-mail list. PR (flyers, brochures, etc.) fresh and hot out of the oven when the school year starts. Perhaps reserving a table in a common area to gather interest and spread the word. An interest meeting for new/returning members to see how involved they want to get (casual or competitive) before the annual club fair Keep our baggage at the door. This was an issue to a greater extent two years ago, but I believe this also applies to the ""lack of diversity"" within the club. I would like to see a diversified team, rather than a copy of the same person across the board. Keep a challenging workout. We don't ever push people beyond what they can bear, but we also motivate and encourage progress as well.   I know individuals without lack of motivation is beyond our control, but we also want to properly deal with individuals who carry dead weight. For example, one of our chief members started out as a difficult case last year, but she eventually became one of the hardest working members of the club by the end of the year. A former chief member who felt overwhelmed with tasks pointed the finger at others and didn't do much herself, and she eventually quit.  Is there anyone who can share his/her strategy for our situation? The main points I'm asking advice for is team diversity/chemistry and maintaing interest while executing challenging routines/drills to encourage progress. PR is one thing, but how do we gather and maintain a core group of individuals to coach? "

298,New bike = new pain. Solution: Training or bike fitting,"I've never been much of a bicyclist, but recently I finally broke down and bought a new road bicycle (Specialized Allez model).  The sales tech sized me with the bike, made a few adjustments at time of sale.  I did not spring for the $125 fitting where all the micro-adjustments are made to the bike and me.  This weekend I competed in a short sprint triathlon, my first since buying the bike.  On the 5k run portion (which follows biking) I had incredible lower back pain, right in the curve above my glutes.  The pain was intolerable when I jogged, so I ended up walking over half the run leg.  The pain subsided with time and I finished the race.  I have no history of any back problems.  My question: Is this a training problem where I need to get busy with some exercises to strengthen my lower back, or are there adjustments that need to be made to the bike?  Is this a common problem when acclimating to a new bike?  I should add that I'm a 51 year old male. "
299,Managing split tees in golf,"This week at golf's US Open, groups are teeing off the 1st and 9th holes. This is because the 9th tee is closer to the clubhouse than the 10th tee (i.e. logistics).  Split tees usually have groups tee off the 1st and 10th holes. However, wouldn't this kind of arrangement introduce more bottlenecks (assuming the same number of players tee off per group - eliminating the ""uneven group"" variable)? For example, one group gets held up. This holds the other groups back, eventually affecting groups who teed off the other hole to be affected.   How do golf organizers deal with split tee times and its risks, as it seems to introduce more unpredictable variables than traditional tee times? "
300,What should a referee do if he physically obstructs a player?,"In the Euro 2012 match between Spain and Ireland, the referee actually ended up tackling down a player who was receiving the ball from his defense and moving off to dribble through the incoming players, resulting in a situation where Spain had a great chance of scoring based on this mistake by the referee. Involuntary it may be, but he had a direct effect on the game, unlike the ball hitting him on its course, or a player running in to him.  Here's a video link of the incident: [website]So my question is whether or not the referee should/could/must do something to compensate the team for his mistake?  "
301,How do different skate wheel setups affect performance?,"I've seen inline skates (for speed skating mostly) in a wide variety of set-ups w/r/t wheel diameter:   OOOO: 4x100; 4x110 (typical) OOO: 3x110 (a Powerslide model) OOoO: 3x100+1x90; 3x110+1x100 (again some Powerslides) ooooo: 5x80 (I used to see some setups like this)   I assume the bigger the wheels, the better - in general.  The justification for setup 3 seems to be to lower the skater's center of gravity while keeping most wheels big. Does this really make a difference?  How does wheel count affect performance? My intuition fails me here- less bearings seem to imply less friction, but OTOH more stress on each bearing could result in more friction overall. What's the rule here? What's the profit from using a 3-wheel setup instead of a 4-wheel setup? "
302,Why did Greece go through over Russia in Euro 2012?,"Given that both Greece and Russia were tied on 4 points, with Russia having +2 goal difference and Greece having +0, why did Greece finish higher than Russia (and thus progress to the knock-out stages) in the group in Euro 2012?  Country     W   D   L   GD  Pts Czech Rep.  2   0   1   -1  6 Greece      1   1   1   0   4 Russia      1   1   1   2   4 Poland      0   2   1   -1  2   This question seems to indicate Russia should be favoured over Greece (and this is what I thought was the case as well?) "
303,What percent of corner kicks turn into goals?,"I have looked around for this statistic without luck.  I just wondered what percentage of corner kicks actually result in a goal? Not necessarily straight in, but from the same passage of play. I have seen answers (without any references) varying from 2.5% (feels too  low) to 32% (surely way too high).  Anyone know? "
304,Stars on football players' shirts,I know that the number of stars on a football team's shirt shows how many times they were champion. For football clubs it corresponds to their continental champions league.   But what about national teams? Does it show number of continental championships or the number of world championships?  Can we say that number of stars relates to the tournament that the team participates in? 
305,How can I get started in golf?,"I've never played any golf before, outside of a small bit of putt-putt. It looks like it might be fun, and I think I'd like to get started. I have some friends that play, and to hear them talk, they're pretty good. I don't want to just bug them into taking me along since as a total amateur, I'm sure I'd just grind their day to a halt.  What can I do to take the first steps of learning to play the sport. Should I get in contact with a golf coach somehow? Are there classes for this kind of thing?  Also, I see all the expensive golf gear for sale in sporting goods stores. How much should I really need to invest just to start playing at a reasonable level? "
306,"What is BABIP in Baseball, and what does it tell us?",How does one get a high/low BABIP?  Is this statistic for hitters and/or pitchers?  What does a high/low BABIP mean?  Definition: BABIP = (Hits - Homeruns) / (At Bats - Strikeouts - Homeruns + Sacrifice Flies) 
307,Alternate Team to Super Bowl?,"On Monday, January 19, 2015 the NFL announced they were investigated the New England Patriots for deflating footballs (to make it easier to handle) during the AFC Championship game against the Indianapolis Colts.  Does the NFL have a rule in place for sending an alternate team to the Super Bowl if one of the original two teams (winners from the AFC/NFC championships) is found ""ineligible"" due to punishment or suspension?  If so, would who would be the alternate? "
308,"Would it be possible for a kicker from a ""non-traditional"" background to be drafted by an NFL team?","Almost all football players are drafted out of college, rather than high school, because the extra ""seasoning"" in college makes them league ready, or nearly so (this is not true in baseball).  But suppose there was a high school kicker, who could routinely kick field goals from the 50-year line or further? Would a major league team consider drafting him or her for that particular skill without the further practice in college on the theory that ""kicking"" ability is basically independent of what else happens on the field (there is normally no contact for the kicker.) Or are anti-kick defenses much better in the ""pros"" than in high school? According to NFL rules, this could take place only several years after the high school graduation, unless this person applied for, and was granted ""special eligibility,"" so maybe this person maintains the skill in junior college or abroad.  And most people who are, say, 5' 5"" and 170 pounds (like the Houston Astros' Jose Altuve) would not be considered ""playable"" on an NFL football field, particularly if female. But could ""kicker"" be an exception to this rule? "
309,Is it considered possible for women to compete with men professionally in team sports played with a ball other than baseball?,"In Little League play, a 13-year old girl, Mo'ne Davis, stunned the baseball world with her 70 mph fastball. Assuming that she ""fills out"" adequately during her adolescence, it is at least within the realm of possibility that she will develop a 90+ mph fastball with the requisite control to pitch in the majors. And if not her, perhaps another woman like her.  This situation came about because in baseball, you ""play the ball, not the man."" Assuming you have the required skills to handle the ball, you don't have to worry about being ""overpowered"" by a larger man.  Are there other sports other than baseball (or tennis, another ""non-contact"" sport) where there are female high schoolers (or college players) ""coming up"" that could plausibly play professionally against men? Or are the odds considered too long in contact sports? "
310,Why have the number of power play opportunities steadily decreased since the 2005-2006 NHL season?,"According to NHL stats found here, the number of total power play opportunities went from:   14,390 during the 2005-2006 season to  10,227 during the 2008-2009 season to  8,055 during the 2013-2014 season.   In 2005-2006, the lowest number of power play opportunities by a team belonged to the Florida Panthers with 411(1), and in 2008-2009, the highest number of power play opportunities by a team belonged to the Montreal Canadiens and the Carolina Hurricanes with 374 each(2).  In 2008-2009, the lowest number of power play opportunities by a team belonged to the New Jersey Devils with 307(2), and in 2013-2014, the highest number of power play opportunities by a team belonged to the Philadelphia Flyers with 294(3).  Why have the number of power play opportunities steadily decreased since the 2005-2006 NHL season? Excluding the lockout-shortened 2012-2013 season, there has not been one increase in the number of power play opportunities. Have there been changes, such as rule, officiating, or playing style changes, that objectively explain this phenomenon? Or are other factors in play? "
311,What is the line marked at the first slip for the spinner?,What is the line marked at the first slip for the spinner? There is a light green grass at the end of pitch where the first slip for spin bowler stands or an umpire stands.I want to know why that grass is light coloured near the pitch and what is that line marked with light green color at the end of the pitch?  You can see the image below     
312,Purposely not getting a batsman out?,"If the fielding team notices that one of the batsmen on the batting team is having a bad day, will they give up a chance at taking a wicket in order to keep him on the field? For example, if the batsman has a terrible strike rate and then he pops the ball up and it could be an easy out, will the fielder purposely not catch the ball in order to keep him on the field and continue being a liability to the batting team, especially if the batsmen ahead in the order are more dangerous? "
313,HEMA Longsword Compasses,"I am a novice swordsman, learning Italian Longsword from Guy Windsor's The Swordsman's Companion, which so far has been a very helpful and instructive book. I have a question concerning the Mulinello (Windmill, or Compass) exercise, as the pictures and wording only explain so much.  When Mulinello are done in reverse, you end up in something like Posta Longa (Long Position) or Posta Finestra (Window Position), but with your false edge up. The golden rule for guards is to go from a guard to a guard. Given this, how do you from your awkward ""post-reverse-Mulinello"" stance to a proper one? (As a bonus question: would this situation come up in sparring without you being totally exposed?)  After some experimentation, I have found some solutions, but I do not trust my opinion as a novice. They are:   Simply twist your wrists around into Posta Longa or Posta Breve Perform another Mulinello to get to Posta Longa Go into Posta Finestra.   It should be noted that I am looking for an answer from a someone with Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA) background. I would make the HEMA tag, but I don't have the requisite reputation here yet. "
314,Why is an I-formation back not a receiving threat?,"I am reading Pat Kirwan's book, Take Your Eye Off the Ball, and he states in Chapter 4 (Ground Rules) that ""a [running] back in the I formation is not considered a receiving threat.""  Why is this so?   Does it have to do with the types of backs that are used in I-formation (e.g., heavier, less agile, more North-to-South runners)?  Or, is there something about the back's positioning in the I-formation that reduces the probability that he's a receiving threat?  Or, is it some combination of the two? "
315,Why are tennis balls not airtight?,"I know tennis balls go flat (even if all they do is sit there) because the interior of the ball is actually pressurized above normal atmospheric pressure, and over time some of the air leaks out.  The question is, why aren't the balls manufactured with some material lining the interior that's properly airtight (creating balls that should never go flat)?  Do the rules of the game prohibit that sort of thing?  Or is it more that manufacturers would rather keep selling you new balls?  Or something else? "
316,Lowest score that has never scored by a batsman in an innings?,"What is the lowest score that has never been scored by a batsman in an innings? For instance, there is no player who has ever scored an 82 in T20Is. Is there a further lower score that has never been scored?  It would be great if you could answer for Test, ODIs and T20s each.  "
317,Why don't basketballers take more long shots?,"Lately, I ran into a discussion about how basketballers barely take long shots and are often looking to break through for dunking. I'm from the Netherlands, and there is this sport called ""korfball"" which is pretty similar to basketball. The word ""korf"" translates to something which is pretty similar to a basket.  In korfball, you're not allowed to walk when you're in possession of the ball, which results in having to pass the ball around at a very high rate to be able to break through.  The defending team tries to find a balance between holding back (preventing break throughs) and blocking shots.  More important, korfballers do not care too much about not being able to break through, as (at a high level) their accuracy is crazy and they score the vast majority of their long shots. Their accuracy pushes defenders to give away less space, which opens up possibilities for breaking through.  Here is a video to get a feel of their typical accuracy:  [website]My question is as follows: why don't basketballers simply take the ""long"" shot as soon as they approach the three-point line? At that distance, they are rarely so strongly defended that their shots would get blocked. I often see attempts of players trying to break through, aborting mission and taking the shot from a closer (and strongly destabilised) position. Why not take your time and shoot from a couple of meters back? Korfballers shoot (and score) from much greater distances all the time.  Even more, assuming that basketballers can have an equal accuracy, scoring from the three-point line will push the defenders forward, creating more space for their beloved dunks.   Some data to support my question:   A basketball weights 650 gram, whereas a korfbal weighs about 500 grams. A neglectable difference, if you ask me. Radius of a korfbal, korfbal ""basket"" and their ratio (the lower, the more difficult): 11 cm, 15 cm, 1.36 Radius of a basketball, radius of the hoop and their ratio (the lower, the more difficult): 12.5 cm, 22.8 cm, 1.82 The basketball net is at a height of 3 meter, whereas a korfbal ""basket"" is at a height of 3.5 meter.  The 3-pointer line is at a distance of 6.75 meter, whereas korfbal players regularly take shots in the range of 15-10 meter Lastly, there is a board behind the basketball net which makes scoring easier   Interested in hearing your opinion! "
318,Comment my off days training routine (boxing),"I'm a boxer training 3 times a week. I run for about 50 minutes on all other days and when I'm feeling fresh I also jump rope for between 15 and 30 minutes after running. During training there's a lot of push ups, quite some squats and a bit of crunches. It's not enough for me. Naturally I want to focus on the muscle groups most important for boxing: [website]My weight is right for the class I compete in. I'm 5 ft 9 in and weigh a little over 165 lbs.  I do the following bodyweight exercises at home (I realized early on that I don't need weights because I'm a short stocky guy and develop muscles quickly without having to use any weights):  On one day I will focus on triceps and legs (2 exercises for each) with pushups, dips, squats and lunges.  The other day I focus on biceps, back and abs with neutral grip pull ups, situps and some lower back exercises from a lying facedown position. I sometimes also use my pullup bar to get into a dead hang position and then bring my knees up to a 90 degree angle or rotate both knees left and right so the crunches aren't the only exercise for abs.  Do the 2 workouts complement each other well? Are dips necessary when I'm also working my triceps all the time with push ups? "
319,Why do some players have trouble finishing off a point in tennis?,"I played a match with a 19 year old girl (division ? college player). During warm up we were hitting back and forth, she hit hard, had some spin, was pretty consistent, I thought this was going to be a good match.   But then, when we started playing, she couldn't finish the points. When we had rallies she did ok, but when it came to a short ball, or trying to put it away, she would overhit it, or hit it into the net. So it ended up being an easy short match. Maybe if she just stuck with the rallies more, and not tried being so aggressive she would have done better.  I have heard from some friends having problem with that too. They can rally, but then can't put away a short ball. Why is that? "
320,Breathing issues in swimming,"I am learning to swim, but my biggest problem is breathing; not only does my heart rate rise rapidly, but I get out of breath quickly. I have read that proper exhaling plays an important role, but how do I know if I have exhaled completely? I workout 5 times a week, and I am indeed fit, but in the pool it seems like it's an entirely different challenge. Also when I turn my face to breathe, I start breathing from my nose. How do I develop the habit of breathing from my mouth? How different is it to breathe on land vs. water? How long should I keep my face turned to breathe? I can barely turn my face for a second, I guess, so how can I breathe in such a short span? Even if I breathe, it's insufficient. Is there anyone who suffered with the same problem while learning to swim? If yes, then how long did it take to overcome that issue, and how? "
321,Meaning of sticky pitch,What is the meaning of sticky pitch in cricket? Does it help the bowler or the batsmen? If it helps the bowler than which type of bowler? And where most of the sticky pitches are found in which part of the world? 
322,Can a batsman hit a six on dead ball?,"If batsman hits a six on dead-ball,It'll be counted in total runs or not?  I have seen in a VIDEO that Australian player is hitting a six on a dead ball and Umpire is giving sign of 6 runs. How runs can be counted on a dead-ball? "
323,"Does a sack count as a Tackle For Loss, and/or a Tackle?","I like to look at player statistics, and I always see the Tackle stat, the Sack stat, and sometimes the Tackle For Loss stat. Is there some overlap in the stats so that a Sack counts as a Tackle?  ie) A player has 7 sacks in one season, and 81 tackles, and 23 tackles for loss. Is there overlap so that they actually had 74 tackles and seven of them were counted as sacks, and they had 16 tackles for loss, but again, seven of them were counted by sacks. Does anybody know if there is overlap, and some stats are have duplicates, or do they not count a sack as a TFL or a tackle? "
324,What is the longest time a football team has gone without being behind?,"Meaning, being in a winning or drawing position. For context, if a team won but was behind during the game it doesn't count. 1. In the top 5 leagues? 2. In any league, if this information exists? "
325,How to clean and frame an autographed jersey?,I recently bought my dad an autographed Colorado Avalanche jersey for his birthday. I am wondering what the next steps are with the jersey to get it cleaned and framed. Are there places that handle this sort of thing? Can I do it myself? 
326,How would a player waived by two teams in the same season get paid?,"In the off-season, the Oklahoma City Thunder traded Carmelo Anthony to the Atlanta Hawks, who immediately waived his contract. After clearing the waivers, Melo was then signed by the Houston Rockets for the veteran's minimum.  With recent news pointing towards the Rockets also waiving Melo, I'm confused as to how Melo would be paid for his contract since it wouldn't have been bought out by any of the teams he was involved with this season.  If I remember correctly, Atlanta still has to pay Melo for the amount his OKC contract was worth even though it doesn't count towards their cap. But if Houston waives him, wouldn't they still have to pay him for that new contract?  Would both Atlanta and Houston need to pay Melo for the contracts they got from the trade/signed him on? "
327,NBA Free Agency vs. Draft for foreign players,"I have a question related to how non-US/CAN players may join a NBA team. I understand that getting drafted should be usually preferred from the players' perspective, as you have a guaranteed salary in case you are actually signed. However, one could also sign at a NBA team as a free agent.  My question is the following: Luka Doncic entered the NBA this year as the one of the first draft picks. Arguably, as a EuroLeague MVP, he is more certain to become a top player than most other players at his age. Could he instead have negotiated with other NBA teams and just sign there? This way, he may have not ended up with a lottery team.There must have been a team with salary space willing to pay him above rookie salary. Are there any rules preventing this? "
328,Dress code at tennis tournaments on clay,"Could a player at a tennis tournament on clay wear an outfit (shirt, shorts, etc.) that is the same colour as the colour of the playing surface? Could this be used as an advantage against an opponent?  Are players allowed to paint or dress themselves in the same colour as the colour of the playing surface? "
329,"Why do Wrestlers not step on their opponents backs, when running the ropes?","In Wrestling, it is often seen, that down opponents turn from their backs to their bellies, when an opponent is running the ropes, which prompts their opponent to jump over them rather than just stepping on them.  Is there an in-universe or kayfabe reason for this? It seems like an unwritten law and other than, they might roll an ankle, I can't really think of an explanation.  See here for an example. "
330,"In Statistics, Does a Missed Shot While Being Fouled Still Count as a Missed Shot?","During a game, players get fouled a lot, and they often throw up a shot, to try to have an opportunity to get more points. When you throw up a shot while fouled, in your game statistics, does it count as a missed shot, or do they only count it if you make it because you were fouled? Is there a more common way of counting this? "
331,Team start with an old ball after enforcing follow on within 30 overs in Cricket,"Can a fielding side start bowling in an innings with the same/old ball after enforcing the follow on, having bowled out the opponents with in 30 overs previously? FOr example, Pakistan today bowled New Zealand out today in 35.5 overs and enforced follow on, now could they start with an old ball in second innings? "
332,Is there any difference between the size of a cricket ball for men and women in cricket? if yes then Why?,Cricket ball is heavy weighted in both cases for men and women but is there any difference between the size of cricket ball that is used for women and men? if the answer is yes then what the reason behind this difference?

335,How does the RB know when to grasp the ball on a read option and when the QB is selling the fake?,"In American football, on read-option plays, how does the RB know when to fully grasp the ball and when not to because the QB ""pulls"" the ball?  Commentators praise the QB on plays where he sticks the ball in the belly of the RB, only to pull the ball at the very last second and keeps it for a huge gain.  In slow motion, it really looks like the ball is in the stomach of the RB with the RB's hands almost around the ball when the QB pulls it.  They have also blamed the QB/RB when there's a fumble because of miscommunication due to:   the QB deciding to handoff the ball but the RB doesn't grasp the ball and it gets fumbled away or the QB tries to pull the ball but the RB has already fully grasped the ball and the ball gets knocked/pulled out by the QB and is fumbled.   I know teams who run a read-option offense probably practice these plays a lot so they ""know"", but as a layman, I'd like to know how the RB ""knows"" what the QB is going to do.  Does the QB bark some code word before handing/keeping the ball or they both ""know"" because they both read the DE and know what the other is going to do and the fumbles are just unfortunate mistakes? "
336,When are (American) football teams likely to decline penalties?,"In the first quarter of the Super Bowl, the Seahawks threw an incomplete pass on first down, leading to second down.   Except that the offense had a ""false start,"" for a five yard penalty. The Broncos accepted it, and it was first and 15 instead of second and 10.  Why would the Broncos prefer the extra five yards instead of declining the penalty for a loss of a down? My understanding is that fewer opportunities for ""conversion"" often outweighs the distance.  Unless the penalty decision was governed by field position? The Seahawks started from the Broncos 30, and were pulled back to the 35, toward the edge of field goal range. "
337,Three Point Field Goal Point of Release,"Does the point of release have to on/behind the three-point line to make a successful 3-pt field goal?  Or can one release the ball from anywhere in mid-air, provided their last step was outside the circle? (Imagine a lay-up from outisde the circle)  I expect that the rules on this are the same for FIBA and NBA. "
338,What happens if the ball is bounced into the basket?,"What happens when I bounce-pass the ball into the basket, like in a circus shot? Does this count as a successful basket? "
339,Is a match forfeit always scored as 3-0 regardless of situation?,"A match forfeit is usually scored as a 3-0 loss to the team forfeiting the game. But, could a team use this to your advantage by forfeiting a game in which they could potentially lose by more?  For eg: in a two-legged encounter, if I manage to win the first leg by more than 3 goals, can I forfeit the second leg and still qualify on aggregate.  I know this is totally against the spirit of football, but is there anything in the rulebook that prevents this? "
340,When did the football match time fixed to 90 minutes?,"As the international football matches are being played for several years. It may have different playing time/periods in the beginning.  I would like to know two things,   Is there any play time for football matches other than 90 minutes? In cricket, there are 5 days matches, one day and 3 hours matches are there. (Just to point out, feel free to edit). When did the time fixed for 1.5 hours in international matches?  "
341,What is the longest game that yields result finally,"Are there any sports other than Test Cricket played over the course of five days to achieve a result? Even in Cricket, the match may end in a draw, which means no result is obtained. But, is there any sport available, that takes as long to play and achieves a result at the end? "
342,Who has scored the most goals as a substitute?,"EPL has had quite a few prolific super-subs (from Solksjaer to probably Chicharito today). Who has scored the most goals as a substitute in the EPL?  Note: If statistics aren't available since 1991, feel free to give an answer from the year of availability of statistics    Also, who has scored the most winners as a substitute? "
343,Can I use my hand to hit the ball on table tennis?,"I've read in somebody's comment in another question:     USA Table Tennis rules:   2.5.7 A player strikes the ball if s/he   touches it in play with his/her racket, held in the hand, or with   his/her racket hand below the wrist.   2.5.8 A player obstructs the ball   if s/he, or anything s/he wears or carries, touches it in play when it   is above or traveling towards the playing surface, not having touched   his/her court since last being struck by the opponent.   Does that mean that I can use my hand to hit the ball?  But only my racket hand? Does that mean that when you miss the ball with the racket, but actually hits it with a finger or something, it's still a valid play? Does that tell me that it's illegal to hit the ball with my free hand?  Please, don't base your answers on the interpretation of that snippet alone, maybe there are varations of this rule in other countries, for instance. "
344,Helmets in alpine skiing vs cycling,"I am wondering why the helmets used in different sports disciplines are so different, especially considering professional athletes.  Alpine skiing (source)   Cycling (source)   Of course I understand that there are two major requirements   Comfort Safety   For cycling it is more important to have ambient cooling, so they designed a helmet with holes to accomplish this. This does make sense to me.  However, in the time trial, maybe comfort is sacrificed  Time trial helmet (source)    Now, these helmets are looking more alike, but they are still different. For the cycling I know that the tail is designed for optimal aerodynamics (and I suppose safety is still carefully tested). For the alpine skiing helmet such a tail is not use, why is that?  Side note: I know that Dtuch Olympic champion Bob de Jong (speed skating), wears is shoulder-long hair in a tight not to recreate such a tail, so it might add something? "
345,How do the penalties work in biathlon?,"I watched the Sochi 2014 Biathlon Men's Sprint today.  In the Sprint race, the racers start separately, at 30 second intervals, and the racers stop twice along the cross-country ski course to shoot at five targets: once from a laying down position and once from a standing position.  If they miss any of their targets, they are assessed a penalty.  My question is: how does the penalty work?  Does time get added on to their result if they miss, or do they get time taken off for each target they make, or is there some other method for penalizing misses in the target shooting portion of the race? "
346,Does the tension of a tennis racket really affect the game play?,"I'm an amateur who has played for a couple of years. In the beginning I bought just a random racket - ""for beginners"", they say. Then I saw some Big Helmet tournaments and got curious about players who punch their rackets and change the behavior.  How exactly does the tension affect the game?  And if the tension really matters, then how will I know if I need to restring?  Does it make sense to try to play with a different racket - will I ""feel"" the difference? "
347,Can the Duckworth-Lewis method result in a tie?,Is it possible for a match to be tied after applying the Duckworth-Lewis method?  Are there notable instances of this occurring? 
348,"Gold, silver, and bronze medal sweep in Winter Olympics by a single country?","I am proud to see that the Dutch athletes have now obtained Gold, Silver and Bronze for one event, and that even twice.  When trying to figure out whether this happened before, I found several occurrences of a country getting all medals for an event during the Summer Olympics. But has this ever happened before in the winter games? And has it ever happened twice in the same games? "
349,Why don't bobsleigh drivers customise their helmets like racing drivers do?,"In motorsport, it is the norm for drivers to customise their crash helmets; mostly to express their personality but sometimes to advertise their sponsors too.  Bobsleigh has some similarities with motor sports, not least the requirement to wear crash helmets. Unlike luge and skeleton (which both use specially designed helmets) bobsleigh appears to be use bike/car racing helmets. For the most part, bobsleigh drivers appear to simply race with a ""stock"" helmet showing no more than the helmet manufacturer or plain white - i.e. no personalisation. Where a design or pattern is used, this design seems to be  adopted by both the driver and the brakeman (so cannot be considered ""personal"").   Given that the sleds and the competitors' lycra suits are often customised (i.e. not just off the shelf), is there any particular reason for helmets not being customised too? Is there a rule that prevents this, for example? (Ben commented below to point out that this is not the case - helmets sometimes adopt these team colours too).  To be clear - I am asking why personal helmets aren't used and my question isn't just limited to Olympic competitions. "
350,Are there strategical differences between two-man and four-man bobsled?,"During the winter Olympics, I notice that there is a bobsled event with two men per sled as well as a bobsled event with four men per sled.  Are there strategical differences between two-man and four-man bobsled? If so, what are they? I would imagine navigating the track would be slightly different due to less/extra weight. "
351,What are the technical differences between skeleton and luge?,"In skeleton, participants run at the start, then dive onto their sled front-first.  In luge, participants begin on their sleds, and use their hands to start before lying back-first.  It has been documented that skeleton is slower than luge (and bobsled)(1).   What are the technical differences between skeleton and luge? "
352,Suspension across Spanish competitions?,"In the Spanish competition (La Liga), a player will be suspended after collecting five yellow cards. What happens if this player collects his fifth yellow card of a season, but in a cup match (Copa del Rey)? Will he also get suspended, or are these bookings counted separately? Is there any relationship between the different competitions regarding yellow cards?  "
353,Running in strong wind,"I ran an extremely windy half-marathon yesterday, and this got me thinking.  In medium- to long-distance races (say 10km to a marathon), what are good strategies for dealing with strong headwind and crosswind?  For example, would running in a pack have helped? "
354,How long should a medal ribbon be?,"I made some custom medals for some friends, who are running a race soon.  But I have doubts about how long I should make the ribbon. Too short and it will be like a necklace, too long and it will go down to the waist.  I have never won a medal myself, so I have nothing to measure by and compare to. (I have won trophies though, so don't feel sorry for me hehe.)  When I say length, I mean the length of the string (flat silk fabric) from end to end. Since it's tied in one end forming a loop, I suppose you could also call it the circumference if you were to lay it out as a circle.  What is the common length? Or should I just estimate from how it hangs on myself, aiming for the upper part of the chest? "
355,Does bat tampering exist in cricket?,"I have been going through this post when I stumbled across this doubt.  Is there anything like bat tampering in cricket?  I did a quick search through the Lords Laws of cricket, however, I haven't found any.  If there exists something like tampering related to the bat, then is there an official name for that? "
356,Why are woodbats preferred to train with over aluminum bats?,"Let me start this off by saying that I have played baseball my whole life, and actually played in college (not for a club team.. the actual team) and  I can't think of why this method of training is preferred.  A lot of younger, developing players (middle school, high school, &amp; college) prefer to hit with woodbats during their winter training, rather than the bats that they are going to be using during the regular season.  Now, the only reason why I have heard as to why this is, is because a woodbat has a smaller 'sweet spot' if you will, or in other words, it doesn't have as much forgiveness as a metal / aluminum bat.  So in translation, if you can make solid contact with a woodbat, then you definitely can make solid contact with a metal / aluminum bat, especially with the amount of forgiveness that those bats give.  My question to that is.. why would you train with a bat that you only use a few months out of the year and you don't use in games?  Shouldn't you train with what you are going to use in games, so that you can build large amounts of confidence with that piece of equipment? "
357,Swimmer's elbow problems,"In the last year I have been, on and off, troubled by what I believe is swimmer's elbow.  The pain does not prevent me from swimming but it is affecting my ability to pull with maximum force in the front &amp; back crawl and especially the butterfly, which I have found to be the stroke that aggravates it the most.  The majority of the pain exists just behind and in front of the elbow, as if it's the tendons or something (I'm not a physio so this is my best description).  The pain does linger during the day and can affect some actions eg. I wince sometimes when putting on or taking off a t-shirt, but I wouldn't describe it as disabling.  So my questions are:    is this something I can avoid, perhaps by strengthening muscles further up the arm and, if so, what would they be? is there anything I can do when I have the pain, to get rid of it?   "
358,Training motor skills for inexperienced athletes,"I captain a team made up of a group of players coming from very different backgrounds, something quite common in our sport. Some of them, all in their 20s, have no prior sports experience, and their main ""physical"" issue is that even if they have learnt some skills specific to our sport they lack overall coordination and dexterity, making them less adaptable on the pitch and slower learners in training.  What should I do to help them develop their motor skills and proprioception? Are there exercises I can teach them that they can replicate at home in their own time without needing complicated equipment? "

360,Is there a connection between serious injuries/deaths in boxing and having one's father in one's corner?,"In the commentary on the tragic 2005 Leavander Johnson/Jesus Chavez fight, which claimed the life of Leavander Johnson, commentator Jim Lampley said that there are two things that seem to be ""constant"" in recent fights where a boxer was seriously - sometimes permanently - injured:     In the recent history of the sport, when you look at fights where one fighter has been badly, sometimes permanently damaged, two constants seem to be part of the formula. Number one, the opponent who is doing the damage is a hard  hitter, but not a big enough hitter to put the opponent away. Number two, the guy who is getting worked over has his father in the corner as his trainer, constantly sending him back to take more punishment.   The announcer actually said, in the 10th round, that he hoped that wouldn't be the case for Leavander Johnson, and the fight was stopped early in the 11th round;  however, Leavander Johnson died 5 days later from his injuries.  A little research on my part turned up an earlier article from the LA Times, which listed other fighters who were killed in their bouts and had their fathers in their corners:  Johnny Owens (1980) Kiko Bejines (1983) Rico Velazquez (1988) Jimmy Garcia (1995) Fernie Morales (1991)1    More recently, in 2009, Francisco ""Paco"" Rodriguez was killed in the ring, with his father in the corner.    Here's a slightly more thorough list of boxers who were killed or seriously injured in the ring since 1980 with their fathers in their corners.  One of the four main sanctioning bodies in professional boxing, the World Boxing Council (or WBC) actually has rules on the books prohibiting fathers from their son's corners because of the alleged correlation:     Dr. Paul Wallace, chairman of the WBC's medical advisory board, said that a study in California backed up the WBC's rule.      ""The most common factor out of all the fatalities that had happened, was having fathers in the corner,"" he said of the study. ""Now, that's not something that's a medical issue, but it's something that's clearly an association.""   -  NY Daily News   The State Athletic Commissions of California and Nevada, which are responsible for regulating safety in the ring, also believe the link exists:     Prompted by Garcia's death [in May 1995], the California Athletic Commission conducted a preliminary inquiry into California ring injuries since 1980.      It was discovered that four of the seven most serious head injuries reviewed--including all three California ring-related deaths--involved fighters whose fathers worked their corners.      Richard DeCuir, the commission's executive director, admits the examination was not scientific--""The numbers have not been scrubbed,"" he said--yet the findings struck him as alarmingly disproportionate, given the best estimates that only 5%-7% of professional fighters are trained by relatives.      DeCuir cannot speak to the specifics of each case nor is it his intention to implicate families that have already suffered, yet he suspects there is a correlation between ring injuries and relatives.      ""I think we all pretty much believe that,"" DeCuir said.      DeCuir sent his information to Marc Ratner, head of the Nevada State Commission, who is still grappling with Garcia's death in May.      ""It's something we have no choice but to address, because it is more than coincidence,"" Ratner said of the father-son issue.   - LA Times   The quotes above make it clear that the issue has been investigated at least once, but the source ""admits the examination was not scientific--""The numbers have not been scrubbed."" Thus, we can't resolve the issue with certainty unless someone has done a more scientific study.  Has there ever been a serious analysis into the possible correlation between permanent injury/deaths in the ring, and having one's father in the corner?  Do we know if there is actually a statistical correlation between these two factors?    1 Fortunately, Morales actually survived, but suffered a blood clot in his brain, had to have emergency brain surgery to remove it, and never fought again.  Sadly, all the others on the list died from their injuries. "
361,Can you kick a stick in NHL?,"If a player drops his stick and a player of the opposing team kicks it away from him as he tries to reach for it, will the opposing player get penalized? A common situation would be when the goalie loses his stick. It would be good strategy for the opposing team to kick the stick away from him.  How about if a teammate kicks it towards the player who has dropped his stick? "
362,Umpire induces appeal play?,"What do the umpires do when a game ends on a scoring play, when an appeal (not video review) by the defense would succeed?  For example:  bottom of the ninth, tie score, one out, runner on third.  The batter hits a deep fly ball, caught by the right fielder.  Runner on third tags up and scores the winning run.  Game over. Everyone leaves the field.  But you're the third base umpire, and you know, without any doubt, that the runner on third left early, and, if the defensive team appeals, you need to be there to call the runner on third out with no run scored and the inning over.  On the other hand, to avoid giving hints to the defensive team, wouldn't you need to do the same thing (hang around third) if the runner had tagged up correctly?  To avoid warning the defense in those cases where there is a successful appeal available? "
363,"Does ""Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green"" objectify tee-to-green performance?","In short, ""Strokes Gained"" is a value of a golfer's performance compared to the average performance of other golfers.   In 2011, the PGA Tour announced Strokes Gained: Putting.     For example, the average number of putts used to hole out from 7 feet   10 inches is 1.5. If a player one-putts from this distance, he gains   0.5 strokes. If he two-putts, he loses 0.5 strokes. If he three-putts, he loses 1.5 strokes.   In 2014, the PGA Tour announced Strokes Gained: Tee-To-Green. This includes calculations on how to calculate Strokes Gained: Total.     First, a player’s score will be compared to the field’s average to   establish a Strokes Gained: Total number. For instance, if a player   shoots 68 and the field average is 70, his Total is +2.0. That number,   in turn, will equal the combination of Strokes Gained: Putting and   Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green. So if the player is +1.2 in Strokes   Gained: Putting, his Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green number is +0.8.   According to this statement, the equation is: SGtotal = SGputting + SGtee-to-green. However, SGtee-to-green is derived from SGtotal and SGputting values. Thus, a golfer's SGtee-to-green value is inversely proportional to their SGputting value.  Does ""Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green"" objectify tee-to-green performance? Is there any correlation between this statistic and the ball striking statistic† + scrambling statistic, its individual parts, or other statistics?   Note: The ball striking statistic and the scrambling statistic doesn't compare to the average performance of other golfers, but does objectively capture driving distance, accuracy, greens in regulation, sand saves, and other around the green recoveries.   † - total driving [driving distance + accuracy] + greens in regulation    For example, Lucas Glover is 1st in Ball Striking, 65th in Scrambling, and 45th in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green thus far during the 2016 PGA Tour season.

364,Does Naseem Hamed violate the Marquess of Queensberry Rules in this video?,"Rule four of the Marquess of Queensberry Rules:     If either man fall through weakness or otherwise, he must get up unassisted, ten seconds be allowed to do so, the other man meanwhile to return to his corner; and when the fallen man is on his legs the round is to be resumed and continued until the three minutes have expired. If one man fails to come to the scratch in the ten seconds allowed, it shall be in the power of the referee to give his awart in favour of the other man.   Video link  Here we see Prince Naseem Hamed and Augie Sanchez get tangled up and fall, thought there was obviously no knockdown, just a pair of slips.  Hamed shows admirable sportsman ship in helping Sanchez to his feet, but the Marquess of Queensberry Rules are pretty clear on this point:     If either man fall through weakness or otherwise, he must get up unassisted   They both fell, not ""through weakness"", but ""otherwise"";  Naz got up mostly ""unassisted"", although the ref at least tried to help him;  but in any case, Sanchez clearly received help in standing back up.

366,MLB awards for players who played in both leagues in one season,"Many of Major League Baseball's annual player awards are awarded to two players, one each in the American and National Leagues.  (For instance, MVP, Cy Young, Silver Slugger, Rookie of the Year, etc.)  If a player plays in both leagues in a single season (perhaps due to a midseason trade), how is it determined which league's awards he is eligible for?  Is it based on games played, days under contract, his affiliation as of a certain date, or something else?  If such a player turns out to be eligible for one league's award, can his performance in the other league be considered towards the award?  (I realize some of these awards are selected by different organizations which may have different rules, but it would be nice to know about as many as possible.) "
367,Can I return a squash serve on the volley?,"When my opponent is serving in squash, if I want to return the serve, can I volley this ball back to them? That is, without the ball hitting the floor (opponent serves > front wall > I volley the ball back).  If yes, do I have to stay within my own serving box? How many of my feet have to remain in the box, one or both?  If no, can I cross the T-line in front of my box if I keep one foot in it? "
368,What is the distinction between a play that counts after the whistle is blown and doesn't count in the National Football League?,"Let's say the following scenario occurs. A quarterback throws a screen pass, and the player drops it. There is a whistle for an incomplete pass, and a player on defense grabs the ball and returns it for a touchdown. The coach of the team that was on defense challenges the ruling on the field of an incomplete pass, and it is overturned, because it is ruled that the ball went backwards. I am almost sure that the touchdown does not count, but does the fumble recovery count? What about if the player on offense hears the whistle and doesn't try to get the ball? Is there a clear rule? Is this a judgement call? "
369,Fencing Tactic for Pulling an Opponent's Blade Out of Line,"I fenced in high school years ago and our coach talked of a tactic to pull an opponents' blade out of line, gradually.  If I recall correctly, it was done with small attacks, each a bit further out, drawing the parry a bit further with each attack.  Often, the defender would execute the parry but come back slightly off-line to a point where a small feint would allow for an easy score.  Is this really a thing?  It has been a VERY long time.  I've been trying to remember the term (if it does exist.) Any help out there? "

Immediately afterwards, the champion relinquishes his title to pursue the world champion title.  It is then announced that two fighters, whom the #1 has already fought and beaten, will fight to claim the title of champion. Why would the #1 not be involved in a fight to claim the champion title when it's relinquished? Would it be because the #1 had already challenged the champion and lost? "

Usually, when the kick crosses the midfield line, and goes deeper into the receiving team's territory, it is usually placed at that team's 40 yard line. What would happen if the ball went out of bounds at the kicking team's 46 yard line, where would the ball be placed? It should not be placed at the receiving team's 40 yard line, giving them a disadvantage, Does anybody know the specifications of the rule, and where the ball is placed according to the place that the ball goes out of bounds?

Are you down if your head touches the defender who is sitting/laying on the ground (knees, elbows and rest of body have yet to contact ground)? What are the rules surrounding falling on other players?  Was watching the Bears play the Eagles when a Bear caught a pass, then touched an Eagle (who was sitting on ground) with his head, only to have the ball ripped from his possession before any other part of his body touched anything else.  "
379,Why do ice hockey teams usually replace their goalie after an empty net goal?,"In ice hockey, when a team is losing by a goal in the last few minutes, the coach usually pulls the goalie and replaces them with another player, leaving the net empty, but this doesn't matter since goal difference isn't as important as it is in a sport like football.  If they are losing by 2 goals (sometimes 3 in a playoffs game) they usually pull the goalie with about 2-3 minutes remaining.  If they are losing by 1 goal, they usually pull the goalie with about 90 seconds remaining.  However, I've seen in some situations, a team is losing by 1 goal, so they pull the goalie, but then the other team scores an empty net goal. Now the team is down by 2 goals, but where they would usually pull the goalie when losing by 2, they actually put the goalie back in.  Why is this done? Is it just because the empty net goal demoralizes the team? Or they think they have no chance of coming back from being 2 goals down with only a minute or so left (as opposed to the usual 2-3 minutes)?  Note: There are cases where the above doesn't apply, like yesterday Colorado were losing 1-0 against Detroit when Patrick Roy pulled the goalie with 3 minutes left (he often pulls the goalie very early) and the other team scored an empty net goal just after, but they kept the goalie pulled even though they were now 2-0 down (and the other team actually scored another empty net goal after that making it 3-0). "
380,Do NFL or college football coaches make up plays during the game?,"Some sports are sufficiently dynamic and with few enough players that coaches make up plays during the game. But American football seems sufficiently complicated I would imagine it's hard to do that as much as other sports.   To what extent do elite American coaches modify set plays during a game to adapt to new situations? Like if the defense is doing something new, how does the coach get everyone on the same page given that so many guys play on a team?  "
381,What are restrictions for junior tennis players on number of senior tournaments?,"Recently in a discussion I have heard that young players can only enter a limited number of senior tournaments.

Profile   Breaststroke - I can go on forever. Backstroke is strong, I can even thrash my way to the other end doing butterfly.  Front crawl where breathing every three strokes with problems   While I'm taking a breath I'm sinking considerably, so much so that my next stroke is just getting back to the surface, maybe the next 2!  When I take a breath I wonder if I am lifting my head simultaneously pushing my body down into the water.  And the stroke immediately before I breathe kind of has to tread water to get my mouth to the surface.  And then I try to reduce breathing time and get a nose of water.    Questions on front crawl   Is my ectomorphic body much denser than the average so I sink faster?   Are my hands and feet very slim so are not providing good enough paddles?  Is my breathing sequence wrong causing me to sink?  Do I need to go just faster and reach a certain critical non-sinking velocity?  "
390,Why didn't Michael Jordan appear in NBA Live 97?,"I remember playing NBA Live 97. This was back when the Bulls were the team to beat. And every time I would go to the Bulls roster, every player was there except Michael Jordan.      At the time, I was 7 and didn't know any better. But I now realize there must have been some financial or personal reason why Jordan didn't appear. They didn't even use his number. They used number 24 and called him Roster Player.    NBA2K11 was an example of what Jordan did when actually let people put him in the game. That edition had so much MJ in it it got old and obnoxious. It was like every part of the game had to have Jordan on it.   My Question:  Does anyone know the history of Michael Jordan's licensing of his name and brand to video game companies? If so, can you explain why he wasn't in NBA Live 97 (when he was playing like a stud) but then suddenly had a Jordan explosion in NBA2K11 (long after he was relevant)? "

See pictured.    While it seems like all sixteen of the countries that participated in the tournament are listed in alphabetical order clockwise around the shirt, there are two teams that do not follow this pattern. I'm not going to count the United States, which appears at the top of the circle (the USA hosted the tournament and prominent spots on advertisements are often reserved for FIFA host countries).  Colombia and Chile are out of order and should be switched. I guess this could just be an oversight because both of the countries begin with C, but that would surprise me. Do either of these countries have a different name that would cause them to be in this order?  The other country that is out of order is Argentina. I'm really confused why Argentina appears in between Uruguay and Venezuela. Argentina's official name is the Argentine Republic (República Argentina in Spanish), but that shouldn't move it on the list.  Does Argentina have another English name that would place it between Uruguay and Venezuela alphabetically? Are the countries on the shirt ordered in a different language besides English? Was the quasi-alphabetical ordering simply a mistake?  The complete list of countries are, in clockwise order from the top:   United States (host) Bolivia Brazil Colombia Chile Costa Rica Ecuador Haiti Jamaica Mexico Panama Paraguay Peru Uruguay Argentina Venezuela  "
397,Tying relegation rules EPL vs EFL,"Could someone confirm the following discrepancy which appears to be a difference between EPL and EFL relegation rules in event of a tie on points, goal-difference, and goals-scored?  From potentially unreliable secondary sources (beginning with a W) it seems that head-to-head performance is taken into account in the EFL before a playoff match for relegation. In the EPL it seems that head-to-head is not taken into account, and it proceeds straight to a playoff.  Is this correct? Can anyone quote chapter and verse? (Secondarily, why is there a difference, if there is one?)  (In case you're wondering why anyone would care, yes this is for a maths problem, not an anxiety about any particular team). "
398,Has any team won the country's top league (division) playing from temporary stadium?,"In the Premier League 2017/18, Tottenham Hotspur F.C. are using the Wembley Stadium as temporary home while their new stadium is being constructed.   So, I was wondering if they win the Premier League this season will they be the first team to do so playing from a temporary stadium in country's top league? And if they are not the first team to do so, which club have done this and when? "
399,Football: final score when one team gets 5 players sent off?,"What becomes the final score if 5 players gets sent off from one team?  In the video game FIFA the opposing team wins with 3-0. However, if one team leads by more, say 6-0, will this be the final score? Would be unfair otherwise "
400,Covering Puck in Crease,"I know that it is a penalty shot if you conceal/cover/fall on the puck while it's in the crease (""No defending player, except the goalkeeper, will be permitted to fall on the puck, hold the puck, pick up the puck, or gather the puck into the body or hands when the puck is within the goal crease. For infringement of this rule, play shall immediately be stopped and a Penalty shot shall be ordered against the offending team), but my question is, how does it work when the puck is partially in the crease and partially outside of it? Assume a small part of the puck is on the red line that makes up the border of the crease and that most of it is on the white ice outside.  In other words, must the ENTIRE puck be within the confines of the crease for the rule to apply, or can just part of it be in the crease? "
401,Is spreading arms foul,Is spreading arms wide and preventing the other team player behind you to move a foul? Is that some kind of illegal screen? 
402,Sign stealing in baseball,"I don't understand the current sign stealing issue between the Red Sox and the Yankees. I don't understand how sign stealing in baseball actually works. Just seeing a catcher's sign is not enough.  How can a team know what their opponents' signs actually mean?  Doesn't each team have their own signs?  Don't they change their meanings now and then like a password?  Edit:  The Boston Globe quotes Red Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia:      Our adjustment to that stuff is: go out to the mound and change the   signs.   OK, I guess one could identify the current signs at the start of a game by watching the signs and the pitches that follow. Yahoo describes this process:     if someone on a team’s video staff cracks an opponent’s signals, they are run from the video room to an intermediary in the dugout and forwarded to players on the field   But that process would take longer than the actual at bat itself and the information would never reach the batter in time. The only benefactor would be the runner at second base who will know when to steal a base. But he should be able to see the catcher's signs directly and wouldn't need a relay chain.  Of course, that runner could alert the batter directly on what pitch to expect once the signs have been cracked. The Boston Globe describes this:     Often times it happens when a runner at second base peers in to see the catcher’s sign and then subtly flashes a signal — maybe a hand movement, or the positioning of his feet — to the batter to let him know whether the next pitch will be a fastball, curveball or something else.   But how often is there a runner at second base during a game? It's not that big of an advantage in my opinion. And I'm pretty sure all teams have been doing this for 150 years or so.  Disclaimer: I have never played baseball myself, unfortunately. I'm just an interested spectator so please bear with me. "
403,Should a goal be disallowed if a player in an offside position blocks the view of the goalkeeper?,"Should Germany's first goal by Özil against Norway on the 4th September 2017 have been disallowed if Timo Werner were in an offside position?  In reality, a defender on the far side of the pitch was playing Werner onside, but I'm interested in the hypothetical case where a player in an offside position is blocking the view of the goalkeeper. "
404,What is the meaning of these American football trash talk expressions?,"This video humorously lists possible trash-talking in the NFL. What is the joke of the following ""insults""?     #5 Your receivers can't run a clean route on a Hail Mary.   What is a clean route and why is it / isn't it difficult to run during a Hail Mary pass?     #8 Your running back is ridiculous. He has no game. He has mud on his jersey even though his games are being played in a dome.   Why wouldn't domed playing areas not be muddy, and why is it a particularly good insult that a running back has mud on his jersey?     #9 The ref threw the flag on your quarterback for pass interference.   I don't get this joke at all - isn't pass interference only applicable to the defensive team? "
405,Upper limit of unsuccessful appeals against suspensions,"From MLS Press Box,     Appeal to review a Send-Off Decision:      1.Prior to the start of the MLS League Season, Clubs must post a $25,000 refundable bond with the League Office for the right to make up to two (2) unsuccessful appeals.      2.If an appeal is upheld (i.e., successful), then the send-off punishment will be rescinded.      3.If an appeal is rejected, then the send-off punishment (and any supplemental discipline should it be administered by the MLS Disciplinary Committee) will stand and the Club will have lost one of its two allotted appeals for the Season.      4.If an appeal is deemed frivolous by the Ruling Body that reviewed the case, then the bond will be forfeited and the Club will further lose the right to appeal any other decisions in that League Season and the next one. Further, the send-off punishment of the player or coach/staff member will be doubled (i.e., an automatic suspension of two (2) games).   Pardon my naivety, but does that imply that MLS teams can not make any appeal once their upper limit for appeals expires (even for genuine cases)?   Also, is this just an MLS thing or does a similar system exist in other leagues as well where no appeal can be made once the upper limit expires? "
406,"Are all oval-track races done counter-clockwise? If so, why?","It seems to me that every type of race on an oval track moves in a counter-clockwise direction. Off the top of my head, I know that this happens in:   auto racing of any kind roller derby horse racing speed skating running races (the 'track' part of 'track &amp; field', I suppose) greyhound racing   What is the history of this custom? Is there a reason all races are run counter-clockwise? Are there exceptions to this rule (if it can even be called a rule)? "
407,Timekeeping before modern technology,"During the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, Michael Phelps won his 7th gold medal of that Olympics by defeating Milorad Čavić by 0.01 seconds. However, there was controversy that Čavić finished first, but did not apply enough pressure to trigger the sensor before Phelps slammed it with his finish. The finish is unintelligible with the naked eye, even with super slow-motion video analysis.   Before modern technology, how did timekeeping officials keep time? How did they determine who finished first when it was a very close finish? "
408,What actions are taken by FIFA/UEFA against what's known as filming or diving,"It seems to me that modern football is suffering from the kind of unsportsmanly behavior of diving which became all the more common, perhaps with the recent success of southern European teams/nations.   For those who might not be familiar with the concept, diving is the act of fooling the referee into a wrong call, either by pretending as if the tackle is much harder than it really was (in which case the opponent might be punished with a card) or to get a free kick/penalty kick where there is no apparent foul. Not only does it result in unfair calls, but also in many cases it slows the game down due to all the unnecessary free kick calls. In many cases it is normal to see players rolling on the grass seemingly screaming in agony for a second, and up on their feet arguing with an opponent in the next...  With more and more efforts going into campaigns against factors that spoil the game (such as racism) I would like to know if any steps are taken against this type of behavior aimed to interfere with the objective call of the referee? As far as I know, the referee can punish a player with a yellow card if the player is attempting to cheat the referee into giving a penalty but more often than not unnecessary cards and fouls are given as seen by instant replays from different angles. Are there any active measures to decrease this type of behavior or the pitch? "
409,Why can't MLB teams trade draft picks?,"Why can't MLB teams trade draft picks like the NHL or NFL?  It would make for much more interesting drafts, and teams could ""stock up"" on young talent, then burn picks for veterans to make a playoff push like in many baseball simulation leagues.  But is there a reasoning behind not allowing MLB teams to trade draft picks beyond ""the commissioner said 'NO'""? "

412,How long should I expect a golf glove to last before wearing out?,"I currently play with a Nike DuraFeel golf glove on my leading hand. It's practical, it works, and it fits ""like a glove"" (as in perfectly; not too tight but nothing to spare). Sometimes I'll glove both hands; I usually only do this at the range when I'm hitting bucket after bucket, but usually on the course I need to get in and out of my right pocket for tees, spare balls etc which is more difficult with a glove.   The problem is that this glove currently lasts me maybe three to four rounds and/or range visits before the thumb develops a huge hole, and by the end of the first round played they get pretty stiff so I often relegate them to range use after just one or two rounds. That makes worn-out gloves a bigger money sink equipment-wise than lost balls; I play C-grade recycled balls so each one I lose is only about $.50, and my lost-ball count is much lower in recent times than it had been.  Questions:   Am I doing something wrong in my grip causing premature wear? Would a more expensive glove last longer, or just waste money on ""better feel"" (for the first round before it stiffens)?  "
413,How does the bottom participant steer in two-man luge?,"Based on this statement, found here:     Typically, the 2-man luge is slower because they start further down on   the track, but it is much harder to steer because the man on top is   the only one that can see, but the man on the bottom is the one that   is most able to contribute to the steering.   How does the bottom participant steer in two-man luge? Since the top participant is the only one that can see down the track, how does the bottom participant know when to steer and in what direction?   I notice there are handles from the top participant's suit the bottom participant grabs onto...does this have any significant effect? "
414,How does a skeleton athlete sprint at the top of the track without slipping?,"   In skeleton, the rider starts running with the sled at the top of the track and belly flops on to the sled.   Since this is the case, how does a skeleton athlete sprint at the top of the track without slipping? The top of the track contains ice like the rest of the track, but skeleton athletes can sprint as if the ice is not an issue. Does this have to do with footwear or the ice profile at the top of the track not being prone to slipping? "
415,"In NBA, what is/are the benefit(s) of a team that will acquire an expiring contract?","I always thought that if an expiring contract was included by some draft picks in a trade proposal, it seems attractive to a receiving team. Is it just about draft picks? Or there is another benefits in acquiring a huge expiring contract like Emeka Okafor's contract? "
416,Can a team use a player for both bowling and batting in super over?,"   Three players from the batting side will be selected to bat in the   super-over. If the batting side loses two wickets, their innings   will end. One player from the fielding team will be selected for bowling the super over. - iplT20wiki.com.   Sorry for copying from this post.  If a team wants a player to bowl the super over and also to face the super over. Is it possible?  To be clear, for example, if RCB selects Chris Gayle and some other player to face the super over, will Gayle allowed to bowl the super over when the opponents come to face it? "
417,How to spin in Bowling?,"Where would one start when trying to learn to spin a bowling ball?  I've seen people bring the bowling bowl up into their elbow (inner part), then somehow manage to put a spin on it completely with the whole arm, while having it run straight..then at the end spin hard. No luck in my recent attempts though.  Any advice other than keep practicing? "
418,What are the differences between the alpine skiing events?,"The Olympics has five different alpine (downhill) skiing events:   Downhill Slalom Giant Slalom Super Giant Slalom (Super-G) Super Combined   What are the differences between these different events?  I know that the number and spacing of the gates are different. Is that all it is, or is there more to it than that? "
419,False Start penalty clarification,"In the Super Bowl this year Denver was called for a false start on the very first play of the game. The ref clearly stated the false start happened before the snap.  Why was the play allowed to continue? A false start penalty is a dead ball penalty, correct?  If so, the Broncos should have been penalized 5 yards and kept the ball. No safety allowed.  "
420,Basketball shooting technique: what makes the ball go forward?,"I am learning the technique for making shots in basketball.   How do you make the ball go forward to the hoop?  After following all the advice I found so far, I can shoot beautifully in front of the hoop. When I get further away, for example free throws, the advice falls short.  These are the key points for shooting technique I found so far. What am I missing?   Feet shoulder width apart, square to the basket or slightly open, depending on the player. Bend your knees and jump using your legs to give the upward power to the ball. Do not throw the ball with your arm. It will be inconsistent. Land the same place you jumped, make a straight up and down jump. Hold the ball with one hand under and the other on the side to guide the ball. Keep your elbow in and straight below the ball pointing to the ground. As you reach the top of your jump, let your arm extend upward and release the ball at the top. Your wrist should snap or flop, which gives the ball a backward rotation. Shoot the ball with a high angle because that exposes the largest opening of the hoop. End your shot with your arm up and your wrist down like you are reaching for the basket.   I see two possibilities for making the ball go forward.   You push the ball forward with your arm near the top of the jump. The snapping motion of your arm at the top of the jump works like the serve in tennis where you throw the racket up and when your arm extends it whips forward like a rope.   And if you push the ball forward during your jump, wouldn't you land a little behind where you started? "
421,How much are retained players supposed to be paid in the IPL?,"After the IPL auction, we know the amount that teams bought the players for and they will be paid according to that.  But I couldn't find the amount that retained players are to be paid.  It's not available in this list.   Who determines the amount retained players will be paid in the IPL? Is it negotiable? "
422,"What tie-breaker is used in the ATP ranking, when two players have the same number of points?","If two players have exactly the same number of points in the ATP ranking, what further criteria are used to determine which of them will be higher in the ranking?  I am aware of the fact that this is not very probably to happen among top players, where the point differences are larger, but this is bound to happen for players with lower rankings and less points.  For example, in the current ATP ranking the players number 78 and 79 have the same number of points (662). So do the players ranked 80 and 81 (in this case, they have 661 points).   "
423,How are the age restrictions followed by ICC for under 19 cricket tournaments?,"I have some doubts under this topic,   Can a player aged 19 play under 19 international cricket match?

They had mentioned during the match that Pakistan could earn a bonus   point if they stop Afghanistan to score 198 runs. - sports.ndtv[08.49 (IST)]    How is this score calculated? What formula is used for this? If the second batting team wants to gain a bonus point, how should the chase be?  "
425,"Looking for an objective crybaby metric... Are there any NBA ""complainer"" statistics?","I was watching Heat vs. Knicks last night with a few friends, and each and every one of them is a LeBron hater. I'd understand if they disliked him because he abandoned his hometown and conspired with his pals to steal championships. But that's not why they dislike him. They dislike LeBron because they say he cries too much. He complains to the refs when he gets fouled, and he does so even when there is no discernible evidence that the contact altered his shot.  I'm wondering if this is true. I'm not sure he actually gets fewer calls than he deserves, and I'd like to know if there is any way to measure that.  Are there any metrics out there that show how many calls a player gets vs. how many he deserves? Are there ""complainer"" stats out there?   If not, how might this data be collected &amp; metrics be created? "
426,Earliest Substitution after kickoff in an official football match,Which team holds the record for the earliest substitution after kick-off in an official football match?  I personally have seen games where players have gotten substituted within the first twenty minutes. But how early does the record stand?  It would also be great if you could include the earliest non-injury substitution too. (I do agree this one might be tougher to come by) 
427,The history of promotion and relegation in English football,"How exactly did the system of promotion and relegation come about in English football? Specifically, what were the driving forces that made it such an intrinsic part of the game?  As an American soccer fan, I've had difficulty trying to dig up this history. Even though there's no pro-rel in any of the sports in the U.S., it gets talked about a lot in relation to the future of the different soccer leagues. "

429,Draft Pick Trading in NHL,"When trading picks (1st round, etc...) Do you essentially give up your spot, or do you give an extra pick to the other team?  For example, the Leafs won the draft lottery so they get to pick first. If they traded a first round pick to another team, say the Rangers.  Do the Rangers now get to bypass every other team and get the very first pick? Or do they just get an extra pick once their turn comes? "
430,Golf Glove Rules,"Is it legal to wear a golf glove that has some of the ""fingers"" missing (cut off)?   The idea for doing this comes from reading Hogan's book ""Five Lessons"". Hogan talks about the muscles that are activated by gripping the club according to his formulation; the pressure points for the left hand would be the last three fingers of the left hand( for right handed swingers here) and the two middle fingers of the right hand. An easy way to maximize this ideal grip pressure distribution would be to wear a left hand glove that only had the last three ""fingers"" (just cut off the top two, the palm part stays the same) and wear a right handed glove that had only the two middle fingers . This would force you to feel the club through the fingers you want to control the club.   Would this be legal?  "

434,How many extra balls occur after a no ball in T20?,"If a no ball is bowled in T20 cricket, a free hit follows. Does the ""free hit"" delivery count as one of the over?  In other words, would an over in which the sixth delivery is a no ball contain 8 deliveries: 5 legal, 1 no ball, 1 free hit and then 1 legal? "
435,Who is out if both batsmen end up at the same end and the fielders hit the stumps at that end?,"I have a query regarding a run out dismissal: Who is out in the following scenario:  The batsman runs, while his partner doesn't.

437,"In sand volleyball, if a ball hits the line but the mark is out, is it in or out?","We play on the sand and there is a dispute as to how to judge a ball in or out.  If the ball hits the line, so that the line clearly moves, but then strikes the sand an inch out of bounds, is the ball in or out by official rules?  This happens all the time and we have always played ""line is in"" but recently many want to change to ""go by the mark in the sand"".  Which is correct?  Due to the contentious nature of this, I'd appreciate reference to official rules and standards with citations, more than personal opinions or anecdotes. "
438,Basketball sits on the back of the rim motionless after an attempted shot. What is the ruling?,Saw this in one of the NBA play off highlights but no one said how it was ruled. A shot attempt bounces on the rim and settles to a dead stop on the rim's bracket never entering the basket itself. Is it a dead ball like when the ball sticks between backboard and rim? Or what? 
439,"In basketball, can you score by bouncing the ball off the ground?","If a player slams the ball on the ground so hard that it bounces into the hoop, is that a valid goal?  (Bonus trivia question: has this occurred in a professional or collegiate game?) "
440,"Sabermetrics and statistics, why so fitting for baseball?","I am looking into defining my own simple metrics for a video game to evaluate how well a player is performing.  To that regard I have been reading about Sabermetrics and the general impression I get as to why Baseball lends itself easily to statistical analysis compared to other sports is that the game naturally rewards individual performance.   To quote from howstuffworks.com: ""The beauty of baseball is that its statistics generally capture the performance of one player. And that player's success is often determined by his own actions"". The page continues to argue that a successful play in football is dependent on many other actors.  However, is this not also the case for baseball? Surely when a batter hits a ball, the pitcher has done his best to make it harder for the player to hit the ball. Additionally, whether or not your ball gets caught also depends on how the defense is setup, and thus his success is not only measured by the batter's own actions. I'm not really seeing how baseball is magically easier to quantify with statistics than other sports.   My question is then, is baseball really easier to measure statistically? Or is the reason why baseball dominate the world of sport statistics just natural consequence of the fact that people have been revising and developing statistics for the sport since it's beginning?  I must disclaim that I cannot pretend to know much about baseball since baseball has never really been part of my life, so maybe I am missing something obvious here. "
441,Why no uniform testing for doping at major sporting events?,"It seems that doping scandals are still very much a part of big sporting events. There are the recent news about the Russian team at the Olympics, the Tour de France scandals, and I'm sure there are more. In the Russian case, for example, we're finding - years after the event - officials that are testifying to the widespread use of doping, including by gold medalists, and we're finding evidence that the analysis lab (run by Russian officials) was falsifying results.  I do not understand why this is still a part of sports. It seems that there's a simple solution: just test every participant in a sporting event, right on the day of the event, in a uniform/standardized way, by the same independent laboratory, with supervisors from the public (perhaps even broadcast to the public), instead of just selective testing by country-specific secretive and closed labs as seems to be the case now.   If for some reason the tests are prohibitively expensive, then make it a rule that tests will always be taken from people who score one of first 3 places in a given competition. Or run basic tests on every participant, and very extensive/thorough tests on the winners.  Why is this type of thing not done to put an end to doping once and for all? Or am I misunderstanding something? "

444,What can teams do when umpire has inconsistent strike zone?,"I was watching a game between the  Blue Jays and the Rangers and several times the ball was clearly in the strike zone, but balls were called and vice versa. The Blue Jays coach was furious and got sent off after the 3rd inning.  My question is the following. When an umpire has a very inconsistent strike zone that, does the league offer any recourse for teams to challenge this? Do they not have access to video reviews for these kind of calls? "
445,Volleyball - Is this reaching over the net?,"This is a follow-up question to the ""In volleyball when is it considered reading over the net"" question posted a few years ago.  Subject of this question, is the accompanying play starting at time index 54:07.  (Ok, so the Team Blue player failed the attack)  Am I wrong here? or did the Team Red &amp; White blockers just barely jump the gun and reach over the net just before the third contact? The bump(set) was not necessarily in the direction of the opponents court, but seemed parallel to the net.  (The Referees never made any calls to this effect, nor did they throughout the rest of the match despite some other possibly questionable blocking plays. I assume by the referees not calling anything that everything was legal)  If it was not legal play, can someone explain to me from the rules where the referees or players may have made the mistake?  (I'm just curious because I've run into similar situations in my rec. league.)  Would someone with more experience/better perspective be able to shed some light on this? "
446,Has a field goal or extra point attempt ever hit both uprights and the crossbar?,"Yesterday in the NFL wild card playoff game between the Eagles and Bears, Bears kicker Cody Parkey missed a game-winning FG that hit the left upright and then the crossbar.  I found a video showing Jason Hansen of the Lions hitting the right upright and then the left upright on a successful FG attempt in 2000.  I also found a video showing Gavin Patterson of South Alabama hitting the left upright and then the crossbar twice on a successful FG attempt.  But has a college or NFL kicker ever hit both uprights and the crossbar on a FG or extra point attempt? "
447,Why do quarterbacks lick their hands even when sitting on the sidelines?,I understand why most QB's lick their hands when they’re on the field. I guess it helps with the grip. But why so many of them keep licking their hands even when they are on the sidelines? Is it a bad habit most of them get in? Do they even lick their hands outside the stadium too? 
448,"What counts as ""onside"" when a ball is kicked from the in-goal area?","If the ball is kicked from the in-goal area, where does a player have to stand to be onside?

449,When is the ball on the correct side in double table tennis serve?,I know that you must serve from server right side to receiver right side and all that.

The ball is no longer in the goalie's hands at this point, but rather, has been placed on the ground. Which rule in the FIFA rules explains this best?  "
451,Touching ball scenario in 8-ball,"In the game of 8-ball: suppose my opponent plays his/her shot without a foul, and the cue ball ends in a touching-ball situation (that is, the white ball stops right next to a ball, declared to be touching upon a close inspection). So now it is my turn to play, having been handed a touching ball situation, I see two scenarios:    The cue ball is in a touching situation with one of my own balls (say I had called stripes at the start of the game). Then I can call the touching ball to be my next shot, and it suffices to shoot the cue ball away from it, and it would count as if I had hit the called ball.  The cue ball is in a touching situation with one of my opponent's balls (solid color). Then by the same token, no matter what shot I call, shooting away would appear as if I had first hit my opponent's ball, because the cue ball was in touching with an opponent's ball. But that wouldn't make any sense, because I would then simply have no legal shots, and any play would be foul before me making any shot.    To remedy the 2nd scenario, I've been reading the rules again, and there's no bit that directly addresses this situation, namely, a touching situation where the two balls are the cue ball and one of opponent's ball. In one case, the rules say the following:     5.9 Touching Balls      If the cue ball is touching an object ball, the shooter must not play   the cue ball in the direction of that ball. He is considered to have   hit the touching ball when he shoots away from it if the ball is on   for the shot.   But it does not specify, what if the touching ball is an opponent's ball, it seems to assume the touching ball is one of my own balls, hence the remark at the end ""...if the ball is on for the shot."" It can only be on for a shot if it is one of my own balls (stripes).   Another source suggests something somewhat orthogonal:     3.18     FAILURE TO CONTACT OBJECT BALL       It is a foul if on a stroke the cue ball fails to make contact with any legal object ball first.   Playing away from a touching ball does not constitute having hit that   ball.   Question:  How are such touching ball situations resolved? What legal shots do I have in case of 1. and 2.? Specially in case of 2., can I hit away from the touching ball even if the cue ball had been in touching/frozen situation with one of opponent's balls?  It would be incredibly useful if you could also include a link to the rules with which you answer the question. "
452,Why do snooker breaks show more ball activity than decades ago?,"While watching old snooker matches, like the famous Higgins vs White match in 1982, I notice that the breaks seem to be like straight pool breaks, with just the corner balls moving. Ideally, the two corner balls go to the rail and return to their place in the pack. A typical safe break in straight pool is show in this video at about 1:45.  In modern snooker, however, break shots seem to cause a lot more activity. Is that because the balls are racked loose to prevent perfect breaks, or is it the modern style to allow more balls to come out as an ""aggressive safety"", or some other reason? "
453,Another crossbar in american football,"Could anyone tell me, why there is no crossbar on the upper side of the uprights in american football?

455,"Is there a standard (advanced?) stat in basketball for measuring player ""consistency""?","Is there an accepted stat that analysts use to measure how consistent a basketball player is?   Take points per game (or points per 48 min): two players with the same average scoring rates could have very different game distributions. Of course standard deviation comes right to mind (after you standardize it to account for high vs low scorers), and it makes sense when I try it.   But...     Is another measure even more informative? I've looked at some data and am intrigued by other possible stats, but with only small datasets (and somewhat limited personal impressions of specific player [in]consistency in the NBA this year), the patterns I'm seeing could just be red herrings. :)    Even if you use standard deviation, would any adjustments be needed? I'm not sure for example if low scorers would need to be handled differently, or if that all comes out in the wash once you standardize the data. And do you weight right skewed data differently, so it hurts your consistency rating less when you score more (vs less) than your average? What scale is most intuitive to use for the ""consistency"" measure? If you use standardized SD, for example, would it be %, where 100% is the player who always scores 12 every night? (what a machine!) Is there a scaling that would make comparisons between two realistic players' consistencies more meaningful than 25% vs 35%?   So I wonder if consistency is a ""thing of interest"" in sports analytics, and if so how pro analysts handle questions such as those.  Thanks in advance for any insights! "

458,NBA traveling - conflicting rules,"I was watching this NBA Video Rulebook video. In it, 23 White gathers the ball after ending his dribble, establishing his left foot as his pivot foot. He then steps right-left, and the referee calls a traveling violation.  I was then looking at the 2018-2019 NBA rulebook.   Rule 10, Section XIII, point (d), says:     If a player, with the ball in his possession, raises his pivot foot off the floor, he must pass or shoot before his pivot foot returns to the floor   Since 23 White raised his pivot foot off the floor and returned it to the floor while the ball was still in his hands, this would suggest that the referee made the right call.  But Rule 10, Section XIII, point (b), says:     A player who receives the ball while he is progressing or upon   completion of a dribble, may take two steps in coming to a stop,   passing or shooting the ball.   23 White, upon completion of a dribble, gathered the ball on his left foot, establishing his left foot as his pivot foot. Until now he has made no steps. He then steps with his right foot: Step 1. Afterwards he steps with his left foot: Step 2. So it looks like 23 White is complying with this rule.   Is Section XIII, point (b), allowing something that point (d) of the same section does not allow? What am I missing here?   I am confused because Section XIII, point d, is the same exact rule that we have in FIBA (in fact I have read they just copied the NBA rule, and they did). This leads me to my second question:   Is this action by the offensive player legal under FIBA rules?  "

461,Do teams announce their exact formations before a match?,"Before football matches they usually show the formations of both teams, including who plays where, on TV.  As far as I am aware, according to the rules teams only have to provide the names and shirt numbers of the 11 players (+subs) they field.  So supposedly it only is know who will play, but not in what formation or where each player will play within that formation. This makes sense, because a formation can change at any moment, while the line up itself won't.  So how does the broadcasting TV channel and commentators know those details?   Do the teams usually give out this information to the media? Wouldn't that be a tactical disadvantage? Or does the media just guess the formation?   The latter seems most logical, but from what I can tell it is almost always correct (for Bundesliga matches at least), even when unusual choices are made for a match. Today one team put five defenders on the pitch, but one of them ended up playing as a midfielder. The media announced this correctly when showing the line up. "

463,Which non-players in the NFL are the highest paid apart from the GM and head coach?,"One of the things I learned from Michael Lewis's The Blind Side is that how much various parties get paid is a good window into their perceived value by their franchises (in the case of The Blind Side the observation was that left tackles are well-paid in the NFL because they protect the super important quarterback). I know that head coaches and GMs can make a lot in the NFL. For example, here's an article saying that Sean Payton makes $8,000,000 a year. Besides the players, the head coach, and the GM, what tend to be the highest paid roles at an NFL franchise? For example, I've heard it said at a good athletic trainer can make a huge difference. Does the market agree? "

Are other coaches/managers of other sports allowed to play on an emergency basis?  I didn't see Isaiah Thomas suit up when he was coaching the Knicks several yrs ago, I didn't see Ryne Sandberg suit up for the Phillies to play a few innings while managing them.  Why was that assistant coach allowed to possibly play for the Panthers?  Here's the link to the story in case anyone is interested "

466,Rugby Union knock on rule in scoring a try,"Can someone help with the knock on rule when scoring a try. In the Ireland v England 6 Nations game, the slow motion reply appeared to show Henshaw first catching the ball, then he appeared to lose control of it temporarily so that he was no longer touching the ball, and the ball was moving forwards. He then put his hand on the ball before it touched the ground, and clearly touched it down.   My question is (in this game or any other game with the same circumstances), if this was the case, was this a knock on, because he did not catch the ball before it hit the ground as the rules suggest? Or does the law allow the touching down in the goal area to be the equivalent of catching the ball in the remainder of the pitch ? Any ideas appreciated.   By the way - as an England supporter I admit they were well beaten, so no complaints about the result ! "
467,How much of a skill difference is there in penalty taking/defending between professionals and everyone else,"People often talk about penalty kicks in soccer/football as if they were a guessing game, where the keeper tries to guess to what part of goal the the penalty-taker is going to kick the ball before the ball is even struck. Economists have studied it as a game theory problem, like a slightly more complex version of rock/paper/scissors that plays out on a human scale.  But of course there must be some skill in it. How frequently can a professional goalkeeper save penalties taken by, say, a typical teenager who plays on a varsity team at his high school (or whatever the non-American equivalent is)? What if we flip the roles around: how would a professional penalty-taker perform against a non-professional goalkeeper? "

469,Does a team stop batting if it cannot win?,"In last night's Scotland-Sri Lanka match, Scotland lost their last wicket after 43.1 overs, 363/9 to 215/10 (43.1).  At that point, averaging just under 5 runs per over, Scotland would have reached a point around the 47th over, where it would have been no longer (realistically) possible to win the match.  For example, say they had not been dismissed in 43.1, and instead scored 5 (more) runs in that over, leading to 220 at 44.0.  They then scored 5 more runs for the next several overs; at 47.0 they have a score of 235.  With 18 balls remaining in 3 overs, they now trail by 128; but even if they hit sixes on every single ball, they could only score 108.  Yes, there might have been extras, but hardly twenty of them.  Had this happened, would they continue to bat (pointlessly)?  (I realize that in some circumstances, total runs scored might factor into tiebreaks for going on, but clearly not in Scotland's case.)  Would it have been by choice (similar to declaring an innings at end in a Test match, though that is usually for the opposite reason) or by rule?  More generally:  In a limited overs match (an ODI or similar), is there a criteria for ending a game prematurely when it is determined to be no longer possible that the team batting second can win? "

471,What happens when rain interrupts an ODI game in second innings before 20 overs and the chasing team is well ahead of D/L par score?,"In ODI cricket, minimum 20 overs to be bowled to use Duckworth–Lewis rule. But my question is even if chasing team scored the D/L 20 over par score target in just 10 or 15 overs, will it be mandatory to bat full 20 overs?  Example: If team A batting first, scored 150 runs in 30 overs &amp; all out (150/10 - 30 overs) Target is 151 in 50 overs.  Team B batting second, scores 120 runs in 12 overs &amp; lost 2 wickets. (120/2 - 12 overs) Rain interrupts now. As per D/L method, revised D/L target would be 80 runs in 20 overs.   But play couldn't resume as rain continues till the end. But team B is well ahead of D/L par score. but didn't complete the 20 overs. Now what will be the result?  Will team B be declared the winner or the match is abandoned due to rain? "
472,Why is the margin when the chasing team wins measured in wickets?,"Why is it that when the chasing team wins, they are said to win by the number of wickets remaining?  What is the relevance of this? You could have 10 wickets remaining and reached the target on the last ball of the last over - it would've been a close game but the margin would've been the greatest allowed.  Wouldn't it make more sense to describe the margin as the Net Run Rate (which is what is actually calculated in the World Cup group ladder anyway) or the number of overs remaining? "

477,Why is Gio Gonzalez's WAR is 0.01 ahead of Max Scherzer in ESPN's current WAR rankings?,"As of the time of this post, Gio Gonzalez's WAR is 0.01 ahead of Max Scherzer.  It's a pretty small difference, but when I look at the more traditional stats, it's really hard to see why they should even be close.  Gonzalez: 2.50 ERA, 1.14 WHIP, 163 K's in 179 IP  Scherzer: 2.32 ERA, 0.87 WHIP, 239 K's in 178 IP  I always thought that sabermetrics-oriented stats tended to favor pitchers who struck out more batters.  Scherzer has way more strikeouts and far fewer baserunners allowed (as indicated by the WHIP).  Can someone explain why their WARs are so similar despite this?  In my view, there's a pretty huge difference in WHIP and K's.  Also, there's a really big difference in their FIP values -- Gonzalez is at 3.89 while Scherzer is at 2.96.  Why don't these differences show up in the WAR for each pitcher? "

484,In which year of the Campeonato Paulista the teams would dispute penalty shot-out before the game in order to win a point in the case of draw?,"When I was younger I remember watching some football matches in Brazil. Now, I don't remember if it was the Brazilian league of if it was state leagues inside Brazil. But I am almost 100% sure that they were matches of Campeonato Paulista.  At the beginning of each match they would dispute a penalty shoot-out to decide who would win an extra point in case the game was tied.  Here was the logic that was explained to me at the time:   In football, when a team wins it gets 3 points and the other team gets 0 points. When a match is tied, each team receives 1 point. So technically a match is worth 3 points for a win-lose game, but it is worth only 2 points for a tie-tie game.   To solve this ""problem"" (in quotation because it turns out it is not a big problem after all) the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF in Portuguese) decided to test this formula where teams would dispute shoot-outs at the start of every game to see who would win one extra point in the case of a tied match.  I would like to know which year that formula was adopted? And, if possible, why it was not implemented in the following years? Was it a FIFA recommendation to implement it in the first place? Was it ever tested somewhere else? I asked some of my friends from Brazil but they think I am dreaming... "

However, today I've been reading up a little on the subject and have a question related to the NBA player draft.  This wiki article states:     the NBA holds a draft lottery to determine who chooses first. The top three picks are allocated by chance among the 14 teams that did not make the playoffs the year before. This discourages a team from losing on purpose to get a better draft pick.   My question is:  Has a team actually done this (lost on purpose) before?  Surely there'd be disadvantages to this that far outweigh the advantage gained in getting the best draftees? "
492,"How does golf technology compensate for the ""groove rule"" for golf clubs?","Question  Can V-grooves replicate the performance of U-grooves via golf technology? In other words: How does golf technology compensate for the ""groove rule"" for golf clubs?    Information  The United States Golf Association (USGA) implemented a ""groove rule"" for golf clubs effective January 1, 2010.   This rule allows only V-grooves (and similar conformed grooves) to be used in competitions on The PGA Tour, the European PGA Tour, the LPGA, the PGA of America and the International Federation of PGA Tours. U-grooves previously conformed to regulations, but no longer do with this new rule.  A reason for the implementation of this new rule:     ""Our research shows that the rough has become less of a challenge for   the highly skilled professional and that driving accuracy is now less   of a key factor for success,"" said USGA Senior Technical Director Dick   Rugge. ""We believe that these changes will increase the challenge of   the game at the Tour level, while having a very small effect on the   play of most golfers.""   Information on U-grooves and V-grooves:         The research undertaken and published by the USGA and The R&amp;A   demonstrates that for shots from the rough with urethane-covered balls   (the type of ball most used by highly skilled players), modern,   sharp-edged U-grooves result in higher ball spin rates and steeper   ball landing angles than the V-groove designs used predominantly in   the past. The combination of a higher spin rate and steeper landing   angle results in better control when hitting to the green. Shots from   the rough become more similar to shots from the fairway, creating less   challenge for shots from the rough.  "

494,Deciding the winner of a boxing match,"Question  Boxing matches are (usually) decided by knockout or decision. However, Timothy Bradley's victory over Manny Pacquiao in June 2012 was highly and widely controversial. CompuBox stats show that Pacquiao landed more punches than Bradley in 10 of 12 rounds.   If knockout does not decide who wins a boxing match, then how do judges come to a ""decision"" of who wins? (see below for judging criteria)   Can promotions/PPVs (ie. politics, media) influence decisions, and/or are there other factors?  Below is supplemental information that may help illustrate a point.    Information  Bradley vs. Pacquiao CompuBox stats:  Total Punches (Landed/Thrown)   Pacquiao 34% (253/751) Bradley 19% (159/839)   Jabs (Landed/Thrown)   Pacquiao 24% (63/258) Bradley 11% (51/449)   Power Punches Landed / Thrown   Pacquiao 39% (190/493) Bradley 28% (108/390)     Judging Criteria  I found the following judging criteria in this article.  The author sources the International Boxing Association Technical &amp; Competition Rules and the World Boxing Association Regulations and Rules Governing World Championship Contests.     Qualification      Before a fighter begins a bout, he must qualify according to the rules   of the sanctioning organization.        Counting Punches      Throughout the course of each round, judges count the number of   punches each boxer lands. These punches are divided between ""power   punches"" that land solidly with force, and ""glancing punches"" such as   a light jab, or a punch that slides along the body. Punches with no   force, or punches to the arms, are not counted at all.      Winning the Round       If a fighter has scored more punches at the end of a round, the judges award the round to that fighter. If it's a tie,   the win goes to the fighter each judge decides showed the most   control, technique or style during the round.      Winning the Bout       A fighter who wins a round receives 10 points for that round. The loser of a round receives 9 or fewer points, based on   the margin by which he lost. As a general rule, receiving less than 9   points only happens in the case of a knockdown, penalty point or   similar major sign that a fighter was outclassed. After all rounds are   fought, the judges total the scores to determine a match total.   Whoever has the most points wins.      Knockout and Technical Knockout       A fighter is considered knocked out if he is knocked down and unable to stand after a 10-second count.   If a fighter gets knocked down and stands in time but is knocked down   enough times, the referee will stop the match as a technical knockout.   Referees will also award a ""TKO"" if one fighter appears to be no   longer able to defend himself or seems to be severely concussed.  "

Which are the benefits of such an odd format?  Is this format really odd, or is it somewhat widespread in team sports? "

504,What is the seeding logic for the March Madness play-in (First Four) teams?,"  So, you'd think that the ""First Four"" teams would be considered the worst teams in the NCAA Tournament. They have to play themselves into the bracket a couple days before the real tourney starts.  But the teams aren't all vying for a 16 seed, as you might imagine. Why not? Did the NCAA committee decide beforehand that it would make the play-in games for two 16 seeds, a 12 seed, and an 11 seed? Or did it decide the seeding after picking the teams?  Either way, it seems unfair. What gives? "

506,How should an ideal sailing boat react when losing control? How about ice sailing boat?,My fellow sailor said that an ideal sailing boat should turn against the direction of waves when losing control. Then he said that ice sailing boats cannot do this. This is apparently because ice sailing boats do not have a keel. Now  How/why does the ideal sailing boat stop when losing control? Why is this not possible with ice sailing boat without keel?

510,Head Position in Swimming,"I am trying to fix my head and hip positioning by looking down instead of forward and pressing my chest and / or head down.  It's kind of awkward to press your chest down while also looking down and keeping your head at the surface of the water. My friend tells me that I was swimming with my whole body about an inch below the surface. But I'm pretty sure it was faster.  In some videos, Phelps looks like he's looking pretty far forward, so I tried to look a little forward and press only my chest. That felt like it really worked to get my hips on the surface and my head at the top, but I was told that my head was still underwater and it also didn't feel quite as fast. It was also hard to press the chest without feeling like I was looking way too far forward.   I'm sure I'll get used to this, but when I press my chest down, I feel like I have so much less breath. I'm a sprinter, so it's less of a big deal, but I'm hoping that goes away eventually or is at least normal?  Some of the later positions I've tried for head and hip position have made my upper lats through my shoulders through the top of the arm ache/hurt, and this aching is accentuated when I switch to a kickboard for kicking sets. I think I've become lazy in my arm pulls as I work on other technical issues (which may be contributing to this), but part of it I think is that my arm is floating above my head and body so when I rotate and pull the arm, it doesn't have as much power.   Thorpe complicates the whole issue because apparently he lets his hips drop a little so he can use his legs to power him along better.   What can I do to alleviate these issues and how can I get a better head and hip position for sprinting? "
511,Bad Breathing Habits in Swimming,"As I turn my head to breathe (almost always to the left), I reach my head out to the left. I think this is probably because I am reaching with my right arm, and trying to reach as far as I can is throwing my head out of alignment.   I also breathe for too long. It's only like a half second too long, but every half second counts.   Also, as I have been pressing my chest and head to get my hips up lately, I have found it increasingly difficult to do a quick, straight breath.   What are some drills for these breathing issues? How else can I fix these problems? "
512,What are the technical differences between freestyle and butterfly swimming?,"Freestyle times (46.91 WR for 100m) tend to be faster than butterfly (49.82 WR for 100m) times. However, the ""peak speed"" for butterfly is faster than freestyle(1). Would this have to do with an aerodynamic or technical effect?  What are the technical differences between freestyle and butterfly? "
513,Is it possible to win a cricket match by 0 wickets?,"Suppose we have an ODI match between Team A and Team B. Team B batted first and scored 300 / 6 in 50 overs. After 49.5 overs, Team A reaches 300 / 9. Player X, who is on strike, is on 98. He wants to complete his century. In the following situation, what happens:   A legal ball is bowled, and the the batsman hits it straight to a fielder at long on. Both the batsmen start running and complete a run. Player X turns back for another run. His partner is busy celebrating their win and does not turn back. The fielder throws the ball towards the bowler's end. Player X, seeing that his partner is not turning back, tries to return back. It's a direct hit, and Player X is out.   The score is now 301 / 10, and Team A has won, but by how many wickets? 0? "
514,How are race numbers in cycling races assigned?,"In cycling races all riders wear race numbers for easier identification. Are there som rules or traditions which decide which team gets which set of numbers?  By looking on some races, it looks that number 1 is assigned to the past winner, if they start again this year. But I am not sure how it works with higher numbers. I am also not sure what happens if the last year's winners does not start. Also, does it depend on the cyclist who won last year or on the team who won the previous edition of the race? If there are rules about this, are they different for stage races and one-day race?    For example, looking at 2016 Tour of Flanders startlist, the winner from last year was wearing number 1. But the rider who was the 2nd last year was wearing 25. The 2015 winner John Degenkolb could not race in 2016 Paris–Roubaix due to injuries. But his team still received the first numbers in the 2016 startlist.  When I look at this year's Giro d'Italia startlist, the teams seem to be ordered alphabetically. The reason might be that the last year's winner does not participate in Giro this year.   The defending champion Nairo Quintana did not race at this year's Tirreno-Adriatico. In the startlist, the first race numbers were assigned to Tinkoff team and then it seems to continue alphabetically.  "
515,What happened in the Tony Drago vs. Alan McManus 2012 German Masters?,"The situation I’m referring to can be seen in the following YouTube video:   Tony Drago goes mad. German Masters Q v Alan McManus   Starting around the 4:50 mark in the video, an exchange between the players and the referee occurs which I cannot entirely make out, and after the exchange Tony Drago beats himself on the head. The referee asked Drago repeatedly, “Would you like to withdraw your concession?” but I have no idea what the response was and what caused Drago’s upset.  My questions therefore:   From a technical rulebook point-of-view, what happened? What did the players (likely) discuss in the exchange and what conclusion was reached? Why did Tony Drago get upset at himself?  "
516,How does the World Ranking work?,"Why are athletes ranked the way they are in the BWF world ranking?  For instance, Marc Zwiebler, listed as World #10 as of May 2016, has not won any tournament this year, and has never won a top-level (Superseries) event. How come he's ranked so highly? "

518,How exactly did the knockout punch work in Ali vs Liston (1965)?,"Ali vs Liston was a very famous match in the history of professional boxing, where Ali downed his opponent in a 1st round, 1st minute KO.

523,Greatest weight ever lifted (with good evidence),"It is widely reported that Paul Anderson lifted 6270lbs in a ""backlift"", but I have never seen a photo of this event and it seems that perhaps the story is exaggerated. So my question is, what is the greatest weight lifted by a human, for which there is irrefutable evidence - preferably including photos or video.  Edit: In response to a comment and to clarify further - I am talking about any style of lift. I do not care about how far the object is lifted off the ground. It could be just 1mm. This does introduce a problem, particularly for bulky objects (like cars) because you have to check very carefully that all four wheels are off the ground at the same time. So the refereeing of the lift must be strict for the record to count. I would expect the heaviest weight lifted to be way way more (2x? 3x?) than simply the world record squat. "
524,Does the run count?,"Runners on 2nd and 3rd 1 out... the batter hits a drive to the OF and the ball is caught for the 2nd out. the runners advance to home and 3rd base respectively for a sac fly... However, the runner on 2nd left to early and the defense appealed and the umpire called the runner trying to advance to 3rd out for leaving early but the runner on third scored easily before the double play now 8-6-1-4 occurred.. does the run count??? This really happened in my teams game 2 nights ago?? "
525,What determines the coefficients in the definition of slugging percentage?,"When calculating slugging percentage, why do the numbers of singles, doubles, and triples get multiplied by 2, 3 and 4, respectively, in the numerator? And, perhaps related, why does the HR count remain as is without a coefficient? "
526,Can a batter in baseball hit a foul ball twice?,"Unsure if that is that most accurate way of stating my question but what happens if a batter hits a foul ball that goes near the batter and he attempts to hit it again and misses or hits the ball foul again, is he out? Does a swing and a miss again count as another strike? "
527,"What does data about kWh in the French Open ""shots of the day"" videos mean?","The French Open publishes on its YouTube videos with ""shots of the day"" - the most impressive plays from a particular day at the tournament.  At the end of the point, an information about kWh is shown. For instance after this lob of Ramos in the match against Sock, the following data are shown:     41 forehand winners, 184,5 kWh.   What is this information supposed to represent? It would be especially nice if some official source about this can be found. (By ""official"", I mean from Roland Garros' website, the video sponsor, or the stats provider.) "
528,Why does a player have to serve a Too Many Men on the Ice penalty?,"When an ice-hockey team has too many players on the ice, it is given a ""Too Many Men on the Ice"" penalty. The rules recognize that this is not the fault of any individual player, and so assign a penalty to the team. However, a specific player is required to sit in the penalty box while the team is shorthanded for two minutes. It is not the player who is most to blame for the penalty, as the penalized team gets to choose which player goes to the box.  So, why is a team forced to take a specific player out of the action? Why couldn't it just play four skaters until the penalty is over without anyone actually sitting in the box? "
529,How often does this achievement happen in basketball?,"We have 5 categories in basketball which we take into account when triple-double or quadruple-double is achieved. They are: points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocked shots.  The achievement of quadruple-double is extremely rare, triple-double is not so rare, and I have defined the achievement that splits rebounds into offensive ones and defensive ones and I do not know how often such an achievement happens?  Now, to define it:     Let us call an achievement in basketball a jumper´s triple-double if the following two conditions are fulfilled:      1) The player has a double digit number of offensive rebounds and a double digit number of defensive rebounds.      2) The player has a double digit number of two out of the remaining four categories.   So, for example, if someone has 19 points and 10 assists and 23 rebounds and if 8 rebounds are offensive and 15 defensive than he did not achieve a jumper´s triple-double but if 11 rebounds are offensive and 12 defensive than he did achieve a jumper´s triple-double.  Now, two questions:     1) How often does the achievement of jumper´s triple-double happen (for instance, how many times we can expect it in one professional basketball season (you can take NBA as an example if you want))?      2) Can you give some documented examples of basketball players that achieved jumper´s triple-double?     NOTE: The term jumper's triple-double is NOT an official term for any basketball statistic and has been made up to indicate a particular statistic just for the purpose of this question.  "
530,Does a run count on a passed ball on a third strike?,"Under the following scenario would the run count?   With a runner on third and 2 outs, the batter swings and misses the third strike and the catcher does not catch the ball. Further the runner on third crosses home plate before the batter is either tagged out or out via a putout at first base? Does the general rule that a run doesn't count if the batter is out at first base apply or does it count because the runner is deemed to have scored because it is considered a stolen base?  "

532,Which climbers have successfully scaled a wall with 15C difficulty?,"I have been going through Alex Harrold's podcast in the Tim Ferris show, and there he says that there are only two climbers in the world who have successfully climbed a 15C difficulty wall.  Were there really only two climbers? Which climbers have achieved this?  On a search, I found that one was Adam Ondra. Who else has done so? "
533,What rules govern touchdowns/touchbacks if there is a fumble involved?,"I have a question specifically about a passage of the official NFL 2018 rulebook ([website]Please take a look at Rule 3 - Section 2 - Article 7 (PLAYER POSSESSION)  My question is about the notes on page 5 of the rulebook. There it says the following:     (2) In the field of play, if a catch or interception has been completed, and the ball comes loose before the player is down by   contact, it is a fumble, and the ball remains alive. It is also a fumble if the action occurs in the end zone of the player who   caught the loose ball. If the action occurs in the opponent’s end zone, it is a touchdown or a touchback.   I don't really understand the last sentence of this Note:     If the action occurs in the opponent’s end zone, it is a touchdown or a touchback.   If I understood this rule correctly, the situation described is that of a ball coming loose after it has been previously caught or intercepted. Now: if I catch a pass in my opponent's end zone or if I intercept one of his passes in his end zone, I'm scoring a touchdown, no matter what happens after that. If I secure the catch and an opponent smacks into me, causing me to lose the ball, that's still a TD, since I controlled the ball previously. And if I fail to make the catch, that's an incomplete pass and the next play begins. So how could this situation (making a catch in my opponents end zone) lead to a touchback? What am I missing here?  "

535,Why don't professional squash players give hard serves?,"I find it odd that in Squash championships, players don't put much energy into the serve. It seems to me that their serve is about half the speed of their fast shots during the game. Is there any rule preventing them from doing so? Or is there another disadvantage? "
536,Which runner is out?,"There is 1 out.  There is a runner on first, and the ball is hit to the second baseman.  The second baseman gets the ball and runs towards first.  The runner on first stays on 1st base and the batter is running towards first.  If the second baseman with the ball steps on first base, who is out and who is safe?  If the second baseman steps on first, do they still have a force on 2nd base? "
537,Can a trainer force a player to be substituted?,"In the final between Chelsea and Manchester City, Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa refused to be substituted, enraging his coach Sarri. Apparently, a few years ago, Messi acted the same way with his coach Enrique.  Can a coach force a player to get out of the field to be substituted, maybe by asking the referee to tell him to get out? Can a player really refuse to get out, if he does not want to? Are there any rule discussing these situations? According to the official rules, was there anything Sarri could have done? "

539,"Referee stopped match mid-game and lost control, what happens?","On the weekend the ref was blatantly giving all the decisions to the home team so was recieveing some grief from the sidelines. On the 52nd minute one of the away players said to the home player 'How much are you paying him?'. The referee went ahead and gave him a red card. After a few minutes there was a disagreement between the linesman (away team parent) and the ref and the linesman walked off and refused to linesman the game. The ref declared the game abandoned and blew for the final whistle in the 52nd minute. The score was 2-2 and bearing in mind this was a junior game, who wins? "
540,Why does a tennis ball have a curvilinear oval that goes around it?,"Tennis balls are mostly covered with felt, and they have a white curvilinear oval that goes around them.    Is there any reason tennis balls have that oval, instead of just being completely covered with felt?  That oval seems to be the same shape as the oval of stitches that goes around a baseball, and the stitches definitely affect the movement of a baseball.  Does the oval affect the movement of a tennis ball?  Or would a tennis ball move the same way even if it was covered completely in felt? "
541,Are 10+ year contracts discouraged or prohibited in the NFL?,"In 2019, Mike Trout signed a 12-year, [tex]330 million contract. There have been several 10-year contracts signed by baseball players.  The longest contracts in the NFL during the 2018-2019 season are 6 years in length. The longest contracts in the NFL during the 2000s were 8-12 years in length.  Are 10+ year contracts discouraged or prohibited in the NFL? If discouraged, why? There were a few NFL contracts in the 10+ year range in the 2000s, but none since. "

543,Was Larry Bird the first basketball player to wipe his sneakers during games?,"Players wiping their sneakers during deadball periods is ubiquitous now.  I remember hearing somewhere that Larry Bird started doing it, but not for any particular reason.  Is he the first to make this action during a game?  Was there another player to have done it sooner? "
544,Penalty for interfering with the path of the cue ball?,"In snooker, what is the penalty for interfering with the path of the cue ball?  I assume it must be more than 7 points because let's say a player hits a shot and he sees the cue ball heading for the black which is not on, then it is a seven point foul if he hits it, so let's say he sticks his cue in front of the cue ball and deflects it, what is the penalty?  I guess the same question could apply in any situation where the frame is in jeopardy if the cue ball gets into position. In other words, let's say that if the cue ball lands in favorable position for the other player, then you will lose the frame. No penalty is big enough, because you will lose the frame anyway, so you might as well foul to prevent it. "
545,How can Real Madrid poach players from its near-peers?,"Real Madrid is evidently in pursuit of such high profile players as Kylian Mbappe and Sadio Mane. Both those players are young and good...and valuable. Any world-class club would like to build around them. So why would PSG and Liverpool let them go?  Deloitte's 2019 Football Money League shows that Real has annual revenues of €750M; while PSG is at €540M and Liverpool is at €510M. Real is richer, but not by much. Let us say that Mbappe transfers for €300 and Sane for €100. If we amortized the transfer fees over 2 years; then Real's annual income is down to €550M, a year; no real advantage over PSG or Liverpool. So, even if Real doesn't pay to transfer in another big name for 2 more years, the high cost of the transfer fee means they shouldn't be able to offer a more lucrative contract to the players in question than other world-class teams with high revenues.  In general, I don't understand how any of the top tier teams are able to afford to transfer player from the other top tier teams. In some cases, like Ronaldo going to Juventus, it seems that it was the player's idea to make the move. But absent player unhappiness, if Sane is happy in Liverpool, then why can't Liverpool pay enough to keep him?  How does Real Madrid, in particular, have the financial muscle to buy whoever they want, even from other teams with top-10 revenues? "
546,"What team has shortest ""longest losing streak"" within a season in NBA history?","Inspired by this question: What team has shortest longest losing streak within a season in MLB history?  What team has shortest ""longest losing streak"" within a season in NBA history? Off the top of my head, the 2015-2016 Golden State Warriors and the 1995-1996 Chicago Bulls are the most likely to have achieved short losing streaks given they lost 9 and 10 games throughout their respective seasons. "
547,"What does ""weight"" mean in the context of putting?","In Hot Shots Golf: Out of Bounds, the phrase ""give it weight"" is occasionally muttered by a caddie before a player attempts a putt. I always thought since the game is a caricature of golf, the phrase was specific to the quirkiness of said game.  However, Tiger Tracker tweeted:     Perfect weight, but misses an inch or two left. Tiger's par is conceded.   Given the context, ""weight"" seems to mean ""speed on a putt."" Thus, ""give it weight"" would seem to mean ""apply speed to the putt."" Would this be accurate? In conjunction, is there any history of the term's origins or usage throughout the years? I haven't heard ""weight"" used during golf broadcasts in this context. "
548,Why are there so many motorsport/race series?,"Apparently, there are many motorsport competitions out there. I understand I can run, say, a cricket league in Russia. As long as I have enough people to compete and a lawn, I don't need much funding, be it from sponsors or spectators. What I don't understand is: How can there be so many motorsport championships, given that it's pretty expensive compared to other sports?  I'm not talking about flagship series like Formula 1, NASCAR or Rallye World Championship. I'm talking about all those weird small series at least I have never heard about. In my view, racing is expensive. You need cars, you have to rent a race track, you need mechanics, etc. How can these championships pay off if you have no or hardly media coverage and maybe a few people watching at the track? Two possible answers emerge to me.   There are plenty of motorsports fans I am just not aware of Most of these series indeed do not pay off, but are used as a marketing vehicle (pun intended :) ) for car manufacturers.    Does somebody have some deeper information on this, preferably with some facts? "
549,What happens if a referee gets injured and there is no replacement available?,"I understand that the fourth official is there to come on if the main referee gets injured, but what happens if even the substitute is injured .

550,Can Bautista re-sign with the Blue Jays outside the terms of mutual option?,"It is generally accepted that Jose Bautista played his last home game for the Toronto Blue Jays this past weekend (2017-09-24) since the Jays are not expected to pick up their end of the mutual option on his contract (too expensive given on-field results this year).  Assuming that happens, does he just become a ""normal"" free agent in the sense that he can shop around and accept an offer from any team -- including Toronto if they make an offer that is acceptable to him?  Essentially, does anything in the CBA or other MLB rules prevent the Jays from signing him for terms other than those outlined in the mutual option? "
551,What is the distance allowed for the goalkeeper to be off the line during penalty kick?,"Recently, I saw a video showing a penalty kick replayed twice because the goalkeeper advanced from the goal line.

552,Has the Lambeau Leap been banned at all NFL stadiums except Lambeau Field?,"The Lambeau Leap is a celebration started by Green Bay Packers players who leap into the stands after scoring a touchdown at Lambeau Field.  The celebration has spread across the NFL though, because I've seen players on other teams leap into the stands after scoring a touchdown at their home stadiums.  During the September 28, 2017 game between the Bears and Packers at Lambeau Field, Green Bay running back Aaron Jones scored a touchdown in the second quarter.  He celebrated by doing a Lambeau Leap.  Jim Nantz and Tony Romo commented on the Lambeau Leap during the CBS broadcast, and they said that the Lambeau Leap had been banned at every stadium except Lambeau Field, where it had been grandfathered in:     Nantz: First and goal at the 2.  Aaron Jones, he's in for the touchdown.  Running right behind Jahri Evans.  And there is your first career Lambeau Leap, Aaron Jones.   Romo: Just a normal handoff, and a really good jump cut right there by Jones getting in the end zone, and you see that right there, right behind Evans, and then he does the Lambeau Leap.  By the way, have you noticed Jim?  The Lambeau Leap?   Nantz: It's been outlawed everywhere...   Romo: No, no.   Nantz: ...but one place.   Romo: It's not outlawed here.   Nantz: It's grandfathered in here.   Romo: Grandfathered in, exactly.   Nantz: Everyplace but here.   Romo: It's like oh you know we like it, we're gonna keep it.   Nantz: You can't take that away.   Romo: No, it's too big a deal.   Is that true?  Has the Lambeau Leap been banned at every NFL stadium except Lambeau Field?  If so, when did that happen? "

554,Rugby league: does a knock-on require an immediate stoppage of play?,"In a few recent rugby league (Australian NRL) games that I have seen, a player will drop a ball that was passed to him, causing it to move forward off of his hands and bounce forward on the ground. Subsequently, a player from the opposing team will rush toward the ball, grab it, and make a mad dash toward their opponent's goal line.  From looking through the official rules, it is my understanding that dropping the ball in a forward motion (except during a charge-down) is a knock-on, which, according to the book, should result in a scrum being awarded to the defense.  Why is the recovering player allowed to take over possession of the ball without a scrum?  The only thing that I can think of is that if a knock-on is considered a penalty, perhaps the opponent is allowed to keep playing so long as they have the advantage? "

According to the Wikipedia article about this stadium,     The stadium is located at an altitude of 3,637 metres (11,932 feet) above sea level, making it one of the highest professional stadiums in the world.

559,Are there additional conditions for qualifying to WTA Finals other than race rankings?,"The Wikipedia article on 2017 WTA Finals1 has some brief explanation of how qualification for this tournament works. Based on the description given there it seems that simply the top players in the race rankings are taken. (The only thing which is slightly more complicated is which tournaments have to be counted, it seems that they are Grand Slams and some Premier level tournaments, with some possible exceptions.2  Apart from rankings, are there some other conditions player has to fulfill to qualify?   For example, in the men's tournament3, Grand Slam winner might qualify even if he is not in the top 8 positions of rankings. Is there a similar rule for WTA finals? (Of course, it is already clear that this cannot happen in ATP rankings this year. But if you look at WTA rankings, the US Open winner Sloane Stephens missed the first half of the season due to surgery, so she is very unlikely to get into top 8. So if there is a similar rule also for WTA finals, it could make difference.) Another example: In an online discussion, I was told that one of the condition for qualifying is that the player has to win at least one WTA tournament during the year. However, I was not able to find any confirmation of this rule. (And this would contradict the Wikipedia article - Venus Williams is listed among players who already qualified, but so far she does not have a WTA title in this season. Of course, what somebody claims online is far from being a reputable source, but still that made me curious.)   1Here is link to the current revision. 2Some exceptions concerning the premier tournaments are mentioned in the footnotes below the table saying: ""The player's ranking at the time did not qualify her to play this event. Accordingly, the player's next best result is counted in its place."" and ""The player was not a Top 20 player at the end of 2016 and therefore not required to count her two best Premier 5 results. Accordingly, the player's next best result is counted in its place."" 3Again, I will add a link to the current revision of the Wikipedia article. "

562,Calculate Assist Percentage in basketball,"On Basketball Reference they state that      Assist Percentage; the formula is 100 * AST / (((MP / (Team MP / 5)) * Team FG) - FG). Assist percentage is an estimate of the percentage of teammate field goals a player assisted while he was on the floor.   If you take a game from the NBA and look at Russell Westbrook for example.  MP=36, AST=10, FG=17  Team FG=40, Team MP= 48  So using the formula I do  100 * 10 / (((36 / (48 / 5)) * 40) - 17)  Which equals 7.519  But on the NBA stats site it comes back with 58.8.  Have I done something wrong with the calculation here or am I missing something? "

567,"In the Benfica vs Man Utd match, why did the referee point to his watch after the goal?","In the Champions League match between Benfica and Manchester United that happened on Oct 18, 2017, Rashford took a freekick, the Benfica goalkeeper misjudged the angle and trajectory of the freekick and carried the ball inside the goal. The referee was standing very far away, but even then he knew the ball had crossed and I think he said so by pointing to his watch. Why did he do that? Does the ball have some sort of GPS tracker that relays to the watch? Can someone explain this? "
568,"Do sportsbooks structure ""lossless"" bets?","Brand new to sportsbetting here, and am trying to understand something. Does the oddsmaker/betmaker ever stand to lose money, or do they structure their offered bets in such a way that they always make money no matter what the result is?    Say you have Team A playing Team B, and an oddsmaker offers a bet on this game with a limit of, say $25 on it. For this question, I don't think the odds actually matter at all.  Let's keep it simple and pretend that only 5 people place bets on this game. Each and every one of them bets on Team A at the max bet limit of [tex]25 = $125 the betmaker now has in her pocket.  Team A wins. If I understand things correctly here, I believe that they are now owed -- from the betmaker -- two times their original bet (so [tex]50). This means 5 bettors need to be paid out [tex]250. In this scenario, this betmaker is at a loss of [tex]250 = -$125.  Even if they take a 10% vig/juice, they're still out of pocket and at a loss on this one.  So I ask: does this happen all the time, or are bets always structured in such a way that the betmaker never takes a loss on a bet? If so, how does this ""lossless"" bet structure work? "
569,How does one fill out a bracket?,"How do you fill out a bracket? I am not asking how one chooses particular teams.  I have never done a bracket before in my life. I have figured out that the two teams connected by a line means they play a match. So assuming I have chosen a winner, I think I put the winning team's name above the line on the next round over, and do this for all the teams and all the rounds until I have a final champion.  There are a couple of questions I have, though.   At the top of my blank bracket, there are 8 teams that are completely separated. Are they also playing? Or do they have their own mini-tournament going on?  After the bracket has been filled, how do you track the actual results? Do you cross out an incorrect choice and replace it with the correct winner? Do you write underneath in a different color? Since the first results have started to come in today, I don't want to mark my bracket improperly. "
570,Out of breath after swimming 300m,"I swim combat side stroke only, and have managed to make my way to around 300m straight. However, it seems like no matter what I do, I can't make it past 300m. Yesterday, I put a float between my thighs and did minimal flutter kicks instead of the big scissor kick in the css stroke, and felt like a could swim forever. Why am I running out of breath with the scissor kick? Is it because I'm trying to hard to propel with my legs, or is it because I'm trying to hard to balance myself? I'm a little confused.  "

572,Can a large stadium impact college basketball players' shooting?,"In the later stages of the NCAA Tournament (the Final Four, and possibly Elite Eight and Sweet Sixteen), the games are usually played in large stadiums to accommodate a huge number of fans.  Sometimes during these games, certain players (or even entire teams) have very bad shooting performances.  Often times people and commentators will say it's because the players aren't used to shooting in such large arenas. They frequently cite depth-perception problems as a result of the wide-open feel of the basketball court.  Is this true?  Can a large stadium really cause depth-perception or other problems that would impact a player's shooting?  I would imagine that most of these players grew up playing on outdoor courts, so I don't know why a wide-open feel would have any impact on them. "

My problem is some of the girls don't like it b/c the guys throw too hard.  I can't totally nix dodgeball as an activity because we ask the kids to help lead/pick games and this is one of the more popular games.  What ways are there to even things out?

575,Please explain confusing situation in 2009 UK Championship O’Sullivan vs. Higgins,"The situation in question is recorded in this video:     UK Championship 2009 Day 8. OSullivan — Higgins. Frame 13, weird situation    My questions are:   Starting at 1:40 in the video, what is the referee doing? They are placing a red ball on the table and the commentators suggest that he is determining whether that red can be hit from where the cue ball is — but why does he need to know that, about a ball that isn’t on the table? What happens at 5:24? The referee calls a foul, but for what? And whatever it is, did Ronnie do it intentionally to escape the situation, or was it a genuine mistake? At 6:05, Higgins is told that he cannot request a replace because of the foul. Why is he confused about this? What do the commentators mean when they say “it’s still a miss” and “if you play a foul shot, you can call a miss”? What are the players and the referee discussing?  "

In this case the table is coming for outdoor use (it's also played indoors during winter), where the natural white light may be bright, the grass and trees green, and so on. During winter the artificial light is much more yellow, and walls usually white.  What does experience tell about the color? Is the contrast to the white ball as good on a grey tabletop as on a blue tabletop for example?  I know the table should officially be blue/green in competitions, but can one notice a difference? Are they really better colours than eg grey when playing as a hobby? "

582,Is it a foul for the defender to preemptively slide tackle a potential shot?,"Let's say that the striker is closing in to the goal post on the right side.  As a defender, I am running towards the middle of the right post and the striker.  I perform a slide tackle towards the line in anticipation of a shot from the striker.  3 possible scenarios could happen with the slide tackle:   The striker hits the ball and I might take it out of play with my slide tackle The striker side steps me and continues to the goal The slide tackle in front of the striker caught him by surprise and he crashes into me with the ball.   Is the above move legitimate in football?  What happens if situation 3 happens, is it a foul?  Is it risky for the striker to get injured?  I'm playing recreational football, so I'm not sure if I should be doing any slide tackle at all even if the striker is far from me. "

What should I pay attention to when buying one?  The racket I had was just a random racket I could afford when I was a student. It was not particularly light, and I don't think it was very stiff either. The last two years I have been playing for fun and fitness on a weekly basis. Before that I played a few times each year at most.

589,Gymnastics Scoring,"In scoring routines in gymnastics, there is ""theoretically no limit to the score a gymnast can achieve."" However, the highest score judges can award for the execution of a routine is 10. Furthermore, ""17"" and ""perfect 10"" are often synonymous.  Given the former, has a score greater than 7 ever been awarded for the difficulty of a gymnast's routine? If theoretically possible, how does a gymnast's routine accomplish this?    A summary of the scoring system in gymnastics:   A panel of judges score the execution of the routine. This score starts at 10 and decreases with each deductable instance, such as taking a step when landing a dismount or falling off a balance beam. Another panel of judges score the difficulty of the routine. This score starts at 0 and increases with every skill/combination performed.    A sample routine score:   "

591,Relief from cart path on a hill,"I sent this question to the USGA, based on a situation from my last round; we'll see what they say in about a month (if that), but I thought I'd let you guys have a try as I'll be playing the same course before the USGA's likely to get back to me.  EDITED:     A player's ball has come to rest in bounds against the outside edge   (opposite to the fairway) of a formed concrete cart path running   roughly parallel to the line of play, which is an immovable   obstruction. This cart path travels perpendicular to the incline of a   hill rising away from the fairway, such that the nearest point of   relief from the current lie (the closest point perpendicular to the   desired line of play at which the cart path no longer impedes the   player's stance or swing) is further up the incline. The player takes   relief under Rule 24-2b(i) by dropping the ball at this nearest point   of relief. The ball hits the turf and rolls back down the incline,   again coming to rest against the outside of the cart path, thus   requiring a re-drop under 20-2c. This has the same result, and again under rule 20-2c, the ball is required to be placed at the spot; it still rolls, and rolls again when replaced under 20-3, and no suitable point within a clublength of the nearest point of relief can be found where the ball will remain where it is placed.      The player and his fellow-competitors concede that attempting to take   relief at the determined point is futile. So, the player determines a new ""nearest   point of relief"" to be on the opposite side of the cart path, and   drops a ball at that point. The ball then rolls down the incline onto   the fairway (not nearer the hole), coming to rest more than two   clublengths away from the point of relief, and thus requiring a   re-drop under 20-2c; however, the situation is similar, as whether dropped or placed the ball is almost certain to roll into a position violating 20-2 or 20-3. A fellow-competitor also says that this is a violation of Rule 13-2 as, in taking relief, the player has moved his ball from the rough to the fairway, thus dramatically improving its lie and the line of play beyond what is reasonable to allow in taking relief from the obstruction.      The player and fellow-competitors decide on two solutions they feel to   be equitable: first, to allow the player to play the ball as it now   lies under penalty of one stroke; or second, to return the ball to   its original lie, and then use the procedure under Rule 28b   (determining a point on a line between the lie and the hole and behind   the current lie) to define the ""nearest point of relief"" at which the   player may take relief under 24-2b(i) without penalty. The player is   given the choice and chooses the latter, and the ball is dropped   successfully at a point 25 yards behind the initial lie, inside the   cart path, and played from that spot to completion of the hole.      Did the players proceed correctly? Would it also have been correct to   choose the first option?   EDIT: edmastermind29's answer to the question as originally stated is completely true and correct; the ball should be placed at the nearest point of relief if after both a drop and re-drop the ball comes to rest in a spot where the obstruction interferes.   However, Rule 20-3d states:     If a ball when placed fails to come to rest on the spot on which it was placed, there is no penalty and the ball must be replaced. If it still fails to come to rest on that spot:      (i) except in a hazard, it must be placed at the nearest spot where it can be placed at rest that is not nearer the hole and not in a hazard;   We may assume, for the purposes of this question, that the hill is steep enough that the ball will roll when placed as well as when dropped; that the crest of the hill is out of bounds; and thus that the ""nearest spot where the [the ball] can be placed at rest that is not nearer the hole"" is at the edge of the fairway near the bottom of the incline (this really was the situation; the hill, being mostly in the rough, was not being watered due to drought conditions, and as a result what grass there was was thin, dormant and providing virtually no rolling resistance). Thus, the situation would have been the same after the correct procedures were followed.  Rule 13-2 states:     A player must not improve or allow to be improved:         the position or lie of his ball     "
592,Why do swimmers peak at such a young age?,"Why do swimmers reach their peak performance at a relatively young age compared with track and field athletes? Particularly female swimmers seem to produce their best results in their late teens to early twenties. This seems to be true for both sprint and longer distances.  By contrast, track sprinters peak at an older age than swimmers, and endurance runners even older. Is there perhaps a buoyancy issue? Do younger swimmers who are not fully developed physically have an advantage because they have built up the muscles they need through training, but have an overall physique that isn't fully bulked out, meaning less dead weight? Compared with track athletes, a streamlined body is more important since water drag is much greater than air. I would be interested in an answer that addressed the physiology involved.  Edit: Here is a study using the career performance of thousands of athletes. [website]"
593,Disqualification due to unmotivated play/intentional losing,"Yesterday I read about the latest ""scandal"" at the Olympic games in London, that 8 players (4 pairs) have been disqualified from the Womens' badminton championship due to ""not using one's best efforts to win"" (the article on BBC). This seems like quite a drastic move by the ruling bodies, and apparently it has caused one of the best players in the sport to quit badminton altogether (reference).    Neither have I seen the games on TV nor am I particularly knowledgeable about badminton regulations but I find the events, the discussion and the outcomes particularly interesting as a sports enthusiast.   So my questions regarding the events are:   Are the disqualifications justified with the current regulations?  Has something like this happened (in this scale that is) in badminton, or any other sport, before? What implications will this event most likely have on the sport, or the Olympic games as a whole?   Edit video showing some parts of the games in question:  "

597,"If grunting is not related to performance, why do tennis players do it excessively?","While watching Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova play for the gold medal in London 2012, I noticed Williams was going about her business while Sharapova was grunting each time she hit the ball.  After doing some research, grunting in tennis dates back to 1962. Although men grunt, women draw more attention due to their high-pitched grunts. In addition, there is an initiative to eliminate excess grunts in the next generation of tennis players.  Another quote from said research says:     ""I have not found in my 32 years anybody who says grunting or not   grunting has an empirically positive or negative effect on performance   -- it's all about belief system.""   What is this ""belief system?""  If grunting is not related to performance, why do tennis players do it excessively?  "

Will it be all squad members regardless of if they played? Or is there a minimum numbers of minutes a player must have spent on the pitch?  I am curious, because if it is the latter I wonder if managers would feel pressured to play each player the minimum minutes in the event they reach a medal position. This would then potentially reduce the chances of the teams playing at their best. "

As far as I understand Arsenal is a public limited company - I will admit that I am not very knowledgeable about this financial talk.  Galatasaray is in a similar position, however, they need to declare all of their signings and the signings' total income when the transfer is finalized. Further, they have to declare when transfer talks are in play to not be charged, AFAIK, due to being a public company in the Turkish stock market.  We see a similar situation with Barcelona FC and the signing of Neymar.  So how can Manchester City and Arsenal manage to hide the exchange of money for a transfer? Shouldn't that be public knowledge? "
603,Why do athletes need help standing up?,"Watching televised sports, especially American Football and Basketball, it seems that whenever a player falls or is knocked down, he needs help getting back up. With football, it is somewhat understandable, since they wear pads that get in the way. But for a basketball player, it seems trivial to stand up, yet I often see players sit on the court until another player offers them a hand up.  Is there a reason for this? I understand that one reason might be a form of team camaraderie. But is there any other reason? Is it difficult for the downed player to stand on his own?  Edited to add  I understand the sportsmanship element in helping an opponent (or teammate) up.   But today I saw a college basketball player sitting on the court, long after most other players were moving on, waving at teammates to come over and give him a hand up. It wasn't an act of sportsmanship, it seemed more like he needed help simply to stand up (and no, he wasn't injured). I actually see this quite often and it always puzzles me.   As I said, I can understand it in football due to the pads they wear affecting mobility when on the ground, but that isn't present in basketball. I don't really watch any other sports, so I don't know if it is prevalent anywhere else. "
604,How many video cameras are used for cricket broadcasting?,"How many video cameras are used for broadcasting an international cricket match?  Especially for the current world T20i, they are covering the each and every corner of the stadium. I would like to know the number of cameras used for that including stump cameras and spider cams.   I think these numbers will also be equal to IPL. Is it? "
605,Are consecutive let (net services) allowed?,Is a point awarded to my opponent if I serve two lets in a row? Or can I serve as many let serve as I want until one of my services is legal or illegal? 
606,Why don't professional bowlers score higher?,"It appears the average professional bowler scores around 230-240 out of 300. In my opinion, this should be much higher.   In bowling, unlike other sports, there is one movement you need to perfect: the movement that gets you a strike. There are no other players to tackle you; just you, the ball, and stationary pins. The fact that pros rarely get a perfect 300 leads me to believe that there must be significant variables that I am missing. All I can think of is the ball being used (size, weight, etc.), floor friction, and pin size and weight. However, this doesn't seem enough to account for this semi-low average as these variables will only ever differ by a minuscule amount.   Why is this average so low? What factors contribute to this ""semi-low"" average? "
607,Maximum overs for a bowler in a reduced over match,"In the limited overs cricket match, the overs can be divided between bowlers by maximum 10 per bowler in ODI and 5 in T20.  If an one day match gets interrupted by rain and started after some time by reducing the overs to 40 or 36 or any, what is the maximum no. of overs allowed for a bowler to bowl?  The above scenario is for both the innings or only for second innings.  How will it be for T20I? "
608,Why was the Cup Winner's Cup abandoned?,Don't know if many people remember watching European football back then but I always enjoyed the Cup Winner's Cup. I was wondering why UEFA decided to get rid of the competition and effectively merge it with the UEFA cup? Was it played on the same night as the UEFA cup? 
609,Who was the quickest player in the English Premier League in 2014?,There are some rapid players in the premier league but who is the quickest as of now (2014)? And how fast are they? 
610,What made Mercedes faster than all the other F1 teams in 2014?,What did Mercedes do in 2014 to become half a second faster than their closest rivals in each lap? Does it have to do with aerodynamics or the engine? What are the speculations at least? Did they discover something or invented something? 
611,Who decides how are UEFA competitions spots divided within teams in some country?,"As far as I know, UEFA allocates some number of places in the European competitions based on country coefficients.   However, I have seen (if I remember correctly) various rules in various countries:   Usually the spots in Champions League and the first spots in Europa league are given based on the league table. At least in some countries, I have seen that that cup winners have earned UEFA Europa Leagues spot, too. Moreover, some countries have more than one cup. Sometimes the rule is that if a winner of a cup qualifies for some European tournament through the position in the league table, the runner-up is given the spot. (For example, here is a quote from Wikipedia article on 2010-11 FA Cup: ...because Manchester City qualified for the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League via their top-four finish in the 2010–11 Premier League, Stoke qualified for the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League as runners-up.) Sometimes if a cup winner qualifies through their position in the league competition, the spot is not given to the runner-up but to the next team in the league table. (For example, in the Wikipedia article about 2008-09 Premier League I read that: Due to Manchester United winning the League Cup,their place was given to the seventh-placed team in the league. Similarly, the current revision of the article 2013-14 Premier Leagues says that: Since the 2013–14 Football League Cup winners (Manchester City) would at this point qualify for the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League the 6th placed team would qualify for third qualifying round of UEFA Europa League. So the 2013-14 League Cup runner up, Sunderland, did no receive a spot in European competitions.)   So my question is:     Who decides how are the spots allocated to national association divided between first teams in the league table and cup winners? Is this entirely up to the national association, or does UEFA have some rules about this?  "
612,Trouble with bowling,I am a medium fast bowler and was able to bowl with good line and length with some swing but due to gap in playing cricket I am not able to bowl and all of my balls are either going above the head of batsman or they are pitching short.   Not getting the reason for this? what am I missing? please help me to rectify the problem. 
613,How do you decide whether a ball is in or out,"In volleyball, how do you decide if a ball is in or out?   Is it like in tennis, where you would look at the ball from the top perspective at the moment it touches the ground and see if it crosses the line or not? Because that can, in some circumstances, give a different result than if you looked at the ball from the perspective of a player inside the court. From the perspective of the player, the ball would not touch the line, but from the top perspective, it would. "
614,"What does it mean to refer to a player as a ""dagger man""?","What does it mean to say that a player is his team's ""dagger man,"" and in what sports does it apply?  I presume it has something to do with being a player who scores. Does it matter how they score (e.g., from close range) or just that they score a lot? "
615,"Could the home field advantage in baseball be due to the ""principle of last action?""","It has been observed that in baseball, a home team has a statistical 54-46 advantage, all other things being equal. There have been various theories to account for this, including the impact of fan support, and possible ""home team"" bias by umpires.  But there may be a more tangible home team advantage called the ""principle of last action."" This advantage derives from the fact that the home team bats and score last in every inning, and in the game itself.  In poker, there is a large advantage to being last, and seeing what other people have done. For instance, if you are ""last"" with a mediocre hand, and have observed other people betting timidly (or not at all), you might bet to steal the pot. If others have ""raised"" each others' bets, you might ""fold"" and let the stronger hands fight it out. If you were first to go with the same, mediocre hand, you would have to bet (or not) without knowing what others wanted to do.  Beginning in the ninth, and all the extra innings, if the home team ever takes the lead, the visiting team will not have a ""return"" opportunity in a subsequent inning. The home team can win in a one-run ""walk-off,"" while the visiting team will have to score as many runs as they can in the top of the ninth, and hope that they are ""enough.""  Say the game is tied at the end of the eigth inning, and the visiting team scores x runs in the TOP of the ninth. The home team knows that it needs to score exactly X runs to tie, and x+1 runs to win. It can manage it ""bench"" in the bottom of the ninth for maximum effect. On the other hand, if the visiting team has a one run lead in the top of the ninth, it must wonder, is that enough? Can we save the bench for tomorrow, or do we need to ""pile on,"" now? Likewise, the visiting team has to make a decision in the bottom of the ninth whether to use as many pitchers as it takes to stop the tying run, or save relievers for an extra inning game.  Other sports such as football and basketball don't have such a clear separation of offensive and defensive ""rounds."" (In those sports, unlike baseball, it is possible for a defender to ""run back"" the ball for a touchdown or basket.) Could this separation of offense and defense be what lends a home field advantage in baseball? "
616,Independent training management with feedback to improve tennis shots?,"It would be very useful after training tennis shots to immediately see the results. Also I would like to see how my shots are developing over time.   Helper questions   What kind of services are available to provide feedback about tennis shots?  What kind of tools are coaches using?  Is there some tool that could be used alone?  Does there exist any training management program that stores and helps manage the recordings?

618,What is tie-breaking procedure in NHL (regular season)?,"What is tie-breaking procedure in NHL (regular season)?  How are standings for the teams in the NHL table decided. What is used as a secondary criterion, if the teams have the same number of points?    For example, with one match remaining for Detroit and Washington the positions of wild card teams in Eastern Conference are     |            | GP | pts | diff  1 | Columbus   | 82 | 93  | +15  2 | Detroit    | 81 | 91  | -11  3 | Washington | 81 | 89  | -4   (GP = number of games played, pts = number of points, diff = goal difference)  I have seen in many sources that at this point the teams qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs are already decided and that Washington Capitals cannot qualify. But it is still possible that both Washington Capitals and Detroit Red Wings both finish at 91 points. (Capitals would have to win their last game, and Detroit would have to loose in regulation time.) Moreover, Washington would have better goal difference. So I wonder why they cannot qualify. "
619,How do I get over caution of going fast (with minimal access to slopes)?,"I've only gone snowboarding once (a 2-week exclusively-snowboarding holiday), about 3 years ago.  It was a lot of fun, even though I didn't manage to come right too well.  The problem was that, even though I managed to get turning and such right, I really struggled to get much further than knowing the basics, as I'm too cautious about picking up speed (even carving was a problem, although the slopes were pretty steep, at least for me - it felt like about a 30-40° incline on most of the slopes where I was - this was on the ""easy"" slope - the ""medium"" slope seemed pretty similar).  I did fall a lot at first (as I guess most, if not all, new snowboarders do), so I can't imagine fear of falling, as such, is the problem.  I did take a few lessons during the first week. I got fairly comfortable with basically just going down the slope (at least better than with my board fully horizontally the whole way) and making the occasional turn, but the next part of the lessons was carving, which, as mentioned above, was a problem, so I felt a bit stuck for the remaining week and a half.  How do I get over this caution of going fast?  I've considered:   Choosing to ignore that little voice telling me to not go fast.  This probably wouldn't be too difficult, but I fear that, not being particularly experienced, I may not be able to react properly to certain situations (which may include trying to slow down / stop), and risk serious injury. Picking up skateboarding so I can get more comfortable on a board.  Given that part of my problem is minimal access to slopes (because of distance and price), I thought it might be a good idea to get started with skateboarding, which I can do locally. A board's a board - right? Or not? Just practice at the speed I'm comfortable with.  The problem here is the minimal access to slopes. And during my snowboarding experience, I seemed to just be stuck skill-wise during the last week of my trip because of this speed problem (not being able to go straight is a bit of a problem), so I'm not sure whether this will actually help.  I've also considered taking a really long snowboarding holiday (a month?) as to practice consecutively for a long period and hopefully get over my problem (although, if I don't, it might be a very depressing month). Going to somewhere with slopes with less incline.  This should get me more comfortable on the board (allowing me to practice slowing down / stopping more safely), and hopefully this also makes me more comfortable at higher speeds.  Makes sense, but I wouldn't even know how to find such a place, beyond just going to different places until I find one.   Any advice on my problem or any of my considerations or any other suggestions?  Or am I too concerned about this, as it's just something that comes with time, and if it doesn't, snowboarding just isn't for me? "
620,"The ""four hits"" fault","Let me describe a specific situation:  Team A serves the ball. Team B executes three hits to return it - they pass the ball, set it and then attack. After the attack, the ball touches both the top band of the net and the hands of the blocker (at the same time) and remains on the same part of the court.  My question is: In such a situation, is team B now entitled to another three hits?  To me it seems they should be, for an oponent player was in contact with the ball.  Some other people around believe the oposite, specifically because of the contact of the ball with the top band of the net after the attack.  I have searched the current FIVB rules but did not find anything that would approve that claim. Is there such a rule in place? "
621,How to choose overgrip to a tennis racket?,"My tennis couch said that I should test as many overgrips as possible to find a grip which does not get slippery so fast and maintain the condition for a longer period. I tested Gamma overgrip that got slippery very fast and I had to change it after four training periods. Before that I had Wilson but in different racket so I am unsure about their differences. I am not sure whether finding the overgrip is the key here, it may be that a poor undergrip makes the grip go worse faster. I use overgrip because of the larger handle and it helps to keep the racket not sliding easily out of my hand.     How should I choose my overgrip? And which kind of criterias should I consider?    "
622,What anthem does the West Indies cricket team use?,"Every country has a national anthem of its own, and usually, it is played before the start of any world event, no matter what the sport is.

623,What action was Logan Couture referring to when describing Sidney Crosby as cheating on faceoffs?,"I am a huge hockey fan but I am not 100% clear on the rules..  This has to do with the 2016 Stanley Cup Playoffs.  So after last night's overtime victory, goal scored by Conor Sheary.. Crosby was called a cheater by the Sharks player LOGAN COUTURE.     In Game 2, Crosby did not score but he did win 17 of 24 faceoffs, including the game's biggest that earned him a secondary assist on the winner. He is 26-for-40 in the faceoff circle through the first two games of the series.      It's an edge that irks some San Jose Sharks.      ""He cheats,"" Couture said. ""He gets away with it. He's Sidney Crosby.""      How so?      ""He times them and they don't kick him out for some reason, probably because of who he is,"" Couture complained.   This can be found here.  Again, I am not clear with the rules, but when it comes to face-offs, what is the other way to win face-offs besides trying to time when the referee drops the puck onto the ice? Or my comprehension of how Couture used the word timing is wrong.   Any explanation is appreciated. "
624,Three two-run homers in the span of six batters,"On June 2 2016 the SF Giants did this against the Atlanta Braves.

In case you are accompanied with the tickets owner (call him nameA), can a person holding a ticket for nameA enter?  I just hope you don't have to resell through the portal and rebuy it again.  I went through the FAQ of EURO 2016, it isn't clear. [website]Hope others in the same situation will find this useful. "

627,"Under which scenarios are using the term ""double-elimination game"" appropriate?","We're having a friendly debate, and can't come to a conclusion on whether or not the final game of a series (game 7 world series, game 7 NBA championship...etc) is ever referred to as a ""double-elimination game"".  Group A says      A ""double-elimination"" is not a ""game"", but a point in a series where   you'd have to lose twice to be eliminated.  Or a term for a tournament   where you must lose twice to be eliminated...etc.  Basically that   there's no such thing as a double elimination ""GAME"".   Group B says      A ""double-elimination game"" can also refer to the fact that either   team can be eliminated (2 teams = ""double"") and is sometimes used to   refer to the last game in a series, as mentioned above.     On one hand, Group A asked a sports writer Alyson Footer about it:    Which certainly points to Group A being correct.    But Group B found this article:     The Yankees in Double-Elimination: A Brief History, which points to Group B being correct.     Under which scenarios are using the term ""double-elimination game"" appropriate, especially as it pertains to the final game of a playoff series? Can anyone clarify or give a definitive answer or explain when it's used different ways, or any clarification? "
628,Inline wheels wobble,"I have been playing inline hockey for 15+ years but only recently made a switch from goalie to skater. I had not skated on a team since I was about 12 years old. I only play recreationally, so not wanting to spend much money, I found a pair of used skates that seem to be in good condition. However, when taking a sharp turn at high speeds they start to wobble. It is hard to pinpoint where the wobble originates, as sometimes it feels more towards the front and other times towards the middle wheels. I believe it had occurred on both sides. They could stand to be rotated but aren't terribly imbalanced. Is this an issue of quality with a particular part of the wheels? The chassis? How I am turning? This takes away an advantage of my natural speed, and I would very much like to get to the bottom of this. "
629,What are the rules in baseball about how close a fielder can stand to the home plate?,In baseball can a player stand three feet from the plate in SWAT-like gear? Your team could have a line of players standing there and then a few fielders for the balls that get through and a first-basemen. What would be the ruling on a play like this? 
630,What is the minimum weight to box at a specific weight class?,"I don't box or participate in the combative sports so I might be asking a stupid question but please humor me.  What is the minimum weight required to box/fight at a specific weight class.  I can see all the boxing weight classes on wikipedia here so I know what the UPPER limit is for each class.  For example, if someone boxes at a high level at lightweight (135lbs) and wants to fight someone at heavyweight (200+ lbs) to win the heavyweight championship belt (something worth risking the size mismatch), will any sanctioning body allow this fight to occur even though there's a huge size mismatch between the two fighters?  I always hear fighters after a fight saying they are confident in their skill, they knew they could do XYZ, etc. thus, I could see someone thinking:  ""Due to my lighter/smaller frame, I feel I can out-quick someone who fights at heavyweight.  My quickness can help me duck/parry/slip his punches and run around him if he tries to corner me.  Since I'm lighter, I should be able to box longer without getting tired, etc.""  Assuming the lightweight is that skilled, would any boxing sanctioning body allow this fight to take place? "
631,Playing for a foreign team professionally?,"Say someone tries out for a team not in their country of nationality and the team will accept them.  Given that this is professional, what would the player/team have to do?  Visitors to foreign countries aren't allowed to work without a specific visa, but this can be complicated.  How does this generally work out, in professional leagues at any level, when players may be drafted or signed, or even try out for international teams and make the cut?  For example, a USA-born player drafted to the Toronto Maple Leafs; a Canadian-born player drafted to the English Premier League; or just someone who tried out for a team in another country with good chances of acceptance? "
632,Why are the same national football teams always the strongest?,"I notice that, in football, a small group of national teams (Spain, Argentina, Brazil, Italy, England, France and Germany) have won virtually every international prize and championship with very few exceptions. I also noticed that this was as true in the 1930s as it is now in the 2010s (and all the years in between). Why is that? Players, coaches and many of the other people involved change every few years, but those teams always win more often.What explains this phenomenon?  "
633,Why did teams score so much during the first editions of the FIFA World Cup?,"I just read that the 1962 FIFA World Cup was the first edition of the tournament where the average number of goals per match dropped below 3 (at that point, 32 years had already passed since the first staging of the Cup). And just to cite an example, an average of 4.67 goals per match were scored at the 1938 FIFA World Cup, which grew even more to the crazy number of 5.38 goals per match in 1954.  Indeed, the group stage of the 1954 FIFA World Cup kind of looks unreal (Hungary 9-0 South Korea; Hungary 8-3 West Germany; West Germany 7-2 Turkey; Uruguay 7-0 Scotland; Austria 7-5 Switzerland).  Is there a reason why national teams used to score so much in the past? Has something changed in the way people play football? "
634,Shortest time between separated yellow card cautions for one player?,"In the June 10th Copa America match between USA and Paraguay, USA defender DeAndre Yedlin was cautioned with a yellow card, and then 57 seconds later was cautioned a second time and sent off for accumulation of two yellows.  Is this the shortest time between two cautions for one player?  Limit answers to senior international and professional teams.  This is different that the question found here: Can a player receive two yellow cards if advantage is played?.  Both cards could be awarded at the same stoppage of play, but I am looking for a case of ""A player knows he has been cautioned, but immediately proceeds to commit another offense"" instead of ""player commits two offenses when he technically doesn't know he was going to be cautioned for the first offense"". "
635,"Which side will corner be executed, if ball gets outside above the middle of the goal?","Imagine, the defending team kicks the ball outside exactly above the middle of their own goal.

636,Why does the UK have 4 national football (soccer) teams?,"Currently there is the UEFA European Championship in football (soccer) taking place and the UK has 3 teams participating: England, Wales and North Ireland. It could have been 4 if Scotland qualified. It is the same for FIFA World Cups, the UK always sends four teams to the qualifications.  The UK seems to be the only country in the world which has 4 football teams even though it is considered as one country almost everywhere.  Why does the UK / why is the UK allowed to send more than one team to international football tournaments? Is it actually the same for other sports?  I already asked almost the same question on politics.stackexchange, and the answers see the reasons in history. However, there are many countries who have a similar history like the UK of smaller uniting states. "
637,When can you get up again after falling on the ground?,"I had always thought that when the ball carrier was on the ground, they were down and the play was over. Recently I have seen a fair number of plays such as interceptions or fumble recoveries where the player intercepted (or recovered) the ball and fell on the ground, and then immediately got up and ran for as many yards as possible.  How does this work? Is there a time limit for getting up to resume play? "
638,"Does Duckworth-Lewis Method consider ""free-hit"" situations?","Say Team-A has a certain score and Team-B is batting with 4 balls remaining. Bowler gives a no-ball. It starts raining heavily and play is stopped immediately with 4 balls (including the free-hit) remaining. Now match result has to be decided based on Duckworth-Lewis Method.  Let us take some hypothetical state where: Case (1) : If Team-B has 4 normal balls, it looses. Case (2) : If Team-B has 5 balls, it wins. I know that these two cases have happened.  Does Duckworth-Lewis consider a case like the following ? Case (3) : If Team-B has 3 balls and 1 free-hit, it wins.  Stating it another way : Is there a numerical value attached to free-hit, which can change the outcome of the final result ?  Intuitively, Case (3) is better than Case (1), so Duckworth-Lewis should consider it. "

642,"In Rugby, why can't the tackling team pick up the ball after the ball carrier lets go?","That's basically my question. When a ball carrier is tackled, he usually lets go of the ball (behind him more often than not). Why can't the opposing team pick up the ball? And who is legally allowed to pick up the ball at that moment? Is there a name for this position?  Edit: Why is the blue team not going for the ball in this scenario:   "
643,How many teams go through from each group in Euro 2016?,"I just noticed that there are 6 groups in the current European Championships, which means that - if the top two from each group were to go through - there would only be 12 teams into the last 16, which is 4 short.  However, if the top 3 from each group go through, we get 18 teams going to the round of 16, which is 2 too many.  There would have to be just 4 groups where 3 teams go through and 2 groups where the top 2 go through to make 16 teams in the round of 16.  How is it working?  Are there 4 groups where 3 teams go through? If so, how do they decide which groups? "

Can this please be confirmed? A reference would be great.  If true, does this mean that one cannot score a push-over try from a scrum, since these must start a minimum 5 meters from a try line?

649,A strange kick from the penalty mark scored: should a goal be given?,"During October 2017, a football game in Thailand went to twenty (20) rounds of sudden death in kicks from the penalty mark.  The twentieth kick for the team going first hit the crossbar and deflected high into the air. As the goalkeeper celebrated the miss, the ball landed and bounced. The spin it picked up from the deflection caused movement towards the goal.  It crossed the line before the goalkeeper could realise and reach it. The officials awarded a goal (shown by signal in video). The opposing team missed their next shot and lost the match because of the strange penalty being scored. The BBC have a video of this incident here.  Was the referee correct in law and in best practice to award such a goal? Does the losing team have any right to appeal the result due to the ""error in law""? "

If this is the case, is the attacker penalised for being in an offside position? "
654,Does the 2-2-1-1-1 format get used in 7-game series anymore?,"I can't remember the last time I saw a playoff series in the NBA, NHL or MLB use the 2-2-1-1-1 format (as opposed to the 2-3-2).  I understand the motivation. Usually the travel distances are so great, even with LA currently playing the Houston Astros. But what if the Mets played the Yankees? Would they use 2-2-1-1-1? I miss it. It also feels like that is a more fair approach. "
655,FIBA 2017 new traveling rule: Pass No Dribble Lay Up Legal Action,"Under FIBA 2017 new rules, the action in this video is described as a legal action.  The FIBA rules, art. 25.2.1, says     If receiving the ball the player shall release the ball to start his   dribble before his second step   In the video the player does not release the ball before the second step.   But, as I interpret the rule, a player that receives the ball shall (=must, right?) release the ball to start his dribble before his second step. So after receiving the ball he cannot shoot, he must release it before he takes the second step.   What am I missing? If in that situation the player does not shoot, so he is at his second step with the ball in his hands, what else he can do if he can't dribble because it's too late to release the ball?   "

657,Starting a social pool club at work,"I work for a large company with a good social focus. I'm thinking of starting a weekly pool club for the interested. I've found a decent venue where we can go to have an informal get together, but wondering how it should be organized.  At least to start with, I have no idea how many people will turn up, or their levels of ability. I want it to be as inclusive as possible, so the social aspect is more important than the competition.  Does anyone have any experience or tips for running or attending such a club? Should we all just get down there and play it by ear, or is there some format I should consider? "
658,"Is it a fault: penetrate under the net when the feet are completely in opponent's space, but not on the court?","It is easier to watch this video (vk.com, Russian social network) than explain  Libero of Sada Cruzeiro flew to the opponent's side but didn't touch the court with his feet. At the same time, his feet were in the opponent's space completely.  Rules allow this, in these sections:   11.2.1 - allow penetrating 11.2.2.1 - allow touching with a foot 11.2.2.2 - allow touching with any part of the body (excepting feet)   But also Rules has this fault-section, verbatim (but with my emphasis):     11.4.3 A player’s foot (feet) penetrates completely into the opponent's court.     So, the question is: Am I right, that in the considered case libero didn't penetrate into the opponent's court? There could be other errors, but the main point of the question is libero's feet: they are in the opponent's space (assume, they don't touch the court). Is this a violation?  Update: Casebook // 2017-11-07  I've found this document: Referee Casebook 2017 (it is not listed on the site, but Google is our friend here). And do you know what? The action, described in this question is considered faulty there (see case 3.14); inexplicable but it's the fact  Update: New rules // 2019-01-06  I heard that the rules changed a little bit, and now such behavior is not considered as a fault anymore. Though, I can't find any proofs...     "
659,"Would it make sense for some teams to ""extend"" the terms of qualifying offers?","A ""qualifying offer"" is the market's way of determining which free agents should carry draft pick compensation. The amount for this year is $17.4 million, I believe. If a team extends this to a free agent, and he declines, the team gets draft pick compensation.  My understanding is that the team gets an earlier compensating draft pick if the player signs for more than, rather than less than, [tex]17.4 million, perhaps that team might be willing to make an offer of that amount for three years, which would take the contract over [tex]50 million threshold? The kind of person I was thinking of was Alex Cobb, of the Tampa Bay Rays, a small market (and budget) team? "
660,Tennis ATP World Tour Finals Scheduling,"My question is to ask how the scheduling for the WTFs is done. I understand the grouping. There is Group A and Group B with the following properties: seed 1 is assigned A or B uniformly at random (50-50 probability), and seed 2 goes in the other; repeat this for pairs (3,4), (5,6) and (7,8). However, how are the matches scheduled?  Specifically, is the case that, in each of the groups, the first match the top player plays is against the bottom, and the two middle play each other. Looking through the history, I see that since 2009 this has been the case since 2009 (at least), with the exception of 2013 (when seed 5 played 7 to open up).  It's possible that there was some reason for it not happening this one year, or maybe it's just that 8 out of 9 years this has happened! (Note that it happened in both groups for all years except for 2013, and neither group in 2013.)  Does anyone have any evidence to suggest what the answer to this is? I'm not interested in unfounded hypotheses, but actual evidence, such as ""too unlikely"" on a small sample. (For example, at one point Djokovic was drawn in the same half as Federer in 17 out of 21 grand slams -- but these are done randomly, this was just an exceptional event.) "

662,Procedure for World Cup draw 2018. How is the principle of geographical separation respected?,"The procedure for drawing teams into groups for the 2018 World Cup has changed compared with 2014. (Source)  The principles are:     All teams will be allocated to pots 1 to 4 [...] The October 2017 edition of the FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking will be used to allocate all qualified teams to the four pots       no teams from the same confederation, with the exception of UEFA, which could have up to two teams in the same group, will be drawn into the same group.   How will the second constraint be enforced?  The 2014 draw allows for      Groups will be skipped to respect principle of geographic separation   If, hypothetically, Groups A-H have received their top seed and Groups A-G have also received their second seed as follows  A Russia      Mexico B Brazil      England C Belgium     Spain D Germany     Denmark E Poland      Switzerland F Portugal    Croatia G France      Uruguay H Argentina      There is only one team left in pot 2 and that is Columbia. However they can't be placed in Group H as this violates the ""no teams from the same confederation in the same group"" rule.  Is the draw restarted, or is the draw ""fudged"" for example by moving Croatia to Group H and putting Columbia in group F. Or is Columbia place in Group A, and the first placable team from the next pot put into group H, and if this last rule, what if the very last team can't be placed while respecting the rules.  Are the detailed rules for the draw published anywhere? "
663,How does Formula E measure remaining battery energy?,"My understanding is that the remaining energy from a battery can be approximated using several different methods e.g. measuring the battery voltage. However, I am yet to find a method that is completely accurate.   While some inaccuracy shouldn't generally be an issue when checking your phone's battery percentage, surely a sport like Formula E would need to use the most accurate method to ensure fairness?  For example, in the 2014 Beijing ePrix, 3 drivers were given 57 second penalties for exceeding the maximum energy usage limit of 28kWh. Given a transgression like this can result in such a significant penalty, you would expect that the method for measuring this usage must be highly accurate.  Therefore, I wondered what method they use in Formula E to measure the remaining battery energy? "
664,what determines a stolen base against the catcher?,"what determines if a successful stolen base is against the catcher or pitcher?  for instance, a ball thrown in the dirt after the runner breaks for the next base.  This surely can not be held against the catcher?  Or, the pitcher has a high leg kick giving the advantage to the runner and the catcher has no chance to throw out the runner? "
665,Why would an offense not put anyone on the free throw lane?,"In the 2019 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship game, with 22.5 seconds left in the second half, Texas Tech had Norense Odiase, a 62% free throw shooter, at the line for what CBS announcer Jim Nantz said was a 1-and-1.  For both the first and second free throws, Texas Tech had nobody on either side of the free throw lane.  Here is a photo showing the second free throw attempt:    What is the strategy in the offensive team not putting any players on the free throw lane?  Given that 62% is a bad free throw percentage, why not put players on the lane to try to get a potential offensive rebound? "

667,Can the body be trained to perform best at unusual times of day?,"It's known that athletes perform best at certain times of day - most studies suggest that late afternoon / early evening seems to be the best time for peak performance. See this link for an article about this.  Can a body be trained to overcome its natural circadian rhythm and perform best at (say) 3 o'clock in the morning?  Let's say you have an endurance sporting event that has to take place in the early hours - maybe it requires public roads to be closed, or maybe it's dependent on the time of day for some other reason.   I'd guess that training at 3am would help for an event that will be taking place at 3am, but is there any science to back up my guess? Has anyone published any studies on this? "

673,How does the VAR decide which camera to use?,"On April 17, 2019, in the UEFA Champions League quarterfinal second leg between Manchester City and Tottenham there were some requests to VAR.  In particular, one was made regarding Llorente's goal in 73', Tottenham's third goal and making the score 4-3, which would (and did) qualify his team to the semifinals.  Cameras show Llorente touching the ball with his arm, but it was attached to his body. Depending on the camera angle, it may look intentional.  In the The Guardian article, Pep Guardiola hits out at VAR after Llorente’s disputed goal for Spurs,     ""I support VAR but maybe from one angle Fernando Llorente’s goal is handball, maybe from the referee’s angle it is not,” Guardiola said.   Is there a rule on what angle should be used to take the decision? Do teams have the right to ask for a new check with other cameras? "
674,What is the record for the most wins by a single team against a single team in an NBA season?,"The Milwaukee Bucks just swept the Detroit Pistons in their first round series  4 games to none after sweeping the regular season series between these two teams 4 games to none.  After completing the playoff series sweep they ended up with an 8-0 record against Detroit this season.    Has a team ever gone 8-0 or better (combined regular season and playoffs) against a single team in a single season?  If so, has any team ever won more than 8 games against a single team?  Notes:    Currently it is not possible for a team to win more than 8 games against  a single team (max of 4 regular season meetings + 4 playoff wins clinches the series), I'm not sure how far back that holds true from a schedule perspective. With the current schedule format, teams only play divisional opponents 4 times in the regular season.  So 8-0 (at least in recent years) would need to be a case of two division rivals meeting in the playoffs.  "
675,How did the NBA decide on 23.75 feet for the 3-point distance?,"In 1979, the NBA voted to have a 1-year trial of the 3-point line, which later became permanent. Although the ABA used a 25 foot 3-point line, the NBA used a 23.75 foot line. How was the 23.75 number settled on? Was it random? "

However it seems like in modern NBA this is not enforced very often.  Most recently I was watching the first game of Raptors vs Sixers series, and came up getting stuck with this move by K.Leonard. Is the NBA relaxing on the carry/travel calls, for the sake of a more exciting game? "

The two choices are to the outfield where you do a pseudo-infield/outfield, or to your normal game position on the field. The answer should solely be based on how the question was phrased.  I got into this debate with my friend because he stated that he would go to his game position, but I thought that the coach meant he wanted us to take infield outfield in the outfield because that is where we normally go. How would you respond? "

680,What happens after the penalty if a player is snookered behind a free ball?,"What happens after the penalty is applied when a player is snookered behind a free ball? This question pertains to the rule when a free ball has been nominated, but the player not only fails to sink the free ball, but also snookers the other player with it. In that case the rule says:     Not potting the free ball incurs no penalty, so the striker may play a   snooker using the free ball, gratis. However, if said snooker is   achieved by having the free ball obstructing the ball on, then the   strike is a foul and a penalty of the value of the ball on is awarded   to the opponent.   Okay, but that still leaves the player snookered. For example, let's imagine Player A has a free ball and nominates the green ball. He snookers the cue ball behind the green. So, in that case Player A will have fouled and Player B receives 4 points. What happens then? Player B will still be snookered behind the green. Does B have to try to escape the snooker, even though he was awarded points for the foul? "

682,Youth soccer - Is it unsportsmanlike for the winning team to pull their goalie because he is bored?,"I coach 13 &amp; 14 year-olds in a community soccer league. Many of the more skilled players also play for clubs, but they enjoy the community soccer league because they can play with the friends they've grown up playing with.   As a coach, sportsmanship &amp; respect for self, teammate, coach, ref, opponent and parents is paramount.   This evening we lost 2-0 to a team that was very dominant and in our end most of the time. We had hardly any shots on net but were able to keep them to two goals. It was a clean game. In the final few minutes of the game, the goalie of the winning team ran up the field to play in front of our net, trying to score. He stayed up there for the remainder of the match.   After the match and shaking hands, I approached the coach of the other team and commended his skilled players and their clean play. I also said that I thought that the goalie joining the forward line at the end of the match was disrespectful and unsportsmanlike to a team that they were beating and thoroughly dominating.    The other coach was very surprised and said that they always do this because the goalie gets bored. Whereby I showed him my surprise and reiterated that nevertheless it was disrespectful and unsportsmanlike.   I can understand moving the goalie up forward if you are losing and need to score. But moving the goalie forward when you are dominating because the goalie is bored is uncalled for and is counter to sportsmanship.   Am I wrong? What do you think? "
683,Does the person breaking get the choice of solids or stripes if he makes any ball in?,"When playing 8-ball, if the breaking player hits any ball on the break, does the shooting player have a verbal choice of stripes or solids? Or does he still have to call a shot in before he can?  If the rule is that he has to call his shot to get either stripes or solids, then what happens if on the break he hits a solid in, but calls a shot for stripes and misses it? "
684,Is my tennis racket damaged?,"I bought a second-hand tennis racket last weekend and I wanted to change the main grip. I wanted to remove the adhesive remains but it was way harder than usual. Then I realized there was a plastic wrap over the grip, which was rotating around the grip when I force it.  I thought that if I don't remove it, the main-grip might get loose when playing so I cut through the plastic and removed it. Cleaned the remaining adhesive and found another duct tape wrapped around the grip. Here are some pictures    Is it possible that the racket is damaged and repaired? If yes, does it affect anything when playing with? "
685,Is there anything preventing all the players on soccer team from standing in the goal box for defense?,"Say you have a team wanting to only play defense. Could all 11 players (1 goalkeeper plus 10 other players) literally stand in the goal box, essentially forming a wall, to prevent the other team from scoring? Could they play an entire match this way?  I understand the rule that only one player can act as goalkeeper (only they could handle the ball), but the other players would behave as normal. They could only interact with the ball by kicks, headers or other legal means. "
686,Waivers and loans in NHL,"I have three related questions that concern NHL trading jargon.  Waiver  Wikipedia reports ""Once an NHL player has played in a certain number of games or a set number of seasons has passed since the signing of his first NHL contract, that player must be offered to all of the other NHL teams before he can be assigned to a minor league affiliate."" So, the question is: a player transferred through a waiver is not on loan, but has been sold to a different team before the end of the contract, is this statement correct?  Loan 1  If my understanding of waiver is right, I wonder whether there exist a separate trading institute that allow a player to temporarily change team, such as on loan (i.e. player P goes from team A to team B for a short period, even shorter than a full season, and then goes back to team A). Is there something like that in NHL?  Loan 2  Related to the question about loan, could a player be temporarily transferred to another team only for the playoffs? "

689,Is carrying a player into touch a legal tackle?,"I recently saw this snippet of a two defenders carrying an opponent into touch as he was holding onto the ball.    So I looked into tackle laws:     REQUIREMENTS FOR A TACKLE ([website]        For a tackle to occur, the ball-carrier is held and brought to   ground by one or more opponents.    Being brought to ground means that the ball-carrier is lying, sitting or has at least one knee on the ground or on another player   who is on the ground.   Being held means that a tackler must continue holding the ball-carrier until the ball-carrier is on the ground.      This means it should be a maul (if called by the referee).     FORMING A MAUL ([website]        A maul can take place only in the field of play.   It consists of a ball-carrier and at least one player from each team, bound together and on their feet.   Once formed, a maul must move towards a goal line.      But since the maul is moving sideways, this would be illegal, to my understanding (but I am unsure).  My question, was this defense legal? "

Which other factors play in? "
692,Fueling strategy while running a marathon in warm weather,"I'm going to be running in the London Marathon in two weeks. Initially my target time was to run sub 4 hours. Its my first marathon and my training had been going quite well until the last two weeks.  I've been doing a long run every Sunday. The longest I've done is 29 KM (18 miles) and my time was 2 hrs and 34 mins with an average pace of 5:19 per km (8:34 per mile). I also did a half marathon two weeks ago and my time was 1 hr and 45 mins.  Both my half marathon and 29k times indicate that I should be able run a sub 4 hour marathon (if not quicker according to some calculators).  My biggest run was meant to be last Sunday, 35k (22 miles). As I set off, I did feel like it was a litte bit tougher than normal but just thought it would be a rough patch so tried not to pay too much attention to it. At the 21k mark, I started struggling. It was like nothing I've ever experienced before on a long run, I couldn't run anywhere near my target pace, my effort levels felt quite high yet my km splits were >6 mins/km. At 25.6 km I gave up and ended my run. I realised afterwards, that I must've hit the notorious 'wall'. I didn't have a very good pre run breakfast. I had three High5 ISO Gels throughout the run (aim was to have one every 10k).  After the disastrous run last Sunday, I decided to attempt a 35k again today. This time I had a substantial breakfast around three hours before my run; 4 weetabixes and half a banana around an hour before I set out. Also sipped on water in the hours leading upto it. I knew I was well hydrated based on pee colour.  I set off with the aim of going at an easier pace than my previous long runs. Kept the effort level relatively low and I felt quite good after an opening rough 5k. Had gels every 10km and overall I felt a lot better at the 21K stage than last week.  However I started experiencing the same problems as last week at the 25k mark. I could feel the pace slipping away and it became physically and mentally very tough just to keep running regardless of the pace. I gave up at the 27k mark :(  The weather has picked up in London in the past week or so. These are the first long runs I'm doing in the sun and slightly warmer weather, they seem to have a massive impact on my performance. My half marathon PB and 29k were ran on cold, cloudy days.  After every long run, I evaluate my target marathon time based on how the long run felt and the pace I did it at. My initial target time was sub 4:30, this was based on before I did any training. Over the weeks its been mostly at sub 4, but after my half marathon I was entertaining sub 3:45. My last two runs have put to bed any of those target times and I think I'm back to my initial target time of sub 4:30.  Based on my situation, my questions are:   How can I deal with the effects of hot weather and minimise any impact on my performance during the marathon? What fueling strategies would folks recommend? I'm toying with the idea of using Zipvit gels too as they have 51 grams of carbs per sachet.  "
693,When can part of a match be replayed?,"In the recent U19 Women's match between England and Norway, the referee made a mistake in not allowing a penalty in added-time to be retaken after a player encroached. This is a clear misapplication of the laws.  Instead of replaying the entire match with a new referee, or accepting the result, the solution was to replay the final 18 seconds of the match at a later date with the original players and a new referee.  How was this decided, and when else could it happen? Was it special that it was a misunderstanding of the rules rather than a simple refereeing mistake, like not seeing the ball crossed the line?  Would it be possible to replay a more significant part of the match (e.g the last 20 minutes)?  "

Has this happened before? If so, in which seasons has all teams in a division made the playoffs? I recognize there was a realignment that took place for the 2004-2005 NBA season, but during the 2003-2004 NBA season, almost all teams in the Midwest division (6 of 7 teams) of the Western Conference made the playoffs. "
696,Is Carter Capps's pitching style legal?,"Here is a video of Miami reliever Carter Capps pitching. As you can see, he basically jumps off the rubber, and delivers from the front of the mound.  Apparently, MLB gave their approval to Capps's pitching style -- but with a caveat:     ""They just said they wanted me to make sure I dragged my foot and not get too elevated in the air, and make sure it's more on a lateral plane,"" Capps said. ""As long as I do that, they have no problem with it. But it was very strange.""   However, as a Bleacher Report article notes:     Not to be a foot in Capps’ punch bowl, but his pitching on Monday didn’t exactly feature extensive toe-dragging. There didn't appear to be any toe-dragging, actually. And by launching down the mound, he does chop off a not-immeasurable distance between him and the plate. In a game where batters have fractions of a second to react to the ball, this difference can be significant.   Was Capps's pitching in the MIA@ATL game legal? If not, why didn't the umpires disqualify him? "
697,Racket of Hu Yun,Hu Yun  Lately Hu Yun has gotten my attention with his performance in the below mentioned tournaments. He plays with a white Yonex racket.

698,"Can a (baseball) ace's record be improved by his ""pitching out of sequence.""","Most teams will use their best starter for Opening Day, the second best on the second day, etc. through the rotation.  Except when other factors intervene; for instance, the White Sox ace Chris Sale pitched the Sox' fourth game, because injuries meant that he wasn't ready for Opening Day. And the Pirates' Francisco Liriano, who pitched Opening Day, took paternity leave and pitched the fourth game of the following series.  My understanding is that while aces are better than ""backenders""on the same team, they don't necessarily have better records, because they pitch against other aces, while backenders pitch against other backenders. Does this hold through a season, or do ""rotational"" factors allow aces to sometimes pitch against backenders? And do aces' win-loss records in fact, improve, when they are pitted against backenders? "
699,How long can a goalkeeper wait for opponent to come get the ball?,"On soccer it is common to see winning teams wasting time. Goalies have their own techniques to run out the clock.  A situation that intrigues me is when a goalkeeper is allowed to get the ball but chooses not to. He places both hands near the ball without touching it. He waits for an opponent to get close enough and then he proceeds to pick up the ball. Thus wasting 5 seconds of everyone's life ;-)  So, every time that a situation like this happens, an opponent runs towards the ball to force the goalkeeper to pick it up. If instead of running towards the ball all the opponents let the keeper run out the clock, how long can a goalie wait before picking up the ball?  EDIT  I will accept the answer indefinitely, because according to the rules that is the answer to my question.  But I was also interested on the practical effect of such ruling. Are there any real examples of players ever letting the goalie waste as much time as he wanted to? I cannot believe that everyone would just look at each other for 5 min... "
700,Is tackling with both legs illegal?,"According to the Wikipedia article on tackling, tackling with both legs is illegal.  However, this tackle by Sol Campbell is clearly made with both legs, and it didn't appear to be called nor appealed for by any of the players, nor discussed by any of the commentators.  Is tackling with both legs in itself illegal, or does the tackle need to be careless, reckless, or excessively forceful before it is deemed to be a foul? "
701,Why do teams reveal injuries?,"This is specific to league play in Europe (England, France, Germany, Spain). Why do coaches reveal to the media in a pre-match conference which of their players are injured and unlikely to play?  I've known some coaches to do a fake-out (say a player is injured but then play him). But why say anything at all? Are there any rules requiring teams to disclose injury information days before the match? "
702,Can a baseball/softball player change gloves mid-inning?,"I play catcher for a very informal ""beer-league"" softball team, and have realized that I prefer different gloves at different points in the inning.  With no one on base, I want a big outfielder type glove for catching foul-tips and short pop-flys.   A catcher's glove isn't as reliable for a novice player like me.  Once a runner is in scoring position, I want more of a traditional catchers glove, because it has a lot of catching-and-trapping power, so I can reliably catch balls thrown full force from the outfield to home-plate ahead of the runner.  I haven't asked the umpires yet, but would it be legal to keep a second glove near the backstop, and switch gloves once a runner gets to 3rd?  What about in more professional leagues? Could players change gloves mid-inning? (provided it does not delay the game) Are there good reasons to do so? "
703,Ranking points for a player who received bye,"There are many tournaments where seeded players (or at least some of them) receive a bye into the second round. This means that the first match this player plays is in the second round - against a player who got there after winning their first round match. For example, in the ATP tournament which is currently played in Barcelona, all seeded players received a bye into the second round.  If the player with the bye loses their first match, do they still get ranking points for the second round? In the other words, does the player with a bye who loses their second round match get the same number of points as the player who did not have a bye, won in the first round and loses in the second round? "
704,How to hit a high draw?,"My natural shot is a fade. I don't have a problem hitting (or feeling) a high, normal, or low fade.  However, I have no feel, but I can hit a draw. With a 5-iron, I can hit a low draw and chase it about 120-150 yards. My typical 5-iron goes about 200 yards.  How do I hit a high draw? I think it's a cool shot, and I want to be more comfortable when I attempt to hit a draw in general. "
705,What is the purpose of the eligible reciever rules?,"I do not know a lot about American Football, but I enjoy watching games from time to time. The other day I saw a penalty given for a player catching a pass but being an ineligible receiver. I had not heard of that rule before, so I looked up the details. I now know the rules around this, and it helps to explain the reasons behind the formations better (I never understood why wide receivers would often line up a bit behind the LOS, now I know).  However, I can't see what the fuss is all about. Why is this rule required? How would offensive plays differ if there was no restriction? Is there some cheesey exploit that this rule prevents? "
706,How would I train for a sport such as orienteering?,How would I train as a young semi-elite orienteer? I have some idea of the amount I should do but I do not know how I should spread it across the week. Should I group my training in the middle of the week or should I try to separate my training days? 
707,Use of the designated hitter (DH) in the MLB,"With the Houston Astros moving to the American League starting in 2013, each league (National and American) will have an even amount of teams (15).  As a result, the debate regarding designated hitters (DH) is heating up. As it currently stands, the AL uses designated hitters while the NL does not.  Why are designated hitters used in the AL, but not in the NL? Are there any specific reasons why the AL adopted the rule and/or the NL did not?   One would think that this rule would be used MLB-wide to keep things consistent...rather than having to play by the respective rules of the home team's league during interleague play, when a player gets traded from one team in one league to another team in the other league, etc. However, the MLB claims that the DH has become ""a role more than a player.""    History(1)  Pitchers have historcally had low batting averages. In 1973, American League owners voted 8-4 in favor of using a designated hitter to replace a pitcher's at-bat. Since, the AL has generally had a higher batting average than the NL.  The DH was first used in the World Series in 1976 and for even-numbered years until 1985, where the DH would only be used when games were held at an AL team's stadium (when interleague play (NL vs. AL) began in 1997, the DH would be used in the same fashion). These days, the DH position is used for players to rest and take a partial day-off rather than a full-time position. Also, the DH position has diminished the use of the double switch in the AL, but is still rather prevalent in the NL. "
708,Can a switch hitter change positions during an at bat?,"Just thought about this while playing wiffleball earlier. During a baseball/softball/wiffleball game, can a switch-hitting batter just switch positions in-between pitches during an at-bat or when he calls time? I know this could be dangerous or just an odd thing to do but I've never heard rules against it so is it allowed? "
709,Contact of a player with the net,"The FIVB rules state that:  (11.3.1) Contact with the net by a player is not a fault, unless it interferes with the play.  (11.4.4) A player interferes with the opponent’s play by (amongst others):   touching the top band of the net or the top 80 cm of the antenna during his/her action of playing the ball, or  taking support from the net simultaneously with playing the ball, or creating an advantage over the opponent by touching the net, or making actions which hinder an opponent’s legitimate attempt to play the ball.   The only criterion that is clear to me here is the one about touching the top band of the net. What exactly does it mean to interefere with the play or to get an advantage over the opponent?  Suppose the following sample situations:   An attacker hits the ball and then, while landing back on the court, touches the middle part of the net (not the top band) with his body or with his hand. Same as before, but this time a blocker touches the net while landing back on the court.   It seems to me that in all these cases the player would get an advantage in comparison to situations in which they would not touch the net at all, because then they would have to play more carefully and less aggressively, resulting in a less effective hit.  What are the rules that one should follow to distinguish valid and invalid net contacts? "
710,"What does ""ripper"" mean in cricket?","I have seen the below context      ""Ishant Sharma removed Shane Watson with a ripper""   in Cricinfo. What does ""ripper"" mean in the cricket? "
711,Double Handed Racket Usage,"Is it allowed to play a racket game, like badminton or squash or tennis or table tennis, both left or right handed at the same time?  So, if the ball or shuttle is played towards the backhand side, the player switches from a right hand play to a left hand play.  Can you show me a video reference of such taking place in a match?  "
712,"Are there times when you can ""recycle"" a player in baseball?","In baseball, unlike basketball or football, once a player is removed from the game, he can't be put back into the same game. That is (probably) to prevent a repetition of matchups.  Example: Late in the game, you have a matchup of (lefthanded) batter X against (lefthanded) pitcher A. So the batting team replaces X with a right handed batter Y. The pitching team brings in B, a right handed pitcher. Now the batting team wants to use a left handed batter, but they can't ""recycle"" X. So they either have to use another left handed batter, Z, or let the new, unfavorable matchup stand.  My understanding is that there is an exception involving catchers. That is, if you replace a starting catcher with a second catcher, you can put back the starting catcher. What I'm not sure about is whether this is true generally, or whether it applies only in special situations.  Are there situations in which you can ""recycle"" a catcher (or other player) in baseball? And if so, why would that be the case? "
713,Why was the ball hitting the spider cam not declared as a dead-ball?,"As per the ICC rules,      If a batsman hits the ball and ball strike to spider cam then this ball   consider as dead ball.   But, during the IPL match between RCB and DD, the ball hit by Yuvraj Singh got strike the spider cam wire and it was not declared as a dead ball.    Though the series is a domestic one, the rule was applied earlier in the CLT20 series 2012.  The ball get strike the wire, not the camera, Is this a reason? Or Should anyone appeal for the dead ball?  My question is:     Why was the ball hitting the spider cam not declared as a dead-ball by the umpires? "
714,Do players get points for matches in Davis Cup and Fed Cup in ATP/WTA rankings,"Do players, who represent their countries in Davis Cup/Fed Cup, receive also some points in ATP rankings/WTA rankings?   If yes, is it for matches on any level? Or only matches in World Group?  Are the points from team competitions counted in both rankings - race ranking and ATP/WTA ranking? "

716,What is the fastest recorded smash shot in tennis?,"The fastest recorded tennis serve is about 260km/h but smash is far easier to do and shoot with far higher velocity. I am trying to find the maximum speed tennis players are able to shoot the ball and I feel the shot is smash, not serving. Correct me please if I am wrong. So what is the fastest recorded tennis smash? "
717,"Can a runner be ""put out"" by a runner behind him in the following situation?","Suppose there is a runner on first.   The batter hits a fly ball, and runs to first. The runner on first, anticipating that the ball will be caught, ""barely"" leaves first, with the expectation of returning there. The ball is caught but the batter has touched first base in the meantime.  Can the runner on first return there or is he out because the batter touched first base? Should the batter refrain from touching first base until the ball hits the ground?  (My understanding is that the runner on first is out if the batter BYpasses him on the way to second, but this is a slightly different situation.) "
718,"In baseball, what is the ""inside corner""?","When I listen to baseball games, announcers will mention that pitches are on the inside corner. Presumably, the inside corner of the strike zone.  What I don't understand is that the strike zone, to my knowledge, is a rectangle so wouldn't it have two inside corners (inside being the vertical side closest to the batter)? Or does inside corner mean something else? "
719,Is a person likely to realize most of their ultimate potential in a three-day tennis clinic?,"I was reading a magazine article about a thirty-something actress who never played tennis before, took a tennis clinic, and in the course of a three day weekend, rose to ""high intermediate"" level (a 4.0 or 4.5).  My understanding is that tennis players are rated from 1.0 (rank beginner) to 7.0 (world class). Your (local) tennis pro or instructor is likely to be about 6.0 on this scale.  Seeing the woman's strong showing, are the tennis instructors likely to think, we have a ""natural"" here who's likely to be ""pro"" caliber (6.0 or better)? Or is there more likely to be a natural ceiling of, say, 5.0 with her having reached ""most"" (80-90 percent) of her potential at the clinic itself?  Put another way, are the tennis ratings ""exponential"" (like the Richter scale for earthquakes)? That is, could it be ten times harder to reach 6.0 than 5.0, and 100 times harder to reach 7.0 than 5.0? Meaning that if some who exited a tennis clinic with a 4.5 rating could (with practice) bump it up to 5.0, that would be three times better, and 5.5 would be a tenfold improvement? "
720,Do players get points into ATP ranking even for matches in qualifying rounds,"All (or at least almost all) tournaments at ATP level have a qualifying competition, from which players can get into the main draw.  Do players get some points if they win a match in the qualifying rounds? If not, do at least winners of the qualifying get points? (IIRC the players who enter main draw get points even if they are defeated in the first round already.)    Both Wikipedia article and 2014 ATP Rulebook mention additional qualifying points. (For example, 25 points in Grand Slams.)  The exact quote from rulebook is this:     Players qualifying for the main draw through the qualifying competition shall receive   qualifying points in addition to any points earned, as per the following table,   with the exception of Futures.   I am not sure whether I understand this correctly. Is this the number of points that a player who qualified to the main draw receives? (In addition to the points he receives from the competition.) So the players who do not qualify do not receive any points? "
721,On which tournaments the seeding does not follow ATP/WTA ranking?,"Wimbledon uses seeding which gives advantage to players that are more successful on grass courts. (Although I am not sure how long have they used seeding in this way.)  For example, in Wikipedia article on 2014 Wimbledon Championships we can read that:     The Gentlemen's singles seeds is arranged on a surface-based system to reflect more accurately the individual player's grass court achievement as per the following formula, which applies to the top 32 players, according to ATP Ranking on 17 June 2013:         Take Entry System Position (ESP) points at 16 June 2014   Add 100% points earned for all grass court tournaments in the past 12 months (16.06.2013 – 15.06.2014).   Add 75% points earned for best grass court tournament in the 12 months before that (12.06.2012 – 15.06.2013)         For the Ladies' singles seeds, the seeding order follows the ranking list, except where in the opinion of the Committee, the grass court credentials of a particular player necessitates a change in the interest of achieving a balanced draw.   Are there some other tournaments which do not follow ATP/WTA rankings? In general, can organizers of a tournament make changes to seeding, if they want to do so? "
722,What Effect Could Splits or Cracks in a Cricket Bat Have?,"I am wondering how much of a different small splits/cracks in the toe of a cricket bat makes I shall add a few photos of the cracks.  The splits aren't very large, and I was wondering if they need to be repaired (I know nothing about bat repairing), or whether they won't really have that much effect? Also, of course, is there a realistic chance of the cracks' getting significantly larger and causing damage?     "
723,"Can an Umpire call ""Play"" with only one batsman in the ground?"," Can an Umpire call ""Play"" with only one batsman in the ground?  I follow up the above question with another one....A wicket falls in the last ball of the over just before the call of Time for drinks in an ODI game. Drinks are being brought on to the field. A new batsman also walks in and by the time he reaches his partner, say near the 30 yard circle closer to the pavilion, the captain of the batting side, who is the not-out batsman on the field, sends the new batsman back and asks him to send another batsman in. By the time, the other batsman arrives, the Umpires and the fielders are ready to resume the game. There is only one batsman on the field.  Can the Umpire call ""Play"" now as time for drinks has elapsed?  If not, how long should the Umpire wait before he can answer an appeal for Timed out? What action should the umpire(s) take?   Note: Play has not been called, hence technically there can be no appeal.  "
724,Slow Left arm bowler vs Left Handed Batsman,"I know the fact that  slow left arm bowler is always easier for left handed batsman. I have seen several matches, captain won't give chance for slow left arm bowlers to bowl against left handed batsmen. During India-Sri Lanka matches, captain dhoni didn't give much chance for R Jadeja. Why is it easier ? Will the same for right arm spinner to right handed batsman ? "
725,Is this a held ball (which should have led to a jump ball)?,"Please see: [website]Greg Anthony (the commentator) is quite insistent that this should have been a jump ball.  But it looks to me that the ball was not in Hibbert's ""continuous possession"" (as required by the rules, see below).   Instead, it looks like Hibbert went up, Millsap blocked it, ball completely left Hibbert's hands, Hibbert rebounded the blocked shot (albeit while still in the air), and came back down with it (just like you would when getting any rebound). So this shouldn't be a jump ball (and the officials got it right with their no-call). Is my interpretation of the rules correct?      A held ball occurs when two opponents have one or both hands firmly   on the ball or anytime a defensive player touches the ball causing the   offensive player to return to the floor with the ball in his   continuous possession.

The question is simple:     How many football players enter at the start of the match?   PS: I know there are total 22 players on the field at the time of play, but, I also wish to ask how many of them sit out on the benches (as substitutes, or maybe for other reasons?) "
729,Was Hooper offside for Australia's first disallowed try?,"During the England Vs Australia rugby union international on 18th November 2017 at Twickenham, Michael Hooper scored a try for Australia that was disallowed due to him being offside. According to the BBC's Guide to the offside law...     A player is offside if he is in front of a team-mate who last played the ball AND they actively try to play the ball   When Tevita Kuridrani kicked the ball forward (""played the ball"") then Hooper was clearly offside as he was ahead of the kicker, however, he did not play this ball! When Marika Koroibete did play the ball, Hooper was behind him and hence in an onside position.  So, was Hooper offside? A video of the try can be found here "

731,"After the revocation of an Olympic medal, do those who took lower places get upgraded?","Recently, there are numerous news about the Russian Olympic players being stripped of medals. There have been many similar cases in the past, too.  Once a sportsperson gets stripped of their medal, do the others get ""upgraded"" automatically? In other words, if the gold medal was stripped, does the player who took second place automatically get ""promoted"" to the gold, the third to the silver, and so on?  If so, what is the process? What happens to a sportsperson who took fourth place, did not even appear on the podium, and lost their deserved moment of glory? "
732,What does a Scandinavian Flick/Pendulum Turn physically achieve?,"From what I gathered a Pendulum Turn in the context of rallying helps with inducing oversteer, primarily on low-grip surfaces. Many resources explain the technique, but less so what actually makes it efficient. I figure that some advantages are:   The initial sideways drift gives more traction than braking in a straight line. Weight is distributed towards the tires on the side of the corner.   But I do not think that this it the primary effect of the technique. So, is the idea of the pendulum, especially in a FWD, that the rear of the car holds the front of the car back (just as the anchor point of a pendulum), thus introducing a moment of inertia towards the corner into the car when the brakes are being released? Also, this would not work in an RWD at all (only if the rear wheels grip faster than the front wheels when releasing the brake)?  Is this what makes it work? Are there any factors missing? A qualitative physical explanation would be great. "
733,Overthrow and throw-by,"The two terms are very popular in my locality. According to my teacher,     overthrow: is when fielder near the pitch misses throw from fielder at far     off in field.   He defined ""throw-by"" as the event when ""batsman has not touched the ball with his bat or gloves or any part of his body, he attempts run, fielder throws ball but misses run out""  Surprisingly, I found no mention of ""throw-by"" on the internet or in the laws as my teacher said.  Did he confuse ""throw-by"" with another popular terminology? Or is there really some ""throw-by"" phenomenon, conspicuously absent from the internet? "
734,Are Teams Penalized for Lone Player Behaviour?,"If a player goes ballistic on the ref or other players, can this cause his team to be punished? I expect there have been several games where a team lost due to infractions from one of their players--but have teams ever been suspended or penalized beyond the match, due to the bad behaviour of one of their players? Presumably, this is more likely to be punished if they keep having bad players.  I was wondering about this primarily with Football, but am curious if this is the same across most sports. "
735,What happens if the 2 umpires in cricket disagree on a decision?,"Say the umpire at the non-striker's end has given an LBW, but the square leg umpire has observed that the ball is clearly too high to be hitting the stumps, can the square leg umpire override or advise the non-striker's end umpire's decision?   Does the square leg umpire in general have the same jurisdiction as the non-striker's end umpire?  Are there decisions the square leg umpire has more power on than the non-striker's end umpire, e.g. height wides/no-balls? "
736,What is the name of round-robins when teams play others an unequal number of times?,"According to Wikipedia:     In a single round-robin schedule, each participant plays every other   participant once. If each participant plays all others twice, this is   frequently called a double round-robin. The term is rarely used when   all participants play one another more than twice, and is never used   when one participant plays others an unequal number of times   Let's say a tournament is held during 10 days and an entire round fits in one week exactly, no more and no less. With round I am referring to an entire cycle where each team plays every other once. The next round cannot be completed because of time constraints so there is only 3 days to organize a partial round where each teams plays a second match against some of the other teams but not all. So this is neither a single round-robin schedule nor a double round-robin one, but something in between. So what do you call it?  And what do you call it when each team plays the other 3 times or more? And more instances of unequal number of teams? "

739,How are the votes on curling shots determined?,"During curling matches it is easy to check the percentage for each shot of for each player, but how are those values determined?

If the green stone is closer to the yellow it takes 100%, if it was farther it takes 0% (I believe so).

741,Can you goaltend a shot that won't count?,"I was watching a review of the longest shot in NBA history and was reminded of this pretty incredible bucket:  [website]This video is of the 2015 Boston Celtics attempting an inbounds play against the Indiana Pacers from the opposite baseline with only 1.1 seconds left. The play is to heave the ball across the entire court towards the basket, but it actually goes in the basket instead.  Of course, that shot doesn't actually count. The player, Jae Crowder, is out of bounds on the opposite baseline and you can't score from out of bounds. His intent is to actually pass it to a teammate so they can attempt a shot within the last second+ of time in the half.  But this leads me to my question: this heave has no chance of scoring even if it goes through the basket.

743,"Can the goalkeeper release the ball at their own goal, then save it from going in?","In this YouTube video (should start at 13 seconds), the goalkeeper releases the ball, involuntarily aiming it towards his own goal. Would he be allowed to save it using his hands?  I read in this article on USSoccer.com that      ""Parrying"" occurs when the goalkeeper controls the ball with the hands by pushing it to an area where it can be played later. By parrying the ball, the goalkeeper has done two things simultaneously:  (1) established control and (2) given up possession. The ball is now free for all to play and the goalkeeper may not play it again with the hands.    This seems to me to indicate that the goalie could not handle the ball, is this correct? On top of that would he be sent off for DOGSO ? "

746,Can the home team win an extra-inning baseball game by more than 1 run?,"In baseball, I'm wondering how home teams are awarded winning runs. If the visiting team in, say, Inning 10, plates 5 runs, then the home team has the bottom of that inning to match or exceed this number.  But what if this scenario occurs: game is tied in the 10th with the home team up to bat. 1 runner is on base, and the batter launches a home run over the fence. The game is clearly over via a ""walk-off"" at this point, but since the home team doesn't ""need"" 2 runs to win (remember, it's tied), are they only awarded the 1 run from the on-base runner? Or are they given a 2-run win? If it's the former, is the batter then only awarded a single RBI for his stats, thus ""robbing"" him of the extra RBI (in this case, himself)?  TL;DR: can the home team in an extra-inning baseball game ever win said game by more than 1 run? "
747,Where does a player's runs scored under his country's A team goes to?,"As to my knowledge, there're 3 categories before a player gets into the national team.

Do they respectively fall under First Class, List A and t20s? Like the domestic.  If anyone could shed in some light on this, would be great. "

Or do they wear another one that is not sold and that could, for example, be ligther, more resistant or better in general? "
752,"In football, how should the referee deal with possible offside situations involving attacking/defending players off the field of play?","I personally think this is one of the most confusing aspects of the Laws of the Game. In particular, I'm referring to these two paragraphs (Law 11.4):     (Defending players off the field of play)      A defending player who leaves the field of play without the referee’s   permission shall be considered to be on the goal line or touchline for   the purposes of offside until the next stoppage in play or until the   defending team has played the ball towards the halfway line and it is   outside its penalty area. If the player left the field of play   deliberately, the player must be cautioned when the ball is next out   of play.         (Attacking players off the field of play)      An attacking player may step or stay off the field of play not to be   involved in active play. If the player re-enters from the goal line   and becomes involved in play before the next stoppage in play or the   defending team has played the ball towards the halfway line and it is   outside its penalty area, the player shall be considered to be   positioned on the goal line for the purposes of offside. A player who   deliberately leaves the field of play and re-enters without the   referee’s permission and is not penalised for offside and gains an   advantage must be cautioned.   I actually have the same two questions for both paragraphs, so they're technically four questions (just in case one or both of these questions have different answers depending on whether we're talking about defending or attacking players being off the field of play):   is a defending/attacking player still considered to be on a boundary line even after he has re-entered the field of play?   (This first question stems from the fact that neither paragraph says that re-entering the field of play actually stops this virtual-repositioning-on-the-boundary-lines that otherwise happens for the purposes of offside.  I'm especially curious about this for what concerns attacking players, as this seems to imply that an attacking players who had stepped off the field of play and then got back will still be considered to be a ""ghost player"" in offside position even if five minutes pass and the ball has been kicked around multiple times, as long as play never stopped, and the ball never left the penalty area while being kicked towards the halfway line.)   do these paragraphs apply to defending/attacking players who leave the field of play as part of a playing movement as well?   (This second question stems from the fact that both paragraphs seem to be about very specific situations, as the first one is about players leaving the field of play without the referee's permission, while the second one is about attacking players leaving for the purposes of not being involved in active play.  While I understand that if a player leaves the field of play with the referee's permission, e.g. because of an injury, it's only natural that he shouldn't be considered for the purposes of offside anymore, Law 11 never touches the important situation of a player leaving the field of play as part of a playing movement as per Law 3.8, so that I'm unsure about what the referee should do when e.g. an attacking player temporarily leaves the field of play to go past an opponent, or when e.g. a defending player accidentally steps behind their own goal line while defending their goal).

753,Outdoor Volleyball: Is overhand contact with fingers on a serve legal?,"Which USAV Outdoor Volleyball Rules regulate the action of receiving a serve overhand with fingers? This is a contentious topic where I play.   I found a rule that allows double contact even when overhand with fingers on a hard-driven ball. This raises related questions: Is a fast serve considered to be a hard-driven ball? What is meant by 'defensive' below?  If the serve is soft/slow, then is overhand contact of a served ball with fingers legal if the contact is clean? Is FIVB the same as USAV for this?  USAV Outdoor Rules as of June 2019: [website]  9.2.2.4 Extended Contacts: In defensive action of a hard-driven ball, the ball contact can be extended momentarily even if an overhand finger action is used. USAV 9.2.2.4: Plays involving finger action require special attention. If the play is defensive and reactive in nature, as in the case of a hard-driven ball, momentarily held or double-contacted balls are not considered faults...If the player decides/intends to use finger setting action to contact an off-speed attack, the contact must be “clean.”  "

This summer, I might move abroad and for sure I want to keep playing football. What is the formal procedure to be eligible for, say an English, amateur squad?  In this example, would it be sufficient to sign up at the team and the FA or is there some transfer action required with the KNVB (Dutch FA) and my Dutch club?

Any answers on how this works in other countries are appreciated as well. "
757,Dress Code for football supporters?,"I was just browsing on Stubhub because I was curious what tickets for a Manchester United game go for when this popped up:    It seems to indicate that if you're a supporter (I assume possibly an away supporter), you shouldn't be wearing team colors. That seems a bit ridiculous to me, not only as an American sports fan, but as someone who has watched any sporting event ever.  Is this really the case? What are they trying to accomplish? Don't they already separate the supporters within the stadium with security and/or walls? "

Perhaps I don't understand horse physiology verse human physiology but why is this the case?  Humans can run many miles per day while training and/or can run a 1-2 mile race once or twice a week (well, my friends did in HS for track and field).  EDIT: Here's an article that shows the owner complaining the field was stacked with fresh horses against his ""tired"" horse but again, for a horse to run three 1 mile races in 5 weeks, fatigue shouldn't be an issue unless I'm totally off regarding horse vs. human physiology.

760,Should a manager be questioned for leaving in a right handed pitcher in the following situation?,"The conventional wisdom is that right- and left- handed pitchers pitch ""better"" (low ERA) to batters of the same ""handedness,"" (because pitcher prefer to pitch ""inside."")  The game (Pittsburgh vs. St. Louis) is in extra innings. Pittsburgh leads 2-1, having scored a run in the top of the twelfth. Pittsburgh has a right handed reliever, Rhadames Liz, who gets ""one on and one out"" against two right handed batters. It's down to the last two outs.  The first, second, and fourth batters coming up (Kolton Wong, Jon Jay, and Matt Carpenter are left-handed); Peter Bourjos in the third spot, is right-handed.  Pittsburgh has two left handed relievers who have worked one inning in each of the two previous games, but only a total of three innings each in the previous week. Why not use one, or even both lefties to get the last two outs?  Liz gave up a single and a walk, loading the bases, and then a single for the tying run in the 12th. After pitching a perfect 13th, he gave up the losing run in the 14th because the Pirates couldn't score.  One more consideration: The following day (today) is an off day, giving relievers a chance to rest.  Would a general manager have reason to question a manager for 1) violating the conventional wisdom about right- versus- left handed match ups and 2) NOT playing to win or lose the game in the current inning to spare future relievers?  "
761,Does anyone else modify their golf grip on a per shot basis?,I've found myself modifying my thumb position of my left hand (I swing right) to achieve a fade or a draw.  I think this technically creates a slightly stronger / weaker grip. If I put my thumb on the flag-opposite side of the golf club I find it much easier to drive the ball low and draw it. And the opposite is true for hitting a cut or fade or even flop shots. I literally put the right side of my left thumb on the flag side of the golf club to hit a soft cut or pitch shot.  I also move my left index finger. If I want to drive the ball lower and draw it a little more or even hit a straighter shot I hook my left index finger on the front of the club and push the club into that left index finger to lock it into place.  My left finger is then at least half an inch farther down the shaft than my left thumb.  The reverse is true for a fade.  I move my index finger farther up the shaft. I feel like this has the effect of letting me cup my left wrist easier.  I don't interlock my grip and I overlap my right ring finger on top of my left index finger.  It's definitely helped with my control and consistency while trying to create different types of shots.  Has anyone ever heard of a pro modifying their grip like this on a per shot basis?  Does anyone else do this?

763,How exactly did Carvajal not get booked/sent off after causing a penalty?,"Juventus-Real Madrid Champions League semi-final game is being played now and I am completely dumbfounded by how Carvajal managed to get away without seeing a card in connection with the penalty situation.   The facts are:    It's a sliding tackle, that misses the ball He is the last defender   I would have expected a red but even a yellow would be understandable. I can't get my head around the fact that Marcelo got a yellow for his ""tactical"" foul prior to the penalty, and Vidal got a yellow for protest but the player who caused it all seemed to get away with it.   That must have been a miss from the ref, surely? "
764,"How were the parameters for a ""quality"" start defined?","A ""quality start"" for a pitcher in baseball is defined as giving up no more than three runs in six or more innings of work. For frames of reference, a starter needs to complete at least five full innings (a majority out of nine) to be eligible for a win, and three runs in six innings would be a 4.50 ERA. So how did this definition come about?  I've worked with a sliding scale, where a ""quality start equivalent"" (QSE) which would require at least five innings of work, and the number of innings minus the number of runs cannot be less than three. That is to say, five innings and two runs would qualify, as would seven innings and four runs. Has anyone in the sport used, or proposed, a similar ""equivalent?"" (On this scale, the Pittsburgh Pirates, who have ""only 16 quality starts in 26 games, would have 20 QSE's. Other teams would benefit from this adjustment, of course but not to the same degree.)  Another thing that puzzles me is that a quality start is ""retracted"" if a starter goes six innings with no more than three runs, then pitches the seventh (and possibly an eighth) and gives up a fourth run. The way I look at it is that the pitcher earned a quality start for ""three in six,"" then functioned as a ""middle reliever,"" for the seventh inning. Put another way, the pitcher gave his manager the option of using only one inning of ""middle"" relief, even though the manager didn't use this option. Or don't the scorers see it that way? "
765,Going back to track and field,"I trained track and field when I was 13, but stopped at 15 due to excessive obligations. However, in the meantime I started karate, and it's really going well, but now I'm considering returning to track and field because I really love it and I have more time now.  The problem is, do I have a chance at becoming good in it? I'm 19 now, and while I was in T&amp;F, my disciplines were the 100m and 200m dash. But I don't have to do the same disciplines. I was thinking switching to the 400m. And karate requires considerably less physical fitness than track and field, so my condition is probably far from perfect.  So, is there a possibility of me getting any good results in track and field after all these years? I don't have any sports injuries or health issues. "
766,Scoring runs when a no ball is caught,"When a ball is batted in the air and then caught, but it was called a no ball (so they can't be dismissed caught), will the batting team score any regular runs of the ball they completed (and can they potentially be run out)?  Two similar situations happened in two different IPL matches, but was seemingly treated differently.  In ball 19.5 of the second innings of the 32nd IPL 2015 match between Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan Royals, there was a run-out after a no ball was caught (an additional run was also scored, the run-out happened when they attempted a second).     Vinay Kumar to Binny, (no ball) 1 run, OUT, another full toss, in the air again and he's caught at long-on. This was definitely over the waist, and is called no-ball. Pollard doesn't realise that and throws the ball late, which makes Southee comes back for the second. But his throw is accurate and Vinay takes the bails off casually, catching Southee's bat short despite the dive. A no ball, a run, a run out   In ball 19.4 of the first innings of the 19th IPL 2015 match between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Kolkata Knight Riders, the ball was caught, but replays showed that it was above waist height and it was called a no ball, and in addition a run was scored. This was shown on televsion and CricBuzz and CricInfo.  But then in the innings break the score was adjusted, and as CricInfo says ""The target is 177, not 178. The run taken on the no-ball for height in the last over won't be taken into account as the catch was taken"".     UT Yadav to Rahul, 1 no ball, high full toss swung high over midwicket, long on runs in to his right to take it, but replays show that is just above waist height, and it is a no-ball   IPL actually tweeted about this.  Was one of these two situations treated wrong, or am I misinterpreting or missing some extra information which makes the two situations different? "
767,Why are Formula 1 tracks usually oriented clockwise?,"In other sports, for example track and field athletics, the track is always oriented counter-clockwise.  Why aren't Formula 1 tracks oriented similarly? (Maybe it's just me, but I find it much more convenient to make left turns than right turns.)  Explanation as to why my question is different than the one linked: That question asks why tracks are oriented clockwise in other sports, and to me the reasons for that are quite obvious and make sense. However, I was surprised about Formula 1 (and perhaps other car racing?) tracks being oriented unusually. "
768,"Why is a baseball runner ""out"" when you hit him with the throw to first?","A few games ago Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers scooped up a bunt down the first base line and pegged the runner square in the back who was just running straight down the baseline like anyone would.  The runner didn't otherwise in any way impede the defensive players, it was just a mistaken throw that hit the runner.  But the runner was immediately called out.  The first baseman never touched the ball.  Everyone including the announcers just understood it to be an out.  Why?  If a catcher throws down to second base to get a guy trying to steal, and the ball hits the runner, he is not automatically out.  If the guy in right field throws a ball to third base and hits the runner sliding into third, he is not automatically out.  What then is the reasoning and rule that allows the guy running to first to be out?  [Edit: keywords so this information can be found: ""45-foot lane"", ""runner's lane""] "

Curiously, my friend and I would get separated by a very wide margin (500m) at the middle of the channel before we merged back together with me lagging just slightly (50m) behind.

776,Why is no second football game televised (possibly just in NY)?,"Something confuses the heck out of me in regards to TV broadcasting of (American) Football.  I used to live in Seattle.  On Sunday, there were the early games, and the later games.  One was selected to be televised at 1:00 (EST), and one at 4:00 (EST), regardless of which time slot the local team (Seahawks) were playing in.  Easy enough.  I now live in New York.  There are still early and late games, of course, at the same times.  There are two local teams (Giants/Jets).  But often if neither of those teams is playing in the later time slot, no game will be shown.  Why?  Now, the first impression I had was that this was just a remarkably poor programming decision made by TV execs...but I once heard the announcers at the end of the early game say something like:     A: And coming up next, you'll be seeing one of these three games...       B: Unless you're in New York, of course.       A: Of course.   Wha?  It sounded slightly sarcastic, like they understood that the policy was strange, but expected.    Is there a straightforward explanation for what's going on? "
777,What are the team sports with more than two teams?,The only team sports with more than two teams I can think of is relays in track and field and swimming like 4x100m and 4x400m.  However I wonder if there is a full sport on its own that is played by more than two teams at the same time. A ball sport perhaps ? That would be quite impressive in terms of strategy and richness.    If it doesn't exists is it because it would create too much incentive for temporary alliance to defeat other teams before duelling each other ?  For this question I don't consider that individuals helping each others in races like the teams in cycling to be actual teams. There is only one winner at the end.

Some high-tops do not have a cut out above the heel. Would a cut out be beneficial or not? Should the shoe fit snug at the ankle or be a little loose?   Why do all the karting shoes have a rounded sole but only some have a cut out?  The primary consideration is safety with athletic performance being secondary. 
783,How do top football league (e.g. EPL) teams retain reserve players?,"Premier division teams in the top European leagues (EPL etc) play a lot of matches, especially the elite teams that also play in UEFA. With player fatigue, injury, suspension etc reserve players must be needed at times. By reserve I mean players beyond the starting eleven plus 3 subs.  My question is who are these players, how good are they and what do they get paid? From the teams perspective, they have plenty of cash and don't want to have to field players who are terrible when their stars are unavailable. But from the players perspective, if you are good enough to occasionally be a sub and get a few minutes for Manchester United, then you are probably good enough to be a starting player for Wolverhampton but then you'd actually get to play full games regularly. Is this about the standard of these reserve players, or are they more like the ability of a regular starter in a lower division?  The main football code I follow is Australian Rugby League and in the top competition (the NRL) each club has a top team but also a reserved grade team that plays in a parallel competition. There is also an under 21s competition which also functions as a type of reserve grade. When top team players are unavailable, someone who has been doing well in reserve grade steps up to the big time and when the top player returns they go back to the reserves but crucially keep getting regular game time. My understanding of European football is that there is not this kind of reserve grade system. So what are the reserve players doing when they are not needed? How do they continue to demonstrate to the manager that they are in form? "

However, I'm still unsure if the Duckworth-Lewis method is applied in the following scenarios:   When the rain interrupts in the middle of the first innings of a 50 over match? When the rain interrupts once the first innings is complete? When the rain interrupts once the second team has batted a certain number of overs?  "
788,How does the review work?,"I've seen both the teams reviewing on a Test/ODI match. So there could be two scenarios such as:  1) When the batsman is given out, and the batsman reviews against it.  2) When the batsman is not given out, the bowling team could review it.   So for example, it's an LBW given for a batsman, and it's the umpire's call. The batsman tries to review it. When the third umpire sees the seam position, whether it has pitched in line and whether it's knocking the stumps. So if the batsman reviews this, what could be the reasons for the umpire to turn down this decision? ie: If it misses the stumps or pitching outside the line?   And I would like to know the vice versa when, umpire gives it not out when the bowling team appeals and they take the review. What could be the scenarios if it should be given out?  All in all, does the standing umpire's call matter when a review is made? Can a dismissal be turned down due the on field umpire's call?  Any advice would be appreciated.  "
789,Can a goalkeeper use his/her hands within the opponents penalty area?,"The Wikipedia article on goalkeepers states that:     The goalkeeper is the only player in the side who may use his or her hands and arms to catch, throw and save the ball, but only within the penalty area.   (boldface added, I'v edited the wiki page to solve the ambiguity)  It is however not clear to me whether the goalkeeper can only use his/her hands within the penalty area of his/her team or is he/she allowed to use his/her hands within the penalty area of the opponents team as well.  Sometimes goalkeepers effectively cross the field for instance to assist the team in a final corner, etc. I am wondering if the goalkeeper would be allowed to use his hands (for instance to catch the ball and throw it to the opponents goal?  Can someone provide a reference whether this is allowed? "
790,Updated power play rules for an ODI?,"I've read the updated ""power play"" rules which were modified in June 2016 on Wikipedia. But then have a slight confusion on when can the fielding team request for the power play.        Mandatory powerplay (1–10 overs):In an uninterrupted match (i.e. 50   overs), the first 10 overs of an innings will be a mandatory   powerplay. During the mandatory powerplay only two fielders are   allowed outside the 30-yard circle.    Between overs 11 and 40 a maximum of four fielders are allowed outside the 30-yard circle    In the final 10 overs (41–50) a maximum of five fielders will be allowed to field outside the 30-yard circle      So ""P1"" is the mandatory power play (""Bowling Powerplay"") and what's P2? If so between which overs they can take it and how many overs is the second power play?   Is that last ten overs considered as a power play too?  "
791,Why isn't it counted as a hit in baseball?,"It happened at the bottom of the 5th inning between Baltimore and Seattle on June 30, 2016. With the bases fully loaded, a batter hit the ball to the right field and the third base runner scored a run, but the second base runner started late because he thought the ball could be caught by the right fielder and got forced out on the third base. The batter was not the one who was forced out.   What I don't understand is why it is not counted as a hit? I have been looking for a relevant rule, but I couldn't find it. Can you explain why it isn't a hit? "
792,Penalty shootout with unequal number of players?,"A penalty shootout involves a best of 5, with 5 different players (who finished the match) from each team taking shots, alternating. If both teams score the same number of goals, it goes to a sudden death, where the team that scores more goals than the opposing team within the same number of shots wins.  What if the number of eligible players is different between the teams? Wouldn't a shooter be unmatched with a shooter from the opposing team? "
793,Dugout players assisting a fielder,"In attempting to field a foul popup, a fielder leans over the railing of his own dugout.  Suppose his teammates  and/or coaches in the dugout support him with their hands, to keep him from falling over the railing, and he makes the catch.  Is this legal?  If not, is there any penalty other than considering the catch not to have been made (making it just a foul ball)?  Rule 6.01(b) says that the team at bat must get out of the way of a fielder trying to catch a ball, even in their own dugout; and if they hinder the fielder, the batter can be called out.  But I didn't see any rule that applies to the fielder's own teammates. "
794,Do managers select their kick takers after learning which team will shoot first?,"From a game theory perspective, I'm trying to find the optimal strategy for selecting penalty kick takers. Anecdotally (and I hope to quantify this relationship later) I've heard that it's always advantageous to shoot first because each player on the second team can face additional pressure coming from behind at each round.   Are managers allowed to adjust their selection of shooters as a result of learning that they will be going first or second?  Do they submit the list immediately following the conclusion of extra time and before the coin flip, or after the coin flip and before the kicks begin? "
795,What if an entire team is suspended for amassing 2 yellow cards each?,Several players will miss the Euro Cup semifinals because they have amassed 2 yellow cards in the first 5 matches.  What would happen if all 23 players had amassed 2 yellow cards? Would the semifinal be a walk over to the other team? 
796,"Who is awarded the assist when a receiving player deliberately leaves the ball for another player, who scores?","Who is assisting the goal, if a player [1] passes the ball to a teammate [2], who is missing the ball on purpose and is leaving it for a third player, who scores? For example, who is assisting the fourth goal of Antoine Griezmann from the UEFA Euro 2016 quarter-finals (France 5 - 2 Iceland)? "
797,What is the name of Pogba's body swerve played on Mustafi?,On 7 July 2016 during the match Germany-France for Euro 2016 at minute 72 Pogba has disoriented the defender Mustafi with a body move.     I would like to know if this movement has a particular name?   I will add the link to a video as soon as I find it.  The goal be seen on this video from official UEFA youtube channel. 
798,Player's name on uniform: when and why did it start?,"Which competition (or team, if relevant) was the first to print each player's name on the uniform? Was there a specific reason given to do so?  Both questions are independent of specific sports. The first one I'm asking out of historical interest. The second is because I see little point in printing players' names when they already have identifying numbers (other than selling replica uniforms, which is, as far as I know, a practice that postdates the introduction of named uniforms). "
799,"In singles table tennis, is it considered bad sportsmanship to intentionally serve deceptively, even if following the ITTF rules","According to the ITTF Handbook, the rule about diagonal serves only applies to doubles:     As the ball is falling the server shall strike it so that it touches first his or her court and then, touches directly the receiver's court; in doubles, the ball shall touch successively the right half court of server and receiver.    Consider the following example, where it is assumed that all ITTF rules are followed:  I had served several balls/points diagonally, but in the next serve, while maintaining the same stance and position as I had in prior serves, serve the ball to the other side of the table.  Would this be considered bad sportsmanship? Do professionals do this in matches? It would be great to see e.g. videos of this happening to get an idea of how it happens in official matches, if at all. "
800,Differences between stroke and let,"I was checking up on some squash rules and realised that I have never really grasped the difference between stroke and let in squash. Especially if there is no dedicated ref, how do you go about deciding these?  Here's an interesting video, where three events: let, stroke and no-let happen during some match, but they looked pretty much the same to me. Could someone explain why the calls are made in that way? "
801,Does a ball count if it hits an umpire?,What happens in a scenario where the batsman plays a shot down the ground and it hits the umpire? Isn't it unfair to the batsman to lose a certain boundary had there been one? Does the ball count as a dead ball? 
802,"What does it mean to say, “X was the Nth overall pick for this season”?","I am a recent NFL enthusiast and have just started following the games but some terminology still stumps me. I understand the draft process in general and know that every year each of the 32 teams get to pick new players over two days with 7 rounds given to each of them. So, when a player is said to be the “first overall pick for a season, does it mean that he was the first one to be drafted by any team for that year? Or does it mean he was just picked in the first (of the seven rounds) round? If each team gets one pick (ideal circumstances), that would mean 32 picks per round. So could the player (said to be the first overall pick) have been picked in any order as long as it’s in the first round or does he have to strictly be the very first pick of the first round? "
803,What is a pass rusher?,Is it just another name for a running back or a wide receiver? It seems to me that it would be anyone who takes the pass from the QB and runs the ball which pretty much seems to be what the RB does. Is my understanding correct or is there more to it? 
804,Safe volley grip and serving grip in Tennis?,"  Which is a correct and safe volley grip aka serving grip in Tennis? One where hand is clearly on the handle or the one where some fingers are resting on the handle? Images screenshot from the video here.  I trained very intensive weeks tennis where my baby finger and ring finger got damaged/painful/non-flexible due to holding the racket so that only 3-4 fingers on the holding -- video about training here -- this was because I used more the grip where some fingers were not totally on the grip so strong swing put intensive stress to the baby finger and ringer finger. Initially, physiotherapist said that it is only tight muscles so 1 week's rest. Now I realise that my right-hand muscles are far stronger on my holding hand and that the tension is getting lower and morning hardness is becoming less. Yet the feeling in the serving hand is not the same as in the other hand, this may be a good (muscles/bones getting stronger used to playing tennis or I am using a wrong technique). Now I am uncertain:     Should I change my serving grip and my volley grip so that all of my fingers are on the handle of the racket (picture on the left) or half finger, one finger or 2 fingers over the handle (picture on the right)?  "
805,What percent of shots on goal hit the crossbar in hockey?,"It seems like a lot of shots hit the crossbar in hockey. Is this just my mind playing tricks on me, or do more shots hit the crossbar than might be expected for a bar a few inches wide set above a goalie's shoulders.  First, what percent of shots hit the crossbar in the NHL?   And is it higher than would be expected?  The ""expected"" rate, I'd imagine, is the same rate as any other space on goal of equal size to the crossbar. "
806,Difference between medium fast and fast medium bowler?,"What exactly is the difference between a medium fast bowler and a fast medium bowler?  At first they seem like they have no difference at all but then, you hear commentators and experts talk about a bowler and you suddenly feel like there is a difference. I know for sure that it is there.   So what is the difference? "
807,How much time hold Cricket if Match delayed from Rain?,"I am really very confuse, How much to wait if  Match delayed from Rain?  If rain delay game from first inning? if rain delay game from second inning?  What is the procedure 20/20 over, one day and test Matches? any rules for this?  Let us Assume:  if Team A scored: 181 all out(41.5 over), Now  Team B played: Rain occurs at 121/3 (27.4 over). If rain Delayed from local time 4:12 PM.  How much time to wait if rain not stopped? Any idea?? "
808,Could I use a trialthlon swimming wetsuit for diving?,"I am a diver, yet I always rent my wetsuits. I have been thinking of making an investment recently, but I haven't gotten around to it, as in Belgium you need some different thicknesses: 7mm (for sure, even two perhaps), 3mm for indoor and on trips, a warm undersuit for the body, etc.   I am living in San Sebastian for 2 months, and I would love to buy a triahlon swimsuit 2mm (like this one) or 3-4mm (like this one) to be able to go out for longer swims in the ocean. I can't swim with a diving suit I suppose, because of the inflexible arms, and I am considering doing triathlons for fun. Not sure which one would be confortable with water temps around 16 degrees C.  Would I also be able to wear the triathlon suit to go diving? Or do they have significant changes that I am not aware of? I guess they are less insolating around the flexible parts, would that be a problem? "
809,Who wins a league (EPL) if two teams have the same number of points?,"Is there any rule defined by UEFA or FIFA?     If more teams have the same number of points in a league after the finishing game, what is the rule to declare a winner??   Were there any rule updates by UEFA for this season (2013/14) or the upcoming season?  I found on the Premier League official website: Who wins the League if teams have the same number of points?  Here the rule is defined by goal difference. Is it a new rule, or is it determined by head-to-head then goal difference? "
810,Bypassing the salary cap through hidden accounts,"I have a general salary cap question. This can be for any league with a cap, but let's use the NFL.  Is there anything preventing an owner from paying a player with a hidden account or something? For example, if a player on the open market can make [tex]5 million as your official salary and I will give you $5 million in an offshore bank account."" This saves the player money in taxes and in agent fees and it helps the team to be more competitive because it has more cap room than they normally would.  Is there anything preventing this from happening? Obviously you'd want to limit it to a few star players so word doesn't really get around and you wouldn't want the official salary to be super low or it could be suspicious.   I was just thinking about this because it seems like teams will do anything to get an advantage. We've seen with Spygate and Bountygate... this seems like an obvious one.  "
811,Do Ice Hockey commentators say score or scores?,"Is it actually called a goal or do they call it a score and therefore shouting ""score!"" is like shouting ""goal!"" in football?  Or do they shout ""scores!"" as in scores a goal/point?  Is either acceptable? "
812,What does this scoring format mean?,"Looking at this soccer match page: [website]The score format says, ""(2) 3 - 2 (3)"". What do the brackets mean? The article also says:     After 90 minutes Sevilla led 3-2 to cancel out the first-leg deficit   and make the score 5-5 on aggregate and with no goals in extra-time,   it was left to visiting goalkeeper Volkan, who saved from Julien   Escude, Ivica Dragutinovic and Dani Alves.   What do they mean by ""first-leg deficit"" and ""score 5-5 on aggregate""? "
813,Wide Ball rule being neglected,"When a ball is outside the wide line on the off side or outside the leg stump on the leg side of the batsman, it is given as a wide ball. But now-a-days (especially in T20 matches), if the ball is inside the batsman's reach even if the ball is outside the wide line on the off side or ouside the leg stump on the leg side is not given as a wide ball by the umpires. Why is it so that the wide ball rule is being neglected by umpires? WHAT'S A PROPER WIDE BALL DEFINITION? "
814,"Rugby Union referee yells something like, ~“Use-Its”~?","Or something that sounds like that.  A side has retained control of the ball after a ruck, and the ball is just laying there on the ground and the player is hunched over with his hands on the ball waiting until people get in place.  The referee yells what sounds like “Use-Its”.  I occasionally hear this, and I heard it three times in a row last match I watched.  What is he saying?     Edit: Super Rugby: Hurricanes vs. Highlanders (5/212014 – Round 6 - Forsyth Barr Stadium, Dunedin NZ)  [website]"
815,Is it ethical to serve really hard?,"This is something that's been bothering me for a while.   We play volleyball socially and the team is mixed gender, aged 20 - 50+, mixed level (from complete beginners to two advanced players who join us occasionally).  I've been playing for almost two years now. I would rate myself above beginner level. But because of weight-lifting and martial arts, I have developed strong arms and can deliver the fastest serves in the team (although my spikes are weak due to bad technique, working on that). But I cannot do jump serves.  We have played against some professional players, and we got some easy points from my serves.  Again, I'm not trying to show off or anything, I just want to know if I'm doing something wrong.  My question is: is it ethical to serve really hard? Is there unwritten or maybe written rule?   I do serve weaker and higher when I target a beginner in the opposite team to avoid injuries. (but that's something we were debating as well). "
816,Where does the fan keeping score tradition in baseball come from?,"Many people go to games and manually keep track of the run's, hits, errors?  Does this come from years of tradition from times when scoreboards were not around at the park? "
817,Spin in Ice Hockey Shots?,"Spin is highly important in professional ball games such as tennis, football (soccer) and basketball. In order to shoot with spin in tennis, you need to have enough flexible hands/arms and learn the proper technique. Spin also helps to score in basketball because side-spinned balls turn more easily to the goal. In football (soccer), spinned shots are highly unpredictable for the goalkeeper and defence, making scoring more probable with the surprise element. Golf balls can travel father away due to spin. Spins are everywhere and its understanding can be a real advantage!  The importance of spin in ball games make me wonder whether spin is also used in ice hockey or could it be used? I feel topspin and backspin are very rare in hockey. So        How is spin done in ice hockey?    What kind of spins are they?    Side-spins? And when are they used? Do they deflect the puck in the air?     "
818,How are the Ballon d'Or scores determined?,"The Ballon d'Or is presented by France Football and honours the male player deemed to have performed the best over the previous year. I've read that it is based on voting by football journalists but I haven't been able to find out   Who are the voting journalists and which countries are they from? Whether the system is based on one vote per journalist, or are the votes weighted in any way?  "
819,Is there any link between Scoliosis and sprinting?,"The fastest man ever, Usain Bolt, world record holder of the 100 and 200 meter sprints suffers from Scoliosis. This is a condition which causes curvature to the spine. The curvature in his spine has cause his right leg to be slightly shorter than the left leg.  I've also read about other sprinters with lower reputation who also had Scoliosis. For example a Canadian national sprinter used to run third in 4x100 relays to ""take advantage"" of his uneven leg lengths in the curve.  Is there any links between Scoliosis and leg length differential and sprinting performance? Has there been a study on this? "
820,Scores of men's vs. women's teams,"In some sports, two teams compete against each other for a set amount of time (e.g. soccer, basketball) or another fixed quantity (like baseball). In those sports, do men's teams score more points on average (against each other) than women's teams, or vice versa? Or is there not any noticeable difference?  For example, take the last editions of the FIFA (soccer) World Cups for women:   2015 (2.81 goals per match) 2011 (2.69 goals per match) 2007 (3.47 goals per match)   and for men:   2014 (2.67 goals per match) 2010 (2.27 goals per match) 2006 (2.3 goals per match)   The women score more goals per match than their male counterparts. Is this common throughout football, or just a coincidence? And how about other sports?  If there are any sports where women's matches last longer/shorter than men's, e.g. 30 minutes instead of 40, I'd expect the statistics to compensate for that; it's really the 'goals per minute' that I'm after. "
821,Run/Run Out with dropped bat,"If a batsman drops his bat while running, and crosses the crease without it - does his team still get a run?  Similarly, if he makes it passed the crease, if the fielding team hits the wickets, is he out since he does not have all his equipment? "
822,How is a batsman not out when the wicket is put down and they don't have their bat or body grounded inside the crease?,"When running between the wickets, a batsman may be run out if they haven't ""made their ground"" before a fielder throws the ball, or uses their hand holding the ball, to dislodge the bails. Effectively the batsman has to be behind the crease.  However I recently watched a match where a batsman didn't have anything on the ground behind the crease when the wicket was put down, but they were given not out and then continued batting.  What's the story behind this non-wicket? Was the umpire wrong or have the laws changed? "
823,Target size for compound archers,"I want to shoot targets of the size used in competitions with my compound bow. How big are these?  I wasn't able to find any reliable information online. When     The more highly the Bow Weight, is the flight curve of the arrow all the flatter. This is very important with the long haul distances. Beginners must lead itself to the high Bow Weights slowly near.   is the language used, I have a hard time believing the source.  Finding information about what recurve archers shoot at is easy as it's an Olympic discipline. But a 122 cm target at 70 m is absolutely ridiculous for compounds.  The only statement from a reputable source (in proper English) I was able to find is:     The compound target is 80cm in diameter with a 10 ring 8cm in diameter. In international competition, compound targets only include the yellow, red and blue rings. This is to reduce the size of target mat needed for each target face, in order that each athlete has their own target to shoot at.   ([website]Is this information correct? Does the outer blue ring have a diameter of 80 cm or would the outer white ring have a diameter of 80 cm if it was there?    Edit:  After reading World Archery's statement again, I noticed that I should be able to figure this out given the information and graphics they provide on the page I linked to.  I measured the 10 ring of the ""target center"" graphic to be 86 px in diameter and the outer blue ring to be 516 px in diameter.  10 cm / (86 px) * 516 cm = 60 cm  So under the assumption that they are referring to only the ""target center"" when stating that ""[the] compound target is 80cm in diameter"", this leads to a contradiction because 60 cm ≠ 80 cm.  But on the full FITA target they provided, I measured the 10 ring to be 91 px in diameter and the 1 ring to be 905 px in diameter.  10 cm / (91 px) * 905 px = 99.45 cm  This again leads to a contradiction because 99.45 cm ≠ 80 cm.  So even though the information seems to stem from a reputable source, it's ambiguous, has only two interpretations, and both of them contradict other information presented on the same page. "
824,Does the change to the grounding law apply to stumping?,"Does the adjustment to the grounding law - that the bat bouncing up will no longer result in a run out, if you don't change your line - apply to stumpings?  I often see a wicket keeper hesitate, hoping that the batsman will lift his/her foot from behind the crease. Does this still apply, or does the batsman have to move out of his/her crease along the pitch line? "
825,"American billards, foul in last ball (black)","I searched a lot about last ball fouls, but I couldnt conclude any answers.  I got two scenarios:   If only black ball remains and Player A fouls, what does Player B do?   Can player B do free-shot? I mean, place the ball anywhere on the table? Must player B place the ball anywhere before the starting line? And can he shoot the black ball directly? What if the black ball is also in the starting line area? Must he shoot to the other lane before touching black ball?  What if Player A has some balls and Player B doesnt, and its Player A's turn. For the scenarios in the 1. item, he can gain advantage by fouling?  "
826,Can football players be penalised for an action against a teammate that is normally a foul if done to the opponent?,I saw this video of a player slide tackling his teammate.   What are the rules on players tackling their own teammates like that?   Would it just be to show fair play and kick the ball out to treat the player? 
827,"When making weights, why are some MMA fighters sometimes below the weight limit?","When making weights, why are some MMA fighters sometimes below the weight limit? i.e., why not stopping the weight cut when the weight limit (upper bound) is reached?  E.g., looking at this mmajunkie.com article (mirror):     MAIN CARD (Pay-per-view, 10 p.m. ET)         Champ Cris Cyborg (145) vs. Holly Holm (144) – for women’s featherweight title   Edson Barboza (155) vs. Khabib Nurmagomedov (155.5)   Marc Diakiese (155.5) vs. Dan Hooker (155.5)   Cynthia Calvillo (116) vs. Carla Esparza (115.5)   Carlos Condit (170.5) vs. Neil Magny (170.5)         PRELIMINARY CARD (FS1, 8 p.m. ET)         Michal Oleksiejczuk (203.5) vs. Khalil Rountree (205)   Rick Glenn (145.5) vs. Myles Jury (146)   Omari Akhmedov (185.5) vs. Marvin Vettori (185.5)   Matheus Nicolau (125.5) vs. Louis Smolka (125.5)         PRELIMINARY CARD (UFC Fight Pass, 7:30 p.m. ET)         Mark De La Rosa (135.5) vs. Tim Elliott (135)     "

829,Is holding the wall or bouncing up off the bottom legal in water polo?,"Is it okay to hold the edge of the pool or touch the bottom of the pool during a game of water polo?  The pool I will play in is 2 metres deep and I'm 1.89 metres tall so that's why I thought of the bottom.  I read that it's illegal to push off the wall, which is fine because that gives you an advantage. Is it okay to hold on to it if you're just tired?  This isn't really a very high level of competition either, if that makes a difference. "
830,Fielders catching foul balls in the air not coming down on field,"Does a fielder who catches a foul ball in the air have to land in the field of play? I.E. when player chases a foul flyball, then catches ball leaping and landing in seats/dugout... Out or Foul ball ? "
831,Little League Baseball Question,"Question on a game I watched: Ages 8-11  2 Outs, runner on 3rd and 1st. Coach wouldn't let the runner on 1st steal- Why not? It didn't make any sense to me; as it would have put 2 in scoring position and if the catcher had thrown to 2nd the 3rd baserunner could have scored? Seems like a fundamental to teach the players and it wasn't used.  "
832,How are matches decided in Laver cup?,"The Laver Cup takes place every year between 6 players from Europe (plus a substitute) and 6 from the rest of the World (plus a substitute).   They play three singles and a double every day for three consecutive days, however, I do not understand how matches are selected since clearly it is not the case that each player plays everybody else on the other team.   The official site only says: Each player competes in at least one singles match during the first two days, No player can play singles more than twice during the three days. At least four of the six players must play doubles. No doubles combination is played more than once, unless for the Decider on Day 3, if points are 12:12.   But some players play once, some twice, some three times and some 4 times (2 singles and 2 doubles). How is that decided? By the captains or is there some rule? The site adds: Match-ups are determined through the exchange of line-up cards by the captains., so do they decide the players separately and then see how they match up (i.e. Captain 1 says, e.g., today Federer will play game 1, Nadal game 2, Thiem game 3, while captain 2 says: Del Potro will play game 1, Isner game 2 and Querrey game 3, so the matches are Federer-Del Potro, Nadal-Isner, Thiem-Querrey)? "
833,Why are referees suddenly caring so much whether or no goalkeeper have a feet on the line during a penalty kick?,"Last Monday, during the female World cup, Nigerian Goalkeeper defended a penalty kick at the 75 minute mark only for it to be retaken due to the fact that she did not have her feet on the goal line as the shot was taken. Due to this, France went on to retake the penalty, score a goal, and win the match.  Nevertheless, last year, during the Denmark vs Croatia game, at the second half of the extra time, Denmark's goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel defended a penalty against Luka Modrić. And yet, if we see this image , it's pretty obvious that the goalkeeper does not have a single feet on the goal line. Shouldn't the penalty be retaken? Why did nothing happen here? And why are the referees so adamant about this rule in the female world cup? "
834,"In the NBA, why do teams spend all their money available?","It seems to me that if an NBA team has an annual salary cap of, say, 100 million, set by league rules, then the team acquires players until they can spend all 100 million for the year -- some teams go over the cap and pay a penalty tax for doing so.  Why does a team spend all 100 million, particularly if it's a team that's widely considered to not contend for the championship?   Why not spend, say, 80 million, and save 20 million, if the championship title is not in the cards for a team anyway? "
835,"What's going on in a Rugby Union ""choke tackle""?","A player with the ball is tackled, and rather than being brought to the ground, he is held up by the tackler(s).   The referee shouts ""Maul"" and then awards a scrum to the defending team.  What exactly is happening here? Why is this considered a maul, and why does that mean it's a scrum to the defenders (as opposed to the more conventional mauls)? "
836,Bouldering “zone”,"I’ve recently got into bouldering and been watching a lot of world championships.  I understand how the “zone” hold is used when you don’t top a Boulder but I have seen a couple of things mentioned that I’m curious about.   There was an appeal against someone getting the zone on their first attempt and it was moved to their second attempt. But they had topped the boulder anyway. So, does that change have any effect on them at all?! That same zone was mentioned because it was in an awkward position and they said they had to use it with their hand not their foot. What would happen if they topped the boulder without using the zone hold? Does that count against them?  "
837,Grass tennis compared to hard court,What are the differences between playing tennis on grass compared to hard courts? What adjustments do professional tennis players make for grass court season? 
838,"Is the 4-minute mile still the ""highest"" standard?","When I ran track in high school, many years ago now, we learned that the 4-minute mile was the ultimate dream goal for many mile runners.  Is the 4-minute mile still the ""highest"" standard?  Has the timing now dipped to, say, 3.5 minutes, with more advanced training, nutrition, and sports doctors? "
839,UFC rules on passive fighting,"In UFC Fight Night 111 in Singapore between Holm and Correia it was a very defensive, tactical fight. In the third round the referee said to both fighters ""I understand your game plan but we have to get something going here"". In other words he was saying ""you both aren't attacking enough"".   That to me raises some interesting questions: [1] is this the limit to what the referee can do under UFC rules? [2] If both fighters just kept standing off what could he do? Especially with both fighters doing it. Does he have the power to stop the fight and declare a no contest or draw because it's so passive?  "
840,What would happen in Formula 1 if a stateless person wins a Grand Prix?,There are about 12 million stateless people on Earth. What would happen if one of them wins a Formula 1 Grand Prix? What anthem gets played? 
841,Why was D'Angelo Russell underpaid during this free agency?,Why was D'Angelo Russell underpaid during this free agency?  Kevin Durant signed with the Nets for 164 million. Kyrie Irving signed with the Nets for 140 million. Russell is only sign-and-trading away from the Nets to the Warriors for 117 million.   Stephen A. Smith says it was because D'Lo was busted for smoking weed. Is this true? Or are there other factors as to why D'Lo didn't get his money? 
842,Is it possible for a tennis match to last forever?,"I ask this because in 2018 John Isner and Kevin Anderson had a set that latest for 50 games in one set. And in 2010, John Isner and Nicolas Mahut had a set lasting 138 games.  I understand that to win a set you must win by 2 games. So is it possible for a tennis match to actually last forever if the winner of a game kept alternating each game? Or is there a time/score limit where the officials call it? "

844,Where does the NBA league revenue come from?,"I hear approximately of numbers such as 6 billion in annual NBA league revenue, of which 3 billion goes to team owners, and 3 billion goes to the players -- creating a wealthy ""middle class"" of NBA players, after a cap is implemented on the ""max players"".  Where does the 6 billion revenue come from?  Tv commercials?  Jersey sales?  International tv commercials, eg, commercials in China during games?  What about ticket sales? For instance, Oracle Arena sells out every home game -- do the Warriors team owners have to share ticket revenues with the league?  (I would guess so, since it takes two teams to put on a great game ... so the opposing teams are in a sense generating ticket sales at the Oracle ... ) "
845,Who gets the yellow trikot at a time draw - Tour de France,"Yesterday was the team time trial at the Tour de France. Team Jumbo - Visma, the team with the yellow jersey, won and the yellow stayed in their team. But it got me thinking: What would have happened if, let's say Team Ineos would have won, who would have gotten the yellow jersey, since they all had the same time after the first day. Would the one who drove over the finish line first or the first one in the alphabet get the yellow jersey? What is the rule in this situation? "
846,How is lucky loser decided in WTA tournaments?,"Lucky loser used to be chosen as the highest ranked players among unsuccessful finalist of qualifying competition. Not so long ago ATP changed this rule in such way that lucky loser is chosen randomly from the highest ranked finalists. (Which means that no player can be sure that he will be lucky loser.) See, for example, here.  What are the rules for WTA tournaments? Is there a draw among highest ranked players  - as in ATP tournaments - or does the WTA still use the old system, i.e., the highest ranked finalist is automatically lucky loser (if there is a spot available). "
847,"Has a ""lucky loser"" ever won an ATP or WTA tournament?","This question made me wonder if a ""lucky loser"" has ever won a big tournament (ATP, WTA etc.)? If it has happened, is there some kind of overview of all the players that did so? "
848,Main differences in Mavis shuttlecocks," What are the main differences of Yonex Mavis 350, 370 and 2000 plastic shuttlecocks? Every type has nylon in two colours: white and yellow, what is the purpose of this? It says that Mavis 2000 series have the closest resemblance to feathers, but which type to which type, meaning:    green 2000 equivalent to Yonex feather,  blue 2000 to Yonex feather and  red 2000 to Yonex feather.   "
849,it is required to add an overgrip on a Fischer sorb tack,"Recently, I have bought a Fischer racket ( it doesn't matter which type ).  It has a very nice sorb tack ( like a grip ), very firm, really nice to be touch.  I was wondering if it is necessary to buy some overgrips to put over this sorb tack?  Will it reduce the firmness of the sorb tack? Will it offer me some advantages? "
850,What is this (basketball) statistic called?,"Personally, I am interested in a player's personal contribution to the game. Therefore, I want to compare the team's performance when he is on the field versus when he is not on the field. I believe that it originates from basketball, but it can obviously be extended to other sports.  Example  Suppose a player plays 12 minutes out of a 48 minutes NBA match. In the time he is on the field, the score is 25-20 for his team. In the other 36 minutes, the score is 70-70. So, his team is performing '5 points better per 12 minutes' when he is on the field. After rescaling to full match time, the statistic would be +20 for this player in this hypothetical match.  Question  Is there a statistic that describes this effect or any one closely related? If not, could you explain why this statistic is not of interest? Personally, I think it says a lot about a player that cannot be counted explicitly, for example defensive positioning. "
851,Which edition of rankings is used for which purpose on Grand Slam tournaments?,"Rankings are used for several purposes:   Players in entry list for main draw and for qualification are ordered based on ranking. In entry list a cut-off is made to decide which players go directly into main draw. Seeding in qualification is based on ranking. Seeding in the actual tournament is based on ranking.   (See also How do tennis players get into tournaments?)  Qualifying starts earlier than main tournament. Players sign in for a tournament even earlier. It seems that different version of rankings are used for these purposes.  For example, this years French Open starts on May 24. I do not have any official source, but I have read on some fora that ranking from April 13 were used for the entry list, ranking from May 11 are used for deciding seeds in qualifying and rankings from May 18 are going to be used to decide seeded players in the main draw.     Are there some general rules which decide which edition of rankings is used for which purposes? For example, is the ranking for entry list always the ranking 6 weeks before the tournament? Is the ranking used to decide seeds always the ranking one week before the tournament?   Maybe there are some differences between Grand Slams, ATP Tournaments, WTA Tournaments and lover level competitions. Therefore I am asking mainly about Grand Slams. (But it would be also interesting to know whether rules for other tournaments are similar.) "
852,"Which came first: Boston Bruins, or UCLA Bruins?","The name, ""Bruin"".  And is it reasonable to assume the first had some influence on the naming of the second?  (Or is there a Bruin sports team that predates both?) "
853,What is the oldest professional sports team in North America?,"Is there a team out there still in existence (that paid its players as professionals) before the Cincinnati Red Stockings of 1869?  (I suppose there was nothing happening professionally earlier in South America, so the title really should be in “The Americas” - no?)  Note: the original Cincinnati Red Stockings of 1869 were professional, but were “barn stormers”, traveling around as a kind of traveling circus, selling tickets and playing locals.  They were 57-0.  That team eventually became the MLB Cincinnati Reds, however, four of the team's players moved to Boston and started a team called the Boston Red Stockings, who changed their name to the Beaneaters, then to the Braves.  Then moved to Milwaukee in 1953, and then Atlanta in 1966.  So the MLB Atlanta Braves also have a kind of secondary claim, since I think one of those four players was the manager of the 1869 team mentioned above – so I'm not sure who “retained rights” of that well documented first (?) professional team.  (Or is there an earlier professional team in another sport?)  Online articles talk about such things within baseball, but I'm asking this about all of sports.  When I was growing up everyone said the Chicago Cubs were the oldest, but I'm just finding all this out now about these other teams.  Maybe someone can reference an article that sorts all this out, and ultimately can definitively answer the question as worded. "
854,Is this Ball or Balk?,If a pitcher is in the wind-up and the ball falls forward out of his hand towards home plate during the pitch is it a ball? or a balk? 
855,Why are pace-setters allowed to go ahead with the race?,"Pace-setters:       Pacemakers may be used to avoid the tactics of deception that are possible in competition by those who, for example, race away from the start line (and are likely to subsequently slow down), giving the other runners the impression that they are far behind.      If they are allowed to continue beyond the point where they had to drop off, they are going aginst the above logic.    How does it help prevent tactics of deception if they race away during the start and then, also allowed to finish it/win it?     An example:      Kenya’s Virginia Nyamburu caused possibly the biggest upset of the night as she started the women’s 3000m steeplechase as a pacemaker but, after leading the field through to the agreed 2000m point, carried on going to win in 9:21.51.      Why are pace-setters allowed to go ahead with the race? "
856,Skills and tennis surface?,How can a tennis player use his skills in his favor on the different surfaces of play?  I mean    Is a powerful player favourite on grass/hard/clay ? Is a technical player favourite on grass/hard/clay ? Is a quick player favourite on grass/hard/clay ?  
857,Why are the teams in NBA's Western Conference outperforming those in the Eastern Conference?,"In the NBA, the West has been the stronger conference over the past decade or two as the graph below shows. The difference between the conferences is usually evident in the playoffs and in the All-Star games. Why is this so? Is it because the teams in the West can afford to pay more or are there other reasons?   "
858,Climber rankings at Tour de France - must the winner finish the tour?,What if a few (2/3) stages to the end of the Tour de France a cyclist retires when he had a number of points that would make it mathematically unreachable by other cyclists in the climber ranking?     Does he win the climber rankings or is it necessary to arrive to Champ Elysee?  
859,Are T20 Cricket games always played to the last ball?,"Is there a point in a T20 match in which the losing team is mathematically eliminated (ie, no possibility of winning the match), and if so does the game end at that point?  For example, Team A bats first, and scores 150-4 in their 20 overs.  Team B's innings starts, and in the first 19 overs, they only score 110-4.  In the remaining over, even if every bowl resulted in a 6, Team B would only end up with 146-4.  So does the match end at the point when Team B can no longer mathematically win the game, or do they play out all 20 overs (or 10 wickets), regardless of the current score?  (Or do I misunderstand the rules and it's possible to score more than 36 runs in an over, somehow?) "
860,What if a shot going for 4 interfered by the spectators in cricket game?,"This actually happened to the recent club cricket game that I played last week. We needed 6 runs off 11 balls and had 3 wickets in hand. One of the batsman played a shot and ball was rolling slowly towards the boundary line, all of a sudden a kid (age ~7) took about 10 steps into the ground and tried to grab the ball but it went over him hit something and jumped not reaching the boundary line. Since kid made the interference batsman and umpire lost sight of the ball and they (batsmen) did not finish the third run wondering if the ball was caught by the kid or went to the boundary line. Meanwhile, fielder chasing the ball continued running and pick up the ball, threw it back to the keeper and they made an appeal for the run-out.   Now, fielding side wanted the run out and batting side wanted the penalty 5 runs or to keep 2 runs which occurred before the interference or even redo the ball/delivery.   Umpire decided to play ""fair"" so he split the points (5 each) and called it ""everyone won"". Fielding side took this decision promptly and happily and quickly started packing while the batting side wasn't happy with the decision.   Now I wanna know, did the umpire made the right call? What are the rules/law for such cases?  "
861,A False Out Call by an Umpire,"Situation: runners at second and third, no outs. A line drive gets caught by the short stop, who throws to third base to try and get a double play.  The runner at third is called safe. However, the runner thinks he is called out and starts jogging off the field. The third baseman throws the ball to the pitcher. The pitcher then throws the ball back to the third baseman who steps on third base. The field umpire signals out.  The runner who was originally called safe (and then out) gets as far as the on-deck circle of the first base dugout before his teammates tell him to go back and touch home plate.  The runner comes back and touches home plate. The home plate umpire calls him safe at home and the run scores. Is this a legal run?  I realize that the runner was essentially tagging up, and when the umpire signaled out, it was the wrong call. However, after the runner was signaled out the catcher figured him to be out and therefore allowed the runner to come back and touch home plate.  What should happen when an umpire make a false out call such as this? It is deceptive to the defense; it seems that the runner should have to go back to third at the very least. "
862,How would a manager use a starter and reliever differently in an All-Star game?,"In a ""regular"" game, a starter pitches ""several"" innings while a reliever pitches one or two.  But in the All Star game, ""all"" pitchers pitch only one to two innings. So what has historically been the difference between the way managers have used starters versus relievers in such a game? For instance, has it been the case that only starters will get to pitch even two innings? "
863,"A batter overruns first base, but misses the bag. Is then tagged out. Does the runner on 3rd score?","Here's something that happened at a game recently and I can't find the answer to it: 2 outs, runner on 3rd. Batter hits a slow roller to third. The third baseman picks it up but makes a bad throw to first, pulling the first baseman off the bag.   The batter-runner runs right over the bag, never touching the base.   The runner on third has now crossed the plate. The first baseman sees that the runner missed the bag and tags the runner as he is walking back to the base. Runner is out.   But does the run score? The umpire ruled that he did not score.   I've read that a runner cannot score on a third out unless the batter reaches first safely. But I've also read that the umpire should have called the batter-runner safe at first when he crossed base (even though he didn't touch it) as it gives an un-fair advantage to not make any call at all. I've seen this in the MLB, so I'm pretty sure that's true. If the runner is initially safe at first, then that means the run does in fact score. Any idea? "
864,Soccer players with over 100 international goals (IFFHS definition),"Who are the soccer players with the most international goals? The international goal definition used is the one from IFFHS (international goals in national team + international goals in club) and not the one used by RSSSF who count international goals as those made in the national team only . This is a (incomplete) list that I've been making, but it is probably incomplete because players from Asian and Arabian leagues are hard to track and it could have some mistakes, plus it becomes outdated quickly since players such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi, Ibrahimovic keep scoring international goals. Is there any other players with more than 100 international goals I have not found?  1  Cristiano Ronaldo  POR 158 2  Lionel Messi       ARG 146 3  Gerd Muller        GER 138 4  Puskas             HUN 126 5  Ali Daei           IRN 122 6  Raúl               ESP 119 7  Didier Drogba      CDM 115    Andriy Shevchenko  UCR 115 9  Zlatan Ibrahimovic SUE 113 10 Ronaldo            BRA 111 11 Thierry Henry      FRA 110 12 Hossam Hassan      ARA 109 13 Romario            BRA 105 14 Samuel Etoo        CAM 104 15 Pelé               BRA 101    Miroslav Klose     GER 101  "
865,Are these two NFL rules overlapping?,"I read two rules quoted on this website that seems to overlap:  Rule 5, Section 1, Article 1:     The game is played by two teams of 11 players each. If a snap, free   kick, or fair-catch kick is made while a team has fewer than 11   players on the field of play or the end zone, the ball is in play, and   there is no penalty.   Section 5 Position of Players at the Snap, Article 1: Offensive Team     The offensive team must be in compliance   with the following at the snap:      (a) It must have seven or more players on its line (3-18); and      (b) All players who are not on the line, other than the receiver of   the snap under center, must be at least one yard behind it.      (c) No player may be out of bounds.   The first one says that the play can possibly start without all the players within the bounds. The second one says that the formation is considered illegal (penalty) if a player is out of bound.  The question is : what is the difference between an ""out of bound"" player and a player who is not part of the play to begin with ?  Moreover, it must have seven or more players on the line but the first rule implies that it is possible to have less than 7 players so it is another contradiction.  Is that a real overlap or I am missing something here ? "
866,What is the record for greatest number of athletes with the same finish time in one event?,"On Sunday 10 July 2016 at the European Athletics Championships in Amsterdam, three athletes in the men's 5000m final finished with exactly the same time of 13:40:85 (a fourth arrived only a hundredth of a second later!).  What is the record for the greatest number of athletes finishing with the same time?  I would like to limit the reply to international running events where the athletes start at the same time (i.e. not considering heats of athletes for the same event).   "
867,Black Crumb Nuisance,"Every Sunday I play five a side football at the local 3G pitches. Every Sunday I bring home hundreds if not thousands of the small black bits used to fill the pitch. This in itself is a nightmare, however recently I've also started developing blisters as a result of these little black bits ending up inside my boots.  I often stop during play now to empty my boots, however this is both time consuming and annoying.  Does anyone else experience this? If so any advice on how to avoid this? "

869,Why are pitcher's mounds higher than the rest of the baseball field?,"On softball fields, the pitcher's ""mound"" appears flat. However, on baseball fields, the pitcher's mound is a mound. MLB Official Rules state (Rule 1.04, in part):     The pitcher’s plate shall be 10 inches above the level of home plate.   Why are pitcher's mounds higher than the rest of the baseball field? What noticeable differences do pitchers (and hitters, if applicable) experience between a flat surface and a mound?   "
870,Cricket bat with bent handle?,"About 10 years ago, I read an article in (possibly) the now defunct Cricket Talk magazine, about a guy in Australia who built cricket bats with bent handles. The bent handle helped keep the ball down when driving, because the face of the bat was naturally angled downwards. Supposedly, a batsman in the Australian domestic shield (perhaps Simon Katich), even used it to make a century.  What became of this bat design? Is it legal? If it is, why isn't it more widely used? Did such a bat ever exist at all?  Sorry there are no references...like I said, this is an article in an out-of-print magazine that I'm now recalling from memory. "
871,Football player backing into another to receive a high kick,"Is it a foul in football if the ball is kicked up in the air towards two opposing players, and the one in front is backing into the one behind in readiness for the ball arriving?  If the player behind puts out a straight arm to stop the other backing into him is this a foul? Even if he doesn't push the other player, but just keeps his arm straight? "
872,"In what way do professional athletes (MLB, NHL, NFL, NBA) get paid?","I've always wondered how this worked. If a player is getting paid $5,000,000 a year, how do they get that salary? Do they receive it at the beginning of the season as a lump sum? Or do they receive payments weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly? Do they get paid during the off season? "
873,Has the practice of retiring numbers ever become a problem?,"Some professional sports teams retire numbers in honor of exceptional players.  If practiced frequently enough by an old team, such a practice would be unsustainable.  You'd run out of numbers.  More mildly, you might need to allocate a specific number to someone like Chad Ochocinco.  Has the practice of retiring numbers ever created a significant problem for a major league sports team?  How do they work around it? "
874,What exactly are player performance bonuses?,"This term was brought up in another question. I know that players can receive signing bonuses etc. But can they receive performance bonuses in a salary capped league? To my knowledge, in the NHL for example, any money given to a player other than his regular salary is not allowed because it is a way to get around the NHL's salary cap. With that being said, how are performance bonuses handed out and in which sports? "
875,Racing jibe in windsurfing,How to do a racing jibe in windsurfing ? What is the better type of sail to try to do is first racing jibe (wave sail or slalom sail) ?  You can see a video of the professional windsurfer Anders Bringdal here.  Waves sail pro:   strong maneuvrability   Waves sail cons:   heavy   Slalom sail pro   stable accelerate in the gust   Slalom sail cons   fragility less maneuverability.  
876,Does the Duckworth–Lewis method work correctly for all matches?,"D/L method is commonly used for limited over matches. Does it work fine?  The opening players didn't know it would rain that day, so they defend to stand for 20 to 25 overs; then how is it correct for deciding the victory by this? Some teams may have aggressive players in the bottom order, so we can't judge by losing 6 or 7 wickets.  Some other teams mostly depend on one or more star players; if the bowling side tried hard to pick them at the last stage, then the D/L method will give the victory to the batting side.  Is this method the only choice for the cricket officials? "
877,How often do tires need to be changed in Kart Racing?,We are new to karting and are renting a Kart for Racing. Our fee does not include new tires this is something we must pay for if we want to provide new tires.  The existing rear/front tires we use a device to heat scrape off any debris before the next race.  The person we are renting from says we should replace the front tires in a few more weekends. (each weekend has 4 races) The tires on the Kart now are not new.  We know that tires are expensive 200.00 a pair but want our child to be safe.  How do we know when to replace?  So we want to know when is the right time to replace. Can we tell by looking? or is it more something our son can tell while racing.  The track is a track that is set up in a parking lot so it has a lot of bumps and is not a normal smooth maintained race track. (although they do blow debris off  before the racing begins) 
878,"When a QB slides, is it considered a dead ball?","I was watching the Niners-Lions game last week and saw something that has me a little confused. I was under the impression that when a quarterback slides in the NFL, the play is considered dead when the player hits the ground. In this video, 49er QB Alex Smith starts sliding and then is hit. I know the timing is really close, but it seems like the defender (safety John Wendling) moved after Smith was already going down. In the instance that a player is hit after the play is dead, I thought there was supposed to be a penalty like unnecessary roughness. I haven't been able to find a rule about QB slides anywhere, except some speculation on it.   First, is the play dead after a QB slides, regardless of whether he is hit? Second, if it is dead on the slide, is there a penalty for hitting the QB after the slide? "
879,How are IPL players paid?,"In the Indian Premier League, the players are auctioned to the different teams and their salaries depends on the auction amount. But who pays them, does the IPL administration pay them or do the team owners pay them?   If they are paid by the team owners, can the owners decide to increase or decrease their salaries later? "
880,By what rule was the Fail Mary pass in the 2012 Packers/Seahawks game a touchdown?,"There was a call at the end of the 2012 Green Bay/Seattle game in which a play which appeared to result in an interception was ruled a touchdown.  The controversy surrounding the referee lockout adds to the confusion, and because of how chaotic the catch was, it's hard to understand what actually happened.  By what rule was this play ruled a touchdown?  Is there compelling evidence that, by rule, the play should have been an interception? "
881,Does the defense have to defend the extra point?,"At the end of the controversial Green Bay Packers/Seattle Seahawks game on Monday night, the Seahawks were awarded a touchdown as time expired that gave them a 13-12 point lead. In the ensuing confusion of the referee's decision, the Green Bay Packers left the field. Eventually, the referees had the Seahawks and the Packers come back and line up for the (meaningless) extra point play, and then the game was over.  Did the Green Bay Packers have to defend that? It seems like the Seahawks could have run that play without the defense if the referees set the ball down and started the play clock. Is there a minimum number of defensive players that have to be on the field for a play to be run? "

883,"When playing ice hockey and giving a pass at the blue line, who should go first?","I didin't know how to clearly express my question, so here are a few explanation.  I'm currently playing in a small hockey club at a quite low level, and we always do this exercise where all the players are at one end of the rink (where the pucks are on the picture). One player on each side rushes to the blue line, only one having the puck. Then, each one crosses the other one behind the blue line, and the one who holds the puck gives it to the other one. Then, they enter the zone and shoot on the goalie. This exercise takes place on only one half of the rink. We often do this at warmup before a play.  So, my question is : which one of the two guys should be the closest to the attack zone when crossing the other one? The puck holder? The receiver?  On the picture, should 1 give it to 2 and wait a bit to avoid an offside, or should 2 give it to 1 for him to enter the zone quickly?  When we play, some say option #1, others say option #2, and it ends up in big ""hugs"" at the blue line, when we bump into each other. ;)    Sorry for my poor english... "
884,Does a cracked carbon fiber rib protector lose its effectiveness?,"For karting, many drivers wear a carbon-fiber rib protector such as K1 Race Gear Carbon Fiber Racing Rib Vest.  Does such a vest lose its effectiveness in protecting your ribs when the carbon fiber becomes cracked? If so, how much does it lose, e.g. should it be thrown out and a new one purchased? "
885,Tennis shots with back towards the opponent?,"A shot with back to opponent is difficult and can injure wrist while turning torso towards opponent or hit leg/knee.

886,How to do whirlpool shot in football (soccer)?,"Drama     I was the only guy in the defence line in a free kick when opponent placed his ball. The opponent had massive leg muscles and he was far taller than me. He scored a goal I have never seen in any football game ever, it barely touched the top of my hairs when I tried to hit the ball back with my head. The flight path of the ball was like a whirlpool: it rised just over me, it spinned to the left, it then went down and then again up so that goaltender was totally flabbergasted by the rapid change in the movements of the ball. For me, it looked like a whirlpool shot due to the whirlpool flight path.   I have tried to understand this shot now years later through golf-tennis terminology. The ball changed direction two times so it must have had:   topspin for changing the direction first time from up to bottom and  sidespin from right to left  second turn from left to right: how?!   now I haven't been able to repeat this shot, neither with a golf club nor tennis racket. Even physically it is hard for me comprehend it.     How can you do a whirlpool shot in football?  "

888,Batter delay of game,"Why is the batter allowed to wander in and out of the box? Doesn't this amount to delay of the game?  The pitcher has 12 seconds to throw the ball after he receives it from the catcher. Apparently he has to wait until the batter feels like getting ready to hit the ball. The umpire has control of this situation.  He can say ""ball"" if everybody takes too long.  Today I watched a batter walk 10 feet away from the box after swinging at a pitch. The catcher is supposed to throw the ball back to the pitcher as soon as possible. There is a baseball rule book. What good is that? "
889,Does a carbon fiber seat help karting performance and protect ribs?,"I found a karting seat that is made from carbon-fiber here:   [website]On that page, it claims:     To Improve Performance:   The Ribtect seat helps the chassis and driver to work better. Keeping the kart rolling free and providing a better launch out of the turns. Connecting more of the kart to the driver for a better feel of the chassis. Lowering the fatigue level of the driver, allowing for better concentration and improved consistency and lower lap times.      To Prevent Rib Injury:   The Ribtect Seat is designed to reduce the amount of rib injuries to karters. Thus, keeping more people involved and happy with the great sport of karting.   I'm wondering if these claims are significant?  Does such a seat provide a significant benefit to rib protection as compared to using a good vest like this one?  Does such a seat provide any significant performance benefit (e.g. more than 0.25% faster) in outdoor karting such as at Sonoma raceway for a driver near the top of the field in Senior Rotax? "
890,How many times Olympics gold medal winner goalies faced in the NHL playoffs?,"Montreal Canadiens and New York Rangers will be playing in the eastern conference playoffs of the NHL starting this Saturday (2013-2014 season). I was watching TSN tonight and it was brought up that the goalies for both teams have won the gold medal in the Olympics, which I hadn't noticed till then. Carey Price won it this year (2014) at Sochi and Henrik Lundqvist did so at Turin in 2006. Price beat Lundqvist in to win gold.  Now I'm wondering how many gold medalist goalies have met in the NHL playoffs? And how many times the goalies who met in the Olympics final also met in the playoffs in the same year? can you also provide the list including the year and the players for both question. "
891,"How does the referee communicate with players in football(soccer) matches, when they are from different countries?","I always see in TV referees communicating with the players in international football matches(both club and national competitions). It seems to be universal: not only in European matches, but also in Asian matches and World Cup etc. However something I don't really get is how are they supposed to communicate at all if they don't speak the same language.   I can only suppose that in this case, there exists a default lingua franca for communication, for example English, and all players more or less understand some basics of this language. (which would not be easy for professional sports players, and it's even more amazing that they can seem able to talk incessantly). If so, is it somehow specified as a rule, or just more of a custom?  Or, as an alternative, is there actually only the captain, or the few players who share languages in common with the referee doing the talking, while others express themselves more by body expressions and translation through the captain etc.?  Are international football referees (supposed to be &amp; in reality) multilingual? "
892,What's the maximum number of games at the playoff phase in NBA?,"I was checking out the playoff bracket the other day and I realised that a significant number of the games (in the first round) went up to the 7th game. Considering that there are 15 series in total x 7 matches the theoretical maximum is 105 matches. (In parallel with that, the theoretical minimum would be 15 x 4 = 60 matches).   Doing a quick calculation, I noticed that so far 72 games were played with 3 match-ups remaining.  So re-iterating my questions:   In what year were the most number of NBA playoff games played?  How many total games were played during that year's playoffs?   EDIT: Now that the 2014 playoffs are over, the total number of games has turned out to be 89 (if I am not mistaken). "

But when it comes to Grand Slams, the Men play 5 sets. At the risk of sounding a misogynist, I always believe the reason to be strength &amp; endurance. After all, a 5 set EPIC match lasts 5 hours while a 3 set EPIC last 3 hours.    Is that the only reason. Or am I a naive misogynist? Also was that the case since the history of Grand Slams or did Men play 3 sets before? "

(It sounds like he's announcing from a toilet seat, and occasionally trying to squeeze one out while speaking.)      And just the whole English boarding-school thing in general, when they are forcing it with stilted pronunciations.  David Croft (Sky Formula 1) Ted Kravitz and Simone Lazenby – are the worst.  Ponce hipster central.  Crofty has this nervous tick.  He says “nOWW” too often for no good reason; other than to make himself sound posh. ([website]     That said: Jack Burnicle and James Whitham are great – and happen to be English and have their own more natural affectations.  Right and proper Yorkshire, I believe.

902,Where is the lower limit for a (baseball) strike?,"Yesterday, watching the Pirates-Mets game, I saw the Pirates' Andrew McCutchen called out on a third strike. The pitched ball was clearly over the plate, but ""low."" IMHO, it should, or at least could, have been called a ball.  In addition to being over the plate, the pitched ball must fall between the players' shoulders and knees. It was the ""knees"" part that confused me.  I was taught that ""at the knees"" meant at the level of kneeCAPS. Is that too high; that is, is there a definition of ""knees"" that is lower than the kneecaps?  Is it true that umpires have been informally expanding the strike zone, so that almost anything that is ""over the plate"" is called a strike as long as it is not in the dirt, even though it's technically ""below the knees"" (basically at the shin, as opposed to ankle, level)?  Could camera angles have caused a difference of opinion? That is, I saw a ""flat"" pitch ""below the knees"" through a TV camera, while an umpire, standing behind the plate, saw a ""sinker,"" part of which was ""barely"" at knee level? "

904,How detailed is penalty kick encroachment in football,"The laws of the game prohibit encroaching on a penalty kick whether it is an attacking player or defending player.  The keeper is supposed to remain on the line until the kick is taken but in practice this is a loose interpretation; movement off the line is common.   My question is: if another player (besides the keeper and penalty taker) has a foot on/over the line of the 18 yard box or the arc, what grounds are there for a retake or an indirect kick out?  Is it a similar loose interpretation which goes unpunished or shall it be referenced as an offside play or simply an infringement? "
905,What is fair play prize at Giro d'Italia?,"I've read that at Giro there is a Fair play prize. It is one of the minor classifications.   It is mentioned, for example, in the Wikipedia article on this year's Giro. However, not much details are given there and information about minor classification is marked as ""citation needed"". (Here is link to the current revision if that article. It says that: Teams also take part in the Fair Play classification where teams are given penalty points for minor technical infringements.)  I would like to find out more about this award. Based on which criteria are points in this classification given?   Are there similar awards in other Grand Tours (or other stage races)? "
906,How steep a hill does a low seeded (tennis) player have to climb?,"It was shocking, but a low seeded player ousted Number 2 seeded Li Na in the first (women's) round of the French Open.  My understanding is that the seeding is designed to prevent this from happening so early. For instance, in a field of 128, the top seed is matched against the 128th seed in the first round, the number 2 against the 127th, etc. The idea in the first round is to eliminate the bottom 64 players, and most of the ""survivors"" will be seeded 1-64.  Given that Kristina Mladenovic eliminated Li Na, it's unlikely that she's really ""only"" 127. And she gets Li Na's (number 2) spot for the second round of 64, and is likely to be paired against say, the 63rd seeded player.   Would it be a reasonable guess that Mladenovic's true talent level is probably at least 50th to 100th, so that she's probably not an underdog against the number 63rd seed in the second round? Or does history show that these early round eliminations are ""flukes"" and the ""eliminator"" gets eliminated soon after? "

908,Can time of possession for the two teams of an NFL game add up to less than 60 minutes?,"In a December 13, 2015 game between the Atlanta Falcons and Carolina Panthers, the time of possession of the two teams was recorded as:  Falcons: 28:21  Panthers: 31:21  Adding these two gives a total game time of 59:42, which is 18 seconds short of a full game.

It's one second short of a full game. Another error in the data? "
909,Quarterback pass to self,"In the wild card round of the 2017-18 NFL season, Marcus Mariota, quarterback of the Tennessee Titans, made a pass to himself for a 6-yard touchdown against the Kansas City Chiefs.  This makes me wonder how many times in the history of the NFL a quarterback has made a pass to himself that resulted in positive yardage? And how many times has that resulted in a touchdown?  Please list the quarterbacks who've done this for both questions. "
910,Is there such a thing as an ineligible runner in football?,"In American football, there is such a thing as an ineligible (pass) receiver. That is, a ""lineman"" (center, guard, tackle) is not allowed to catch forward passes. Are they similarly prohibited from running with the ball? I can see two cases:  1) A ""back"" (or pass receiver) drops or fumbles the ball, a lineman picks it up and runs with it.  2) The quarterback (or runner) hands the ball to a lineman.   I see the second happening in the case of a ""quarterback sneak,"" that is, the quarterback allows the center to keep the ball and ""plunge"" for short yardage. Does this mean that a runner can hand the ball to a lineman if it is convenient? Why is this not done occasionally to ""mix things up"" if it is allowed? Or is such ""mixing things up"" something rules are designed to prevent? "
911,If Liverpool FC win the Champions League does that mean Coutinho wins it as well or if FC Barcelona win Champions league will Coutinho win it as well?,"I mean anything is possible in football and I was reading an article about how Coutinho can help FCB in terms of attacking football etc.  When I saw      With Coutinho ineligible to play in Europe for Barcelona this season, Balague says Valverde will use the rest of the domestic campaign to get him to speed in central midfield. Alongside Sergio Busquets, Ivan Rakitic and Paulinho, Coutinho will hone the defensive side of his game.   I did some research and found out since Coutinho already played for Liverpool in the UCL he cannot play under Barcelona.  So if Liverpool win Champions League would Coutinho have a Champions League medal under his belt and same with Barcelona or will it be neither and he misses out of Champions League if either team win it??  I mean he did help Liverpool and as far as UEFA are aware he already played for Liverpool and thus cannot play for Barca. "
912,Can bowler bowl with two hands (left & right) in international cricket,Recently I've seen in domestic match there was one bowler (spinner) who used his both hands while delivering the ball?  I've doubt can it be possible in International Cricket.  Does ICC has any rule about this? 
913,What's the complete rule regarding double bouncing balls inside the popping crease?,"I've been trying to figure out the possible outcomes in case a ball double bounces off the cricket pitch. I read Law 20 and Law 21. Law 20 does not reference double bounced balls. Law 21 says:     The umpire shall call and signal No ball if a ball which he/she considers to have been delivered, without having previously touched bat or person of the striker,         bounces more than once or rolls along the ground before it reaches the popping crease       But what if double bounces inside the popping crease? And then possibly stumps the batsman? Is there another rule or law regarding that?  "
914,What are the duties performed by the match officials before the start of a match?,"I understand there are these primary match officials: the referee, the umpire, the head coach, and the scorer (one from each team).   I wish to know what duties they perform before the start of the match. I knew of a few myself:   Match referee: conducts toss Umpire: checks whether the floodlighting is proper; the ball is playable; and the pitch condition is good. Scorer: checks technical equipment, and resets display of score to zero. Coach: Boosting the morale of the team? I am unsure :/   Unfortunately, they obviously aren't complete. I checked the laws and they mention the pre-match duties of only the umpire (Law 2.3 and 2.4). The laws don't go into the details of the referee or the scorers or the coach.  What are the pre-match duties of the umpire, referee, head-coach, and the scorer? "

In such a case of tangling of steps, the bowler might run-into the umpire, be swayed from his path away from the pitch, or simply fall straight onto the ground. I searched the laws but couldn't find any mention of this.  Has this ever happened before? And what is the official procedure for handling this situation? Is a no-ball given or a dead ball?  "
918,Which team is mentioned first in the score in NBA games?,"Most sports I know of (e.g. soccer) will mention the home team first; e.g. if Barcelona plays Real Madrid in Barcelona, the scoreboard will show     Barcelona - Real Madrid &nbsp; 1 - 0   both in the stadium (where the home team is often displayed above the away team) and on television, at one of the edges of the screen.  However, in my (limited) experience of watching NBA, I have often (maybe even always?) seen the away team mentioned first. Most recent example on Dutch television: a summary of Milwaukee Bucks - Golden State Warriors, played in Milwaukee; the scoreboard at the bottom (provided by ESPN) showed GS - MIL, where I expected it would be the other way around. What logic is used to determine which team is mentioned first in the score in NBA games? "
919,Is there any guideline the NFL uses to refrain from calling a penalty due to unusual celebrations or mass reactions?,"In the NFL's NFC Divisional playoff game on 2018-01-14 between Minnesota and New Orleans, Minnesota's Stephon Diggs scored a touchdown as time expired in the fourth quarter to take the lead and thus win the game.  Of course, the game does not end till the PAT is attempted.  Diggs removed and threw his helmet in jubilation.  The back judge threw a flag, presumably for unsportsmanlike conduct, but this penalty was never announced.  Why not?  The players, media, coaches, staff, and security rushed the field.  After about ten minutes, the officials were able to get everyone off the field and the Minnesota offense on the field for a PAT attempt. Why was delay-of-game not called against the Vikings?   The Saints were not there, and it took another minute or so to get eight Saints onto the field and onsides before the Vikings could snap and kneel-down.  Why was delay-of-game not called against the Saints?  The real reason is, of course, everyone had been caught up in the moment; it was an exceptional ending to the game.  Further, any penalty would have been toothless and silly.   Is there any guideline the NFL uses to withhold a penalty call due to unusual celebrations or mass reactions like this? Or, did the officials simply use their discretion to avoid a silly but correct call when it doesn't matter?  "
920,Scoring by offense on a blocked extra point,"In American football, if an extra point kick is blocked can the offense pick it up and advance it or recover it in the end zone? Would they score 1 point or two? Does it matter where the ball lands after the block (i.e., passing the line of scrimmage vs. not) before it is picked up? Is it different in the NFL vs. college?  What's triggering this question is the 1-point safety rule. I'm trying to figure out what in the world a defender should do about a ball that lands in or near the end zone on a blocked extra point. Why is there any motivation at all to pick that ball up and try to run with it if they might be tackled in the end zone, giving 1 point to the offense?  I've spent an hour researching all the sources I could find, and they discuss all the cases of the defense scoring on a blocked extra point kick, but I can't find a good answer regarding the offense scoring if the offense regains possession. "
921,Is the ball considered in play when the goalkeeper puts it on the ground after catching it?,"The goalkeeper has caught the ball and decides to put it on the ground to kick it to his teammates.

922,Slovenia - Germany last goal of the 25-25 tie in EHF Euro 2018,"Luckily, Germany was awarded a penalty after the game was already over, thanks to the video technology (Game report). Now Slovenia files a protest hoping to get the match replayed.  Although I like that decision I am not sure if it was a correct one.   Is it allowed to call the video proof after the final buzzer went off? The rules of the Game don't mention video tech at all. Is the decision next to a red card (only within the 30-seconds rule) always a penalty if the attacking team didn't score in that situation? I believe it doesn't matter whether or not they passed or shot. No goal = penalty. But some press articles say otherwise.  "
923,How important is the opening service in a game of badminton?,"Background (aka motivation): In chess, there are only two players. In (singles) badminton too, there are only two players. Both face off against each other. In chess, each player has a particular play-style, that can be studied by reviewing their previous matches. You can do a similar thing in badminton too. Moreover, both these sports involve an opening/service from one side.  In chess, there are a multitude of ways you can open the game. Each opening is suited to a particular play style of a player and affects the further development of the game. But, unlike a game of badminton, one game of chess has only one opening.  My question: How important is the opening service in a game of badminton? What techniques do player's use to gain an advantage over the opponent when they win a serve? "
924,Why do these highly ranked senior players never enter a national medal tally?,"This official list of senior badminton players in India ranks, under Women's Singles, Saina Nehwal as rank 20 and PV Sindhu as 30. As such, there are already 20 players above Saina Nehwal.  However, it is almost one of them only who tops the merit list. Even in the recent National Badminton Championship, Saina was the winner while Sindhu was runner up.  My question: Why are the names of the other top players so unheard? Why don't they take part (and probably win) such national titles? "
925,What happens to a half century recorded when a player scores a century?,"When a player crosses fifty runs, it is called a half century, and is recorded in the batsman's records. When a player crosses one hundred runs, it is a century, and is also recorded in the batsman's records.  But, to cross one hundred runs the player must have crossed fifty runs first.  What happens to the previous half century recorded, when the player completes a century as well?  Are they both recorded? Is the half century discarded and only the century recorded?  Similarly, what is the recording procedure when a player who scored a century goes on to score a double century? "
926,When can the ref cancel or abandon a match due to severe weather?,"According to the Laws of the Game it is for the referee to decide whether or not a match can take place when the weather is too severe. But what defines the term ""too severe""? Are there any guidelines about wind speed, snow, rain fall, etc. the referees have to follow?  Right now we have wind speeds of >120 km/h, which would in my opinion way over the limit, but what actually defines that limit? In our referee group we had a test for that, but that was just a small guidance for our local league (like can you see both goals from the middle line or can you run on the pitch or is it too deep, etc).

He eventually reached second base safely. The defence committed no errors.   Should that be scored as a double? Or should it be scored as a single with a stolen base? Or should it be something else?  Thanks. "

930,"In the 2019 Cricket World Cup final, should Guptill's overthrow have resulted in 5 or 6 runs?","In the 2019 Cricket World Cup final, a throw to the wicket from Martin Guptill hit Ben Stokes's bat and ran away to the boundary. ICC Law 19.8 which deals with ""Overthrow or wilful act of fielder"" states     If the boundary results from an overthrow or from the wilful act of a fielder, the runs scored shall be any runs for penalties awarded to either side, and the allowance for the boundary, and the runs completed by the batsmen, together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the instant of the throw or act.   It seems that when Guptill threw from the boundary Stokes and Rashid were just starting their second run and had not crossed, so was this an error by the umpires?  (This question was originally raised by ESPN Cricinfo) "

Answer from both scorer's and goalkeepers point of view would be great. "
937,Can a goalkeeper chip the ball to the head of a teammate from a goal kick to circumvent the backpass restriction?,"If you've been following the 2019 International Champions Cup, you've certainly not missed Benfica's unorthodox goal kick against Milan (clip on Twitter). If you can't see the video, just know the goalkeeper had a defender stay very close to him, so he could flick the ball to his centre-back, who then headed it back to him so he could pick it up with his hands and resume play more easily.     Now, I originally thought this would not be allowed, as Law 12 punished whoever uses a trick to circumvent the backpass rule, and the fact there are two offenders instead of just one shouldn't change anything, especially in a case like this where the intent of circumventing the law is clear as day (Law 12.3).     There are different circumstances when a player must be cautioned for unsporting behaviour including if a player (...) uses a deliberate trick to pass the ball (including from a free kick) to the goalkeeper with the head, chest, knee etc. to circumvent the Law, whether or not the goalkeeper touches the ball with the hands   However, it appears that several people have contacted the IFAB following this situation, and surprisingly enough they have stated this kind of goal kick is legal. But while it's obviously up to them to decide what constitutes unsporting behaviour (so I can't really complain there), what truly puzzles me is their explanation as to why this should be allowed.  According to many people, including Dale Johnson (link to his tweet), the IFAB said this is legal because ""[n]o handling backpass Law was designed to prevent time-wasting and actions here are clearly not to waste time"". This is also confirmed by other tweets which provide screenshots of emails written by David Elleray himself (Technical Director of the IFAB), that again mention the fact that ""no law [was] broken"", and that ""game [was] restarted quickly"" (link to tweet, image below).    Now, let's consider that sentence from Law 12 again, the one that punishes trickery; it's considered unsporting behaviour, meaning that something about it is against the spirit of the game. This ""something"" can only be one of these two things:   the unfair action is trying to circumvent the Laws, OR it is specifically going against the spirit of the backpass law.   Now, if the correct answer were the first one, this means that any attempt to circumvent a rule could result in a yellow card (remember that the list of unsporting behaviour offences is a mere list of examples, which could be expanded to include any other act or behaviour the referee deems to be just as unfair), which would then clearly include this situation as well. Yet the email in that screenshot clearly states that ""no Law [was] broken"", which means this can't be the correct interpretation; I've heard the IFAB also likened this situation (but sadly I have no screenshots of this) to kicking the ball at an opponent while taking a free kick in order to replay it, which could be seen as a way of circumventing the rules, but is instead—as we all know—permitted by the Laws themselves.  This leaves us with only one possible option: the unfair action behind the no-trickery rule is specifically going against the spirit of the backpass rule—and thanks to the first tweet (but it's also hinted in the email in the screenshot) we know what that spirit is: to prevent time-wasting.  But then, doesn't it mean that goalkeepers are able to handle most backpasses now?  Very rarely do goalkeepers feel the need to handle a backpass during a tiki-taka situation: this offence is more often than not called when a defender has no other choice but to kick the ball back to the keeper because he's being pressed by the opponents, and the GK accidentally picks it up with his hands. Yet there's no time-wasting ploy in the situation I just described, is there? It's just a defensive scheme, especially if the goalkeeper immediately throws the ball with his hands like the Benfica GK in the video above. Whistling for a foul here would mean going against the spirit of the law.  And the situation gets even more absurd when you think that if the defender flicked the ball up to his own head and then headed it back to the keeper under the very same circumstances, then the GK could legally pick it up according to this new interpretation because they weren't trying to waste time! Which means that if we punish the foul we're applying a rule outside of the scope it was originally intended for, and therefore we're encouraging players to circumvent it in situations where the spirit of the law would not be broken, in which case we're actualy told not to intervene because it would be legal for them to circumvent it!  What do you think of all of this? How should the referee deal with these offences after this groundbreaking new interpretation by the IFAB? "
938,Why are combined no hitters so rare?,"The other day, the Astros pitched only the 14th combined no hitter in MLB history by a starter and reliever(s). I believe that there were actually more than 14 complete game no hitters by only starters.  Why would there be fewer combined no hitters than complete game no hitters? I would imagine that it would be easier for ""fresh"" pitchers to avoid getting hit than someone who had to pitch all nine innings. Or is this somehow not the case? "
939,Why was Andy Murray allowed to play doubles in Washington without a wildcard or PR?,"At the Citi Open in Washington 2019, Andy Murray played doubles with Jamie Murray. The team did not got a wildcard, nor was it a protected ranking (PR). Link to draw.   According to this answer on sports.stackexchange.com, the ranking 6 week before the tournament is relevant for enter a draw. Andy Murray did not have a ranking 6 weeks before, according to ranking history  In the draw it is mentioned, that the last direct acceptance are ""Advance-47/On-Site-54"". Why was he allowed to play doubles in Washington without wildcard or PR?  Edit: I found something in the rule book, page 10 about commitment player:     C. Commitment Player   A 2019 ATP commitment player is any player positioned in the Top 30 in   the ATP 2018 Rankings (singles) as of November 5, 2018.   ...   E.

940,Which kind of bow fits my needs,"I'm an archery beginner and I'm a bit overstrained by the massive supply of different bows.  I'm 1,94m tall, want to use ""intuitive shooting"" (I hope this is the right term) and intermediated sporty.   Okay, what I've found out so far is, that a ""recursive bow"" is the most modern bow for this discipline. However, I'm a little bit afraid that this bow is already too modern for me. I really want to have a pretty basic experience. Is this possible with this kind of bow?   Example for this kind:     Size: 70"" Pull weight: 32 lbs   Another example is such a ""Manaubow"" which raises the impression of being more traditional.     Okay, here are my questions. Which size and pull weight should a bow have for me? Are the 70"" and 32 lbs ok? Is a ""recursive bow"" able to provide a basic traditional experience or would something like a ""Manaubow"" be the better choice?   Thank you so much! "
941,What is the logic behind pitting AL vs NL in the All-Star game for ws home-field advantage?,I always figured that the reasons the all-star game is now played this way are:   There's no other non-arbitrary way to directly compare the AL and NL champions It makes the all-star game more interesting   Are those reasons the case? Is that the extent of the logic behind the all-star game winning a league home-field advantage in the world series?

943,Why have some MLB managers stopped wearing uniforms?,"I believe that for many years, MLB managers would always wear the same uniform as their players during games.  However, I've been watching more games on TV this year, and it seems that many managers now wear other clothing.  For example, in this photo from May 9, 2015 (credit David Richard of USA Today), we see Cleveland manager Terry Francona making a visit to the mound.  The shirt he's wearing is completely different from his player's uniforms, and it doesn't look like he has a uniform jersey underneath.  Why the break with tradition?  Was there a rule change, or simply managers deciding to dress differently for some reason? "
944,Does the precision of NBA timekeeping go beyond tenths of a second?,"As NBA viewers, we see that they keep time up to tenths of a second. But officially do they keep track of time to hundredths (or perhaps even thousandths) of a second?  Here's an example. Say there are 'really' 27.12 seconds left in the quarter, with a team to inbound the ball. The team inbounds the ball and then commits a 24 second shot-clock violation. At this point the referees will typically stop the play and reset the clock to what it should be. Viewers at home will see that they reset the clock to 3.1 seconds (correct me if I'm mistaken). My question is this: Do they in fact reset it to precisely 3.12 seconds? Or do they really just reset it to 3.10 seconds? "

946,Combining Bets in sports,"I am trying to come up with the most lopsided bet I could possibly do for the upcoming Barcelona vs Juventus final. I have a question about whether or not combining bets is possible.  For this example, I'll use mostly made up odds. And I'll use the decimal representation of the odds.  Say I will bet that Stephan Lichsteiner scores during this game. That's got 31/1 odds on Bet888.  Also, I could bet that the game ends Juventus 9-0 Barcelona, which has odds of 500/1 on Bet888.  Lastly, I want to bet that Andrea Barzagli will be man of the match. This has odds of 66/1.  Is it customary to combine the odds? So if I wanted to bet that all three of these events happen, would I get odds of 500*66*31/1 = 1023000/1 ? Or does it depend on the rules set by the betting agency, or is there a maximum of two simultaneous events?  I ask because I read somewhere that the man that bet $50 on Brazil losing 7-1 AND Sami Khedira scoring won a lot of money and I want to see how his winnings would be calculated. "
947,What is used as tie-breaker in mountain classification?,"If Mikel Landa finished 2nd in the yesterday's (30 May 2015) stage of Giro d'Italia, both him and Giovanni Visconti would have 125 points in mountains classification. The last stage is flat, no points in mountain classification are given. So in this scenario they would finish both with the same number of points.        What is used as a secondary criterion if two riders have the same number of points in mountain classification?   Are the rules the same for all Grand Tours (all races in UCI World Tour)?      Bonus question: Has it ever happened in some important stage race that the winner of mountain classification has to be decided by some additional criterion, as two (or more) riders were tied on points?

951,Why is match fixing illegal?,"With all eyes on FIFA in the past days, I tend to wonder, why match fixing (or tournament fixing) is illegal in any sport.  I understand that fixing violates the rules of the governing body of a particular sport, but why does government and authorities need to get involved? By which right, do governments enforce internal rules of NGOs such as FIFA?  I understand that there is a deception involved here, but I don't understand how is that violating the law? "
952,How are doubles seeds calculated?,"For singles, the seeding in the tournaments is rather straightforward: We simply look at the rankings and the players with top 8 (or 16 or 32) rankings are seeded.  However, for doubles competition we cannot use such simple procedure. There are ATP rankings and WTA rankings (and, in the case of junior events, ITF rankings) for doubles. However, the players are ranked individually. For example, it might happen that in a tournament player which is No. 1 in doubles plays together with the player who is No.4. If the players ranked 2nd and 3rd would enter the same tournament, which of these couples would be ranked higher? Or is the seeding somehow calculated based on the number of the points each player have gained?  Similar question can be asked about mixed doubles. (Although mixed doubles competition is not played at many tournaments. I am only aware Grand Slams, Olympic Games, Hopman Cup and Youth Olympics.) I am unaware of a ranking for mixed doubles. Is the ranking in this case somehow combined from the doubles ATP and WTA rankings?  To summarize:   Based on what are couples in doubles competition seeded? Is the procedure to obtain doubles seeds the same for Grand Slams, ATP tournaments, WTA tournaments, junior tournaments? What about mixed doubles?  "

954,Who are the other horses and riders alongside Americah Pharoah?,"Both before and after the Belmont Stakes on Saturday, I noticed that the horses and jockeys were accompanied by men wearing red vests over white shirts, who were also on horses. They first led the procession to the track, then stayed in the rear while the horses entered the gate.  After the race, one of the men rode alongside Victor Espinoza as American Pharoah cooled down after the race. At first, as I had thought earlier, it seemed that the men were merely there to ensure that everything went fine and the horses went where they were supposed to go. However, I noticed that Espinoza was talking and laughing with the man after the race, and America Pharoah appeared the be nuzzling the other horse, indicating that the two pairs knew each other. That seemed to cast doubt on my first theory.  Who are the red-vest-wearing men? Are they officials?  A picture can be seen here, later in the article.   "
955,Five a side tournament - awarding bye's in a partial round robin,"I help to run a five-a-side tournament with my scout group; we tend to have around 40 teams which split across 4 age groups. We can't run full round-robins at the group stage, so instead we run 4 games for each team, award points and put the best teams through to a knockout round.  The fixtures are all pre-arranged the day before, so if a team doesn't show up on the day it's sometimes not possible to avoid the situation where a bye has to be awarded to some of the teams.  In this situation, what's the correct score to award? We award 3 points for a win, 2 for a score draw and 1 for nil-nil. In practice goal difference often decides who goes through to the knockouts.  FWIW my own answer would probably be to award a score draw, which might avoid introducing an unfair advantage without penalising the team for missing a game? "

Athletes normally compete under the flag of the country they're from, but complications can lead to an athlete competing independently under the Olympic flag.  If independents have won medals, why did they compete independently? If an athlete is of Olympic medal-winning calibre, why wouldn't any country want the athlete to compete for them? "

I figured I lose a life whether I foul or whether I fail to sink, and I only have one life left, so why not?  I was accused of cheating. Is that right? "

965,Usage of unusual characters in sports shirts,"Many languages make use of characters outside the standard English A-Z set, and these characters often make it into family names, e.g., Özil, Fàbregas, Čech, Szczęsny, and so forth. Surprisingly (to me), kit manufacturers often produce shirts where the player's name has a special character replaced with the closest approximation within the English A-Z set, e.g.,   At Arsenal, Szczęsny's shirt says Szczesny, and this version of the name is even used in the club's website. Similarly, Čech goes by Cech. Many Iceland players have names with a þ or a ð in them, and then carry shirts where it is replaced with th. For example, Sigþórsson went around the Euro this summer with a shirt that said Sigthorsson. This is also the version of his name in his Nantes website.   Many such examples can be provided. Effectively, the only special characters that regularly make it into shirts are Germanic umlauts and Spanish/Portuguese accents. This is odd, because the change in spelling often entails a change in pronunciation (e.g., Šmicer's Liverpool shirt used to say Smicer, even though š and s correspond to different sounds; this is like giving Ronaldo a shirt that says Renaldo and then going ""eh, close enough, who cares"").  So  here there are actually two questions. First, why do clothing companies systematically produce shirts with known misspellings (unlikely to be economic reasons, I think; the cost of procuring additional characters is probably trivial relative to the size of the market)? And second, why do the relevant players systematically tolerate the misspellings? "
966,Electronic Assistance in baseball,"Though I'm curious about this in all sports, I'll limit my question to the scope of MLB for the moment.  My question is what (if any) are the rules regarding electronic assistance in baseball games?    Extrapolation   Scenario 1:  Player batting has a ear bud inside his ear that is receiving info from another party in real time about where the catcher is located; what pitch to expect; etc. Scenario 2: Pitcher is wearing ear bud and receiving information about where this player likes pitches, his weak spots, how he does in certain counts; etc. Scenario 3: Manager receives real time data about whether to challenge a call based on a team of people scouring instant replay video.     Scenario 1 seems like it is obviously illegal, and should be.  Scenario 2 is no different than what pitchers do to prepare before games and perhaps between innings;  but it allows for a much finer control on a pitch by pitch basis - and for some reason feels like it should be illegal.  Scenario 3 is legal and practiced.  So with that as background; my question expanded is:  Are there any rules governing this?  If so:   What are they? And given the vast array of potential uses for electronic assistance in the game, what are the guiding principles in determining legality in a given situation?  "
967,How do rankings in competitive table tennis work?,I've often heard of 2000 rank or 1250 rank in competitive table tennis. What does this mean? How far do ranks go? How do you attain a rank? I live in the USA so the governing body is the USATT. 
968,Timeout after field goal: when can it be taken?,"What is the FIBA rule about taking a timeout after a field goal is made, with no fouls or violations other official intervention?   EDIT added: I have already read the rules, and in my view they are unclear.  18.2.3. A time-out opportunity begins when:     For both teams, the ball becomes dead, the game clock is stopped and the official has ended his communication with the scorer's table.   For both teams, the ball becomes dead following a successful last or only free throw.   For the non-scoring team, a field goal is scored.   Why is 18.2.8 rule there? 18.2.8 would imply  that for the scoring team somehow timeout was possible after scoring without official interruption otherwise a special case for the last 2 minutes isnt needed. 18.2.8 doesnt seem to be a refinement of  18.2.3 It appears to contradict it.     18.2.8. A time-out shall not be permitted to the scoring team when the game clock shows 2:00 minutes or less in the fourth period and in each   extra period and, following a successful field goal unless an official   has interrupted the game.   even harder to understand     18.2.3  (...) For both teams, the ball becomes dead   how is the ball not dead for both teams ? Art 10 doesnt say anything about dead for 1 and alive for another.     10.1. The ball can be either live or dead.  "
969,What does Home Runs Allowed mean?,"I am reading an article about data science which uses some baseball statistics as an example.

There have been races where I hear the Sky F1 commentators mention a few familiar names as part of the stewarding team, former F1 drivers like Emanuele Pirro and Nigel Mansell.  Looking around the internet, the FIA website has published biographies for known race stewards of certain race events, but they all come from different backgrounds in the motorsport industry, some of them former FIA officials and some racing drivers. (see source)  Is there any specific criteria for selecting race stewards? Does being a former F1 driver qualify you to be one? And did these people volunteer or are they a part of a collection of people that are assigned to be race stewards every race weekend?      Sources (via FIA website):      Hungarian GP Stewards      British GP Stewards  "

Will the current Bowl Games (e.g: Rose Bowl, Cotton Bowl, Capitol One Bowl) still be played when this format change happens or will they disappear? It seems like if they disappear, only four teams would be competing at the end of the season, rather than the multitude of games that currently take place in the Bowl Game format. If it is the case that the Bowl Games no longer exist, are they also being replaced with another system to allow more teams opportunities for post-season play? "

Modern Olympics, obviously, have men's and women's competitions. However, given that most Western nations (whose cultural norms drive the Olympics) didn't view women as competent until well into the 20th century, I'm curious: which Olympic sport was the first to have a female counterpart?

983,Result of the game?,"Scenario - Final ball of the match and 2 runs are required to win. A fast bowler is bowling to a batsman who is standing one yard outside the popping crease. Bowler bowls a yorker which crushes the toes of the batsman, who gets injured and cannot run. He, though somehow keeps his bat in the crease, thereby eliminating a run-out opportunity. The ball, after crushing the toe goes to fine leg. In the meantime, the non striker runs to the strikers end, completes the run, turns back and safely returns to the non strikers end before the ball is thrown back.  Question - What is the result of the match?   Has the bowling team won? -> Though the non striker has reached the strikers end and gone back, the batsman hasnt made any effort to take a run. This is considered as a no run and the bowling team is declared winners. Is the game a tie? -> The non striker has completed two runs whereas the striker has just gone back to the strikers end. The strikers effort is considered as a one-run-short and the two runs that non-striker has run is reduced to a single. This scenario, ties the scores and the match ends in a tie.   If you are aware of the ICC rules or the possible outcome of the game, please explain with reasons. Thanks! "
984,Two dismissals off a single ball," Is it possible to dismiss both batsmen off the same delivery (i.e., by a catch and a run out)? If the ball touched the lower end of the bat, edged up and touched the bat again, will it be given out? This is assuming that the batsman does not intend to hit it twice. If the ball hits the bat on the other side of the bat, does it count as a dismissal?     "
985,Football Jersey Swapping,"At the end of every game, the top players swap their jerseys with opposition players.    Why is this done? When and how did this tradition of jersey swapping start? Is it mandatory for the players to swap jerseys? What do the players do with the swapped jersey? As in, keep it as a memorabilia , auction it, etc?  "
986,What is the biggest comeback recorded in competitive international soccer matches?,"On October 16, 2012, Sweden came back from 4-0 down to draw 4-4 with Germany in a World Cup qualifier. Purely in terms of goals, is this the record for the biggest comeback in a competitive international match (ie. ignoring friendlies and contests over two legs)? If not, which match holds the record?  (For avoidance of doubt, I'm interested in country vs country matches, not matches between clubs from different countries). "
987,Last tennis players to win Grand Slam on home soil,"Who are the last male and female singles' tennis players to win a grand slam on home soil?  In other words, which male and female Australian, French, British and American athletes most recently won the Australian Open, the French Open, the Wimbledon, and the US open respectively?  "
988,How do clubs/stadiums segregate home fans from away fans,"During a football match, the segregation between the home and away fans can be easily noticed. Majority of the seats are occupied by the home fans , while the visiting team's supporters are often seated in a separate zone with arguably not the best of seating arrangements.  I understand that the clubs allocate a certain amount of tickets to be sold to 'away' supporters. However, how exactly do they know if a person is an away fan? What restrictions , if at all, are there on an  away fan to prevent them from buying tickets reserved for home fans? "
989,What do these numbers mean in the tennis WTA calendar?,"Take a look at the rectangle in this picture.   I understand that M stands for the whole amount of participants (it is like ""S"" for Singles). Q stands for qualifiers. D for doubles tournaments. X stands for mixed tournaments.    What do ""32,16,16"" (in the Shenzhen tournament) mean?  I have been told that for example in the Shenzhen tournament the qualification board can have 16 female players and only 4 may qualify. It means that each player must win two matches to enter in the competition. But, how do you know that only 4 can qualify? It is not written in the 2018 WTA calendar.  Moreover, how come in the Australian Open the 2018 prize money is not showed? "
990,Is there a minimum number of players needed on the field in the NFL?,"In the NFC Divisional playoff game on 2018-01-14 between Minnesota and New Orleans, Minnesota's Stephon Diggs scored a touchdown as time expired in the fourth quarter to take the lead and thus win the game. Of course, the game does not end till the PAT is attempted.  The players, media, coaches, staff, and security rushed the field. After about ten minutes, the officials were able to get everyone off the field and the Minnesota offense on the field.  The Saints were not there, and it took another minute or so to get eight Saints onto the field and onsides before the Vikings could snap and kneel-down.   Now, why did they need eight Saints there?  Why not seven?  One? Zero?  At what point does ""eh, it's your fault you didn't have enough players on the field"" become ""this isn't football""?  What rule specifies the minimum number of players a defense must have in order for the ball to be declared ready for play?  Note this is not really a question of having enough players on hand, lest they risk a forfeit; let's assume the players are somewhere nearby (sideline or locker room) but just are busy with something else.  The only relevant rule, 5-1-1, doesn't address it.     The game is played by two teams of 11 players each.   ...   Penalty: For more than 11 players on the field of play or the end zone   while the ball is in play: Loss of five yards from the previous spot.      Note: It is not a foul if a team has fewer than 11 players on the   field of play or the end zone when a snap, free kick, or fair-catch   kick is made.  "
991,Word for: player who's just helping field a team,"Say you have a soccer team from a small high school, and only 14 students sign up to play.  Now suppose several students twist their ankle or for some other reason aren't able to play.  Now you have to bring a weak player off the bench for the whole game.  What's this weak player called?  He's only there to avoid forfeiting the game for a shortage of players.  Is there a word for this? "

993,Did any player on Eagles Super Bowl winning roster play on the 04 season Super bowl?,"The Philadelphia Eagles beat the New England Patriots in Super Bowl 52 to win their first Super Bowl.   The last time the Eagles made it to the Super Bowl was during the 2004 season, also against the Patriots. Were there any returning Eagles from the 2004 season that were part of the team who won Super Bowl 52? If so, who are they? "
994,What will the batsman score from a winning boundary with one run needed to win?,Assume a team needs 1 run to win and the batsman needs 2 or more runs for his century or half century. The batsman then plays a shot completes his first run then the ball goes to the boundary or six.   How is the score written? Did the batsmen score a half century or a century or did they win the match when the batsmen completed his first run? What was the batsman score of this delivery? 
995,Can an intercepting player be down by contact that occurs before the interception?,"Consider a scenario where a receiver runs a post route to the goal line. A linebacker drops back into coverage, jumps, and tips the pass right before the goal line. In the act of deflecting the pass, the linebacker collides with both the intended receiver and another teammate in coverage. His momentum carries him into the endzone as he flies through the air, but the collision knocks him over upon landing. The pass is tipped multiple times by both offensive and defensive players and somehow passes right in front of the linebacker. He lunges from his knees, extends his arms, and catches the ball before it touches the ground. He is not touched by any player after the initial collision.  Can he get up and advance the ball now, or is he down by contact? If he is down, is he down at the 1 yard line (where the contact occurred) or for a touchback (where he caught the ball)? Would changing certain details (like how many players tip the ball) affect the ruling? "
996,"After a missed field goal, where does the next drive start?","In Superbowl LII, at the beginning of the 2nd quarter, New England drove to the Philly 8 and kicked a field goal.  Gostkowski missed (hit upright).  The ensuing Philly drive commenced at their 20-yard line.  What?  Why didn't the drive start where the Patriots line of scrimmage was?  I don't remember seeing this before. "
997,"Hand pain in the first lumbrical muscle due to golf, why?","Let's investigate the pain in the first lumbrical due to repetitive golf swings with backswing where the support hand experience the pain. It can be repetitive injury, too weak muscles or poor technique. If you are left, then the pain is in the first lumbrical of the left hand. If you are right, then the pain is in the first lumbrical of the right hand.    I first doubted ""not tight enough golf grip where hands not as package"" and then ""not proper backswing"" but this and this confirmed me otherwise. So I am still in the starting point: I cannot understand why my first lumbrical becomes painful after repetition: I am not sure whether it is because my hand muscles are not yet familiar with the stress or some other reason. First lumbrical is connected to the muscle ""flexor digitorum profundus."" Tension in that muscle may cause pain to the hand. Poor warm-up of the hand muscles? Or some other reason?     How do you alleviate the pain in the first lumbrical due to golf?    Helper questions        How do you warm up the small hand muscles in golf?   What have been the reasons for the pain in the first lumbrical with you in golf?     "
998,ATP/WTA ranking during Grand Slam tournaments,"As far as I know, the ATP and WTA rankings work approximately this way: Each week the points for the tournaments played that week are added. The points for tournaments more than 52 weeks old are dropped. (Of course, there are more complicated rules about which and how many tournaments are counted, but this should be the gist of it.)  My question is what happens during Grand Slams, which last two weeks. Some players do not play at GS tournaments, so they might play some tournament during the first week. However, if the new ranking would be issued after one week of GS tournaments, what should be done? Dropping the points for the last edition of the same GS tournament seems unfair, since the players did not finish the tournament yet?        Is the new edition of WTA/ATP rankings issued after the first week of the GS tournament? Are the points for Grand Slams dropped/counted only after the two-week period, in which the tournament is played?     "
999,How many times have major league teams won a championship after winning 4 Game 7s?,"The LA Kings beat the Chicago Blackhawks in Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals during the Stanley Cup Playoffs on June 1, 2014. The Kings have won Game 7 of all three series to get to the Stanley Cup Finals.   I'm wondering if a team ever went on to win the championship after winning 4 Game 7s? If so, can you provide a list of the team and the year of accomplishment? "
1000,What is the difference between chinaman and regular leg spin?,What is the difference between a chinaman bowler and a leg-spinner? The trajectories and direction of both the deliveries are the same.  And why do they call it Left arm unorthodox spin? I can understand unorthodox but why just Left hand?  We all know Brad Hogg as a leg spinner. But Wikipedia states him as a Chinaman Bowler. 
1001,"Does ""size matter"" in tennis?","Martina Navrátilová is considered to be one of the greatest, if not the greatest woman's player of all time. At 5' 8"" in height, she is above average (for a woman) in this regard. But one opponent who has given her a lot of trouble over the years (when not her doubles partner) is Pam Shriver, who is much taller, at 6'0"". Perhaps Shriver has advantages such as arm reach or power that Navrátilová lacks, partly compensating for Navrátilová's greater raw talent.  Another small, scrappy men's player is Michael Chang, who was the youngest man to win the French open. Great things were predicted of him, but he lost other Grand Slam finals to men like Boris Becker, Patrick Rafter and Thomas Muster who are much taller than Chang's 5'8"".  Are the setbacks of Chang (and to a lesser extent Navrátilová) attributable to ""size"" (or lack thereof), or to other non-size factors such as skill, stamina, strategy, etc.? Did anyone ""smaller"" than Pam Shriver do better against Navrátilová in match play? Was Chang ever beaten by anyone close to his size (5'9"" or shorter), or were all his defeats to much bigger men? "
1002,Eyes in the contact point during follow-through?,"This video (8min53s) mentions that eyes are always at the contact point even during the follow-through, I understand this so that the video generalises the observation to all ball games. I instructed my friend in golf to follow the ball during his shot and his shot seemed to become better but this instruction to follow the contact point during the follow-though. So     Where are eyes supposed to be during the follow-through in ball games? Do the eyes follow the ball during shots or do they follow the contact point during the shots?  "
1003,How does a golfer's follow through affect a golf ball's flight?,"Tiger Woods has promoted swinging with a high follow-through and a ""fuller finish"" to hit a high shot. Here's a video example of Woods hitting a full shot from the fairway.    Also, he abbreviates his follow-through and finish to hit a low shot, in which he refers to as his ""stinger."" Here's a video example of Woods hitting a low shot under the trees.    How does a golfer's follow through affect a golf ball's flight? Does follow through also dictate/promote drawing/fading the golf ball, and if so, how? "
1004,"""Lower score than you actually shot will disqualify you"" in Golf? What does this mean?","This answer here mentions this rule:      ""Lower score than you actually shot will disqualify you"".   I have friends who boost by their 20, 30 and 40 handicaps but their performance with me is far poorer such as in the range of 50 -- so 10-30 shots poorer than they are supposed to be. I cannot understand this: it is not motivational particularly when they become angry to unrelated things such as other golfers.        When a golfer gets a far worse result than their handicap, what should happen to their handicap?    Does it get lower and what does the disqualification mean?     "
1005,Why do the Oakland As value a low strikeout rate?,"Last year, the Oakland A's traded Grant Green to the Los Angeles As for Alberto Collaspo. Both had similar statistics (as of 2013), and both can play second base. (Collaspo has since been moved to first, where he is a ""light hitter"" for his position with a batting average below .250.)  Oakland's general manager, Billy Beane has been known for (generally) getting the better of such trades. In Collaspo's case, he has a ""feature"" that the As prize; he strikes out at a lower rate (something like once per eleven innings) than anyone else in the majors.  In ""Moneyball,"" Michael Lewis pointed out that the strikeout was the ""worst"" possible way to get an out (with the possible exception of the double play). So not striking out appears to be worth something.  What exactly are the advantages of having low strikeouts, compared to other ways of making an out? To what extent would Callaspo's lower strikout/higher contact rate than others make up for his low batting average? "
1006,Has a bout stopped during a count ever been reversed?,"Has there ever been a reversal of a referee's decision to stop a boxing match?    If you watch this specific bout, shown in this clip, the man knocked down isn't even allowed to come to his feet, and as soon as the ref stops the fight starts trying to tell the ref he's fine. From what we can see, his eyes look straight, and he ends up getting up looking fine. The ref didn't even make it to 6.  I get that it would be unlikely for an outside person to over-rule a match ref, but can the ref himself do it? "

1010,Which features are required from a heat-shrink sleeve for a tennis racket?,My grip size is 12cm 4 6/8 and I have a racket 4 3/8 with overgrip i.e. 4 4/8. It is not fit enough and getting some pain with it. I want to increase its size by 1/8 inches but which kind of Heat-shrink sleeve should I use? Can I buy it from any warehouse store or does it need to be tennis-specific? What kind of features are required from the heat-shrink sleeve?    P.s. the picture is a little bit misleading but when I press the ruler to my hand: the distance from the top of my ring finger to the second crease is 12cm. 
1011,What is the protocol for switching a pitcher between positions?,"It's kind of rare, but I've heard that it is possible to ""relieve"" a pitcher without removing him from the game--by making him a position player such as an outfielder, or first baseman.  My understanding is that the position player leaves, the pitcher replaces him, and a relief pitcher comes in to pitch to at least one batter. Following this, the original pitcher can return to the mound and resume pitching, while a new position player replaces the former one.  But suppose your ""outfielder"" happens to be Nick Swisher, or even the Pittsburgh Pirates' JB Shuck, who can pitch at least part of an inning. So can the pitcher and outfielder switch places, the outfielder finishes the inning, and the pitcher resumes the following inning with the outfielder going back to his original post?  Can this happen? (I was told that at least the outfielder needed to be replaced in this sequence.) And are clubs beginning to experiment with ""swing men,"" position players who can pitch ""strategically?"" (The Pirates' Harrison got the last out in a game the team was losing by 10 points, thereby sparing a reliever.) "
1012,Deliberate back pass saved off the post,"When a footballer attempts a deliberate back pass to the goalkeeper, and it hits off the post or crossbar, and the goalkeeper uses his or her hands to save it on or about the line:    First, is the pass back infringement still valid?  If so, does an indirect kick come from the spot the line where the keeper handled the ball, or does this necessitate a penalty?  "

1014,How do you log in basketball stats a desperate shot attempt at shot clock buzzer?,"In basketball, the 24 second shot clock buzzer is about to sound, team in possession of the ball throws it up towards the basket.  According to some sources this not registered as a shot attempt. Now, what do we with rebounds? If there is no shot attempt there is no rebound, correct?  A. The ball touches the rim. So technically both teams can contest the rebound. Still no rebound situation, right? So if the offensive team retrieves the ball there is nothing logged yet if they lose the ball then it is a team turnover and just a change of possession or something like that, no?  B. The ball does not touch the rim. Offensive team turnover and that's it, correct? "
1015,Is it ok to stop my serve when I've already started my racquet forward?,"In a match last night, I was serving, threw the ball in the air, and started swinging my racquet. Just before I hit the ball, I stopped my racquet and caught it because I didn't like the toss. Did I go too far? Should I have lost the point? Or is it ok to still stop my serve at that point?  I recorded the match. This is how close I got to hitting the ball before backing off.   "
1016,How often does the IFSC actually hold a world championship?,"The Wikipedia article says     The IFSC Climbing World Championships are the biennial world championships for competition climbing ...   but there was a world championship in 2018 and now again in 2019.  Is this information out of date? Why would the IFSC make this change, if they have done so? "
1017,Why is special case of handball above the shoulder allowed under the revised IFAB rules (2019/2020)?,"According to IFAB's recent changes to the rules:     It is usually an offence if a player:         touches the ball with their hand/arm when:         the hand/arm has made their body unnaturally bigger   the hand/arm is above/beyond their shoulder level (unless the player deliberately plays the ball which then touches their hand/arm)           Scenario One  If I interpret the rules correctly, this sequence of events usually constitute a handball offence:   Player A's arm is above the shoulder, with his back facing the ball.  Player B (could be from either team) plays the ball. The ball travels and touches player A's arm.   It does not matter why Player A's arm was raised above his shoulder. Perhaps, he was sitting on the floor after a tackle left him injured, and he had an arm raised towards his team bench signalling for help.  It also does not matter why Player B played the ball towards Player A's arm.  It is usually a handball since this condition is met: ball touches a player's hand/arm when it is above their shoulder. And he did not deliberately play the ball prior to it touching his arm.  Strictly speaking, As long as the ref has not stopped the game, a handball offence should usually be called in the above sequence.    Scenario Two  This is where it gets a little weird:   Player A's arm is above the shoulder, with the ball at his feet. Player A plays the ball deliberately into the air (e.g. he lobs the ball up). The ball travels vertically up and it touches his arm.   This will NOT be a handball since the clause in parentheses explicitly excludes the scenario where the player deliberately played the ball prior to the ball touching his hand/arm.  Perhaps, the player did not mean to deliberate handle the ball. Maybe he was trying to lob the ball to a team mate, but poor technique or the wind carried the ball vertically towards his unusual raised arm.  I understand that in an actual game, it is highly unlikely that a player will execute this sequence of events. But why is it allowed?    I don't understand why the rules were worded this way. It seems to be allowing a very unusual special case of a player's arm/hand touching the ball, while penalising quite accidental cases.  I think it would have been fine (albeit a little rigid) if the rule makers just left out the part in parentheses. So why did they add this confusing part? What is the motivation behind this special exclusion? What are the examples?  Link to the relevant section of the Laws of the Game: [website]"
1018,Is there any point in training medium-fast running for football?,"I define medium-pace running as fast running but where you aren't actually going all-out.  Say fast all-out sprinting is what you can hold continuously for less than 2 minutes, and let's say jogging is what you can hold for 10+ minutes. Then medium-pace running is anything you can hold for 2-10 minutes.   Am I correct in saying that there's no need to directly train medium-pace running  in football(soccer)?   When does a footballer ever need such a pace? A footballer seems to me to either always be jogging or fast-out sprinting. There doesn't seem to be an ""in-between"", does there?  I am asking because my friend, who plays football, has this endurance program where he runs 800m or 1200m as fast as he can, and then repeats that a bunch of times.. This fits the definition of medium-pace running as I defined above, and I don't see the point of this training. How does this benefit a footballer? Why not just do regular HIIT where you sprint all-out for 20 seconds, jog for 40, and repeat? Isn't that all a footballer will need? "
1019,What limits are there for an NFL teams reserves list?,"There is a maximum to the number of players that are allowed on the active roster of a team in the NFL, but is there any limit to the number of players who may be placed on a teams reserve list (assuming they fit the qualifying criteria)?   Do players on the reserves list always count against a teams cap space, or are there any cases where they do not?  "
1020,Does Nippon Badminton Association forbid players from swapping shirts?,"After yesterday’s game between Kentō Momota and Luís Enrique Peñalver at the World Championships in Basel, Peñalver indicated that he wanted to swap shirts with Momota. Momota’s reaction was a bit of an awkward smile and then turning away; no shirt swap took place.  Some Danish media outlets turned this into a bigger thing than it was, with headlines that Momota ‘snubbed’ his opponent. Now, I’m not entirely convinced that Momota even got the hint that Peñalver wanted to swap, but never mind that (see link below for a clip of the interaction).  The interesting thing to me is that the news stories also mention that     In Momota’s defence, it must be said that the Japanese badminton federation has banned players from swapping shirts.      Verdensetteren ydmygede modstander på banen – og afviste at bytte trøje   This seems like a very odd thing for a badminton federation/association to do, and I’ve heard several commentators decrying it as highly un-sportsmanship-like and detrimental to players.  But when I tried googling it, I couldn’t really find any confirmation that it’s true. There’s no source in any of the media articles I’ve found, and commentators just mentioned having been “informed” that it was so.  Looking on Nippon Badminton Association’s website (the English version of it at least), I cant even find any kind of ruleset or code of conduct for players that might confirm or deny it.  Is it actually true that NBA does not allow the Japanese players to engage in shirt swapping? And if it is true, why on earth have they enacted this puzzling rule? "

1022,Is a hard slap to the basketball a foul?,"If player A has control of the basketball and begins his two-step run at a lay-up within the painted area, and Player B (defender) slaps the basketball hard as Player A goes by, is this a foul by Player B?  Player A argues that the hard slap ""impedes his progress/path"" and is always a foul ""unless the ball is stripped completely."" Player B argues that contact was ""all ball"" and therefore should not be a foul.  What are the rules on this? NBA? FIBA? "
1023,"Ball rebounds from wicketkeeper's pads or body, can the batsman play it?","During the third 2019 Ashes test, a bowled ball (Lyon) passed the batsman (Stokes) without being struck. The ball then hit the wicketkeeper’s (Paine) pad and rolled back more or less in front of the batsman.  The ball was treated as dead if I recall. How do the laws cover this?  Could the ball have been played by the batsman? "
1024,"What is the ""main"" position of players that are on field at NFL kickoff?","As far as I know, players on the special teams (except the kicker, punter and long snapper) are offensive or defensive (backup) players, due to the limited number of players on the active roster. What is the ""main"" position of the players on the field at kickoff?  For the kicking team there's obviously a kicker on the field, but what is the ""main"" position of the other 10 players? They need to be fast and tackle well.  For the receiving team the returner is usually a WR, a CB or even a RB, but what about the other players? They should be able to block for the returner, but I guess the best blocking players (offensive line) are too slow...  I also heard during a game that for onside kicks the kicking team may send a ""hands team"" to the field - how much they differ from the ""regular"" kicking or receiving team? Sending the ""hands team"" on field doesn't tell the opponent ""we're going to onside kick, prepare for it""? "

1027,What determines if a hand pass is legal in the NHL?,What are the conditions that make a hand pass legal or illegal?  I have seen players swat the puck to a teammate and not get whistled for the a hand pass and I have see players get whistled for what seems to be the same play.  Have these rules changed in somewhat recent times?  I don't remember ever seeing the play continue on a hand pass.  I started noticing it in the last year or two. 
1028,What happens when all the same color balls (solids or stripes) go in on the break?,"I played on a pool league (TAP league, 8-ball) a few years ago and some of us pondered what would happen according to the rules if a pool player made either all solids or stripes on the break (but not the 8 ball).    We figured (with our rules anyway), since any balls made on the break does not automatically determine which color you had to make for that game, then you would be forced to go for whatever the other color was still on the table, essentially putting your opponent on the 8-ball as soon as one was made.  I would figure that either player wouldn't want that situation so they would both most likely choose to stalemate (unless a player was confident they could run the table), but I was wondering if there was any precedent or rule for this situation.    Oh yea, and spare me any responses like ""It's probably not possible so don't worry about it!"".  Just asking out of fun curiosity.  Thoughts?  Stories?  Please share! "
1029,How can I determine safe surfing conditions from a surf report for a beginner?,"I'm not a strong swimmer, and I'm not positive I could swim back to shore if my leash were to snap. I understand this is a major risk, and I'm taking steps to mitigate it (I've begun private swimming lessons, and I practice at a local pool a few times a week), but this is my last summer in the West Coast and I'm not willing to wait on the sidelines and watch the summer go by.  So far I'd been looking at the swell height, e.g. 1-2 ft. today for my area on Magic Seaweed:    I've also learned that waves seem calmer during high tide (and please correct me if that's a faulty or oversimplified assumption).  But last week I went on a 1-2 ft. day during high tide and the waves turned out to be randomly sized with occasional massive (4-5 ft.) sets. And the water was so choppy, I felt I was being rocked from all sides and struggling to keep balance on my board. What went wrong in the forecast? Or more likely, my reading of it?  Do the secondary and tertiary swells have to do with choppiness? Should I read more into some of the other stats, like swell periods or wind speed?  In short, how should I read a surf report, as a beginning surfer and weak swimmer, and what, if any, are some danger signs I should look out for? "
1030,Are World Cup refs all the same gender as the teams?,"I am watching the Women's soccer/football World Cup. So far, all the refs I have seen have been women. Now that I think about it, during the men's World Cup I only saw men as refs.  Is this in fact the case? Are all the refs in the Women's World Cup women, and all the refs in the Men's World Cup men?  If so, is this a rule, directly or indirectly? (An example of an indirect rule might be that all refs must have played in the league/association which would imply a gender requirement without explicitly stating one.) Are there any rule differences or reasons why the two referee populations would not have significant overlap? "
1031,Why would a recently drafted player sign for less than slot value?,Why would a recently drafted player sign for less than slot value?  This is their only chance to make some money before making the big club if that ever happens?  Seems to me it is not in the players best interest to sign for less money. 
1032,What is the MLB record for the most errors by a single player on a single play?,"What is the MLB record for most errors committed by a single player on a single play?  I wondered about this today, when Giants shortstop Brandon Crawford was charged with two errors on the same play in the second inning.  (With a runner at second, Crawford booted a ground ball, then threw wildly to first, allowing the runner from second to score.)  I imagine this must happen with some regularity, but I had never seen it before.  This article reports that Tommy John committed three errors on one play in a game in 1988.  The story suggests that at the time, this tied the record for pitchers, but does not address other positions or whether this dubious record has since been broken.  Has any player ever been charged with four or more errors on the same play? "
1033,What happens if a team walks off the field during a football match?,"On the weekend an altercation between a referee and a play led to their team leaving the pitch. 21 minutes into the game our team was up 1-0 when allegedly the referee said to a player that he was a ""shit player."" There is no evidence of this. The player was told to calm down, and then he pushed the referee and stood as if he wanted to fight. The referee drew a red card. The player left the pitch and told his coach what the referee said about him being a ""shit player.""   Their team left and forfeited the match. The referee was keen to move on and referee the rest of the game; therefore, was the game abandoned, or did their team forfeit, as both the referee and our team were keen to persist with the match?  I was just wondering if we get the 3 points and they forfeit, or is the game simply forgotten? "
1034,"If a baseball team takes a large early lead, would it make sense to substitute an inferior pitcher to save the better one?","The Pittsburgh Pirates took an early lead of 5-0 against the Chicago White Sox in the first inning. Their pitcher was their ace, Francisco Liriano.   With such a large lead, can the Pirates afford to substitute an inferior pitcher, say Vance Worley and save Liriano for a later game in the (four game) series? (This would be on the theory that even Worley wouldn't blow such a big lead.) Or would such a move throw the whole rotation out of whack?  As it were, the Pirates are at home, meaning that Liriano had to pitch the top of the first. Would the proposed substitution make better sense if the Pirates were the visitors and run up the big lead, before Liriano threw a ball? "
1035,When was the last time a single country had three players in Top 10 of WTA rankings?,"If Karolína Plíšková wins her today's match against Angelique Kerber, she will move into the 10th spot in the next edition of WTA singles rankings. (Sources: wtatennis, tennisworldusa, idnes, ...) If this happens, there will be three Czech players in Top Ten of the rankings. (The other two being Kvitová and Šafářová.)  To me it seemed a rare occurrence. (I do not remember something like that in the recent years.) Which provoked me to ask the question:     When was the last time a single country had three players in Top 10 of WTA singles rankings?   I have tried to check at least year-end rankings. It is probably not an unexpected that I found several years where some big nations (Russia, USA) had three or more players in top 10. However, my question is not only about year end rankings.   Russia had 3 or more players in year-end rankings in 2009 (Safina, Kuznetsova, Dementieva, Zvonareva), 2008 (Safina, Dmentieva, Zvonareva, Kuznetsova, Sharapova), 2007 (Kuznetsova, Sharapova, Chakvetadze), 2006 (Sharapova, Kuznetsova, Petrova, Dementieva), 2005 (Sharapova, Dmentieva, Petrova) In 2004 there were four players from USA (Davenport, Serena and Venus Williams, Capriati) and four players from Russia (Myskina, Sharapova, Kuznetsova, Dementieva) in Top Ten. USA had three or more players in Top 10 in 2003 (Serena Williams, Davenport, Capriati, Rubin), 2002 (Serena and Venus Williams, Capriati, Seles), 2001 (Davenport, Capriati, Venus and Serena Williams, Seles), 2000 (Davenport, Venus Williams, Seles, Serena Williams) In 1999 there were four players from USA (Davenport, Venus and Serena Wiliams, Seles) and four players from France (Pierce, Tauziat, Halard-Decugis, Mauresmo) in Top 10.  "
1036,Do sports blackout policies exist anywhere outside North America?,"As a sports fan, I hate blackout policies. Every day there are a few MLB games I cannot watch, even though I pay a subscription directly to MLB. They're obviously not the only league that does it, but I can only find rules in North American leagues. I understand that in some ways blackout rules were once imposed by the FCC, but that is no longer the case.  Do blackout rules exist anywhere outside North America? I've been looking around and all I've found are rules in Canadian and American leagues. I've found no blackout rules in Europe, Australia, Asia, or otherwise. Am I just not looking in the right places, or do these rules only exist here? "
1037,Is there any concept of 'declaring' an inning in Baseball?,"This is a question regarding a somewhat hypothetical situation, but one I have been thinking about quite a bit and can't get my head around.  In Cricket, a team can 'Declare' an innings at any time, ending the innings and allowing the other team to come to bat. This is generally done during test matches, as any game that reaches 5 days in length without both teams completing 2 innings would end in a draw - this means that it is not to a teams advantage to carry on after they have already achieved a heavy lead - it is more important to get the other team in so that they can be bowled out.  In Baseball, however unlikely, it seems to me that it would be possible for a team to just keep batting around the order, hitting a potentially infinite number of runs within an inning if the other teams pitchers were so inept that they just couldn't record any outs.  So my question is: Can a Baseball team choose to end an innings? Is there any law in place that would allow an umpire to step in and end it? In fact, is there anything at all that can end an innings other than three outs being recorded? "
1038,In 8 ball can a player place the cue ball behind the head string and then directly pot a ball which is also behind the string?,"Section 3.9 of the WPA Pool Billiards rules lists Bad Play from Behind the Head String as a standard foul for 8 ball. However, when you actually read Section 6.11 Bad Play from Behind the Head String, it says:     When the cue ball is in hand behind the head string, and the first   ball the cue ball contacts is also behind the head string, the shot is   a foul unless the cue ball crosses the head string before that   contact. If such a shot is intentional, it is unsportsmanlike conduct.   The cue ball must either cross the head string or contact a ball in   front of or on the head string or the shot is a foul, and the cue ball   is in hand for the following player according to the rules of the   specific game.   But this seems like an unfair rule. Assume a scenario where I commit a foul and my opponent has a ball in hand with an easy shot in the kitchen. Is my opponent required to place the ball outside the kitchen just to abide by this rule (or take the other option of taking a long bank shot)? I have never observed this rule being applied in the recent matches of 8 ball pool that I have seen. Is there a different interpretation of this rule?  If I were to frame the rules, I wouldn't have included Section 6.11 as a standard foul for 8 ball, or at the very least I would have added a line saying applies to ball in hand only after a foul committed on the break. As it currently stands there's nothing restricting this rule to the spotting of the cue ball immediately after the break. "
1039,How hips generate power while punching?,"I have been hearing this things a lot. But don't know:   How it works? How is it possible (science, body mechanics behind it)? How to practice it, if its the most effective of punching?   I understand leg and head movement, eye co-ordination, concentration. But this I don't get. Any experienced boxer or martial art expert please answer. "
1040,Why is racquet abuse banned in tennis?,"I am wondering what is the reason a player is not allowed to damage their racquet on purpose, assuming they have another to play with.  I can see why such behaviour would be discouraged, but why is there a specific rule regarding it? Assuming the player does not present a danger to anyone, how is that different from kicking a bottle or throwing a bag on the floor etc...? "
1041,How often has a major league team hit only a home run and a triple in a single game?,"On June 26, 2015, the Mets had two hits, a home run (Granderon) and a triple (Hererra), but no singles or doubles, and they won the game (2-1 over the Reds).  Did the Mets pull off a baseball first? Has any other major league team hit only a home run and a triple in a single game, and if so did they win? "
1042,What happens if only one runner reaches base on a double steal?,"There are two outs, with men on first and third. The one man leaves first and gets caught in a rundown. The other man steals home as a result. The first man gets tagged out, but not before the other run reaches home.  Is the run counted or not, since the one runner reached home first? That is, BEFORE the out? (In the actual play I'm thinking of, Pittsburgh vs. Atlanta, both men reached.)  Do I assume correctly if the man on first made the second (instead of third) out, that the run is counted? "
1043,What do managers do when a closer blows the save?,Would they pull him for the tenth inning in most cases?  I know that they're generally one-inning specialists but would they go to a setup man or something after? 
1044,MLB: Gray area concerning runners passing each other rule,"I was just watching the cubs - mets game on TV (7/1/15) and in the bottom of the 8th, a bit of a bizarre play transpired, which seemed to stump the umpires and commentators alike. There were runners on 2nd (Daniel Murphy) and 3rd (Ruben Tejada) and 1 out, and Tejada took off to steal home. About half-way between 3rd and home, Tejada turned around and got caught in a rundown. Meanwhile, Murphy took off from 2nd to 3rd, and stayed put on 3rd when he got there (expecting Tejada to get thrown out in the rundown). But the result of the rundown was that Tejada ran back to third, on which Murphy was still standing, and passed through the bag (believing he was out somehow), running behind Murphy and proceeding to get tagged out. The Cubs player then tagged Murphy, standing on 3rd, and the third-base umpire ruled both men out.   However the umpire quickly took back his ruling and went into conference with the other umpires, finally ruling only Tejada out, as he was tagged while behind 3rd base, but ruling Murphy safe at third.  My question is, should Murphy (the following runner) have also been called out for passing Tejada (the preceding runner), when Tejada ran back through third base and behind Murphy before he (Tejada) was tagged out?   I suppose the issue comes down to the wording of the rule concerning runners passing other runners. According to Rule 7.08 (h): ""Any runner is out when: he passes a preceding runner before such runner is out.""   Therefore, should Murphy have been automatically called out when Tejada (still not out) ran behind him, thereby putting Murphy in front of the preceding runner Tejada? Or would Murphy only be considered to have ""passed the preceding runner"" if he himself were to run ahead of Tejada, rather than remaining stationary while Tejada ran behind (or ""unpassed"") Murphy? "
1045,Are the gender differences in Olympic uniforms simply a style choice? Whose choice?,"There are a number of sports in the Olympics where men and women do similar things in very different outfits:     from [website]from [website]Many more examples abound, of women wearing what appear to be bathing suits while men wear shorts, and are covered above the waist, for the same sport.  Are there uniform rules that state women must have bare stomachs? Or that men may not? That women's bottoms should look like panties instead of shorts? That men's bottoms should be loose? Do the sport's governing bodies set these rules? Can a woman declare she would rather wear shorts, thanks? Can a man declare he'd rather wear something super tight and short? (We'll set aside the issue of sparkles for the moment.) "
1046,Why do professional boxers not compete in boxing in the Olympics?,"Now that many professionals athletes are taking part in the Olympic Games, why do pro boxers not also compete in the boxing competition?  Are there any other categories that do not take part in the Olympic Games? "
1047,Did Eric Moussambani go to the semi-finals in Sydney?,"In the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Eric Moussambani, from Equatorial Guinea, was invited to the games under an IOC program that allows smaller countries to compete without meeting qualifying standards. He swam his 100m Freestyle heat in a heroic 1:52.72, and won, due to false starts from his competitors. Why didn't he go on to compete in the semi-finals? Did he opt out, or was this program essentially for exhibition only? "
1048,How many olympic gold medal ties have there been?,"Simone Manuel tied for the gold with Penny Oleksiak in the 100m freestyle during the 2016 Summer Olympics. I have never seen this before, and was curious how often it happens. I tried to find information, and in fact the first article I linked to says that there was a tie in this same event in 1984, but I can't find a list of other events where this has happened, within swimming and beyond.  All I found were articles like about a downhill skiing gold medal tie between Tina Maze and Dominique Gisin in 2014, and one that addresses this incident and lists the ties from only the Winter Olympics.   Does anyone know how many gold medal ties there have been in Olympic history, in both the summer and winter games? "
1049,Why NFL kickers wear different shoes on each foot?,"I was watching some American Football, and I noticed that the kicker Blair Walsh wore a white shoe on his right (kicking) foot, and a black shoe on his left. Is there a reason for this? Does it benefit the kicker somehow? "

1052,Can Bowling be chosen as a sport in the Olympic Games?,Can bowling (10-pin) count as a sport that can be added to the Olympic program?  Is there a chance it may feature in the Olympics one day? 
1053,Which medals are given when there are multiple tied positions that would earn them?,"In some sports it is (actually, not just theoretically) possible that two contestants receive the same total score.    If this happened in the first three positions, would each medal be awarded to two people, for a total of six medals? Is this treated differently in the Olympics, World Cups,and other competitions? Is it different for each sport?   I am specifically thinking of sports in which a fixed difficulty is multiplied or added to a discrete ""execution"" score, for example, platform diving or figure skating or gymnastics. "
1054,How is an overthrow represented on the wagonwheel?,"The ""wagonwheel"" is a diagram used to show where a batsman's shots were played, colourcoded for the number of runs scored from that shot.  An overthrow occurs when a fielding player attempts to return the ball to the stumps, either directly or indirectly, but through some error causes the ball to be sent to another area of the field instead.  Suppose a batsman plays a shot to one side of the field, scoring runs from it. An overthrow to the other side then allows additional runs.  How would this shot and overthrow be represented on the wagonwheel? How are the runs coded? "
1055,Why is a bronze medal not awarded when two silvers are awarded in the Olympic Games?,"I'm curios why a bronze medal is not awarded in 100m butterfly swimming Rio 2016 award ceremony. Michael Phelps and two other swimmers got silvers but no bronze was awarded.  So I assume         If there are three or more gold medals are awarded, silver and bronze medals are not   awarded.      or            If there are two gold medals and one silver are awarded, no bronze is awarded.      Is my assumption correct? "
1056,Is it true that a sprinter ran the 100m in 21.73 seconds in a World Championship?,"In many websites (especially in Spanish), it is mentioned that the worst performance in Men's 100m is that of Kim Collins, 21.73 seconds at Athens World Championship in 1997. To make things more spectacular (and, to me, more suspicious), this is the same Kim Collins who became World Champion in the same competition five years later.   There is no mention of that abysmal 1997 performance in the wiki page, but the time indeed appears in this list and also in the IAAF page.  For me, it's hard to believe that that the record was for a real, normal run. It's also totally inconsistent with the progression timeline of that runner (it would seem credible if it were a 200m run). Does anyone know what really happened? "
1057,"Rules and punishments for causing crashes in track cycling (omnium, points race)","After yesterday's (August 15th, 2016) omnium in the Olympics and the crash caused by Mark Cavendish in the points race, lots of people, ranging from cycling specific media to seemingly half of twitter, are saying they can't believe he wasn't disqualified, or insinuating that he should have been. However, no one has actually pointed to a rule nor any case where a similar standard has been set.  What are the rules and standard punishments for crashes caused in track racing and specifically, the points race of an omnium? What does one have to do to be disqualified? Did previous similar incidents have the same results (warning) or result in disqualification? "
1058,Olympic Diving: how is the difficulty of a dive decided?,"Shi Tingmao's fourth dive in the 2016 Rio Olympic 3m final was ""Forward 3½ Somersaults"" with a difficulty coefficient of 3.1.  How are such values determined?  In general, is the difficulty coefficient fixed or variable over time? "
1059,What if two boxers refused to fight each other?,"Suppose that two boxers (or MMA fighters or similar) chose not to fight. They do nothing and persist in doing nothing even when instructed to start fighting.  Now if it was just one doing so, then he would either be attacked and knocked out, pinned, scored lower than his opponent, or otherwise determined to be the losing fighter.  But what if both fighters were doing the same, refusing to fight? Would it be a double loss? How is that decided? "
1060,How often do Olympic divers score a zero?,"I've been amazed at the headlines about so many Olympic divers scoring zeros during competition. Is this common in Olympic diving? If so, is there an easy explanation? It just seems odd to me that divers could misjudge their dives so badly as to do so many bellyflops. If gymnasts did this, they would be leaving on stretchers a LOT! "
1061,What teams have won the Champions League the season after winning the Europa League?,"Have any football teams won the UEFA Champions League the season directly following on from when they won the Europa League?  If so, what teams were they, and in which seasons did they achieve their victories? "
1062,"Was ""freestyle"" swimming anything other than ""front crawl""","In competitive swimming, ""freestyle"" events are those which have very few limitations in the swimming style, and the swimmer is allowed to choose whatever style they are fastest in. However, I have only ever seen freestyle swimmers use the ""front crawl"" technique.  Given that the front crawl is so dominant, was there ever a time in history when there were actually a range of styles used in freestyle events? Or have freestyle events always been dominated by front crawl? "
1063,Why do the olympic beach volleyball teams not set?,"I have been watching a lot of the Olympic Beach VolleyBall, and I noticed that they almost never set the ball using an overhead set (two hands open position over their head.)

1064,If the defense commits a penalty on an extra point after a turnover does the offense get to retry the point?,If the defense commits a penalty on an extra point after a turnover does the offense get to retry the point?  Assume the offense is going for a two point conversion and a defender intercepts the ball.  One of his teammates hoping to help out commits a holding penalty after the interception.  Does the offense get to retry the extra point or does this penalty have to be enforced on the next kickoff? 
1065,NHL players making less than NHL minimum?,"I have looked up a few currently inactive NHL players, but who played at least 30 or more career games in the NHL. I am familiar with the hockey term ""duster"" and I've heard it thrown around, but I don't quite get how this works:  If you play in any amount of games for any time in the NHL (even if you play less than 1 second of a game), aren't you signed on a guaranteed minimum NHL contract salary?  If so, why have I found some dozens of players stats online who show well under NHL minimum? Some players show no earnings at all (e.g., preseason games).  Others show earnings well below the minimum for playing in NHL games (e.g., $100,000 or such instead of the minimums at the time of playing which were much higher).  Does this minimum only count under certain contracts/conditions? Because I have heard some former NHL players whose earnings were not NHL minimum, yet they've had rocky NHL careers (e.g., up and down from NHL/AHL multiple times).  Could this be clarified? Just look at this if you don't believe me:   [website]A few of those bottom of the list salaries are pretty surprising, if real. "
1066,Can a team sell tickets to a practice?,The Tigers have about a week off between now and the World Series.  Is there anything in the Rules about not letting a Team Sell Tickets for Practice?  My thought is that by having a stadium full of fans would feel more like a real game and keep the players in the mindset they have during the season.  They wouldn't necessary have to sell tickets but just a way to basically have an open inter team game?  EDIT (from comment below): I was thinking more of the inter squad games they were playing. They would still have their closed off from public so they could concentrate on how to play the other team. The Inter Squd game with a crowd would give the feeling that it is just a regular season game and keep them in that mind set

1068,Knock-on vs batting the ball down,I recently saw a game where a player on the defense knocked down a pass. He was given a yellow card and sent to the sin bin. It looked like the referee said the word 'cynical'. Is there a difference between a knock-on and deliberately knocking the ball down (which is what it appeared happened)? Why does this behavior warrant a yellow card? 
1069,Which criteria does the ref look for when judging whether or not the pitch is suitable for a game?,"I have recently seen a number of matches where prior to the start of the game heavy rain made the pitch pretty hard to play on. Interestingly some of these matches were postponed (e.g. recent qualifier between Poland - Englad) whereas some others did not (this weeks Champions League match between Galatasaray - Cluj).   In the second case it was pretty obvious that there would be absolutely no quality of football due to the conditions on the pitch due to erratic behavior of the ball on ""grass"" (terrible bounce, passes getting stuck on puddles, players sliding uncontrollably...)  Now that game reminded me of Euro 2008 match between Turkey and Austria, during which rain had made the game practically impossible for both teams and unexpected ball behavior caused a rather silly goal.   THat being the background, when the refs go out on the pitch to judge whether or not to start the game, what do they look for? Are there specific/descriptive criteria with which they take their decision? "
1070,Most number of extra-time Goals,"On 30-Oct-2012, Arsenal defeated Reading with an incredible score of 7-5. A more astonishing fact is that 4 goals were scored in Extra-time.

1071,Career of a cricketer,"I need to clarify some doubts about the career of a cricketer.   If a player played for Under-19 international matches, will they be added in his ODI career? If a player played any domestic matches like IPL, CLT20, will they be added in his Twenty20 career? What is the difference between Twenty20 career and T20I career? What are First-class, List-A matches? When these matches were played?  "
1072,Timed out in cricket,"I've learned that timed out means the batsman takes over 3 minutes to enter the field of play after a wicket falls.   Which batsman will be given out for this? (ie, whether the batting team had any chance to give wicket of any of its batsmen or the wicket will be given according to the batting order) Will this wicket be given to the bowler? Will this innings be counted +1 to the career of the batsman? Are there any batsman given timed-out in international cricket history?  "

1078,Are Hookers the only players allowed to take lineout throws?,When lineouts take place in Rugby Union I have only ever seen Hookers being the player who takes the throw in.

The distances will be 400m-750m swimming / 20km cycling / 2-5km running.   Are there shoes that work for cycling (with click system) and running as well? Or is it better to have two seperate pairs that can be changed quickly?  (So far I have only done swimming and cycling so I don't have any shoes for running yet) 
1085,"Possible dismissals off a noball, wide ball and free hit","I came to know that a batsman can be stumped out off a wide ball but not off a no-ball (Is it correct?)  What are the possibilities to dismiss batsmen, off a noball, a wide ball, a freehit ball and two or three pitched(dead)ball? "
1086,Can a player play after retirement?,"If a player announced his retirement from international sports, Can he get back his retirement and play?  Who will decide on that(either the player or the country's sports authorities)? "
1087,"What does ""filing retirement papers"" actually mean?","This might be applicable to any worldwide major sport, but I'm most familiar with how it pertains to the 4 North American major sports.  What does it mean when a player files their ""retirement papers"" with their respective league?  I know in the NFL or MLB it starts the clock for when you can be considered for the Hall of Fame.  But does that process categorize the athlete in other ways?  I think I also heard that you have to go through some formal reinstatement process in order to play again (Brett Favre and Michael Jordan are good examples).  Does anyone know the terms of these retirement papers? "
1088,What is the maximum number of red cards that a referee can give in a football match?,"What is the greatest possible number of red cards that a referee can give in a football match?  Does such a limit even exist?  If so, does it vary from league to league and tournament to tournament? "
1089,Do sport players have pension rights?,"Do players have pension benefits or retirement plans?  Unlike other employees, they can't work until the age of 65 and usually have a second career after they retire from their sport, generally before the age of 40.  Is there something official? "
1090,How could a trade take place after the trade deadline?,"In August 2012, roughly several weeks after the trade deadline, the Red Sox and the Dodgers made a trade in which the Red Sox sent players, worth over $250 million in remaining salary, to the Dodgers.  It has been widely understood that July 31st is the trade deadline for the MLB each season. How could a trade take place after the trade deadline? Were there special circumstances that allowed this trade to go through? "
1091,What determines the spot of a field goal kick in the NFL?,Is there a limit to how close the ball gets spotted behind the line of scrimmage during a field goal attempt?  I regularly watch the NFL and on the field goals the holder awaits for the ball about 8 yards behind the line of scrimmage. It seems like the ball is always kicked from 8 yards behind the scrimmage no matter the yardage of the kick; ie. if it's a 20 yard attempt or a 60 yarder. Although at times this distance looks to be much closer to 7 yards than 8. Is there a rule that dictates this distance has to be respected or all teams have converged to kick about 8 yard behind the scrimmage over time? 
1092,How are UEFA Champions League group ranks decided in this convoluted situation?,"Suppose two teams in the same group are tied at 4 points each with the same number of goals, but they  did not tie the head-to-head match the other won, and they did not play the last match of the group against each other.  How is the final ranking in the group determined if these teams are ranked in second and third of the group between themselves? Does the head-to-head rule apply here? "
1093,Are ballroom dance competitions just for trophies only?,"I visited several dancesports web sites, such as the 2018 New England Dancesports Championships, and I only see entry fees mentioned.   There is no mention of any prizes. What are the prizes? Are dance competitions just for flowers and trophies? "
1094,When exactly did Dale Earnhardt crash?,I've been researching Dale Earnhardt's fatal crash at Daytona in 2001.  I have yet to find any mention of the exact time when the crash happened.  Is there a credible source that lists the precise time that the crash occurred? What exactly was that time? 
1095,"Who are the ""Olympic Athletes from Russia""?","Who are the ""Olympic Athletes from Russia""?  I was watching the 2018 Winter Olympics and saw ""Olympic Athletes from Russia."" Why isn't this done for other countries such as ""Olympic Athletes from the United States"" or ""Olympic Athletes from Italy""?   "
1096,Signal for off-side and indirect free kick in association football,"In association football, I'm confused as to how the referee is expected to indicate an indirect free kick at the time of the offence. He spots the offence, blows his whistle, and then he needs to indicate which team is awarded the free kick by raising his arm at a 45° angle pointing towards that team's attacking side. At that point, i.e. way before the kick is about to be taken, does he also need to indicate that the free kick is indirect with an arm raised vertically or does he only indicate indirectness when the kick is about to be taken ? I'm assuming he would not raise both arms at once.  This video didn't make that clear to me. My understanding from this video is that the referee would have his arm raised vertically from the moment he awards the free-kick up until when the ball is played and touched by another player. This makes no sense to me since in the meantime the referee might need to deal with objection or wall-placing, or may simply need to wait for a ball to be provided.  I also have the feeling that when an off-side offence is called, the referee signals it differently from other indirect free-kick offences. I can't find a video on Youtube where the referee is actually on the screen at the moment the off-side is called, but I seem to remember that they immediately raise an arm vertically, without indicating which team is awarded the free-kick. Granted, if it's an offside, then there's no confusion. But I'm pretty sure that in other cases, like in an obstruction offence, the referee would indicate which team it goes to, and indicate indirectness later on ? "
1097,What's the point of winning the opening tip off in basketball?,"In basketball, if you get the ball during the opening tip off, the other team gets the ball at the start of the 2nd and 3rd quarter and you only get the ball at the start of the 4th quarter.  So there is no advantage to winning the opening tip off and no disadvantage to losing the tip off because both teams start with the ball an equal amount of times. If that's the case, why even have a tip off? Why not just start the game the same way you'd start every other quarter? "
1098,What are these additional white lines on the cricket pitch?,"Some cricket pitches have an additional white line, perpendicular to both the bowling crease and popping crease, and joining both of them. One example is of the Eden Garden stadium pitch (2016)   video source    I have highlighted the line in question in a pink box. There are three more lines, a total of two on each side of the pitch. I checked Law 7 - The Creases and Law 6 - the Pitch, and could not find any reference to these lines.  What are they? Are they not standard lines i.e. why are they not on every pitch? What is their purpose?  "
1099,What are rifle specifications in Biathlon?,"I'm watching the Olympics Biathlon right now, and wonder what is that rifle? For sure, it must be a custom made rifle only for biathlon, but what are the specifications?  Is it a true bullet, or some kind of paintball? If a contestant was to go bonkers and try to shoot someone else, would it hurt/be deadly? "
1100,Too many players on the basketball court,"After making substitutions, we accidentally had 6 players on the court (5th grade girls).  I called a timeout when I saw it (after maybe 5 seconds elapsed), and was granted the timeout. The refs did not realize we had 6 players until after allowing me the timeout when somebody from the stands yelled out.  I was then given a technical and still charged me with the timeout. Should I still have been assessed the technical foul?  Should I still have been charged the Timeout? While I acknowledge this was a fault on my part, it seems unfair that I got charged with both the technical and the timeout. "
1101,What is the origin of the myth that Dutch are good speed skaters because it's a mode of transportation for them?,"During the opening ceremony of the current Winter Olympics, NBC presenter Katie Couric commented the following when the delegation from the Netherlands was making their rounds through the stadium:     It is probably not a news flash to tell you the Dutch are really, really good at speed skating. All but five of the 110 medals they’ve won have been on the speed skating oval. Now, ‘Why are they so good?’ you may be asking yourselves. Because skating is an important mode of transportation in a city like Amsterdam which sits at sea level. As you all know, it has lots of canals that can freeze in the winters. So, for as long as those canals have existed, the Dutch have skated on them to get from place to place, to race each other, and also to have fun.   (source: Business Insider)  The article mentions it's bogus; I'm Dutch, and while I do like skating on natural ice, I've never used it to travel and I do not know anyone who did either. Also, most winters the ice doesn't even get thick enough to skate except on rinks and ponds.   I've heard this particular myth before, and I was wondering if there's anything known about its origins; who coined it, or where was it mentioned first? "
1102,How is the scoring determined in Winter Olympic Sports?,"I'm watching the Winter Olympics on television here in the U.S. I don't know too much about winter sports, especially the nuances of Olympic competition. However, watching the downhill skiing competition, the commentary regarding slope conditions suggests that the slope itself can be the difference in the sport.  The other night, I was watching ski jumping, and they had wind speed factored into the score. Why is this not a part of the scoring? Does the Olympic committee have oversight of rules, or are those defined per sport? "
1103,"Why, specifically, is George Asanidze's record not 181kg?",Do the official olympic weightlifting rules really not count 1kg increments? Why? Seems like unit and fractional weights should count.  [website]
1104,"What is the point of the ""Small Final"" in Snowboard Cross?","Last night I watched the women's snowboard cross event of the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics.  After the semifinal races and before the final race (officially known as the ""Big Final""), NBC showed what they called a consolation race - the ""Small Final"".  This race included the 4th through 6th place finishers of the two semifinal races.  I know some events will have a consolation match that determines who wins the bronze medal.  But this ""Small Final"" race determined who finished in 7th through 12th place.  What is the point of that?  Why does it matter who finishes in 7th through 12th place? "
1105,Why do skiers use poles in slalom and downhill?,"I'm watching the Olympics. The skiers in the ""classic"" events like giant slalom or the downhill carry poles. But they never seem to use them for anything. I don't see the poles touch the ground unless it's part of falling. Some of the slalom skiers seem to use the guard on the pole to push the gates aside, but a big rigid glove could maybe serve that purpose. There also seems to be a role in getting back up after falling, but that is not a normal part of a run.  Is it habit or tradition? Does it help them to balance, like the long pole a tightrope walker uses? Is it for the first few strides at the very beginning of the race?  I know that ski jumpers and arials don't use them, so it's certainly possible to get down a hill without poles. What value do they bring? "
1106,What happens when time runs out in Curling Olympics matches?,During the Olympic Games in curling it is easy to see two stopwatches (one per team) with a time that starts from 38 minutes each .   What happens if the time should end for a team?  Has this situation ever occurred? 
1107,What could be the advantage of doping in curling?,"I've seen reports that one of the OAR athletes in curling in these Olympics (Pyeongchang 2018) might have failed a Doping test.  I really wonder... what could be the advantages of doping in curling? Curling is not a sport of power, or endurance... they rarely throw the rock full power, and even then, a little bit more or less power will probably still to the job just fine.  So why could a curler be using performance enhancing drugs? "
1108,Why is the first false start allowed an exception while the second is not?,"The first skater to make a false start is pardoned. But the second skater, even if it is not the same person, is disqualified.  What is the logic behind that? Why, if I'm not at fault in the first false start, would I be disqualified if I provoke the second one? "
1109,Can a player be replaced after the team is announced for a cricket match?,"After a team has been named, can any players be replaced?  What is the limit of this replacement? For example, if half the team were injured while warming up, can they be substituted or otherwise swapped out?  Does the same rule apply if this were to happen during the first innings or between innings? "
1110,Was Elizabeth Swaney the second lowest ranked competitor going into the women's halfpipe skiing?,"Elizabeth Swaney got her own twitter moment saying that she qualified for the women's halfpipe skiing by gaming the system. That she met the requirement of being in the top 30 by competing in events with fewer than 30 competitors, and then going to enough events to get sufficient points to qualify.  However, the Wikipedia article Freestyle skiing at the 2018 Winter Olympics – Women's halfpipe says that she had a bib number of 23, while Rosalind Groenewoud from Canada had a bib number of 24. The article Freestyle skiing at the 2018 Winter Olympics – Qualification mentions that four Canadians could have qualified but they only sent two, so I assume their competitors are reasonably strong.  The bib numbers and the results of competitors in the qualification seem fairly well correlated, so I assume they're based on a ranking. Groenewoud's FIS profile doesn't seem to indicate that she was out of action for a huge amount of time.  Was Swaney the lowest ranked competitor going into the women's halfpipe skiing? Also, if Swaney was the lowest ranked competitor, is there any individual we can point to as being denied a spot in women's halfpipe skiing as a result of her presence? There's the possibility that another Hungarian may have lost the ability to compete in another event, but that's a separate question. "
1111,Are all sizes of paint ball compatible with all paintball guns?,I am going to buy different sizes of paint balls for different paintball guns.  Can I use any size ball in any gun? Should I be concerned with the compatibility of each ball and gun? 
1112,Why do curlers blank on purpose?,"Watching the 2018 Winter Olympics games I've noticed a few times that the team with the hammer doesn't go for an easy shot on their last stone. Instead of just putting the stone on or near the button when the circle is quiet empty, they hit the other teams stone and clear up all the stones.   What's the reason behind this? Are there rules regarding when a team can put a stone on the button? Or will this move give the team an advantage moving forward in the game? "
1113,Power Plays in the Final Period,"After watching the US-Canada Women's gold medal match, where the Canadian's had 30 seconds remaining in a power play following the end of the last period, I have to ask a question. If you know that a shootout is likely, why doesn't one team use their weakest shooter, who would suffer a penalty, to slam into the opposing team's best shooter with the hope of causing a performance-impacting injury? Of course, this would not be a respectable action, but, other than sportsmanship, what reason is there to not field this strategy? Sure the advantage gained for the shootout may be nominal, but even a tiny error in skating or handling can cause a shooter or goalie to miss. "
1114,Which player gets the assist in this situation?,"I've been collecting stats for a soccer team.   I'm using definition of assist from soccerstatmanual which is, an assist is awarded for a pass leading directly to a goal.   I have two situations I'm looking for answers on,  1st Situation  - player A passes ball to player B  - player B strikes the ball, shot is blocked  - player B strikes the ball again and scores  Do you award A with an assist?  2nd Situation  - player X serves the ball  - player Y strikes the ball off which is deflected by player Z, ball goes into the goal  Whom gets the assist? "
1115,Does shaving your legs really matter in swimming/cycling?,"For many many years, elite swimmers (well, actually any swimmer with a big meet) will shave almost everything from their bodies, and serious cyclists will do the same.  The claim is that shaving reduces drag and thus makes you faster, but has this ever been proven? Or is this merely apocryphal lore? "
1116,Snooker fouls before tv,"When a foul occurs in snooker, they use ""instant replay"" or whatever to put the balls back in their original position if the opponent wants the shooter to try again.  How did they do this before TV? I mean, if the cue ball didn't touch anything, I could see both players agreeing on where it was, but sometimes many balls are moved.  And, what happened if the players could not agree on the spot? "
1117,"Has any information come out that clarifies how sick Jordan was during his famous ""flu game""",Michael Jordan's flu game is one of his most famous performances as a basketball player. Yet I remember that at the time there was some question about how sick he really was: had he been acting some to mislead his opponents?  Has any information come out since that gives further indication of how ill or well he really was? 
1118,"What's the purpose of making a ""below slot"" high round draft pick?","This question applies to Major League Baseball, where teams have an ""allowance"" on which they can spend for players in various slots.  In the first round, the Pittsburgh Pirates surprised many people, when the selected high school short stop, Cole Tucker, with the 24th overall pick when at least some would say that Michael Chavis (26th overall) was better at that spot.  As I (and others) suspected, Tucker was signed for [tex]125,000 less than the slot ""allowance."" Most of this difference was used to sign pitcher Mitch Keller with an above slot bonus in the second round.  Why would a team ""skimp"" on the first round in order to use the money in the second round? Aren't most of the impact players in the first round, meaning that you get the ""biggest bang for the buck"" there? And if the Pirates wanted Keller so badly, why not just draft him in the first round (Tucker was a relative unknown who might have lasted into the second round)? "
1119,Can you keep the ball if it is thrown at the audience?,I have always wondered. Do people keep the balls? What happens? 
1120,How is FIFA world cup schedule created?,"For example, on 13/06 it was Spain and Netherlands. How are the matching teams decided and based on what? What are these groups? Sorry, I'm new to football and this site.   "
1121,How do teams progress to the 2nd stage in case of same points?,"I am not very familiar with football. I only follow football matches during world cups. Suppose two teams end up the first group with same points then how the final group standing is decided? I can see Wins, Draws, Loses, Goals For, Goals Against, Goals Difference and Team Points in the group standing table. So my question: what is counted prior? At least I know team point is counted (compared) first. But if points are equal then on what basis the group standing is decided?  Related: Qualification decision in group stages when everything is equal "
1122,Hand ball and free-kicks,"If I kick the ball into the opponents hand, do I get a free kick due to hand-ball by the opponent? Can I keep on doing this until I'm right in front of their net? "
1123,What guidelines would a World Cup official follow when deciding whether to book a player for hitting another when contesting a ball in the air?,"During the U.S.'s World Cup match against Ghana today, I was surprised to see that the player who kicked Clint Dempsey in the face while contesting a ball in the air wasn't booked. I've seen bookings given for accidental elbows (or ""accidental"" elbows) and this seemed worse: you're clearly endangering the other player by raising your foot so high. Is this a case of the referee judging that the hit was accidental?  Of course if none of the officials see the hit happen nothing will be called, but in the case of today's game I don't think that's the case; the hit occurred very close to the ball. But even if the official didn't see, what if he had? "
1124,Effects of altitude on athletic performance,"It is well known that the performance of athletes who suddenly move to a location at a higher altitude than they are used to will suffer; when sports events such as the Olympics are held in a high altitude location, athletes often move to the area much earlier in order to adapt.  The question I haven't been able to find an answer to is: How big of an altitude difference is significant? E.g. Will a sprinter who lives and trains at sea level feel any different competing at 200 - 300 m above sea level? "
1125,How international teams decide on jersey number?,On what basis jersey number will be given to players in their international teams if jersey number used in their leagues clashes? for example Torres and Villa share same jersey number 9 in Chelsea and Atletico Madrid respectively. Why it is given to Torres? 
1126,FIFA World Cups History: Defending Champion Knocked Out in First Round?,"As you all might have seen on 18th June, 2014 that Spain, winner of Last FIFA World Cup 2010 was knocked out in first round. I need to know that is it happened first time or it did happen in any past World Cup? If yes, then when and which team?  I don't know much about previous FIFA World Cups. "
1127,How is 'distance covered' tracked in football (soccer) at the World Cup and during other official competitions?,"In most football leagues, and now the World Cup, distance covered is now a commonly-shared statistic.  Are there trackers in the boots? Do the players have chips implanted in their brains? How is 'distance covered' tracked?    Related: How to find “distance covered” for players during the World Cup? "
1128,Does stoppage time actually equal all non-playing time during a half?,"After every half during a football (soccer) game, the refs add stoppage time to the clock to compensate for lost time due to injuries and penalties.  But how closely does stoppage time equal real game time lost? (Are there different stoppage time calculations for different leagues?)  And if it's nearly exact, then what's the logic in delaying or faking injuries, as players on a winning team are often accused of doing. Wouldn't that delay just be tacked on at the end of a game or half? "
1129,"Is there a ""hypernym"" for ""free base.""","Is there a common word for ""base on (four) balls,"" hit by pitch, balk, or anything else that might let a batter get on first base without hitting the ball? The term I liked to use was ""walk,"" but I've been told that is synonymous with ""base on balls,"" and doesn't include the others.   Or does it? "
1130,How does the NBA salary cap work?,"I'm not American, and I live in a foreign country. I have been watching NBA since about 2000. I was a New jersey fan, when Kidd went to Mavs, I became a Mavs fan and still am.  As far as I know, the Mavs sold Barea and Chandler to have more salary cap. Mavs then won the NBA Championship and sold everyone next season and bought old Carter, and I wonder why, and I keep hearing about the cap!  I have been playing EA sport and there's a cap, 2Ksports there's a cap. What is a cap?  More importantly, how could Miami afford James + Wade + Bosh + all the other players while the Mavs couldn't?  How could Brooklyn buy all these guys? How could Clippers do it?  And lastly if it's not the cap, why else would the Mavs sell everyone, when they are the champs. In theory, the champ should be the one who gets the most money.   "
1131,What is the statistical disadvantage of playing a man down?,"How much does it hurt a football (soccer) team to play a man down? What about two men down?  How does that cost shift depending upon whether the team is up or down at the time of the penalty - does playing down a man more heavily impact defense or offense?  Related: Are there ever any scenarios when playing down a man can actually improve a team's odds of winning? (Doubtful, I know, but I've heard of crazier paradoxes.)  Is there research out there on short-handed odds?   (Short-footed is probably the more appropriate term.) "
1132,End of the game: does the referee have to wait for the end of an action to blow the final whistle or can they do it whenever they want?,"I was watching today's World Cup game between France and Switzerland. At the end of the game the referee blew the final whistle while the French team was attacking and right after a French player scored a goal:     The referee blows his whistle. And he's the Clive Thomas de nos jours,   because a split second later, Benzema is lashing a first-time   conversion of a right-wing cross into the top left from the edge of   the area! He races off to celebrate France's sixth goal, but it won't   count!   Does the referee have to wait for the end of an action to blow the final whistle or can they do it whenever they want? In case of the latter, why don't games end at e.g. 91:00, 92:00, 92:00... sharp? "
1133,How are the uniform colours determined in the World Cup?,"Choosing jersey and shorts colours for all concerned seems to be a reasonably complicated process:   each team has a set of colours they consider theirs (from their flag, or associated with them) any pair of teams might both want, say, red and white, but they need to be easily distinguished on the field the goalkeepers need to be in a different colour than both teams the refs are in a fifth colour   I have seen ref shirts that match colours I've seen on teams, so it's not that there are separate pools of colours to choose from for each category. I confess I am not paying enough attention to notice if a given keeper always wears the same colour or if top and bottom on a keeper always match.  So, how is this sorted out? Are there rules? Is there some colour-assigning ceremony? Do teams have to submit their uniforms for approval?  And then there's the ""I'm not on the field"" pinny that any player in uniform but not playing wears. I've seen these in brown and purple. Are these chosen not to conflict with any uniforms, or must someone work all those combinations out also? "
1134,Why do some soccer players wear small shin guards?,I've noticed that Thomas Müller of Germany wears very small shin guards (at least most of the time). If I remember correctly he did the same thing during the last world cup or Euros. I played a bit of soccer when I was young and can't understand why a professional player would refuse to wear shin guards that cover all their shins. They are the only thing that keep you away from seriously hurting your shins and going through ridiculous pain. So what's the reason behind this? Why would you leave a considerable amount of your shins unprotected and risk getting injured?? 
1135,Why do World Cup teams bring kids out onto the pitch before the game,"I'm watching USA vs. Portugal right now, and both teams have brought kids out onto the field for the national anthems. But it's not just these two teams that do it, it seems like every team, even in past World Cups does it.  Are the team players bringing out their children? Or are the children symbolic of something greater? "
1136,How do I read this chart about a FIFA World Cup game from Google?,"Throughout the World Cup the Google Doodle has been FIFA themed, and clicking it takes you to a search for the latest game. Today it's United States vs Portugal.  The search brings up a chart which appears to be a summary of the game. It looks like it should be obvious what everything means but I can't make heads or tails of it.  Is this a standard football (soccer) game chart?  If so, how is it meant to be read?  Is there a key available?  Full chart reproduced below in case Google results change.   "
1137,Is football's (soccer's) popularity in the US increasing?,"How is soccer trending in the United States? Anecdotally, it seems like the World Cup is generating a lot more interest here this year than it did when it was hosted here twenty years back.  I'm not seeking opinions (""I think it's a lot more popular, and so does my pet lizard!"") as I already have my own one of those to not trust.  My question is this:  Are there any metrics that can indicate whether US interest in soccer is rising faster than just the rate of US population growth?  I'm open to any source of data that might reasonably be measured against a baseline:    Growth rate of participation in soccer leagues over time vs. other sports Soccer equipment gross sales vs. that of other sports Etc.   TV ratings struck me as one good proxy, but just going off TV ratings may be tricky, due to confounding factors - Sunday's US vs. Portugal match was watched by 25 million people in the US, beating out the previous record for a soccer game (1999 Women's World Cup final) by about 7 million viewers. It also beat out viewership of the latest World Series and the NBA Finals, by about 10 million viewers each. And US TV ratings for the 2014 World Cup are ~50% greater than they were for the 2010 World Cup. But... that World Cup was in South Africa, which was 6 hours later than New York, and 9 hours later than LA. Plus, the US wasn't in the hyper-competitive ""Group of Death"", with no Ronaldo star power to keep casual fans glued to their TVs.  TV ratings may help to determine a general trend for football's (soccer's) popularity in the United States, but can anyone find or point me toward other stats that may paint a more complete picture? "
1138,"How much of an effect does a ""Group of death"" have on teams winning the World Cup?","In the context of the FIFA World Cup, does a team being placed in a ""Group of death"" have much of an impact on the likelihood of a team winning the tournament?  For example, would a mid-ranking team have its likelihood of winning the tournament, prior to any matches being played, be 1 in 10 if it's in an easy group, and 1 in 100 if it's in a difficult group, or would the difference be more like 1 in 10 versus 1 in 10.1? "

Of those, if any, did there happen to be anyone who played in a Little League World Series championship game?   "
1141,How does basketball overtime strategy differ from regulation?,"Both teams have demonstrated they can achieve similar offensive production. Does defense become more important? Is there a unique strategy regarding three-point field goals, steals, assists or other changes? "
1142,Are there reports of Luis Suárez biting other players (but not getting caught)?,"On 24 June 2014, Uruguayan striker Luis Suárez was accused of biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini during the 80th minute of Uraguay's 1-0 group stage win. It wasn't the first time Suárez was accused of biting an opposing player. Suarez was suspended 10 games in 2013 after biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic. In 2010, while playing for Ajax, Suárez was suspended 7 games for biting PSV's Ottman Bakkal.  These 3 incidents are now well known. But are there lesser known biting incidents in Suárez's past? Are there any quotes by other players suggesting Suárez plays even dirtier than we might imagine? "
1143,Do minor league hockey teams pay their players?,"How are minor league hockey teams financed?  Does the team pay the players themselves, or are their contracts paid for by the NHL parent franchise?  I recall that before the 1967 NHL expansion, Hall-of-Famer Eddie Shore owned the Springfield Indians AHL team and owned the contracts of its players.  He often made injured players earn their keep when missing games by selling programs.  All players had to help clean the arena.  The LA Kings wanted one of Shore's players, but he refused to sell.  Kings owner Jack Kent Cooke bought the Indians from Shore to get the player. "
1144,Why do some tennis broadcasts show the player's country next to their name?,"For example, see this screenshot of the broadcast of the men's final from the 2018 Australian Open, between Roger Federer and Marin Cilic. [website]They show the player's country flag next to their name. I noticed that not all tournaments will do this, it depends on the people broadcasting the match.  I can understand if it was an Olympic event or something like the Davis Cup, where the players are representing and playing for their countries. However, in most other instances, tennis is an individual sport, and the player is representing and playing solely for themselves, so knowing their nationality is unnecessary.   My questions:   Why do the broadcasts show this information? What purpose does it serve? Why do some broadcasts show it, but some do not?  "
1145,Details regarding two step rule,"If a player is running and bouncing, is he allowed to catch the ball - for simplicity let's assume that he has both feet in the air through all the time interval whose beggining is marked by start of the catching and whose end is marked by the completion of gaining control of the ball - can he take two steps (by this I mean land with his foot A on the ground, and then - without moving the foot A - land with his foot B on the ground, effectively setting both feet on the ground) and then just stand like it, without releasing the ball at all?  The official FIBA rules, [website]""A player who catches the ball while he is progressing, or upon completion of a dribble, may take two steps in coming to a stop, passing or shooting the ball""  which almost explicitly says that what I described is legal. Yet, I ask this question because I've always been taught that after taking two steps as described above, the rules impose that it is necessary to pass or shoot. So, I'm interested if:  1) it used to be that releasing the ball was necessary under FIBA rules, but after the changes of travelling rules so they would be more similar to NBA, holding the ball (after two steps) became legal, 2) it was always legal and the enforcement of releasing the ball under FIBA rules was just a commonly taught misinterpretation, 3) in fact ""coming to a stop"" here is to be understood in some peculiar way and after taking two steps a player is still obliged to release the ball.  Also, I'd be grateful for answering the above questions in the NBA case, I know that the article concerning travel is largely (or completely) the same as in the FIBA case:  [website]""A player who receives the ball while he is progressing or upon completion of a dribble, may take two steps in coming to a stop, passing or shooting the ball.""  but I'm not sure if I understand everything correctly, perhaps the accepted interpretation of these rules is peculiar.  Also, if stop (after two steps) is legal, then what are options for a player remaining in such a stop? Basing on my reading of rules, I'd suppose that a player can pivot with the foot A; lift the feet B; jump and release the ball with two feet. But I'd like to be sure. "
1146,Why are the NCAA volleyball seasons for men and women different?,"In the NCAA, the women's volleyball season runs from late August/early September until December. The men's volleyball season runs from January to early May. Why the difference?  Is it due to the women having a beach season in the spring? Why don't men have beach volleyball? "

1150,What happens if you knock the bails off while the batter is behind his crease?,"For example, a batter steps forward as he attempts to hit the ball. He misses, but is out of the crease. He quickly turns back and gets his bat over the line just before the wicket keeper knocks the bails off.  Does it make any difference to the score or game?  Just curious as I'm watching a game and this happened, but the wicket keeper stopped just before he knocked the bails off. I'm wondering why he didn't knock the bails off anyway, just in case?  Edit: and a follow up question to this. If it's not against the rules, what stops the wicket keeper just doing this randomly to waste time or for some other reason? "
1151,Has any player in NFL history been drafted to more than one team?,Has there ever been an NFL player that was drafted by multiple teams?  How did they manage to do so? 
1152,How do you calculate a ten-pin bowling strike rate?,"I'm a USBC League Bowler, and I'm tracking my own stats, and I want to know my Strike Rate Percentage.  Theoretically, you would take and divide the number of frames bowled by the number of strikes bowled, but how do you account for the tenth frame? If I bowl a perfect game, that's 100%. But let's take this scenario where I bowled a 232.    As you can see here I have 8 strikes in the game and 2 of them in the tenth frame. 8 strikes / 10 frames is 80% strike rate, but not when 2 of the strikes are in the tenth frame. 8 strikes / 12 first throw chances for 75%.   How do I figure this out in Excel? "
1153,Why do F1 drivers move towards the pit wall at the end of the race?,"On the last lap, at the start-finish straight, just as they are ending the race, F1 drivers (especially those at the front) move their car off the racing line towards the wall.  I'm guessing that they do that to make sure they won't be overtaken, but I can never find an explanation anywhere.  Why do they do so? Is there a rule that says you can't be overtaken on the outside at the end of the race? "
1154,How is a passer rating calculated?,"How is a Quarterback's passer rating calculated in the NFL? In the NFL, all of the stats like YPG, and average fantasy points are calculated somehow. How is a passer's rating calculated? Does it have something to do with the average yards gained per completion, or other countless QB statistics? What is the formula that is used to calculate the passer rating? "

1156,Why are marathon runners so tactical? Any reasonable reason?,"I wonder why marathon runners are so tactical.  As far as I watch them on TV, there seems no doubt to me that they control their pace according to that of others.  I just suspect it would be better if they ignored others and focused their attention on their own pace so that they could finish in the shortest possible time.  Why are marathon runners so tactical?  Any reasonable reason? "
1157,Has any NFL team ever gone an entire season without trailing by 7 or more points?,"According to this article, the 2010 Green Bay Packers and 1962 Detroit Lions went the entire season without ever trailing in a game by more than 7 points.  (Did any other teams accomplish that?)  Has there ever been an NFL team whose largest deficit in one season was 6 points or less? "
1158,Playing again by the same player after hitting the net,"After receiving the service the ball hits the net. It is legal to continue as long as you are within the 3 hits limit.  But can the same player continue after hitting the net? Player 1 hits the net, the ball bounces, and then the same Player 1 continues by passing to another team member? "
1159,What happened to Polish football in 2014?,"I'm Polish and for my whole life I could just dream of spectacular successes of our national team, like in the 80s. However, about the year 2015 something changed, a lot. Our team started to mean something in the world's football. My question is: why was so?  I know Polish players started playing in not-so-shameful European clubs, like Borussia, Bayern, Arsenal and of course it mattered a lot but is it really a concidence that a sufficient number of them played in such clubs and it was enough to form a quite strong national team? In Poland much praise went down on Adam Nawałka, the manager of the team. In fact, his team didn't consist of stars only, he found some players from the Polish league.  Maybe it was money which appeared in the Polish league and infrastructure and level of schooling improved? Maybe Poland for some reason became interesting for foreign headhunters? I've got no idea. "
1160,"Two-handed ""attack"" return on a serve?","So I went over the Volleyball Canada rulebook for 2018-2019, but I couldn't find anything about a certain situation that occurs often when I play volleyball with friends/colleagues.  What will sometimes happen is that, during a service, a player on the front-row of the receiving team will jump and return the ball to the serving team by hitting it with both hands at the same time (as if he was trying to ""spike"" it with two hands). We're wondering whether this move is legal or not:   Is returning a serve from the front row by jumping legal? Is hitting the ball (in a spike-like motion) with two hands at the same time (contact is made with both hands) legal?   If that helps, when this happens, the ball is usually not over the net (net height), but below it. From our point of view, it looks like a full blown ""block"" or ""attack"". Not a receive, nor a set attempt. "
1161,NBA player to player match ups,"In the NBA, does the depth charts of one team match up with the depth charts in another team in terms of who will face who?  Let me explain:  Suppose the Celtics have Kemba Walker listed as a Starter for the Point Guard position and the 76ers have Ben Simmons listed as Starter for their Point Guard.  When the Celtics play the 76ers, is it safe to assume that Kemba Walker will face Ben Simmons on the court for most of the time that they are on the court on that game?  Whatever the answer is, will the same apply to Bench and Bench Warmers?  I hope I was clear thanks! "
1162,Baseball last inning pinch-hitting/pinch-running loophole?,"I was researching pinch hitting and running the other day, ands I thought of a possible loophole that could be used to get a walk off when in a bad situation in baseball.   The premise of the loop hole is pinching all of your best players. To elaborate, you pinch hit the first at-bat of the inning with a better hitter if they are not good at hitting. Then, if they get on base, you pinch run them with a better runner (or stealer, depending on your needs) is they are not good enough at running. Then, repeat until you either win or lose.  Would this loophole work? If it doesn’t, how could it be changed to work?  Note that this would be used in the bottom of the 9th inning. "
1163,Why is O'Sullivan always sitting on the left side?,In every snooker game I have watched O'Sullivan has always been sitting on the left side. Why? How is this decided in the first place?  
1164,Is grabbing the shoulder pads defensive holding?,"During the Monday night game between Green Bay and Detroit on 14 October 2019, Detroit’s Trey Flowers was twice penalized for “Illegal Hands to the Face” when he wasn’t really touching the face but was instead grabbing the shoulder pads under the chin. The result of the penalties was a first down, both happening at crucial moments for the Packers.   The ESPN announcer made a big deal about how the calls were wrong and that it affected the outcome of the game. However, a friend of mine pointed out that although “Illegal Hands to the Face” is not the correct call, it should have been penalized as “Defensive Holding,” which results in the same 5 yards and First Down.   Is this true? Is grabbing and holding the shoulder pads under someone’s chin considered Defensive Holding? "
1165,NFL football incentives,"How do incentives work in the NFL in respect to salary cap?  For example last season, if Nick Foles played 3 more snaps against the Redskins, he would have received $1,000,000 based on total plays that season.  However, how do those contract incentives work?  Do they count toward the salary cap?  I assume they would have to, as you could simply play a player $1, then give them easily reachable bonuses and incentives. "
1166,Single Elimination Blind Draw Bracket with # of Teams != 2^n,"I'm looking for an unbiased (hence the ""Blind Draw"") way of creating a single-elimination tournament bracket, but with a little twist. The number of teams I have will not be equal to 2^n. As a matter of fact it'll probably be odd too...  With this said, is there a method better than having random ""bye"" matches (example here)?  For a little background, the tournament is for a game of Jackal (teams of two), specifically, the direct variant, with a communal pot of money. As such, I'll want to start everyone on even ground, and with no free passes.  -  If I'm not mistaken, my question seems to be can I have a binary tree with  less than two branches somewhere...I'm just not sure. "
1167,"Is there such a thing as a ""one way player"" in tennis?","I'll use an example from baseball to illustrate my question. A designated hitter is someone who bats, but is not deployed on the field. In its extreme form, a ""one way player"" would be someone who was one of the best hitters in the game, but could not field as well as a good minor league player. Examples would be David Ortiz or Frank Thomas.  Are there people in tennis who are great servers but who have trouble at returning serve in the later stages of a major event? That is, they will almost never have their serve broken in a given match, but also almost never break serve? Meaning that a large number, if not the majority, of their sets are decided by tiebreakers?   Put another way, how ""lopsided"" are John Isner, Ivo Karlovic, or other similarly challenged world class players. "
1168,"How does handicapping work in ""social"" games of golf?","In a professional tournament, of course, there is no handicapping; the best (lowest) score wins. But among amateurs playing ""socially,"" a comparison of handicaps sometimes comes into play.  Suppose you are a ""scratch"" (par) golfer, and my history suggests that I will go ten strokes over, ""on average."" Then, we might handicap the game so that I win if I hold my overage to nine or fewer strokes than yours.   Why are  such handicaps given? Is it because informal bets are taken? Is it because it's a social way to give the weaker player an even chance to ""win?""  And apparently there is a technique to handicapping; that is, the weaker player is expected to get a par score on some holes, and is given say, a one stroke handicap on others (in my case, ten holes). How does that work? "
1169,What do different properties of a snooker cue affect?,"For example:   Is there any difference, playing wise, between a centre jointed cue and a 3/4 jointed cue? I would have thought that the only difference would be that a centre jointed cue is more portable because it wouldn't require as large a case, but many players seem to have 3/4 jointed cues, and there must be a reason for this Does wood type make a difference? Assuming they're the same weight, why would a maple cue be any better or worse than an ash cue, for example? What are the advantages and disadvantages of having a heavier or lighter cue? Is there any reason to go for a hand spliced cue over a machine spliced one? Overall, what are you paying for when you buy a £250 cue as opposed to a £100 cue?  "
1170,Why do football teams announce their formation before the game starts?,"While watching the pre-game for the 2015 Women's World Cup final, they said that Japan would be using a 4-3-3 formation. Why did Japan give up that strategic information? Wouldn't it be better to keep it secret so that the USA couldn't use that information to devise counter strategy? I can't imagine they are required to submit a formation ahead of time, because it is such an abstract thing. "
1171,Basketball shooting percentages while practicing,"What is a good percentage for making baskets when practicing/shooting around?  I was told 2 things for shooting by 2 different ppl.  One person said since no one is guarding me when practicing/shooting around, I should make all my shots.  This is very improbable since even the best pro shoots ~90% from the FT line.  Another case in point, even the pros won't hit all their shots when no one is guarding (I think Charles Barkley said something about how impossible it is for Curry to have hit 70 3ptrs in a row during practice or whatever he said during the 2015 playoffs)  Another person told me that when we practice shooting around, if we hit ~70% of our shots, that's good enough.  This makes a little more sense since:   We're not perfect and If someone is guarding us, that percentage will drop, e.g. if I shot 10% from a spot when no one is guarding me, I'll probably be shooting 3% WITH someone guarding me   So that brings us to my original question, what is a good percentage to shoot at when practicing so that I know I have decent proficiency from that spot/area? "
1172,Does the Daytona International Speedway have more crashes than other tracks?,"I'm watching the coverage of the delayed Coke Zero 400 on NBC, and as I write this, the race is about to begin.  The commentators seemed to suggest that drivers are much more likely to experience crashes at Daytona then they are on other tracks.  Is this true?  If so, why?  Admittedly, the start of the race has been delayed for a while now, and the commentators are probably running out of things to say.  I know very little about NASCAR, so I have no idea if it is true or not. "
1173,Would it be feasible to have Camera on the bat and ball?,"In current days, a camera is present everywhere - the stumps, boundary, umpire's hat etc. Would it be possible to have a camera on bat and ball as well? How would it disturb the aerodynamics of bat and ball? "
1174,"In what sense is the term ""pigeon"" used in tennis","I have encountered the word pigeon in connection with tennis players, for example, have a look here, here or here. It seems to be a slang term - at least I did not find it in any news article.  From the context it is clear that it has something to do with one player having bad H2H against another player. Could somebody give a clearer explanation when this word is used? Etymology of this phrase could also bit interesting. Has this originated from some common idiom in English? "
1175,What has historically been the effect of a long rain delay on a pitcher's arm?,"By ""long"" delay, I mean an hour or more.  On one hand, a pitcher that has pitched two or three innings, and is interrupted by rain gets a chance to rest.  On the other hand, perhaps a pitcher has warmed up, and gotten into a ""rhythm."" Then perhaps the delay ""undid"" all this work.  Has a pitcher been likely to pitch the same way after a rain delay as before? Suppose there is more than one rain delay in the game. Has it been  disruptive to most pitchers?  I was think in terms of last night's game, San Diego vs. Pittsburgh. Why did San Diego relieve its starter after two innings and an almost two hour rain delay, when he had given up no runs? "

I think Chapman had all but 2.  Has there ever been another pitcher who was this much ahead of the rest of the league?  In other words, has there been a pitcher who's fastball was so consistently much faster than anyone else's? "
1178,Is it possible for the libero to score points in volleyball?,"Is it possible for a libero to score points during a volleyball match?  I believe that libero cannot hit the ball, but he can set and receive, so is it possible that the ball passes over the net and falls in the opposite field?  Is there any example of the libero scoring points by the end of the match? "
1179,Is betting on oneself to win or lose legal?,"Is it legal for a player to bet on himself or on his team to win? to lose?   For example, could a player from Chelsea FC bet that his team will win the Champions League next year? Or could Cristiano Ronaldo bet that he will be the top scorer of La Liga next season?   This is not soccer specific, I am asking in general, is it legal for an athlete to bet on him or herself at all?  Is there any precedent for this? "
1180,"In Soccer, can it be a foul even if the player gets to the ball first?","There is a lot of confusion surrounding this topic, both from media and from fans.   For example, in the 2014 World Cup, Gonzalo Higuain was hit pretty hard by Manuel Neuer (with his knee), but no foul was given because Neuer touched the ball first.    However, just as an example, in this last Copa America, Jorge Fucile was given a second yellow after hitting Alexis Sanchez, despite getting to the ball first. Most commentators seemed to agree this was a foul.    In some of the video replays of the aftermath of this foul you can actually hear Fucile's teammates scolding the referee for the call because Fucile ""got the ball!!""    There's a lot of cases like this. What does the rulebook say about these fouls?  Were these two calls good? "
1181,How do College Drafts work?,"I am not American and this is something I do not understand about sports here in the US, so please bear with me. I know in the US, professional sports teams can't be ""relegated"" to a ""second Division,"" and instead get an earlier pick during the college draft if they perform worse. This makes sense - it allows teams with poor performance to pick themselves up by getting better reinforcements. However, this means potentially worse teams will get the best college players. It seems, then, that being an earlier ""pick"" in the draft is potentially a bad thing for a college athlete, since they will get picked up by a worse team (If I were a college soccer player, for example, I'd prefer to be picked up by Real Madrid than by Betis, theoretically).  This seems like it doesn't make sense - it seems like it would discourage athletic performance in college since players should prefer to be picked up by the teams that are winning championships and not the ones that are struggling.  So, how does it work? Where do the earlier picks in the draft end up, usually? Do the ""worse"" teams pick up the best players and them trade them instantly? "
1182,Relief/Closing pitcher statistics,"I was wondering about some of the stats that you regularly see in baseball, and what criteria must be met to achieve such a stat, primarily with the relief and closing pitchers.  I understand that a starting pitcher must go at least 5 innings and leave with his team up at the end of the inning to be considered for the win, however after that I do not quite understand the stats for the pitchers to follow.  To my best knowledge I believe that if the game ever gets tied up again or the winning team drops below the other team's score once the starter is out, they will receive a no decision for their performance, and if the team comes back and retakes the lead, then the pitcher for that inning will be eligible for the win (not sure if there is an innings pitched requirement), while the loss will be awarded to the pitcher that last gives up the lead (regardless of the amount of innings pitched).  The stats that I am wondering about include, saves, holds, and innings pitched requirements for the win in the event that a game gets tied up after the starter leaves. As far as the saves and holds, what are the differences? Is there any requirement for a relief/closing pitcher to get the win once the starter is no longer eligible for it? "
1183,Is there any difference between racing driver and formula 1 driver?,"I want to know if is there any difference between a racing car driver and a formula one driver?  Have a look at the 2 images I have attached, both from Google.  Against the name of Massa there is formula 1 driver is written whereas racing driver is shown against Jules Bianchi.  So this was my doubt as if there is any difference between formula one driver or racing driver?    "
1184,"Safety comparison, downhill mountain bike vs. downhill ski","My twelve-year-old recently tried downhill mountain biking when we were in Lake Placid.  He found it thrilling and would like to continue with this new sport now that we are back home.  I am hesitant for him to practice this sport on a regular basis because of safety concerns.  We allow - basketball (with mouth guard) - soccer (with shin guards -- by the way, should he use the mouth guard as well when he is playing goalie?) - swimming - tennis - cross country skiing - ice skating for fun  We do not allow games with a stick -- ice hockey, lacrosse.  And we do not allow American football or downhill skiing.  I'd like to be reasonably consistent with our existing policy!  Where does downhill mountain bike riding (on an established track at a reputable ski center) fit, on the scale of things?  He has asked for a full-face helmet and elbow and knee pads, because that's what he was given to use as part of the fee at Lake Placid.    Clarification: I'd like to avoid fractures, of course, but I'd mainly like to avoid really serious injuries and things that might leave him with longlasting health problems such as a knee or back that is never the same again.  I'm not worried about scratches or bruises. "
1185,Why is there no American team in Formula One?,"As far as I remember, even since the 90s, mostly European teams were racing in F1.  Is there any specific reason? Or is it just that Americans do not care about F1 because they have IndyCar, drag races and so forth?  I don't believe it is financial reasons, but what about technical reasons? Is it too complex to build a new car from scratch? "
1186,Indoor/Outdoor Rock Climbing Shoes,"I am looking at getting some shoes to start rock climbing, and I had a few questions about the shoes. I currently rent shoes, and use an indoor climbing wall, but I have a lot of friends that like to climb outdoors. Is there a difference in indoor vs outdoor climbing shoes, are there known hybrids if there are considerable differences?   Also is there any rule of thumb for how a shoe should fit and any brands that are known to cause issues (fall apart) or fit different compared to their size? "
1187,Most runners under 10s in a single 100m race?,What is the greatest number of runners ever to have gone below 10s in a single 100m race? Has there ever been an instance of all runners getting below 10s?  Just found that at the 2012 Olympics it would have been all eight except that Asafa Powell pulled a muscle half way through. So seven is the highest number I know of.

Then, I decided to try to figure out how this statistic is being calculated and could not find any search for the answer, and it brought me here.  In this case: ""Predicted Score (65.2 - 78.4)"" where the 65.2 is the current spread favorite at -1.5.  So my questions are:   How is this number being calculated? A computer using stats, experts, ratio of bets placed? Would that mean the favorite is actually a 13.2 point underdog?  "

1198,Is there any rule forcing a team to try to win?,"The Montreal Canadiens have been eliminated from the 2018 Stanley Cup Playoff contention, but now I cheer against them so they finish at the bottom of the standings, and might get first pick in the draft.  They did have a good chance of getting the first pick if they would lose the last 11 games of the season, but they decreased the chances of picking first by winning a game.  That triggered a question for me: Is there anything that prevents a team from just playing to lose? Could management ask them to throw the game for end season ranking purposes, orr is there a rule in place forcing teams to trust the process and try their best even if they are mathematically certain of missing the playoffs?

1200,Why didn't Lu Xiaojun get to lift 177kg at the 2012 London Olympic Games?,"See video here.    Why didn't the jury overturn the decision for Lu Xiaojun's attempt at 177kg at the 2012 London Olympic Games when he missed the minute countdown due to a ""tactical hiccup""?     ""...there's been some kind of strange clerical error there because   they started the clock and Lu Xiaojun ... oh this is very very   confusing because Lu Xiaojun's clock started too early there..."" -   commentator #1        ""...when you follow yourself in weightlifting you have two minutes on   the clock. He was only given one minute on the clock there because the   other lifter hasn't come out..."" - commentator #2   So, Lu Xiaojun wasn't following himself (technically), so he doesn't get two minutes, but was that really an oversight on their part? Just seems like a withdrawal from Lu Haojie should have been more apparent to the coach/everyone. Did Lu Xiaojun's coach think that the timer that was running was for Lu Haojie who silently posted no figure? Right after Lu Haojie's failed attempt at 175kg Lu Xiaojun successfully snatches 175kg, so that'd be 1 minute on the timer after Lu Xiaojun for Lu Haojie (who didn't see the stage), then Lu Xiaojun's 1 minute timer would have started immediately after. How did the coach/anyone not notice that the timer cycled twice first on behalf of Lu Haojie and then reset for Lu Xiaojun? Is this because in the one minute you're allotted you can either post or not post a figure, and that these postings are not immediately apparent? It stands to reason that a ""no post"" should have been made apparent. Why didn't Lu Xiaojun follow himself? What decides the order of lifts? Seriously, isn't this weird? The klaxon sounded on the second cycle for Lu Xiaojun's attempt at 177kg. Why didn't the klaxon sound at the end of Lu Haojie's 1 minute ""no post""? "

1203,Leaning at the end of a running race?,"I currently run the 400m and 800m with good times. I am still a little confused about how to end these races by leaning.  I'm not a 100 or 200m runner, but how would I lean at the end of those races if it is close? For example, in the Rio 2016 Olympic 200m final, Christophe Lemaitre leans quite early before the finish:     The runner who came fourth (and was incredibly close) quickly snapped his head forward instead.  Which way is more effective for this event?  However, in the 800m, would it be best to just place your chest forward or lean and possibly lose momentum? "
1204,Attacker makes blocker touch the net in volleyball. Who should be awarded the point?,"In the Rio 2016 Olympic volleyball final match's third set, a Brazilian player was spiking very close to the net. After his spike, his arm followed down, contacting the arm of the Italian blocking player, and making their hand touch the tape (the top of the net).  Since the ball was in play, the referee decided that this was a point for Brazil. But this touch of the net happened at about the same time as the ball hit the ground.  According to the rules, whose fault was this? Was it still the Italian player's fault because he touched the net, or was this a bad call by the referee, and should have been a point for Italy? "
1205,Are women allowed to compete in men's division in Olympic Games?,"Question  Are women allowed to compete in men's division in the Olympic Games? So, how is the ""men's division"" officially defined by the IOC? Is it explicitly for men only or is it an ""open division"" which allows women (at least in principle) to participate in the ""men's division"" in the Olympic Games?  If it does depend on the sport, what would be an example where women are allowed in men's division (in principal) and where they are explicitly not allowed?  How did this rule change in the past?   Were there any woman participating in the men's division in the history of the Olympic Games (except riding where no distinction between ""men and ""women"" exist)?  Some remarks   Calling a division ""men"" doesn't logically imply that only men many participate. For example at least in Germany I know a lot examples where girls compete in ""boys"" divisions if they are good enough, though the division is called ""boys"".  This also happens occasionally at more advanced levels, for example in table tennis the female player Li Jiao played in the played in the men's Eredivisie for Dutch club TTV Heerlen and won the championship (see: [website]Note that the question is about if it is in principle possible. Clearly in lots of sports the difference between men and women is very big. However one might imagine a women who is at mens elite level and wants to participate in mens Olympics for example because in the womens division there are no real competitors for her. So how are the IOC rules formulated, do they allow women in principle to participate in mens divisions?  "

It seemed like by the end of this, all the fielders were out and the batter was ready, so I presume it was a timer to get ready for the next half of the inning.  What happens if either the fielder or the batter take too long to get to get ready, i.e. the countdown timer runs out? Does the offending team get some sort of penalty? "
1211,Unbalanced conferences in the NBA,"In 2008, the Seattle Supersonics moved to Oklahoma City and became the Thunder, but because Oklahoma City was still in the Western Conference, the NBA still had a balance of 15 teams per conference.

Is there a video of actual zero-tempo attacks? "
1214,"When advantage is played on a DOGSO situation, and a goal is scored, should the offender always be cautioned?","This question was inspired by something that happened during a Serie A match between Napoli and Milan yesterday. A defender handles the ball to prevent it from crossing the goal line: advantage is played, an opponent shows up, collects the ball and scores (here is the relevant GIF). The defender was issued a yellow card. Now I am wondering: why is it a yellow card instead of a red card?  The way I see it, there is a difference between denying a goal to the opposing team (which can only be done by handling the ball on the goal line) and denying an obvious goal-scoring opportunity to the opposing team. This said, Law 12 reads:     If the referee plays the advantage for an offence for which a caution / send off would have been issued had play been stopped, this caution / send off must be issued when the ball is next out of play, except when the denial of an obvious goal-scoring opportunity results in a goal the player is cautioned for unsporting behaviour.   (Law 12)   This is NOT relevant to our situation, because the defender denied a goal and not an obvious goal-scoring opportunity. The following paragraph should be applied instead:     There are different circumstances when a player must be cautioned for unsporting behaviour including if a player [...] handles the ball [...] in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent a goal   (Law 12)   This is where I am questioning the referee's decision. It should not matter if the attacking team ended up scoring anyway: a goal has still been prevented, because what was scored next was another, different goal. So I think the right decision should have been to let the goal stand, and send the defending player off instead of just cautioning him.  Am I right, or is there anything in the Laws I am missing? "

1216,Blown save when starter is ineligible for a win,"I'm parsing some baseball data, so I need to be able to appropriately award saves, blown saves, holds, etc. In doing so, I came across some examples that I'm unsure how to handle.  Example 1: Suppose Adam is the starter and he leaves the game after 4 innings and his team is leading by a run. Billy comes in and pitches into the 8th, when he gives up the tying run. Is Billy charged with a blown save?  Example 2: Suppose pitcher Adam is the starter and he leaves the game after 4 innings and his team is leading by a run. Billy comes in and pitches a scoreless 5th and 6th. The score is unchanged when Charlie comes in in the 7th, and allows the tying run. Is Charlie charged with a blown save?  Example 3: Suppose pitcher Adam is the starter and he leaves the game after 4 innings and his team is leading by a run. Billy comes in and pitches a scoreless 5th. The score is unchanged when Charlie comes in in the 6th, and he pitches a scoreless 6th, 7th, and 8th. It is still a 1 run game when David comes in in the 9th, and records a scoreless 9th. Could the official scorer determine that Charlie deserves the win (hence David gets a save), while Billy gets a hold?  My intuition: 1) No, because there is no other pitcher eligible to receive the win. Hence, it's not truly a save situation, and Billy can't be charged with a blown save. 2) Yes, because Billy could be assigned the win, thus Charlie would have entered in a save situation. Therefore, he would be charged with a blown save. 3) No, it doesn't make any sense for a pitcher to get a hold and the pitcher that relieves him gets a win when their team does not surrender their lead.

Prominent examples that come to my mind are Ryan Giggs and Gareth Bale. I'm not sure how the regulation is with regards to the national team eligibility, do all citizens of UK have the liberty to choose any national side (in the UK that is)?   As a follow-up question, isn't it a bit tricky that UK is represented as one single team in some disciplines (e.g. track and fields) and as individual ""nations"" in other disciplines (e.g. football or rugby)? I mean, that could technically mean (or at least extrapolated to) that individual states in the U.S. could also have their national teams?  Could someone with more knowledge on this matter, help me (us) figure this out? :) "

The boys here argue Michael was nobody but an old guy, today's players are muscular than the players in 80's and 90's and well scientifically trained, so on and so forth. What is the general reaction in today's U.S about this?  What I would like to hear is the general air towards the sport, basketball ( if possible toward the NBA too ), compared with the general air in 80's and 90's.

1232,Tennis strings with the ulnar claw hand repetition injury?,"I am recovering from an Ulnar claw repetition injury, more here: apparently one reason is too tight synthetic narrow strings with extremely dense string pattern 16x19. I am still an amateur. I mostly play inside. I use Babolat Pure Drive Roddick. According to this video, I should not select co-poly strings because they do not absorb the vibration. Durable strings are not comfort strings according to Babolat video -- so apparently I should find comfort strings that are not durable?   Solution candidates        For more comfortable topspin, one plan is to have hitting surface with less dense pattern and not stiff strings (related where video visualises hitting surface).   Natural gut products such as Babolat VS Touch and Babolat Tonic+ are mentioned in this context due to its ability to absorb vibration.      Helper questions        Which factors should I look for in selecting the strings?    Soft strings with small tension?    Width? Which gauges and why? Details such as 15L and 16G mean the gauges, more here: ""The higher the gauge number, the thinner the string and typically measured in millimeters"".   Which kind of hitting surface? How densely knitted and the impact on comfort?     "
1233,"Durable tennis players with strings of monofilament, why?","The Babolat advertising here mentions the durability with players such as Rafael Nadal. According to google, durability means ""the ability to withstand wear, pressure, or damage"". I am not sure what it means here: it does not certainly mean too muscular because muscle is very expensive cell in terms of natural metabolism rate aka energy needed per time unit. Too muscular person cannot continue playing because of getting tired during a long run so not durable.   Now I am trying to make the connection to durability and monofilament strings. What do the two things have to do with each other? I cannot see the connection. Please, explain:     Why should durable tennis players use strings of monofilament?  "
1234,Player throwing himself into another running player's way,"Alternative title: Please explain why the situation leading to Antonio Valencia's red card was not also a foul on Lucas Digne's part.  In yesterday's match Ecuador - France, around the 49th minute a situation occured that looked to me like this (see this FIFA ""highlights"" video from second 41):   Player Y (yellow) has played the ball and is running after it. Player W (white) throws himself, feet first, towards the ball (and Y's running direction), perpendicularly and with no chance of controlling the ball, but some chance of reaching it and changing its direction. Player Y, with coming W into his way, seems to slowdown slightly, but still extends one leg towards the ball, reaching it the same time as W. His foot lands on the ball, slides off it, lands on W's knee, potentially injuring him. After some time for treatment of W, referee sends Y off (red card), to no protests from him or his team (presumably the scene has been replayed in super-slow motion several times on screens in the stadium by then).   But what was Y supposed to do in that situation? If he had tried to get his front leg onto the grass, given W's momentum it would have ended up under him and Y would have fallen over him with no chance of using his legs to soften the fall (unless risking stepping onto W with the other leg).  Extending his leg further in hope of landing past W would mean risking injury to this leg (and falling anyway, too). Note that this was a split-second decision to take.  I realize it would have been the gentleman-ly thing to do to take the harder fall, but either way I look at it, W's action should have knocked Y off his feet. Why is this not a foul? "
1235,Does football (soccer) require more calories than running?,"Michael Bradley of the US team leads all athletes in ""distance covered"" during the group stage of the 2014 World Cup with 38 km (23.6 mi) in 270 minutes of play. That's about 8 mi per game (90 min), for an average speed of 5.33 mph.  How much more calories does football (soccer) burn per mile compared to running? Is it considerably more exhausting than running for 90 min straight at 5.33 mph?   I would think yes, considering Bradley and other players are in fact sprinting and resting (more tiring, I think, than medium-distance jogging), plus constantly shifting directions, which I assume requires more calories than running straight ahead (citation needed).  But is the ""distance covered"" metric measured this way actually analogous to running? Is 8 miles on the soccer pitch equivalent to some greater distance on a racetrack?  What's the conversion rate for ""distance covered"" in soccer vs. running?  How much more or less calorically expensive is soccer than running? "
1236,How changing tennis balls influence players using serve and volley?,"I have heard on several occasions from TV commentators that the tennis balls are now faster, which means that serve and volley, once typical for grass court, is much less common nowadays. I have also read similar claims in some internet discussions.  Could someone explain this in a layman's terms? Basically I would like to ask, for example, about things like this:        How and why has the speed of balls changed? Does ATP/WTA/ITF give some regulations about types of balls used in their tournaments?   How does this influence whether player can use serve and volley style? (For example, do changes in racket technology influence this?  What about changes of the grass? Do players physical abilities have also some bearings on this?)   Are there some other reasons why serve and volley is becoming less common?     "
1237,In what game did Luis Suárez (seemingly) try to bite his own teammate?,"Here's a short clip showing Suárez apparently trying to bite his own Liverpool teammate, who was celebrating after a goal. When did this happen? Do we know any additional context that would explain what Suárez was doing and why he was trying to do it?    EDIT: I think @Ben is right. Suárez is trying to slide on his knees and failing. Momentum keeps his upper body moving forward even when his lower body has ground to a halt. His mouth is probably open because he's yelling (happily). "

Of course, football players come from all different regions. How do they communicate on national teams? Is there a dominant language, or does each just use his most fluent language while all others are assumed to be able to understand, more or less? In what language does the coach instruct the team?  On a side note, I've read somewhere that players (and some supporters) of Anderlecht use English to communicate and support the team. I hadn't imagined English to be such a popular choice in a country where it's not an official language. Does this claim make sense? "

1245,Change of strike in case of batsman is bowled?,"Our bowler banged it in short of length, in line with the off stump, and the batsman swings across the line sending the ball straight up over the pitch. Both batsmen immediately set off for the run and the wicket keeper stepped in the middle of the pitch to take the catch. The keeper was so bad at the catch attempt that the ball, which had a lot of back spin on it, went straight through his outstretched hands without making any contact whatsoever, and rolled back and hit the stumps all by itself. By this time the runner had reached the batting crease and he just stood there calmly watching the ball come back and hit the stumps. The striker was given out - bowled. Pretty straight forward isn't it?  But my question is: do you consider that the batsmen had crossed for this wicket, even though the striker was bowled?  The new batsman ended up taking strike in the middle of the over in this case. But I cannot find anything in the MCC rules that refers to change of strike with respect to someone being bowled out. What do you think? Or by any freak chance has anyone seen this before? "
1246,Are there any rules or guidelines concerning players' boots?,"Soccer teams are very strictly color coordinated at the international level (and at most lower levels). The two teams must have matching uniforms distinct from each other, and additionally the two keepers must be in colors distinct both from each other and from the teams' kits.

Are there any rules players must follow when selecting their boots? "
1247,What is the motivation behind requiring LPGA Tour members to speak English?,"Effective at the end of 2009, LPGA Tour golfers on the tour for two years were required to pass an English oral evaluation exam or face suspension(1).  Looking at the current Women's World Golf Rankings, ten of the top 25 originate from Korea.

Will the initiating visitor be ejected?  EDIT: According to the current MLB Rule Book, it does not appear to be explicitly stated.  However, it seems that it would follow the protocol for when a manager visits his pitcher twice in the same inning without removing him: the manager is ejected; the current pitcher must face the current batter; then the pitcher must be removed from the game.

1254,The ending of a baseball game,"Suppose the game is tied 0-0 in the bottom of 9th with bases loaded and no outs.   If the batter hits the ball in play and the runner from 3rd reaches home plate before there is a force out at 3rd, 2nd and 1st (a triple play), then the run doesn’t count.

1257,Can the third umpire overturn a decision without being referred from the field?,"In cricket, one of the officials is the third umpire. Usually, they deliver a decision only when there is a referral from the on-field umpires or from a team in UDRS. Can the third umpire give or overturn an umpire decision without being asked?  For example, the field umpire calls and signals a no ball, and it is known to the third umpire that it is a fair delivery. In a situation like that, do the laws or regulations give authority to overrule the field umpire's call without referral?  Can they contact the field umpire and reverse the decision when it is clear the decision made by the field umpire is wrong? "

1259,What constitutes a player as a rookie?,"When is a player said to be a rookie in North American major league sports? My understanding is that a rookie is a player that is playing his first professional season. But for how long is that player considered to be a rookie?  I have heard many times a player being discussed as a rookie even though he was in his second year. So is a player called a rookie only in the season he starts (I don't believe that's the case), or until he has played as many games as there in a full season, or for some other length of time? "

1268,Why is Boxing Day a match day in the English Premier League?,"My question sounds easy: why is Boxing Day used as a match day in the English Premier League (EPL)?  The Wikipedia article on Boxing Day states that:     In England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, it is traditional for the Premier League, Scottish Premier League and Irish Premier League respectively, as well as the lower divisions and rugby leagues, to hold a full programme of football and Rugby League matches on Boxing Day. Traditionally, matches on Boxing Day are played against local rivals. This was originally to avoid teams and their fans having to travel a long distance to an away game on the day after Christmas Day.    But, at the same moment, if I am seeing this correctly, Arsenal is free today.  How important is this Boxing Day as a match-day, and how did it became that important?Also, if it is important, then why Arsenal is free? Why not let the players celebrate Christmas with their families, as the fans will get to the stadiums on other days as well? "

1276,Who should sit out when a social sporting team has too many players available?,"I am midway through a season of indoor cricket having put together, organised and captained a new team at the start of this season. Initially it was a struggle getting enough players together to be able to enter a team and we played undermanned for the first few games which in any 6 a side sport, especially indoor cricket, is a huge disadvantage and can be quiet demoralising.  This is a social comp/team and everyone has work and family commitments that make them unavailable from time to time, some more than others.  Originally I told everyone that I'd try and share the games around so that if we had more players than needed available on a given week, the player who had played less games would get a go. However we are now in the situation in which the players who have played more games are the ones who have been with the team ""through thick and thin"" having to cope with playing undermanned, which also costs them money since the indoor centre charges a flat rate per team per game. Other players have been unavailable less often and so have played less games but also therefore haven't had to put in the hard yards of building the team and making sure it could get off the ground. All of a sudden everyone seems available and I'm left having to work out who (potentially myself included) will have to miss games.  So, what is the standard etiquette in social sport in this situation? Should loyalty be rewarded or does fairness dictate the number of games be made as equal as possible for all players? Note that no one has done anything wrong by being unavailable, just that everyone has different levels of commitments to other things.  Edit: I should point out, for those unfamiliar with cricket, that substitutes are not possible in any form of cricket including indoor cricket. The logical option of sharing game time that is possible in most other sports is not an option in cricket. "
1277,Is it permissible to wear hand gloves while fielding in cricket?,Is it permissible for a fielder to wear hand gloves while fielding in cricket due to some climate conditions or infections?  we can see the football players wearing hand gloves while playing(but they won't deal the ball with the hand).  What does the Icc rules and laws of cricket say about this? 
1278,Is it necessary to appeal for lbw in cricket?,"Why is it necessary to appeal for an LBW dismissal when sometimes it is clear that the ball would have gone on to hit the stumps?  It is the duty of an umpire to give the decision as OUT when the ball running to the stumps, hits any part of the batsman other his bat. If the bowler or any of the player of the fielding side did not appeal for the dismissal, what can the umpire do in this situation? "
1279,Earned v. Unearned Run Following an Error (Dropped Foul Ball),"Suppose that Paul the pitcher begins an inning by striking out Adam, and then he walks Billy. The next batter is Charlie, who hits a foul ball that the first baseman drops. Subsequently, he is charged with an error on the play. Charlie proceeds to hit a home run. Paul concludes the inning by striking out David and Ed.   How does this inning get scored in terms of earned v. unearned runs? Clearly, Charlie's run is unearned because of the error. But what about Billy's run?   I would assume that there are 3 options available for the official scorer:      1) Ignore the end result of Charlie's at bat (the homer, which implies   Billy's run is unearned).       2) Assume that the next hitter (David) would have the same end result   as Charlie (i.e., David would hit a homer, which implies Billy's run   is earned).       3) Which ever approach is more favourable for the pitcher.   How would the answer change if instead of David and Ed striking out, David hit a triple (which would have scored Billy had the foul ball been caught), and then Ed and Fred strikeout? My guess is that the scorer would take approach 1, assume Charlie was actually out, and proceed from there. "

1281,How are the disability definitions scored in the Paralympics,"There seem to be a wide range of categories in the Paralympics, all with different tariffs for difficulty, but how are these actually balanced?  For example, one of the simplest groups is Kayaking, with only 3 categories:     KL1: Athletes in this sports class have no or very limited trunk and no leg function.      KL2: Athletes in this sports class have partial trunk and leg function; they are able to sit upright in the kayak. Along with this, they will have limited leg movement during paddling.      KL3: Athletes in this sports class have trunk and partial leg function and are usually able to use at least one prosthetic   Does each get a points handicap in order that there is one gold? Or is there a gold per category?  In Athletics there are categories from 11 to 58 so this must lead to a lot of medals if there is a set per category.     A letter F is for field athletes, T represents those who compete on the track, and the number shown refers to their impairment.      11-13: Track and field athletes who are visually impaired. Blind athletes compete in class 11, wear compulsory blindfolds and run with a guide runner. Athletes in class 12 are visually impaired but running with a guide is optional.      20: Track and field athletes who are intellectually impaired. Athletes in this class have difficulty with reaction time and memory recognition during an event. There are three events for men and women in the Rio programme - 1,500m, long jump and shot put- these particular events have been medically proven to have an impact on performance for T/F20 competitors.      31-38: Track and field athletes with cerebral palsy or other neurological conditions that affect muscle co-ordination and control. Athletes in classes 31-34 compete in a seated position (using a racing or throwing chair), while athletes in classes 35-38 compete standing.      40: Track and field athletes with short stature (also known medically as dwarfism).      42-47: Track and field amputees. In classes 42-44 the legs are affected and in class 45-47 the arms are affected. Athletes in these classes compete standing and do not use a wheelchair.      T51-54: Wheelchair track athletes. Athletes in class 51-52 are affected in both lower and upper limbs. T53 athletes have fully functioning arms but have no trunk function at all, while T54 athletes have partial trunk and leg functions.      F51-58: Wheelchair field athletes. Athletes in F51-54 classes have limited shoulder, arm and hand functions and no trunk or leg function, while F54 athletes have normal function in their arms and hands. In the F55-58 classes the trunk and leg function increases.  "

Will it be wide or batsman will be considered as out?? "
1284,Appeal play after a pitching change,"Is it possible to appeal a tag-up play at a base after a pitching change?  If so, how does it affect the pitchers' statistics?  For a concrete example, suppose P1 is pitching, runner R3 at third, one out.  Batter B hits a fly ball which is caught by the left fielder (two out).  Runner R3 advances to home.  Now pitcher P1 is removed and replaced with P2.  After the pitching change, but before P2 pitches to the next batter, the defense realizes that R3 left third before the fly ball was caught.  P2 throws to third to appeal.     Will R3 be called out, or is it too late to appeal? If R3 is out, who is credited with the corresponding 1/3 inning pitched?  P1 or P2? Suppose this is the last out of the game in a save situation.  Who gets the save?   Assume current MLB rules.  References to authoritative sources would be preferred if possible.  I couldn't find this situation addressed in the Official Rules. "
1285,Zero-pitch save,"It occasionally happens that a pitcher will earn a save by throwing one pitch.  For example, he is brought in with two outs in the ninth and a two-run lead, and his first pitch is popped up.  In principle, it should be possible for a pitcher to earn a save without throwing a pitch at all.  For instance, he could pick off a runner.  We could also imagine more exotic situations: a runner abandons the base paths, or the batter attempts to use an illegal bat.  Has this ever happened?  Instances in MLB would be most interesting, but other leagues would be interesting also.  In this forum post someone suggested that Mitch Williams did this in 1989 or 1990.  It looks like they are thinking of September 11, 1989, where according to the box score, Williams did earn a one-out save by picking off a runner.  But unfortunately, it appears he threw one pitch to the batter first (a ball). "
1286,Can a player get his second yellow card while being replaced? What happens then?,"In football, a yellow card can be given to a player when he/she is losing time on purpose.  Typically, a team wining the match will make changes on the last minutes to lose some extra time: the player will make sure to be far away from the bench, so that the distance to cover will be quite big. Also, he will walk all the way, making the other team feel very nervous for it.  For this, 30 seconds are summed to the extra time to be added to the end of the match. However, in many cases this change takes way more than this.  I was wondering: would it be possible for a player that is being replaced already having a yellow card to get another one for being so slow during the replacement? Would the replacement then be cancelled? Has it ever happened? "
1287,How do swimmers know how many laps they have left?,"Just wondering how swimmers know how many laps they have left.  Is it like in athletics where they have an electronic screen, except underwater?     Are there any objective elements (inside or outside the pool) that help swimmers to calculate the number of tanks?  "
1288,Dinghy Racing: how do I use the kicker/vang properly?,"I'm sailing an Enterprise Dinghy, and recently upgraded to a cascading kicker (kicking strap, boom vang, ...). The previous kicker I had I could never operate during a race properly, but now I can, and my question is: what is the best way to learn how to use a kicker properly?  I know that in very light wind it should be tight to flatten the sail, making it easier for the weak wind stream to attach to the sail, off in medium wind which has more power to pull the rounder sail forward, and tight again in strong wind to depower the sail. But how do I go beyond that? How can I best learn to match a sail shape to the wind condition, and then achieve that shape with the kicker? "
1289,Shall I always stick to the same move if it works?,"I play basketball and my strongest move is right hand hook shot. I comfortably shoot over 50%. I hit even better if I shoot from left using the board. I can finish a post move this way, but also do a running hook shot.  For some reason though, I can never force myself to do it again and again. Even after 3 successful shots in a row, I try to change my next offensive move. I interrupt the hook shot with a fake (defender does not go for it) and try to go under anyway. Or I turn into the hook shot but immediately turn the other way and try a fade-away shot. Or just shoot from the line. All these other moves give me worse shooting percentage.  I think, that I worry too much, that the game will become boring for the others. Is it a valid concern? Or shall I just ""play to win""? Regarding tactics and development, is there any reason to abandon a move that works and force myself to try different moves?  Thanks. "
1290,"Has there ever been a ""strike-em-out-throw-2-out"" triple play?","Has there ever been a ""strike-em-out-throw-2-out"" triple play?  (I started wondering that after watching this YouTube video MLB | Strike 'em Out, Throw 'em Out. "
1291,Is there a stat or resource that tracks series-wins in MLB?,"Major League Baseball could obviously never have a team go undefeated (actually, I found out it did happen in 1869, so from now on let's just go with the live-ball era forward) because of the large amount of games played each season. The best in recent history were the '01 Mariners, who won close to 75% of their games. So on any given day the worst team can, and fairly often does, beat the best team.  To me it seems like the closest a team could ever get to ""undefeated"" would be to win (or at least tie?) every series in the season. For example, taking 2 out of 3 games against the Red Sox, then 3 out of 4 against the Orioles, and so on. In this specific case total wins isn't relevant.  As an example I just quickly went through the wins-losses for the 2015 Cardinals. They played in 51 different series. Of those they won 32, lost 15, and tied 4. Depending on how you look at it their percentage of series won would be .638, or their percentage of series not lost (wins + ties) would be .706. In either case that percentage is not too different than the winning percentage of total games .617 (100 wins). So I'm not too surprised, because this is the type of data I would guess is pretty normal.  What I'm curious to know is about anomalies such as a team winning ~60% of their games while managing to win 90%, or more, of the series played by remaining consistent. The thought of tie-breakers sparked this curiosity.  I'm calling this ""series-wins"" for a lack of better term. Is there an actual statistic for this? Or better yet is there a resource that keeps track of this? I have tried searching, but can't seem to find anything. "
1292,"In American Football, why are fullbacks called such if they aren't all the way back from the OLine?","Maybe this question is outdated for modern football so I can delete if needed but why is the fullback called a fullback when they aren't all the way back from the O-line?  I don't have a source on me but I remember reading a book on football like 25-30 yrs ago and it said something like on offense, the QB is 1/4 back from the line, the HB is 1/2 from the line, and the FB is all the way back from the line.  1/4 or 1/2 of what distance, I don't remember but that was the explanation.  At this time (early to mid 80s), there were great runners who were listed as FB (Roger Craig, John Riggins, Franco Harris).  Towards the late 80s-earlier 90s, the FB turned into a lead blocker for the HB and didn't carry the ball much (Mike Alstott, Daryl Johnston, Tom Rathman, etc.)  I'm just wondering why didn't they call lead blockers HBs at this point in time since they were between the RB/FB and the QB?  This might be a moot question now since everyone is taking the FB out for another WR or TE but still a interesting question to me after reflecting back on the evolution of American football. "
1293,Why do MLB players always look into the field after striking out?,"I have watched quite a bit of baseball, and have always wondered why almost every player immediately looks into the field after striking out.  Are they:   making sure the pitcher isn't staring them down? trying to see their replay on the video board?  "
1294,Basketball and rebound,"In basketball, why is a rebound simply not just called a bounce, ball bounce, or re-bounce? What exactly is a rebound? Also, why is a date with someone used to forget another date simply also called a rebound? What is the connection? "
1295,Foot fault on a jump serve in volleyball,"When a player does a jump serve can land on the baseline or not?  I had a case tonight when a player do a jump serve and landed on the baseline I was told it was not a foot fault, is it correct? "
1296,What makes Stealing Signs wrong?,"My question pertains mostly to baseball, but I imagine it is just as relevant in other sports as well. Every so often I hear about a disgruntled team, accusing the other team of stealing signs. I don't get it. What actually makes it wrong?  This just seems like any other aspect of the competition that is fair game. For example, if a pitcher inadvertently ""tips"" his pitches, and the other team is smart enough to pick up on it and use that knowledge to their advantage, then it is generally considered a flaw of the pitcher. It is now his responsibility to correct the problem, and improve his skills by becoming more deceptive and unpredictable. I wouldn't blame the opposing team for cheating; I would say they played smart baseball. I'm having a hard time understanding how ""decrypting"" signals is any different?  Additionally, the coach who creates the signals does so with the intention to obfuscate them as much as possible. Obviously this is to maximize competitive advantage. So does that not imply competition even within this narrow aspect of the game?  Someone help me out please. What makes stealing signs wrong that teams rightfully take exception and feel cheated? "
1297,"In table tennis, why is a ball that hits the edge considered in?","The answer to this question states that a ball that hits any part of the top of the table (including the edge) is considered in-bounds.  My question is why is a ball that hits the edge (and bounces off the table in a manner that could be nearly impossible to return) considered in-bounds?  On all of the ping pong tables I've seen in people's homes, the white lines along the edges do not actually touch the edge of the table.  There is about 2-3 millimeters of space between the white line and the edge of the table.  This means that if a ball hits the edge of the table, it has landed beyond the white line and therefore should be considered out of bounds.  If it is still considered in-bounds, then there is no point in having those white lines along the edges.  Do the tables used in ITTF matches have their white lines touching the edge?  If so, then it makes sense for edge balls to be considered in-bounds.  But if their tables have space between the edge and the white line, then it is illogical for edge balls to be considered in-bounds. "
1298,Why did the Netherlands put in their backup keeper for the PKs?,"In the Netherlands v. Costa Rica World Cup game played on 5 July 2014, the Dutch substituted their keeper at 120+1', clearly solely for the inevitable penalty kick shootout. I'd expect the starting keeper would usually be the one entrusted with the PKs, so why did they put in the backup? Because he's fresh and the starter has been playing for two hours? I noticed he's a couple inches taller, is that enough difference to put him in? A combination of those?  The Result:  The gamble worked, Netherlands won 4-3 in PKs with a shot to spare. The winning save looked like the couple inches of height/armspan did make a difference. "
1299,Can the opposing team's goalkeeper take a kick in a penalty shootout?,"When doing a penalty shootout, is it possible for the opposing team's goalkeeper to take a kick? I've never seen it happen, but it seems that since the goalie is part of the team, he/she should be able to take a kick.  Bonus: Has this ever happened? "

With bowlers you can use statistics like number of wickets taken and with batsmen, you can use number of runs scored but with wicket keepers, what could you use to evaluate the performance of a wicket keeper?  You couldn't use anything like number of catches or stumping because these things are generally dependent on other players. "
1301,How much does it costs teams to insure against player injury?,"In 2008, the New York Yankees signed free agent CC Sabathia to a 7 year deal worth $161 million.  At the time, Sabathia was coming off winning the Cy Young Award, and was brought in to be the team's ace as their earlier championship core aged and/or moved on.  However, after occasional short-term injuries earlier in his career, by 2014, a degenerative knee was placing Sabathia's career in doubt.    At the time he was 33, and still owed a great deal of money ([tex]25 million in 2016).  My guess that the Yankees would have protected themselves by buying insurance proved correct.  He ended up returning to a fairly full load in 2015 and 2016... but his best was certainly behind him.  But it got me wondering: how much might player insurance cost?  And how much more might it cost for Sabathia (since he was older and weighed 240 pounds) than for another player with a similar salary? Put another way: How much does Sabathia's ""extra"" age and weight cost in insurance? "
1302,Bad light issue in ODI Cricket,"We know that the bad-light issue in cricket is always happening in test matches to finish that day's game. Since, the traditional cherry or the red leather ball is harder to pick under lights.   But, what about white ball matches?  I could see the bad light issue in ODI's too. In the recent match between South Africa and SriLanka, they were showing the D/L target for every over in the second innings due to bad light problems.   We can also see a match between Sri Lanka and New ZeaLand had ended with D/L method due to the same reason.  Couldn't they switch on more lights? What is the bad light rule for limited overs cricket? "
1303,Heaviest loss of last four teams remaining in history of World Cup,"Brazil just lost 1-7 to Germany in 2014 World Cup.

What game had the most goals? "
1304,Does FIFA have contingencies for riots during or after a match that make the winner incapable of continuing the tournament?,"During the monumental defeat of Brazil on 8 July 2014, some people jokingly said on Twitter that Holland and Argentina should hope that the Brazil fans storm the field and lynch both teams (their own team for disappointing them so much and the Germans for revenge). Of course this would never happen because it would be terribly unsportsmanlike, not to mention a gigantic smear on the reputation of the country.  But what if that actually would have happened? What if the fans of a heavily losing team storm the field and attack the winning team, incapacitating some of their players? Does the FIFA have rules for such an occurence? "
1305,Any statistics that are no longer used?,"In 1980, Major League Baseball started keeping track of a statistic called the game winning RBI.  But due to controversy, they stopped keeping track of it after 1988.  Are there any other statistics in any sport that were used at one point but are no longer used for whatever reason? "

1308,What are the typical / expected results of using too large a surfboard?,"I'm having a rough time learning how to surf. I've gone enough times now (20 to 25 times) to notice a consistent point of failure. I've tried laying farther front or farther back, catching the ""energy"" of the wave sooner or later, and trying to get on one knee earlier. However, the results are consistent; as long as I go forward (as opposed to dragging behind or the wave being mush), I wipe out the same way every time.  For now I'm holding off on saying exactly what that way (of wiping out) is, because I'd like to hear from surfers with enough experience to tell me what should happen hypothetically, instead of tempting everyone to offer connect-the-dots theories (narrative fallacies) after detailing my wipeouts.  I've been riding my roommate's old surfboard, a 6' 4"" Fish, 3 in. thick. However my roommate's 6 ft. tall, while I'm only 5' 5"" and 103 lbs., so the board's probably too large (and heavy) for me. Still, isn't it supposed to be easier to learn on a larger board? That's why I'm wondering: If there's such a thing as ""too large"" a surfboard, then in what manner would a novice tend to wipe out on them? "

1310,Can a batsman be run out after the ball is dead?,"Can a batsman be run out after an umpire signals over? My friend was batting outside the crease, and the ball went to a fielder. He was not taking a run. The umpire called Over and my friend went to talk to the non-striker at his end. The the bails came off. Is this Out, or Dead Ball or what? "
1311,Yellow and Red Card pattern in football,"There is 3 recognized yellow-red card pattern in football (just try check a football report in FIFA.com and there's only 3 pattern)  They're   Yellow card 2nd yellow card followed by red card Red card   The questions are:   When it is applicable to show a 2nd yellow card and followed by a red card. Can't you just directly give a red card? If a player who gets 2nd  yellow card, is going to be followed by a red card, why we hear commentator says like ""Oh he got a 2nd yellow card! He will miss the next match"", since if we're referring to the second pattern, this is impossible since a second yellow card is automatically followed by a red card. Is this pattern possible?      Player A:      30' : 1st Yellow Card   60' : 2nd Yellow Card   90' : Red card  "
1312,How does a six-sided ring contrast from a four-sided ring?,"Total Nonstop Wrestling (TNA) fans recently voted to have the company bring back a six-sided ring(1) for their wrestlers to perform in.  How does a six-sided ring contrast from a four-sided ring? Obviously, one ring has six sides and the other has four sides, but how does this difference change the mechanics of the ring itself? (ie, Does it have more/less give? Is it more/less sturdy? etc.) "
1313,How the cricket ball's swing measured instantly?,"In the recent test series between India and England, Star Sports, which is the official broadcaster in the Indian sub-continent, showed a new graphics after each ball is bowled. It was the amount of ball swing (in-swing/out-swing). The data was in centimetres &amp; the measuring axis was the trajectory of the ball if it doesn't undergo any swing.    So, what new technology was used to measure this deviation? Or was it just the good old Hawk-eye with some data processing?  "
1314,What's to stop a guy staying at the back of a peleton?,"In Tour De France, when the riders are in a pack, one rides at the front while the others take advantage of the reduced wind resistance, and then one from the back (or is it the guy directly behind the leader?) heads to the front for a while while the previous leader rests, and they carry on doing this.  What's to stop someone just staying at the back and letting the others take it in turns leading the group? "
1315,Do they ever pull the goalkeeper in football?,"In ice hockey, teams that are losing will sometimes pull their goalkeeper late in the game and bring in an extra attacker to increase their chances of scoring and tying the game.  Do teams ever pull their goalie in football and bring in an extra attacker when they are losing?  Is this even allowed? "
1316,Is English the official language for international sport events?,"There are specific languages official for every sports (i.e. soccer/cricketboxing) / sport events (olympics/world events/continental events)?

1317,How essential is a purpose built Triathalon bike?,"I am a experienced marathon runner who is looking to get into Triathlons (long course and half -- ~50 mile bike), hoping to work up to an Ironman.   I have an older, but working, road bike that gets me around very well (to which I could attach Tri-style handlebars), so my question is:  how essential is having a purpose built triathlon bike if the goal is just to complete the race? Can I get away with a standard road bike? "
1318,Which tennis matches are best of 5?,"I am researching statistical characteristics of tennis matches. I need to know reliably which tennis matches are best of 3, and which ones are best of 5.  Is it strictly the case that only men grand slams are best of 5? Are the venues for the grand slams only used for grand slams (e.g. if I see that the venue of a tennis match is Wimbledon, am I guaranteed that this is the Wimbledon Grand slam)? Or are there sometimes some matches in these venues that are not part of the Grand slams? "

1323,Swimming long distances self sufficient,"I intend to swim long distances, over 5 km, in open waters. I won't do it in shark infested water or anything alike, but there are still a lot of dangers, like jellyfishes.  I also want to do it self sufficient.   I suspect that I would need at least an auto inflating vest. But what should I look for when choosing one? If I would need to carry food and water how can I do it? Is there something like a floating bag that I can easily attach to myself?  Related to safety again, is there something like a radio buoy to emit a signal in case of emergency?  Any other tips if someone already did this? "
1324,How to benefit from playing a racquet game with a player on a much lower level?,"Suppose you're teaching a beginner how to play (let's concentrate on various racquet games for that matter).  Do you have some tips on how the more experienced player can also benefit on some level from such games? A squash player once told me that one idea is to play with one's non-dominant hand, although I'm not sure what benefit would one get from that, (except perhaps in tennis, for the two-handed backhand), apart from the challenge/developing general dexterity (which I do find fun, but wondering whether there's more to that).  Are there any additional tips? "
1325,Baseball and DWar,"Two part question really.    What is the formula for calculating DWar?  Also, as I understand it; it seems to rely on some stats that were historically considerably less stringently monitored than say home runs or hits.  If that's the case, does the accuracy of the stat dip exponentially after a given number of years back - is there a known cut-off line where the numbers stop being trustworthy?  Or is my assertion incorrect? "
1326,"The call ""nets"" in tennis, details","Question: If I used up my first serve, then am serving my second serve, and the ball hits the net and into the correct sector(meaning if the ball would hit that surface directly without hitting the net on the way, akka a valid serve) that is called ""nets"" ? The rule would have to be , me serving the first serve again, even though ""I've already served the first serve"" am I correct? What if nets happens again, be it on the first or second serve, do we have the same situation? "
1327,What if an opposing player uses part of the Batsman's clothing to put down the wicket?,"Following on from,  Lets suppose that a batsman is facing an over of spin, he/she has removed thier helmet and placed it behind the stumps for safe keeping.  What if, while the ball is in flight, an opposing player uses the helmet to put down the wicket? Would the batsman be out? Assuming not, which laws preclude this? "
1328,Why did the Houston Texans select a defensive player in the 2015 draft?,"I have been watching Hard Knocks featuring the Houston Texans.  I watch the NFL draft every year.  It appears to me that the Texans are mainly focusing on defense.  I understand that the defense is great, but it seems to me that they are not focusing enough on offense.    Does anyone know why the Texans drafted a defense player in the first round instead of drafting a QB or a WR? I have been watching NFL network for analysis and have been checking Texans websites and there are no explanations.    Does anybody have any info on this? "
1329,Why do centres take face offs in hockey?,"I almost always see the centres take the face offs in the NHL. Is this part of the rulebook?  If not, why isn't more common to see other players take face offs. I can understand why defensemen don't take face offs as there's only 2 of them on ice and teams don't want to give away break aways with 1 defender. But how come it's also not common to see wingers take face offs?   "
1330,Why do baseball managers argue with umpires in situations where they know it won't help?,"As I understand it, in baseball, some subset of the calls made by an umpire are open for review, at the request of one of the team's managers. In those cases, the managers are allowed to leave the dugout and question the correctness of the call. At that point, they can ask the umpire to either officially review the call (which each team has a set number of), or the umpire may decide to voluntarily review it under their own discretion.  However, ""judgement"" calls by an umpire, such as balls and strikes calls, are not review-able. A player or manager arguing with an umpire over such calls can quickly lead to an ejection.  I can understand e.g. a player at the plate, in the heat of the moment, mouthing off to the plate umpire when they disagree, but for a manager to come out of the dugout and argue knowing they're going to get ejected seems odd. Frequently I will even hear the commentary team speculate that being ejected was the intent of the manager.  So, why do managers argue over these calls when it's always fruitless? Is it always fruitless (e.g. do umpires ever reverse ball/strike calls)? Or is there some reason a manager would want to be ejected from a game? "
1331,Genuinity of replays,"How it is ensured that the replay shown for a particular incident is correct? For instance, while checking front foot no-ball, host broadcaster can edit and alter the footage to benefit the home team. Is match referee responsible for checking the correctness of the replays?   "
1332,Can a baseball runner lead off of first in a direct line to the pitcher?,"I believe that a base runner is allowed to make their own base line when running the bases.  I don't believe that there is anything in the rules that prevents a base runner from running all the way out in to the outfield when going from first to second base (as long as they are not trying to evade a tag).  I believe that runners are only called for ""running out of the base line"" when they are trying to evade a tag.  And that the ""base line"" is the line that the runner creates when he runs from one base to another.  So for example - I don't believe that it is against the rules for a runner to start at first base then run out in to right field and then run to second base.  As soon as a fielder is making an attept to tag the runner that runner is now required to run in a direct line either back to first or continue on to second base.  And that is when they are not allowed to deviate more than 3 feet in either direction.  So with all of that said - I had a thought today.  When a baserunner is leading off of first base could that runner move off of the base in a direct line with the pitcher?  I know it would be sort of a disadvantage in terms of getting a lead towards second since the runner would be moving out towards the pitcher in to the infield grass.  But it would make picking the runner off virtually impossible.  Any throw from the pitcher back to first base would almost certainly hit the runner.  And the runner could always go back to first standing up which would almost always get in the way of the throw back to first.  I know it would be odd to see a runner leading off of first and standing in the infield grass about 3 strides off of the bag.  But it would seem like you could almost guarantee that you wouldn't get picked off.  And any attempt by the pitcher to throw over to first would be very risky and probably end up with a throw that hits off of the runner.  Thoughts?  Is this legal? "
1333,Why is music played during NBA games?,"Music is often played at sports events. In North America, music is regularly played in MLB, NHL, and NBA games. However, only in basketball games music is played while the game is in live action. In the NHL music is usually played during breaks and before the puck drops, and in the MLB it's in between the innings or during the few seconds a new batter steps in to the box; the game is not in play in any of those events. The only other time you might here music is during chants - for the purpose of this question let's ignore that as music.  So why is it that music is played in NBA arenas during live ball? Wouldn't music be a source of distraction to the players? "
1334,Team scoring more total points but lost the series,"During the first round of the 2018 NBA Playoffs, the Indiana Pacers scored 704 total points while their opponents, the Cleveland Cavaliers, scored 664 total points. However, the Cleveland Cavaliers won the series.  Prior to this series, has a team who has scored more points during a series lose the series against their opponents? If so, who was the last team to complete this feat? "
1335,When is the new ball due for all forms of cricket?,"Is there a standard time fixed in Test, ODI and T20 formats of Cricket, when a fielding side captain can ask for a new ball?  If the captain of the fielding side doesn't ask for a new ball, will he be forced to have it mandatorily after a certain point by the match umpires? "
1336,What's the rule governing the Lynch touchdown in the Falcons - Seahawks playoff game?,"In an amazing comeback, the Seahawks got a TD with less than a minute on the clock. The running back Marshawn Lynch seemed to fumble the ball, which was then picked up by the center and carried into the end zone. I realize that the score was reviewed, but I'm not sure on what grounds...  What was the final decision in that case and which rules govern that situation?   Edit: Perhaps the question wasn't clear enough. What I am asking is:   Why was the TD reviewed? What would have changed if the ball was fumbled and recovered?  What exactly constitutes a TD when the running back takes a dive into the endzone? Does the ball have to touch the turf in the endzone?   "
1337,Who are involved in the team selection process in cricket?," To select the squad for a series, who are involved in it? To select the playing 11 for a match, who are involved in it?   that is, who has the most rights to do it? "

UPDATE: If the ball first hits the bat, then the helmet and goes for a boundary, he will score 5+4 =9 runs/ball. So, in an over, 9*6 = 54 runs. Is this logic correct? "
1342,Is a too low ascent speed unsafe?,"A friend of mine (an old scuba instructor to be honest) told me that a too slow ascent is unsafe because it increases the time you stay at higher depths.  I think I have a good understanding of decompression algorithms (especially VPM and RGBM) and a good mathematical background, so I can roughly say that the risk of decompression sickness is a function of a derivative of pressure. In other words, the slower the better; if the ascent speed where near to zero, the risk would be near to zero too.  Am I wrong? Could my friend's theory be considered true at some point in the history of scuba diving? "
1343,Jersey name for World Peace,"I am new to watching the NBA. I saw the name World Peace as #15 for the Lakers. However, I saw highlights of the same player, number, and team with the name Artest. Why these names? What is the history behind these names? "

1346,Consistency in bowling stroke,"Several years ago, I learned how to bowl by palming (I have two fingers inside, but my thumb and the rest of my hand supports the weight of the ball) the bowling ball.   At first, I could bowl toward the right side of the lane and it will come back and hit most, if not all, of the pins. This was predictable and reliable.   However, as my arm got stronger, the same technique I used before resulted in a straighter path.  If I bowled toward the right side of the lane like I used to, I would throw a gutter ball. If I bowled toward the head pin, it will dive left before it hits a pin. It has been tough to be consistent and to find a predictable, reliable stroke.  What steps do I need to take to (re)gain consistency in my bowling stroke? In addition, how do I adjust my bowling stroke to accomodate for one-pin spares? "
1347,Is it worthwhile to change your golf swing?,"Tiger Woods has made headlines for changing his golf swing multiple times in his professional career. As a pro, Woods has changed his golf swing three times under Butch Harmon, Hank Haney, and most recently Sean Foley.   Woods's pro statistics before each swing change:     June 1997, pro swing change No. 1. Tour events prior to change: 17.   Wins: 5. Winning percentage: 29.4 percent. (Majors: 1. Wins: 1.   Winning percentage: 100 percent.) World rank at time of swing change:   2.      March 2004, swing change No. 2. Tour events since prior change: 132.   Wins: 35. Winning percentage: 26.5 percent. (Majors: 27. Wins: 7.   Winning percentage: 25.9 percent.) World rank at time of change: 1.      August 2010, swing change No. 3. Tour events since prior change: 91.   Won: 31. Winning percentage: 34.1 percent. (Majors: 23. Wins: 6.   Winning percentage: 26.1 percent.) World rank at time of change: 1.   Woods's experience of changing his swing is an exception. Other golfers, such as Padraig Harrington and Sir Nick Faldo, have not had an equitable level of success after changing their golf swing. In Faldo's case, it took several years for his swing change to click.  Is it worthwhile to change your golf swing? What are the reasons for changing your golf swing? What factors play into the ""growing pains"" associated with changing your golf swing? "
1348,How to start with halfpipe snowboarding?,"For somebody that is a little experienced with regular snowboarding (around 10 years of basic snowboarding), what would be the ideal way to starting halfpipe snowboarding?    I have done some research and saw that there are some basic tips on the halfpipe snowboarding   out there. This source suggests just delving right to it, the only precursor is having to buy a helmet. Similarly, this one suggests:     When riding the Halfpipe for the first time, it is important that you practice first. You can do this by simply traversing the transitions of the Halfpipe[…]   I am not entirely sure if jumping right to it (without any schooling) is the best idea there is (judging from my experiences with jumping the bumps on my own and causing many issues).   In your experience, having clocked some snowboarding time, what would be the best way to start the halfpipe? "
1349,What are the differences between the Power Forward and Center positions?,"What are the differences between the Power Forward (PF) and Center (C) positions?  Several PF/C players, such as Tim Duncan, have been considered a power forward and/or a center. Based on the differences between the positions, which position best defines players like Tim Duncan?

And considering Tim Duncan's style of play, which position is a better label for him? "
1350,How do you make 100 free throws in a row?,"One day during shooting I thought about how many consecutive free throws I could make. It ended in a bet (mainly with myself) that I could do 100 in a row by the end of the season. Working on that goal on and off for a few weeks, I realized that it is hard but still possible. I made 29 consecutive on day one and since then improved to 38. That does not seem like a big improvement, but the number of longer streaks increased a lot and it definitely helped improve my form and my overall shooting.  As I expected, it's more of a ""mind game"". The challenge seems to be to stay concentrated doing the repetitive task of shooting a free throw for at least fifteen minutes without losing focus. Every time my mind wanders for just a brief moment, chances are I miss the next shot.  My question is, how do pro athletes (from whatever sport) deal with problems like that? I watched the World Darts Championships recently. On that level many of the throws are easy (theoretically). The challenge is more to score consistently under pressure over the duration of a match. I guess the same is true in many other sports where precision is important. Once you mastered the technique, how do you fade out everything else and repeat that same move over and over again without losing focus and precision? "
1351,How far off-center can the center be?,"So sometimes a team can run a play with an unbalanced line. I was wondering ""how unbalanced"". Can the center be all the way to one side? Can the center be several yards away from his teammates?   I don't care if it is advisable to do this or not. I'm strictly asking if it is allowed in NFL rules. "
1352,Interpretation for sequence of slugging percentages,"This is really more of a mathematical question with a baseball application, but it seems more appropriate to ask it here.   Because slugging percentage is defined as total bases divided by at bats, it does not appear to be meaningful to describe it in the sense of a probability. In contrast, a batting average is easily described as a probability and the complementary probability is also meaningful. Suppose that we're given batters A and B with batting averages of 0.300 and 0.280, resp., the product of the averages (0.300*0.280 = 0.084) describes the probability that both batters get a hit, assuming that at bats are independent. Similarly, the product of the complements (0.700*0.720 = 0.504) describes the probability that both are out. Lastly, the probability that exactly one of the batters gets a hit is given by 0.300*0.720 + 0.700*0.280 = 0.412.   But if I'm interested in slugging percentages, what would the interpretation be for a product of slugging percentages? Similarly, I assume that the complement of a slugging percentage would be 4-slg? "

1355,Win football game by running backwards?,"If a football team is one point behind with less than two minutes remaining, wouldn't the logical move be to run the ball back into their own end zone to score a 2-point safety? Even if you are in field goal range, the field goal is uncertain, but the 2-point safety is a sure thing and difference between 2 points and 3 points is meaningless in a one-point game.   Has any team won by doing this? If so, how far did they run backwards? "
1356,Football: abandoned matches,"I need some help to understand if there's a common rule or at least a set of rules that apply when a match is abandoned.  So as far as I know there could be two scenarios. One is the match is abandoned and then it gets rescheduled and played again from the beginning (minute 0) usually in a different day.  The other scenario is the match is abandoned but the play resumes. Although it may not resume exactly from where it stopped it's likely to resume from the second half (45) if it was abandoned before full time (usually they replay the very same day?).  Questions are, do you know if these rules always apply, if yes to all the main competitions in the world? Also, are you aware of other scenarios/rules?  Any help would be much appreciated, thanks!  EDIT: I think I found also another scenario when a match is abandoned but it doesn't get replayed and the outcome is decided by a board meeting. That's the case of Blackpool vs Huddersfield Town (on 2 May 2015).     After the match, the Football League announced that there would be no replay of the fixture, and that it would hold a board meeting to decide the outcome.   [website]"
1357,does steal count as first bounce?,"It is also a well-known rule that if you have just received the ball, you can bounce it but if after you take it with both hands, you cannot bounce it again and you must either shot or pass it.  Most of the steals (a defender stealing the ball) occur when the defender tap the ball from the offender, usually causing the ball to bounce (at least once). When playing, I always thought that the stealing was the first bounce, and you cannot take it with both hands unless you intend to shot or pass it.  However, in several videos of the NBA I have seen that the following: defender tap the ball causing a steal, then ball bounces, same defender takes it with both hands, and starts dribling all the way to score.  Is this normal/legal?    EDIT: Just to give you an idea, I am leaving this links of plays from Russell Westbrook:  In this one, he does not take the ball again and just continue the dribling to score:  [website]In this other one, he takes the ball with both hands after the steal, to then bounce it all the way to score:  [website]"
1358,"Would a ""driving hybrid"" be an adequate replacement to a fairway wood?","I've finally taken the time to upgrade my golf clubs. I ordered a matching 9.5° RBZ driver with a 19° 3-hybrid with stiff shafts. I already have a 3-iron (and 4-PW) and three wedges (50°, 54°, and 58°), all with stiff shafts. I'm not sure what to do with the 3-hybrid.   I will be getting fitted. My thought is to replace my fairway woods (3 and 5-wood) with a ""driving hybrid"" (perhaps by decreasing the loft of the hybrid to distinguish itself from the 3-iron and/or consider suggestions by the fitter). I can count on one hand how often I used my 5-wood. I would use my 3-wood off-the-tee for precision, but I find gratification hitting the driver. I rarely used my 3-wood elsewhere.  I understand this is a personal choice, but my question is along the lines of feasibility. Would a ""driving hybrid"" be an adequate replacement to a fairway wood? What steps can I take to determine feasibility?  "
1359,Who was the youngest winner of Gagarin Cup?,"Gagarin Cup is the name for KHL playoffs. (KHL is widely considered the second best ice hockey league in the world, after NHL.) In the last season, 20-years old Ilya Sorokin and 19 years old Ilya Samsonov played in the final. This is relatively young age for a goaltender. This made me wonder:   Who was the youngest winner of Gagarin Cup? Who was the youngest goaltender, defenseman, forward to win this trophy?   (This is probably clear from the context, but I mean age at the time of winning the cup.) "
1360,What are the FIVB Club World Championship qualification criteria?,"What are the qualification criteria for the FIVB Club World Championship (both male and female)? For example, how was it decided which clubs competed in the 2016 male tournament played in Betim and the 2016 female tournament played in Manila? "
1361,US open scoring system,How does the scoring system in US open differ from other majors and normal ATP/WTA turnaments?  My understading is this: In ATP they go best of five sets like French Open etc. but have a tie break after 6-6 in each sets like any other non-major tournament. Except for qualification where they play like any other ATP tournament.  In WTA they play just like any other WTA tournament.  Correct? 
1362,What does the term it's a fast track mean in regards to the long jump track?,"I'm watching the women's long jump at the 2015 Beijing world athletics championship, and don't understand why they keep using the phrase, ""It's a fast track so some of the girls are struggling with it."" Surely the track is the same length as other tracks? It has to be flat, so it would not be down hill. I can't understand what would make it faster then other tracks. Is it simply that there is a strong back wind pushing them forward thus adding more momentum? "

1364,Can a football team buy and sell a player in the same transfer window?,"For example, the current transfer window for most leagues in Europe ends tomorrow.  Manchester United bought Depay from PSV this window. Could they sell him tomorrow if they wanted? Or do they need to wait until the mid-season transfer window at least? "
1365,How to minimize wind effect in beach tennis?,"How is it possible to minimize wind effects playing beach tennis between two players?  I mean what positions can be suggested for the ""strongest"" and the ""weakest"" player?  Lateral wind for each players or wind blowing the back/front of the strongest player? Or another solutions? "
1366,Should I give unsolicited playing advice to strangers?,"I happened to walk by a man and woman casually playing informal unscored tennis, somewhat above beginner level, at a local park.  It was immediately obvious the woman was waiting far too long before beginning her strokes, basically letting the ball almost reach her, even at the baseline, then attempting a quick, cramped stroke without much power or control.  The couple was also doing something I see far too often at the park:  frequently calling ""out"" and ending play instead of playing the ball anyway to try and keep the ""game"" going, keep up the rhythm, and getting in as much practice as possible instead of constantly stopping/restarting.  I was tempted to introduce myself, ask them if they wanted some unsolicited advice, and if so suggest the woman try to start her swing as soon as she sees what side of her body the ball will be arriving at (although she'd probably need practice changing her style but might end up with much better strokes), and also to simply try to continue playing when calling outs.  My wife said I should mind my own business, because I have no idea what sort of relationship, advice, practice, and coaching they've already gone through to reach a level of play they might be perfectly happy with.  On the other hand, my personal experience, for life in general not just sports, is that I've rarely received unsolicited advice at all let alone bad advice, and what unsolicited advice I have managed to receive is usually very helpful.  So from a ""golden rule"" perspective I would tend to want to give advice that I myself would want to receive.  What's the proper etiquette?  Is there some best or proper way to offer playing advice to strangers?  Or should I keep my mouth shut? "
1367,Has a ATP / WTA / Grand slam ever been rained out?,"If during a ATP / WTA / Grand slam tennis tournament, rain falls consistently for the entire 2 weeks, would the tournament just be cancelled? Has this ever happened in a grand slam? Is there an actual rule to say when a tournament would be abandoned due to rain or would they just keep waiting till the rain stops? "
1368,How far is too far for Roger Federer?,"Well, not far enough in terms of innovating/rediscovering tennis in these dull times of monotonous baseline rallies. But the question is specifically about Roger Federer's recent attempts at hyper-aggressive half-volley returns on opponent's (second) serves.    Federer, after Wimbledon, has on numerous occasions tried to charge towards the service line to take the returns early to unsettle the opponents. While the attempt is nothing new, Serena Williams stands well inside the baseline against weak servers &amp; thumps return winners.     But nobody has reached as  far ahead as Federer has. He has taken the returns almost at the service line. So 3 questions.    1) In any of his attempts, has the point of impact with the racquet been inside the service box?    2) If NO, then, is having the point of impact inside the service box legal in tennis rules?    3) If YES, then can he essentially, stand at the net &amp; volley the opponent's serves, from the rules point of view? "
1369,Where does the assistant referee watch to realize when a soccer player is offside?,"How is it possible for the assistant referee to realize when a player is offside?  If the assistant referee is in line with the last forward, how can he see when the ball leaves the other player if he is so far from the last forward? Watching the replays, it seems impossible to make the right decision on difficult offside calls.  The problem is that is necessary to view the last players (forward and defender) and the ball at the same time. "
1370,"How does ""optioning"" a player to the minor leagues work?","If a baseball team needs to make room on its 25 man roster, it may send one of its newer players back to the minor leagues.   Apparently, this is done through a process of ""optioning"" the player back to the minor league team. What is involved in this process? What are the limits on the number of options or the amount of service time a player has that makes him eligible to be optioned? "

1372,Does being good at table-tennis help when playing tennis,"I'm a sport fan, playing ( at amateur level ) numerous sports. 10 years ago, I was quite good at playing table-tennis, participated in several amateur competitions. Even now I often play with my friends. On the other hand I rarely play tennis, although I enjoy watching.  Will knowing table-tennis help you when you play tennis? Can the movements, the balance, the rhythm, the pace and so on from table tennis help you when you're playing tennis? Is there such an obvious relation between the 2 sports?  "
1373,"Football penalty shootouts: Germany wins 71% of the time, England 17% only. Any reason?","See the same question posted by me on Quora.     I was surprised to read the following statistics regarding the success rate of national teams in football penalty shootouts:      NATION     PENALTY SHOOTOUT WIN/LOSS RECORD   Argentina     73%   Germany       71%   Brazil        64%   France        50%   Sweden        50%   Uruguay       50%   Italy         33%   Netherlands   20%   England       17%   The data was taken from the following competitions:   the World Cup the European Championship (known as the European Nations Cup until 1976) the African Cup of Nations the Copa América the Asian Nations Cup African Games Afro–Asian Cup of Nations Asian Games Confederation of Southern African Football Associations Cup (COSAFA) Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup (CECAFA; also known as Al Amoudi Senior Challenge Cup) Confederación Centroamericana y del Caribe de Fútbol (CCCF and CONCACAF) tournaments FIFA/Confederations Cup Gold Cup Intercontinental Championship Olympic Games Panamerican Games South Asian Gold Cup South Asian Football Federation Cup South East Asian Games Tiger Cup West Asian Games West Asian Championship.   Is there any reason that explains such a discrepancy between teams? I would have expected the distribution to be much more uniform, as I felt that professional players would be trained pretty much the same around the world when it comes to kicking penalties. "
1374,How does the slope at Lord's aid swing bowling?,I have heard that the slope at Lord's runs down from Nursery end (media centre) to the Pavilion end with a height of around 8 feet.   Wikipedia mentions that the slope aids in-swing from one end and out-swing from the other.   What's the physics behind this? What has the slope to do with the ball swinging?  
1375,How could pitchers once pitch both games of a doubleheader?,"It was once not unheard for pitchers to pitch both games of a doubleheader, even to throw back-to-back complete games:     The most distinguished doubleheader pitching achievement was that of   “Big Ed” Reulbach of the Cubs, who did it only once, but nobody did it   better.  His big day was September 26, 1908, when he threw a pair of   shutouts in Brooklyn, allowing a total of just eight hits.   I had always assumed this was because pitchers in the old days didn't throw all the fancy pitches they do today. But the New York Times indicates otherwise:     For the past 12 years, a team led by Dr. Carl Nissen, a surgeon, has   been doing research into the stresses inherent in pitching. At one   point, Major League Baseball gave the center a grant to research why   so many pitchers were being injured. Because the results contravened   accepted wisdom — that certain pitches are more harmful than others,   for example — Nissen believes that M.L.B. is unlikely to fund further   studies there. “We were myth-busting,” Nissen said. “Beliefs handed   down over time with no science behind them. It’s not the curveball   that’s damaging to the elbow, as everyone says. It’s the fastball,   thrown again and again over time. Pure physics.”   So what's different? Do we just know better these days? Or was pitching not as hard on the pitcher's arm long ago? "
1376,Football score swapping: is it ok?,"I'm developing a football application. A two-legged tie looks like this:  TeamA  1:0  TeamB TeamB  4:2  TeamA &lt;sum of goals 3:4, sum of wins 1:1, winner TeamB&gt;   Is it easy to understand? The sum is actually calculated diagonally, and the order of sums corresponds to the first leg (match).  May I rearrange all this so that it would be understandable and correct? May I fold the first two lines like following?  TeamA 1:0, 2:4 TeamB   Or it is untraditional and weird to swap the score this way?  There may be objections that this question should be moved to User Experience site, but the question is more about how is right, rather than how is more convenient. "
1377,Why does the Vuelta a España have a combination classification?,"Stage races in cycling are interesting because they typically have multiple competitions inside one race. You have the general classification (usually seen as the most important one), and then there are numerous other classifications such as points classification, intermediate sprints classification, mountains classification, young riders classification, and the combination classification.  The combination classification is the one that confuses me, especially in the Vuelta a España, where it has consistently been one of the prizes for many years. This classification is almost always won by the same rider who wins the general classification. Because the combination classification is (literally) made up of a combination of the other classifications, there is no way for a rider to go for this prize; in order to improve your standings in the combination classification, a rider needs to improve his standings in all other classifications, which is something nobody is interested in doing. People who are possible contenders for this prize are usually also contenders for the general classification, which typically means that they only care about the general classification.  Interesting statistic: After 2003, only one rider has won the combination classification without also winning the general classification. This was Alejandro Valverde in 2012.  So, my question: why does the Vuelta keep employing the combination classification, and why don't they switch to a different prize that riders would actively try to achieve? Are there any historical reasons behind this, or sponsor contracts or so? "
1378,What does the batting strike rate signify?,If player has batting strike rate of 300 what does that mean?   If bowler has strike rate of 20 then we say he has taken 20 balls to take a wicket. what can we say in case of batsmen? 
1379,How does a three team trade work?,"Now that we are approaching the MLB trade deadline, I would like to ask some questions about unusual trades. The first is about three team trades.  Suppose a manager of team A goes to the manager of team B and says, I want Y from you and I'm willing to offer X. If they agree that X and Y are equivalent, and that a trade would benefit both sides, the deal is done.  But suppose the manager of Team B says, ""I think that X is equivalent to Y, but that's not really what I want. But I think Team C will accept X in trade for Z, and Z is what I really want for Y."" Then there is a possible three way trade if team C is really is willing to trade Z for X.  Is this how a three way trade gets done? Or are there other means/mechanisms? "

1382,Has there been any punishment for taunting opponents in a top division football game?,"Inspired by this question, I am wondering if there has been a game where a player or team was punished for taunting the opponents (or the fans) with unsporting behaviour, i.e. scoring in an unconventional way with intent of insulting the defence.   I am not sure if unsporting behaviour (besides physical or verbal  violence) is an offence in itself, and if so what's the appropriate punishment for such; yellow/red card? Can a goal be disallowed for instance?   Has this ever happened in a top division game? "
1383,How do minor league deals work?,"(Unlike some of my other recent questions, this one is primarily about baseball.)  Most minor leaguers are players just drafted out of high school or college, and working their way up (hopefully) to the majors.  But there are some instances, where injured or otherwise ""recycled"" major league players spend some time in the minors. Just ask Dan Uggla, who recently signed a minor league deal with the San Francisco Giants.  How do such minor league deals work? Specifically is this a strategy that a cash rich, prospect poor team such as the Giants (and even more so, the LA Angels, who traded their few good prospects for closer Huston Street) can use to re-build their depth chart? "
1384,Did any tennis tournaments retain Rebound Ace after the Australian Open switched to Plexicushion?,"From 1988 to 2007, the Australian Open used Rebound Ace surfaces. In mid-2007, the tournament organisers decided that from 2008, the tournament would instead be played on Plexicushion surfaces. From memory, the lead up tournaments in Hobart and Sydney formerly used Rebound Ace but subsequently changed to Plexicushion following the Australian Open's lead.  Were there any tournaments on either ATP, WTA or second-tier tours that retained Rebound Ace as a surface after the Australian Open's change? If so, are there any that continue to use Rebound Ace now? "
1385,Who gets Super Bowl rings?,"When a team wins the Super Bowl, there are a lot of players and organizational members that helped in the process. For each team playing this year, there are multiple players on injured reserve that helped the teams early on, but won't be playing for the Lombardi trophy. Who actually gets a Super Bowl ring? Are IR players like Mario Manningham (49ers) and Lardarius Webb (Ravens) eligible to receive rings? What about all of the coaches and coordinators and front-office employees? "

1387,The NBA's New Flopping Rule -- Any Official Records?,"Most NBA fans are aware of the new flopping rule that was imposed this season. You can find details about it here. The basic idea is that whenever the NBA determines that a player has flopped, he gets a warning for the first offense and a fine for the rest.  Most of the time, I get news about flopping via articles on the web (e.g. here and here), but is there an official web page that contains data about the full list of those who have been warned or fined? I couldn't find one by doing a brief search on ESPN or NBA.com. "
1388,How much rotation is done on the ice / in the air on single rotation jumps in figure skating?,"I'm currently learning the loop jump and get conflicting messages on how much of the rotation should occur on the ice before continuing the rotation in the air. I have heard that the rotation should be only 1/4 on the ice, 1/2 on the ice, or entirely rotated in the air. Which is it?  As well, the toe loop I have seen rotated entirely in the air and 1/2 on the ice before jumping.  However, the Salchow jump seems to be rotated 1/2 on the ice and 1/2 in the air. (Which makes the Salchow more of a three turn coupled with a waltz jump.)  I haven't started the flip or lutz yet, but wonder if it is allowable to rotate either of these on the ice before jumping.  How much of the rotation of the single rotation jumps (toe loop, Salchow, loop, flip, lutz) should be done on the ice before jumping into the air? "
1389,What are the rules governing passing in american football?,"Last night after having seen the Super Bowl I ended up watching Top Ten Trick Plays in NFL on youtube. Some of the tricks that are mentioned in there made it clear that I was not fully informed on the rules of the game, particularly regarding the passing aspect.  So here are the questions:    What's the rule concerning forward pass? From what I know, there can be only one forward pass per play. Is this correct?  What's the difference between ""lateral"" and ""reverse"" plays? Aren't they both based on passing the ball backwards in a ""rugby-like"" fashion?  Can whichever player be the passer? or do they have to go up to the referees and declare themselves eligible, like it is for receivers?   "
1390,Is sport betting legal in Europe or America?,"I tried to google, but could not get a clear picture. It is illegal in India to Bet on sports like cricket and football.   Is it true that betting is not prohibited in USA or the European countries? I am not talking about a particluar sport, but sports in general.  Personally I believe betting may give rise to match-fixing and so I agree with the laws in India. So what does the law say elsewhere? "

1394,How is the location of the Super Bowl determined?,"How is the location of the Super Bowl determined? What criteria must a prospective stadium/region meet in order to adequately host the Super Bowl?

Assume that kit includes everything from footwear to headgear, weapon(s), ammunition and anything in between.  I realise there are some differences in the law between various countries, and that generally the requirements can vary between sites (especially between Close Quarters Battle (CQB) and outdoor sites), so by any site worldwide, I'm interested in a baseline set of kit that would satisfy nearly all, or all skirmish sites (CQB or outdoor) in any country that permits airsofting.  Are there any recommended extras that would help, but are not required and what are they? "
1397,What factors could have contributed to the fall of the Oakland Raiders?,"The Raiders of the 70's claimed the best winning percentage of any team in all of professional sports.   However, although they played in the Super Bowl in 2002, the Raiders followed that with seven consecutive seasons with at least 11 losses per season.  What factors could have contributed to the fall of the Oakland Raiders? What specific factors may have contributed to their playoff success in the early 2000's followed by a record number of consecutive losing seasons (according to Wikipedia) since their Super Bowl season of 2002? "
1398,How to transport airsoft gun(s) internationally?,"With the increased security on international (and internal) flights in the last few decades, what is the best way to transport airsoft rifles and pistols between countries?  There are several large international airsoft skirmishes - the most notable one that comes to mind is Berget in Sweden ([website]In the majority of cases, does an additional licence or permit need to be purchased?  If there are specific, relevant exceptions please indicate these.  If a flight connects through a country where airsoft guns are illegal/banned, are there any further actions to be taken with the intermediate country?  Is there a service available (such as a courier service) that could be used to transport the weapons, so they don't need to be transported as luggage?  An answer to this might also apply to other shooting/archery sports, especially if countries worldwide do not make a distinction between airsoft weapons (which are basically non-lethal) and other projectile weapons.

1403,Why don't baseball players get involved with the spectators when something good happens?,"When soccer players celebrate a goal, many times they celebrate ""with"" the public.  Why do baseball players pretty much ignore the public when celebrating? Or even don't show much emotion when a good play occurs?  For example, when running the bases after a home run many times the batter will show no emotion and not respond to the crowd cheering. "
1404,Why does there exist a pause on seventh inning?,I read in the baseball matches (formed of nine innings) that there exists a pause for spectators at seventh inning.  Why on this number of innings and not after fourth and before fifth? Potentially in the middle of match? 
1405,Are NFL teams disallowed from practising with NCAA teams?,"Ignoring whether this would actually happen, is there any rule that would prohibit a NFL team or unit (OL, DL, etc.) from practising with a NCAA football team or unit?  Would the NCAA consider it tampering in some form? "
1406,betting - do favorites get undervalued quotes?,"I came across an example of a job interview question related to betting and want to ask the opinion of experts as my betting knowledge is very basic.  Here is the question:     ""Do you think favorites in the English Premier League are undervalued in the betting market?""   Is this true? if yes, why?   My guess:  Assuming it is true statement, it would be because the bookies are trying to discourage betting on favorites where the probability of them winning is bigger (giving bettors odds less than the probability of a win) and tempting people to bet on underdogs where the probabilities are lower (giving bettors better odds than the probability of a loss), therefore maximizing their profits.   That would be the gist of it. Would my guess be close to the answer to this question?  Plus, how this would be relevant in the world of constantly changing odds? "

1410,"In soccer, has a player ever been cautioned for offenses against his or her own team?","Have there ever been any incidents where a player got cautioned (or sent off!?!) for a wild tackle against his own player.  In the Tottenham-West Ham game, there was a funny quick moment in which, amidst a bout of frenetic possession changes in midfield, one Tottenham player ended up tackling another.  So, taking that to extremes, has a player ever gone in so recklessly upon his own player that he was issued a card?  For that matter, are there any even circumstances where it was more intentional; perhaps a player, fed up with his team's play, goes ""rogue"" and takes out his own man in frustration?  And finally, does anything in the wording of the rules regarding unsporting recklessness suggest that it should be less applicable in such self-defeating circumstances? "
1411,How should play be restarted after a player swings their boot near an opponent's head?,"Referees have stopped play for a high boot when nearby opponents are challenging with their head, whether or not it there is contact. And in the past, bicycle goals have been disallowed due to the risk of injuring another player.  How should play be restarted after these stoppages of play? Would it count as a foul, and is it cautionable? "
1412,Can a referee end the game between a shot being taken and the ball entering the goal?,In my last game we were awarded a free kick; I shot the ball directly at the goal. The referee blew their final whistle while the ball was in the air; the ball then entered the goal.  Can the referee do this? What are the rules regarding this kind of situation? 
1413,Can a basketball player play in college after playing in the NBA?,"If an NBA player never played at the collegiate level, can he ever play for an NCAA Division 1 team?  Thinking about LeBron, Kobe, Kevin Garnett, etc.  Surely the NCAA prevents anyone with active professional status to do so, but what about free agents or retirees?  I couldn't find much more than this NCAA page on Amateurism, from which I couldn't discern an answer to my question.  If LeBron retires tomorrow and forfeits any remaining contracts and salaries, would he be eligible to go play for a Division 1 NCAA team? "
1414,"MLB Pitch Types ""Back in the Day""","I was thinking how hard it would be to approach DiMaggio's 56 game hit streak these days. Not only are there defensive shifts, specialized pitchers to get certain guys out, faster overall pitch speeds, etc...but what were pitch selections like?  Did pitchers have two-seamers, cutters, sinkers, etc back in the middle part of the 20th century? "
1415,Could a player be in an offside position off the field of play?,"Before you immediately say 'yes', let me explain why I asked this question.  According to Law 11, a defending player who leaves the field of play for any reason shall be considered to be positioned on their goal line or touchline for the purposes of offside. When it comes to attacking players, it is only said that they can step or stay off the field of play not to be involved in active play, but if they re-enter from the goal line they may be penalised for offside (Law 11.4).  But the Laws say nothing about an attacking player leaving the field of play as part of play. It is true that Law 12 now states that a free kick can be awarded if an offence is committed off the field of play provided the player left it as part of play, but it only refers to (physical) offences committed against another player (Law 12.4), so offside is not counted.  The new wording of Law 11 makes things even worse. The old 2015/16 Laws of the Game read that:     A player is NOT in an offside position if:      • he is in his own half of the field of play   On the other hand, the new 2016/17 Laws of the Game state that:     A player is in an offside position if:      • any part of the head, body or feet is in the opponents’ half   There is a huge difference between the two paragraphs: the old one allowed a player to be in an offside position off the field of play (because, indeed, he was not in his own half), whereas the new version implicitly denies that eventuality because any point that is not on the field of play is logically not part of the opponents' half.  Thus, here are my questions:   what should a referee do if an attacking player, who leaves the field of play as part of play and is in an offside position at the moment the ball is played to him by a teammate, re-enters the field of play to play the ball — or stays off the field of play to commit an offside offence there (e.g. if the player interferes with an opponent by making an obvious action that clearly impacts on the opponent's ability to play the ball)? if the player is penalised for offside, where does play restart from?  "
1416,Why weren't the Eagles penalized for illegal touching on this quick kick in 1986?,"In this video you can see the Eagles punting the ball away on 2nd down and 40. Randall Cunningham punts the ball into the back of one of his offensive linemen and the ball pops up in the air but continues to travel downfield. The Redskins field the punt and return it for a few yards.  What I don't understand is why this isn't considered a 0-yard ""illegal touching"" penalty. Normally when a punt is touched by a member of the kicking team, the return team has the option of taking the ball at the spot where it was touched. This is the process by which a kicking team ""downs"" a punt. So why couldn't the Redskins have taken the ball at the spot where it hit the offensive lineman? "
1417,Where to find team stats/comparisons for Eurobasket 2015?,"The Eurobasket 2015 homepage is a disaster IMHO, although I can find simple information about players, I can't sort players by physical attributes or age etc.   Are there any pages which follow up the championship that have better roster pages? Alternatively is it possible to find the entire list of players (with stats) in raw text which I can play around with in R? "
1418,How to decide a basketball game ended but not yet end of regulation,We got a basketball game with score 56-61 4:40 mins remaining in the fourth quarter.

1419,"What is ""sneak attack by Roger"" (SABR)?","Recently there was a discussion about a new element in Federer's play which some journalists dubbed sneak attack by Roger or SABR.  What exactly this shot/point build-up is?  What type of player can successfully use this tactics? What abilities does a player need to be able to take an advantage of this? (Probably also weaknesses of the opponent play a role here?)  This recent post is, to some extent, related - although it asks about this with relation to tennis rules: How far is too far for Roger Federer? "
1420,What is tie-break for match in tennis?,In US-Open 2015 mixed doubles final I saw tie-break instead of the third set.  What is that ?   Is it applied only in mixed doubles?   When this rule is applied in tennis?  Is it applicable for all tournaments? 
1421,"Why do american commentators call the ball ""the football""?","Listening to commentators on NFL games, it seems that all of them systematically call the ball ""the football"", and not just ""the ball"".  Why is that the case? In Rugby or Soccer (at least in my country) I've never heard commentators call the ball ""the rugby ball"" or ""the soccer ball"". There doesn't seem to be any advantage to calling it ""the football"", which is longer and not really more descriptive.   ""Football"" is the name of the sport. Why do comentators insist on calling the ball it is played with the same name as the sport itself? "
1422,How to collect stats in NBA?,In NBA there are a lot of available stats:   Points Rebounds (def/off) Assist Blocks Steals % of free throw/2p/3p Minutes played   and maybe many more that I do not remember.  How does all the stats collected? There are a kind of software that register those info or are collected by human or what else? 
1423,Why is the premier league considered a more physical competition?,"I often hear the English premier league referred to as a more physical league compared to the other European leagues. The talk is always about how foreign players struggle to adapt to the physicality.  What exactly is meant by this? I would have thought that the sport was the same regardless of where it was played. Is it more physical in terms of scheduling (mid-week league games are a ridiculous concept to me), or is it something in the gameplay?  In case it's not obvious, the EPL and World Cups are pretty much the only chances I get to watch the sport! "
1424,Is there a penalty for deliberating losing or fielding a weakened side?,"In the English Premier League, if any team deliberately tries to lose a game to give the opposition more points that could possibly damage the league position of a third team, say by fielding a weakened side or in extreme case score own goals, is there any penalty they could face for such action?  Also, I heard few years back that relegation some candidate threatened to report Chelsea to FA because they fielded a weakened side with young players against their relegation rivals at the end of the season game.   Is there any particular criteria set by FA to determine just what constitutes a weakened side in such a case, since the strength of a team is very subjective? Secondly has there ever been any action taken for such an incident in past?  EDIT: (Could find an example for EPL but here's a hypothetical example for CL group stage where losing is beneficial)  In the final two matches Roma play Celtic and Barcelona play Shaktar. Barcelona had a poor run in previous five games due to injury to key players and silly red cards. Assuming that Barcelona can beat Shaktar in the final game, it makes sense for Roma to lose to Celtic deliberately to make them qualify instead of Barcelona, so that they wouldn't have to face a full strength Barcelona later in the group stages when all their key players have recovered.

1428,Can a back row setter reach into the plane to play the ball?,A first hit is over passed towards the net and passes partially through the plane of the net. The back row setter is tall and jumps to pull the ball back with a closed fist. Is this a legal hit? Or does the moment the ball touches the plane mean that the back row setter makes an illegal attack on the ball even though he is pulling the ball back for a third hit?  This is the ball position where the back row setter makes contact.   
1429,Why do NASCAR drivers retire?,"I once watched an ESPN sports science segment which discussed some of the physiological demands that a NASCAR driver requires. Yet in most sports I see, speed and strength are the things that impact athletes the most, which obviously isn't an issue for a NASCAR driver.   Why do NASCAR drivers retire? What does aging change in drivers that reduces their performance?  "
1430,Is it considered a dig when receiving a block attempt ball in volleyball?,"Team A hits the volleyball on an attack. Team B attempts to block, sending the ball back across the net to Team A. Team A receives the ball. Is this considered a dig?  Also if Team A attacks the ball and Team B attempts to block causing the ball to remain on Team B's side. Team B then receives the ball. Is this still considered a dig even if it was first touched by the blocker? "
1431,Are Major League Baseball players allowed to wear nonstandard hats in the dugout?,"On Sept 30th, the Blue Jays clinched the divisional title in the first game of a double-header. There were many shots, in the last few minutes of the first game, of players in the dugout waiting to celebrate. One of them was wearing what appeared to be a toque or brimless cap. It was blue and had a Blue Jays logo on it. Later, he was celebrating on the field with a GoPro over this hat.      Cropped from [website]A little twitter research reveals that it was David Price, and that he had the hat custom made. I would have imagined that brims were not optional. Are there rules about caps and hats? Do they perhaps only apply while a player is on the field? "
1432,What is the highest two-man stat line from teammates in NBA history?,"For example, during the 2012-2013 NBA Season, Kevin Durant averaged 28.1/4.6/7.9 and Russell Westbrook averaged 23.2/7.4/5.2.   Does anyone know what the best two person line has been in history? Or how I might go about finding out myself? "
1433,What is the lowest overall baseball draft pick that has played in a major league game?,"In an answer to this question, a pro coach ""justified"" his publicity stunt of picking Johnny Manziel (a football player) with the 837th overall pick by saying, ""No 837th pick has ever played in a major league game.  There are thirty major league teams, and I've heard of 20th round (and higher) picks making it to the majors (although this is rare). That might be somewhere in the 600's for overall picks, 750th, if someone actually made it from the 30th round?  What is the lowest overall draft pick that actually made it to the majors? "
1434,Why are baseball parks allowed to be be so different?,"A football field has exactly 100 yards between to ""end zones"" of a specified size, and a specific width. Likewise, the dimensions of a soccer field, hockey rink, tennis or basketball courts are highly specific.  Why are baseball fields different to the point where there are ""pitchers'"" parks, and ""hitters' parks"" because of the home run distance and other factors? And, in fact, the ""infields"" of baseball are basically the same size and shape. So what caused outfields, and hence the parks overall, to be so different? "
1435,Why have the vertically passed air gates been abolished?,"In the past (up until the new 2014 season), a Red Bull Air Race track consisted of 3 different kinds of gates, requiring different fly through procedures:   Pylon pairs to be flown through horizontally. Pylon pairs to be flown through vertically. Single chicane pylons to be crossed on alternating sides (with irrelevant roll angle).   But in the new season in 2014 there don't seem to be any gates of the 2nd kind anymore.  All gates apart from the single chicane ones are to be passed in horizontal position. But while there seem to have been quite a few rule changes after the 4 year break, in order to equalize some technical aspects of the planes and to generally increase the safety, I couldn't find any information about the removal of the vertical gates in particular.  So why were the vertically passed pylon pairs abolished? Is this also connected to increasing safety? If yes, then in which way were those gates less safe than the horizontal ones? If not, then what else is the reasoning for their removal? "
1436,Is it true that Brazil made 1 billion dollars from the world cup?,"I've heard that Brazil invested 11 billion dollars to prepare for the world cup and have made less than 1 billion. Is it true? If so, does it mean that they lost 10 billion dollars?   And if that's true, didn't they make the calculations to predict the income of their investments? "

1438,"Is Tom Glavine the only hockey player who was drafted by the NHL, but went on to play another professional sport?","At his MLB Hall of Fame induction, Tom Glavine noted that he was also drafted to play hockey by the NHL's Los Angeles Kings (1984 draft, 4th round), ahead of Hockey Hall of Famers Brett Hull (6th Round, Calgary Flames) and Luc Robataille (9th Round, Kings).  Two other hall of famers also came from that class, Mario Lemieux and Patrick Roy, making that draft class a great trick hockey-trivia question (""how many hall of famers were drafted in the 1984 NHL Draft?"").  Are there other NHL draftees who went on to play another professional sport, or were drafted in another sport and gave that up to play in the NHL? "
1439,How does Champions League work?,"Thanks to an answer to a previous question, I now have a better understanding of the BPL. But now I am trying to figure out the Champions League.  What is the criteria for getting into it?  How is the season scheduled?  What takes priority (a domestic league fixture, or a Champions League match)?  And while this may warrant a whole different question later, how do player contracts/salaries change when a their club is in the Champions League? "

1442,How can a top seed in a tennis tournament be a qualifier?,"I have noticed in this tournament (it is ITF Futures level) that the player, who is No. 1 seed in the main draw, also played qualification. (It shows that he was given wild card for qualifying.)  How is this possible? I would expect that if his ranking is sufficient to be seeded player in the main draw, it should also be sufficient to avoid qualifying.    To clarify: I am referring to Ivo Klec, who is listed as No. 1 seed both in qualifying draw and main draw when I look at the tournament here. See also the following screenshots:      I suspect it might have something with him entering the tournament late? (See acceptance list on the same link. He list listed there among withdrawals.) But I do not know that much about the system how the players enter the tournaments; so I have decided to ask here. "
1443,Can you play baseball more or less defensively?,"In football (and I'm sure many other sports) if you're a goal down, you can push up with more attackers, and put more pressure on the opponent to try and get a goal back. If you're leading by a goal or two, you can keep more men behind the ball and make it more difficult for the other team to score a goal.  In baseball, if you go a few runs down, can you change the way you play and become more offensive than you were before? Do the fielders change position? Does the batter swing at more pitches than he would have done before? "

1445,How does arbitration work in baseball?,"First, my understanding is that they use professional labor arbitrators, not people with a strong specific knowledge of baseball. So ""old"" metrics, hits, runs, RBIs and ERAs count for more than on base percentages (OBPs) or FIPs (field independent pitching statistics).  Second, my further understanding is that first, second and third year ""arb"" players tend to get about 40, 60 and 80 percent of what a free agent would get ""on average,"" although their is a wide variation in individual cases. That is, in some cases, the arbitrators would value players rather differently than the managers who sign free agents.  Third, my last understanding is that the arbitrator has to choose either the player's or team's salary proposal. He cannot ""split the difference"" or go outside the ranges.  Why does baseball use a system like this? Is three (limited discretion) a factor of one (limited baseball experience)? And why has it worked as well as it has for a long time, despite obvious flaws? "
1446,"How do (National League) managers decide when to ""pinch hit"" for their pitchers?","You're in the top of the seventh inning with a 1-1 tied score. Your starter has thrown about 80 pitches, meaning that he's good for at least one, maybe two, more innings. Your bullpen is tired, but is still rated better than the other team's bullpen. Your seventh, eighth and ninth players are up. For now, we'll assume that whether or not we ""pinch hit"" for our starter depends on what the seventh and eighth players do. Here are my preferences.   If the seventh and eight batters both get on base, and one or both of them score (e.g. the second batter gets an extra base hit that scores the first batter, and possibly himself if it's a home run), I'll keep the pitcher in to protect my new (2-1 or 3-1) lead. If the seventh and eighth batters both make an out, I'll let my pitcher close the top of the inning, so he can pitch at least the bottom of the seventh, on the theory that he'll ""save"" more runs than we'll score by having a pinch hitter bat for him. I might even tell him to strike out intentionally so he won't run the risk of getting injured. If the seventh and eighth batters both get on base, say first and second, I'll ""pinch hit"" for my pitcher to try to score a go-ahead run. If the seventh and eighth batters make one single (or walk) and one out, that's a close one, because I'm undecided between trying to score, or save, an extra run.   Two more considerations. 1) There's only one bench player left, meaning that if you use him now, all remaining pitchers will have bat for themselves. 2) Your starter bats only .053, but all your relievers bat .000.   The actual (Pirates') manager decided to pinch hit for the pitcher in scenario 2, after two outs.  What would cause him to do this? Put another way, what considerations would govern his choice? "
1447,What are the rules around a tap-in in golf?,"I notice golf players often miss a long putt by a small amount so that there's only a few inches remaining.  In this situation they perform what I believe is called a ""tap-in"" and are allowed to take that shot immediately, rather than waiting for their opponent to putt.  Typically when a golfer does this, they put their left foot forward (for right-handers) somewhat awkwardly. The stance is clearly unusual. Are there any rules that dictate how a ""tap-in"" must be performed?  Or is the unusual stance a tradition? "
1448,Two point conversion from 15 yard line?,"During preseason, the NFL are trialling having extra points snapped from the 15 yard line. During the Giants-Bills preseason opener, all three extra points were successfully kicked.  But what would happen if a team tried to go for two points. Can they call a fake, and try to score from 15 yards out? If they reach the endzone, it still worth 2 points? Or can they declare their intentions, and go for the endzone from the 2 yard line? Or if they are desperate (last seconds of match, two points down), would they have to call a regular play from 15 yards out to score? "
1449,Is a base runner automatically out if they stop advancing when forced to their next base?,"Here's a situation that came up during a back lot league softball game a few weeks ago. (Note: While our league has some of its own rules we try to defer to MLB rules in all causes that aren't specifically addressed.)  There is a runner on second (R2) and a runner on first, with no outs. A ground ball is hit to the third baseman (3B) who cleanly fields the ball away from third base. Seeing that R2 is running toward him, 3B does not go to third and instead waits to tag the incoming R2. R2, in an attempt to buy some time for the other runners, stops advancing to third base. As soon as R2 stops, 3B declares R2 is out (without making a tag) and throws the ball to first to make a play.  During the discussion after the play, the 3B claimed that any player advancing on a force cannot stop moving toward their next bag or they are automatically out (the same way a runner leaving the baseline to avoid a tag is considered out). Our rules don't have a specific clause that addresses this situation and I couldn't find anything in official MLB rules (though it's possible I missed something, as 3B claims it is an MLB rule).  So, is 3B’s claim correct? That if a runner who is forced to advance to their next base stops (in particular to avoid/delay a tag) they are automatically out? "
1450,How do companies get their logos on racing cars?,"Do the companies provide parts for free (or with heavy discounts) in exchange for having their logo on the car?  Or do they pay to have their logo on the car, and if so, can a car use Pirelli tyres but have a Bridgestone logo on the car, because they paid more?  Finally, do the teams approach the companies (by going after who they think makes the best parts for their car), or vice-versa (the company going after the team/car they think will give them a better return on advertising)? "
1451,Can a baseball player stop at a base after a home run?,"Suppose a player needs a triple to complete the cycle. In the ninth innings, the player hits a solo home run. Suppose that the game is a blowout, has no postseason implications, and so on such that the extra run is irrelevant. The player would rather achieve the statistical accolade of hitting for the cycle than another home run.  Can the player just stop running the bases at third and take a triple? If a player didn't run all the way home after a home run, what happens? Is he out? Would he statistically be credited with a triple or a home run? "
1452,Pitcher responsible for scored runs,"Which pitcher is responsible for the players left on base when the original pitcher leaves the game? For example, Pitcher A, is pulled out of the game with 2 men left on base.  A reliever - Pitcher B - comes in and a run is scored.  Is Pitcher A responsible for the men on base or the reliever, or pitcher B? "
1453,Shooting Compound bow on a Crossbow Range?,"The archery range near my place has two areas. One for Compound/Traditional bows and one for compound bows. The crossbow range has a tower for practicing shooting from elevation. When it's empty and not occupied by crossbowers, I'd like to try shooting from that tower instead.  My only concern is respect for the equipment on the ranges. Are there any issues with shooting crossbow targets with a compound? e.g. am I going to damage the targets shooting my compound on crossbow targets? "
1454,What are the roles of vice captain?,"Does the Vice captain of a team have any influence in selecting the playing 11 or other activities in international cricket?

1456,What is the rule for wide ball during reverse hit or switch hit?,"It is permitted for a batsman to reverse or switch his bat from right to left or vice versa for getting runs.  If they missed the ball means, what is the rule there regarding wide?  To be more clear, for ex,  If a batsman faces the ball with RHB and switch his bat to LHB and missed the ball, now the ball went outside the leg stump according to LHB, is this a wide ball? "

If a batsman doubted that he or his partner didn't get reach any of the runs, are they allowed to run more than the maximum number? "
1458,Stumping from fast bowling?,"Is it possible to dismiss a batsman by stumping off a fast bowler with the wicket keeper not standing up to the stumps?  To be more specific, for stumping a batsman, is it mandatory to keep the ball within the hands?(since the keeper has to throw the ball to stump the batsman when standing in the normal position for a fast bowler)  If the WK throws the ball to the stumps before the batsman returns to the crease, is this a runout or stumping? (the batsman is not intending to take a run)  Most of the WK are trying to throw the ball with under-arm in this scenario. Are there any rules regarding that? "
1459,Ovechkin's +/- in his recent hat trick game,"Alex Ovechkin had 3 goals and 1 assist in Saturday's 5-1 win over the New Jersey Devils. The Devils only scored 1 goal so I'd assume his minimum +/-, assuming he was on the ice when the Devils scored, is +3 (4 points for - 1 against). But he is listed as +2. Is this a mistake, me being stupid, or missing something about +/-? "

1464,What are the side effects/drawbacks of compression apparel?,"I've been running for some time now and every now and then some friend tells me about the benefits of compression apparel.  They say it prevents premature fatigue by smartly, well, compressing the muscles... They also say that they help your circulatory system by bettering the blood flows.  Now, while every major brand has its compression apparel line, some seem to perform better like BSC, Skins, X-bionic, etc.  Are there any drawbacks? Any side effects? And especially why aren't they allowed for cycling competitions (see this article)? Does this has something to do with compression garments being dangerous somehow? "
1465,How does one become an adequate fencing official?,"I have officiated dry and electric foil fencing matches. Electric matches are less difficult to officiate due to the assistance of a scoring machine...but scoring machines are not foolproof.  Issues stem from being able to describe the phase (eg. right of way, attack, counter attack, parry-riposte, remise of attack, etc.) on the spot correctly, consistently, and reliably as it occurs very fast.  How does one become an adequate fencing official? I understand the human element, but how can one improve consistency and reliability so that s/he describes phases more correctly? "

But now, he is not in the list, ie, he got out for a duck (I think it is his only duck in ODI history).  When did this happen?  Which bowler took his wicket? "
1467,Importance of a pre-shot routine,"Before shots in golf and before free-throws in basketball, I notice players have a distinctive series of actions before setting up to hit the golf ball/shoot the free throw.  A few examples of pre-shot routines:   A golfer steps behind the golf ball, takes a few practice swings, steps into address, takes a few waggles, then hits the golf ball. A basketball player takes the basketball, simulates a free throw with his hand, bounces the basketball twice, looks at the hoop and sets his feet, then shoots the free throw.   Michael Jordan says making putts is equitable to making free throws.(1)     “I equate making putts with making free throws, and my biggest mental   challenge shooting free throws was in my second year, 1986, when I   came back from a foot injury for the playoffs and had a 63-point game   against Boston in the Garden. I had to make two free throws to send   the game into overtime, and all I focused on was the basics – I’m not   gonna be short. I’m gonna extend and reach for the rim – all the   fundamentals that I had worked on at home and at practice for all   those years. Golf is no different.”   What is the importance of a pre-shot routine? What benefits will a player have with a pre-shot routine? "
1468,How many times have the team batting first declared innings and then lost the match by innings?,"In the recently completed test match of Aus Vs India, Australia lost by an innings even after declaring their first innings. How many times have this happened in Test cricket? Are there any reference to any previous games in which the same happened? "
1469,Is there a rule that protects the goalkeeper in the 6yard-box?,"After yesterday's red card for Nani in Manchester United against Real Madrid (March 5th 2013) I decided to read the entire Rulebook Laws of the Game by FIFA (IFAB), including the guidelines for referees concerning the interpretation of the rules. Sadly enough, this was my first time that I read the rules, although playing Football for nearly 20 years now.  I got the answer to my initial question whether the sending off was justified, but the rulebook raised a lot of different questions. The problem is that I found no clues to some common understandings of the game, for example that it is forbidden to clamp the ball between the legs in order to make it unreachable for the opponent.  The main issue, however, is that I could not find anything regarding the Goalkeeper receiving special treatment in the 6yard box (other than being dressed differently and being allowed to use the hands on the ball), as it is often pointed out and ruled as foul play.  Can anyone help me finding the rules for that, or clarifying these issues? Are there other official rules besides FIFA's Laws of the Game?  Thanks in advace! "
1470,Should a point guard consider who is he passing to?,"In basketball, should a point guard distinguish who is he passing to? I mean, when I play point guard, I'm always trying to pass to any of my teammate that is open (so that everyone gets involved and there is ball movement).   Should a point guard pass to any open teammate, or he should consider teammate skills (shooting, passing, ...) and his position before passing? "
1471,What is the difference between balls in Test and ODI Cricket?,"In Test Cricket, the red colored ball is used while in ODI and T20I, the white colored ball is used.

1473,Is Roger Federer's 65 consecutive Grand Slams a record?,"In 2016, Roger Federer missed a Grand Slam for the first time in his career, the French Open. This was the first Grand Slam he had not competed in since the since 2000 Australian Open, i.e. 65 straight Grand Slams.  Is this a record? If it is, then what is the next highest number of consecutive slams played without a withdrawal? "
1474,Are you allowed to fake a field goal or punt?,"Whenever an offense reaches the 4th down in American Football, i.e. they didn't achieve to get a new 1st down in their past 3 attempts, they're faced with basically 2 fundamentally different options. They can either play that down as a ""normal"" offensive play in order to reach a new 1st down, or they can either punt the ball or attempt a field goal, depending how far they are from the end zone.  The usual strategy is to settle for a punt or field goal, unless the situation is rather urgent (i.e. you can't risk giving your opponent the offense) and/or you're confident you can make a new 1st down. What I haven't ever seen in the NFL (although, I'm only following it rather actively for about 2 seasons) is a faked field goal attempt or punt and I wonder if this is even possible. What I mean is making the play look like a field goal/punt, i.e. putting the special team and kicker on the field, and then having the kicker actually run (or pass?) the ball instead, trying to make a normal 4th down attempt.  So do the rules actually allow you to fake a field goal attempt or punt which you then transform into a normal play or does making a genuine field goal attempt require you to go through with this and not doing so would just result in a failed field goal? Is there a difference between punt and field goal in this regard? Or is there a difference between various rule sets, i.e. College and NFL? If you are technically allowed to do that to some degree in the NFL, then why isn't it done more often as a trick play? "
1475,Why can't multiple fouls be accepted by the offended team?,"If there are multiple fouls on the play against the same team, it's common to hear that all fouls are declined except for the one that results in the largest gain. Why can't the offended team accept all the fouls?  If there are 3 fouls on the play, 2 against 1 that all count for the same yardage, logic would dictate that the first 2 penalties would offset and the 3rd would be enforced, but in actuality only the first 2 offset and the 3rd is ignored. Why? "
1476,What is a single powerplay in ice hockey?,"This is a question only about the statistical representation of power plays.  When looking at team statistics (example), there are numbers that describe teams efficiency in power plays and penalty killing.  In the linked example Denmark had an advantage 29 times and scored 10 goals thus having 34.48% powerplay efficiency. But how do they get the ""29""? It is clearly not the amount of penalties as in the penalty killing table Canada has had 29 disadvantages while actually having earned 35 penalties.  It is obvious that a 5-man team playing 2 minutes against team that has one player sent off on a minor penalty is a powerplay, but I am concerned about some trickier cases:   Player a (team X) is sent off for 2 minutes. After 1:50 (game time) player b (team X) is sent off. After 1:50 (game time) player c (team X) is sent off etc. Does this all counts as a single disadvantage situation? Can a team play 4v5 for 50 minutes and have only one penalty killed? Player a (team X) is sent off for 5 minutes. A minute later player b (team Y) is sent off for 2 minutes. Does team X get two disadvantage situations based on a single penalty? It would seem wrong that you have more powerplays just because a 5 minute penalty was split in half by a minor penalty on the opposing team.   Edit  As this question is pretty much a duplicate, I will specify that I am interested to find the interpretation that is used by IIHF as in the linked example. The IIHF rulebook defines some of the statistics, but does not define this one.  I initially asked without specifying IIHF rules because I expected that there would be a common and accepted understanding of the statistic.  I was aware of the NCAA rulebook, I just don't really believe that IIHF tournaments and different national leagues follow the NCAA definitions and there should be either the accepted or at least the IIHF definition of counting advantageous/disadvantageous situations.

1477,What is the role of the person escorting and recording the driver during the interview?,"In the formula 1 after the race finish and they interviewing the driver, they are escorted by a person recording the interview.  What is that role position? And why they need it?  Are they afraid of what driver say? Or they need a copy of the interview in case the press put something different?

1478,"NBA violation , drop pass, regain and pass","In this Shaqtin example  at 1:40 into video, Portland player 11 Leonard takes a rebound, drops passes to no one and picks the ball and then immediately passes.  The Pass to no one, is just a dribble. Leonard picks the ball up after it bounces, so valid dribble. He didnt dribble prior and he disposes the ball immediately after regaining the ball in 2 hands. No double dribble , no travel.   Why is that a violation ?    "
1479,Why was spitball allowed to some players?,"Wikipedia has this to say on the history of banning spitball:     The spitball was banned in two stages. In the winter of 1919–1920, managers voted to partially ban the spitball, allowing each team to designate at most two pitchers who would be permitted to legally throw spitballs. Then, following the 1920 season, the spitball was banned leaguewide, except for existing spitballers who were grandfathered in and allowed to keep throwing the pitch legally until they retired.   The first stage looks highly surprising, but somewhat fair.  It's a way to allow some spitballs in the game but not all spitballs.  The second stage puzzles me.  Did this decision lead to inequality of rules between players and teams?  Was such inequality real, and seen as a problem?  Were there any considerations that made banning spitball for everybody impractical? "
1480,What is it like to change from football (soccer for the Americans) to rugby?,"I have recently moved to a new city and want to join a sports team here. I have played football (soccer) for about 20 years (since I was 6), but am thinking about changing to rugby. I have gotten tired of all the complaining to the ref and to each other during football, and from what I have heard, this is much much better in rugby. Also, I think the sport would suit me. I am a very physical player in football, and rely for a large part on my strength and stamina.  But I do have some hesitations. Has anyone experienced this, or are there any rugby players who know about football players that changed to rugby? What are key differences? How important is ball control in rugby? Or is it really more based on strength/stamina? Is it difficult to learn how to position yourself in rugby? Do you think the transition would be easy? I couldn't find anything about this on internet, that is why I am asking you guys. Some hints/tips would be much appreciated! "
1481,How can I go faster in slalom?,"I've trained in alpine skiing for a couple of years now. I'm good at downhill &amp; super g, and my times are improving, but I'm really bad at slalom. How can I go faster in slalom without crashing? Are there special tips apart from those taught in training? "
1482,"How do water-temperature, swim distance and skill influence the choice of using a wet suit for the swim-stretch in a triathlon competition?","Water Temperature: I'm good with cold, but I am not an ice-swimmer.  Frequency/Distance: I swim an hour weekly (tri-club), with two hours additionally every 2-3 weeks, but I have yet to swim more than 200m without pushing off a wall.  Skill: I have been swimming for a few months. Through training, I have been able to manage a small constant glide at an easy pace.  Would a wet suit provide added benefit to swimming in different temperatures of water in varying distances? Is my skill level a significant factor in considering which type of wet suit I should consider? How do water-temperature, swim distance and skill influence the choice of using a wet suit for the swim-stretch in a triathlon competition? "
1483,Question on legs/body size for women runners,"I have a female friend who is training for a 5km race. She's 1.6m tall and complains that her short legs (83cm long) penalize her.  I was looking at the women 5km world record holders and noticed that the top 3 are all exactly 1.60m tall like her (found height by googling the athlete's name, right hand side of search results) but couldn't find information as to their legs size.   Does anybody know how long the legs of these athletes are? Are there known theoretical value as to the optimum legs/body size ratio for runners?  "
1484,Seeding for Round 1 in NCAA basketball tournament,"In the ""field of 65"" style tournament bracket, there were two 16-seeds (presumably the weakest teams) that had a play-in game in order to play the overall #1 seed.  When they expanded to 68, it's now 4 play-in games between 16-16 seeds, 13-13 seeds, 11-11 seeds and 16-16 seeds.  Why didn't they just do it between all 16 seeds?  Was there specific reasoning?  Is it the same seeds in each region every year or is there a mechanism for selecting which teams will play in Round 1.    (I know it can  be debated that playing in such a game can be a good warm-up for lower seeds, but I don't think that was the official reason.) "
1485,What is the correct turf for metal studs in rugby?,"I have a pair of plastic cleats for practice and dirt fields for play. My question is when would I use metal studded cleats?  Only on rainy and muddy fields, or can/should I use them for also dirt fields that are hard?  I'm under the understanding that the metal studs will make it more difficult to move since they won't grasp the dirt since it's hard and not muddy, hence they won't sink in.  Is this the correct assumption or should they be used if I have them for better grip period?  I should mention I am a forward (open side flanker). "
1486,How important is racquetball ball freshness?,"I'm a new racquetball player, playing once or twice a week. I'm not a power player nor do I play with many people who are. I noticed that balls sell in bulk for less than $1 each and was wondering if that would be an easy way to ensure a supply. However, it may take many months (a year even?) to go through them all. Should I be concerned about deterioration once the canister is unsealed? "

1489,What factors does the shot power depend on and how can it be improved?,"I used to have pretty hard shots up until I had a persistent injury to my lower back, probably due to sedentary workdays coupled with irregular training. Well, a few months of physiotherapy and changing my work environment I have overcome this injury now and play football without any problems... except my shots seems to have withered altogether. I can run, tackle, dribble but have no real intensity in my shots these days.   That got me thinking; what does the shot power really depend on? What distinguishes players with incredibly hard/fast shots from others? Something I find particularly interesting is that there is no direct dependance on the body frame of the player, in other words some small and thin player can still have tremendous shots despite being undersized compared to others. So it's not all about being pumped..  As a follow-up, how can one improve his/her shot power? "
1490,"In fantasy baseball, should I avoid playing pitchers who are starting against my batters?","One of the important things in fantasy football is to make sure that your defense isn't starting against your high-scoring offensive players, especially your quarterback. For example, if you had Tom Brady and the Houston Texans' defense on your team, you wouldn't want to start the Houston defense because if Tom Brady is doing well there's a good chance Houston isn't.  I'm wondering if a similar principle applies in fantasy baseball. In my head-to-head points league, I noticed that I have multiple instances where one of my starting pitchers is pitching against one or more of my batters. I'm I going to net less points? Will the points gained by batters significantly impact the points my pitchers get, and vice versa? Ultimately, Is it wise for me to play my starting pitchers against my batters?  Edit: Below I've added the scoring system for my league, per Jacob G's request. I'd be happy with a more general answer, since this becomes pretty localized. But this would be my specific case.  Note that lineups get set on Monday and cannot be changed until the following week.  **Scoring for Batting** Categories          Settings Singles             1 point Doubles             2 points Triples             3 points Walks (Batters)     1 point Caught Stealing     -1 point Hit by Pitch        1 point Home Runs           4 points Strikeouts (Batter) -0.5 points Runs                1 point Runs Batted In      1 point Stolen Bases        2 points  **Scoring for Pitching** Categories          Settings Walks Issued (Pitchers) -0.75 points Blown Saves         -3 points Complete Games      10 points Earned Runs         -1 point Hits Allowed        -0.5 points Hit Batsmen         -1 point Innings             2 points Strikeouts (Pitcher).5 points Losses              -5 points Perfect Games       50 points Quality Starts      3 points Saves               7 points Shutouts            15 points Wins                10 points  "

1492,"How many people can ""cut down the net""?","It's traditional for winning college basketball teams to ""cut down the net"" when they reach the Final Four. But just how many people (players, coaches, staff) are allowed to cut down the net?   That is, can assistant coaches cut down the net? "
1493,What are the differences between the Wooden Award and the Naismith Award?,"College basketball has two primary ""player of the year"" awards: the Wooden Award and the Naismith Award.  The Wooden Award is ""presented annually to the outstanding collegiate basketball Player of the Year.""  The Naismith Award is ""awarded annually to the women's and men's college basketball players of the year.""  What are the differences between the Wooden Award and the Naismith Award? "
1494,Is the runner on first forced to run?,"Looking for some clarification on this situation that came up today:  There is one out and a runner on first base (R1).  The batter hits a fly ball in the infield.  The first baseman (1st) makes an attempt to catch the ball and it drops out of his glove.  1st picks the ball up and tags the batter/runner out as he runs up the first base line (before he touches first base).  The batter/runner was called out, R1 stayed on first and we continued play with two outs now.    Is this the correct call?  There was a lot of discussion as to whether R1 is still forced to second base on this play (allowing someone to tag him for a double play) or can R1 stay put on first base (as was allowed in our case)?  I know rule 7.03 b states :      If a runner is forced to advance by reason of the batter becoming a runner and two runners are touching a base to which the following runner is forced, the following runner is entitled to the base and the preceding runner shall be out when tagged or when a fielder possesses the ball and touches the base to which such preceding runner is forced.   Our situation is slightly different as the batter/runner never made it to first base before being tagged out.   Was the correct call made? "
1495,Are these overthrows 4 or 6?,"Consider the third scenario asked in this question, where it has been established that the throw by the first fielder is overthrows.     Two fielders are running behind the ball. The first slides, stops the ball and wants to pass it to the second fielder. But his throw misses the second fielder and the ball rolls over the boundary ropes.   Assuming that the throw by the first fielder goes directly over the boundary ropes instead of rolling over, how many overthrow runs are given to the batting side? Is it 4 or are 6 runs given as the throw does not touch any part of the playing surface before getting grounded? Also, is there any instance of where a fielder has thrown (overthrows) a ball directly over the boundary ropes? "
1496,How are football players objectively rated?,"Football (soccer) by comparison to many other sports has very little in the way of personal player statistics. This is particularly true for defenders, who don't even have the number of goals scored as a potential comparison statistic. How then are players compared? How do fans, commentators and managers agree on the players that are playing well and those that are not? For many other sports, even if you didn't watch a game, reviewing the stats will give you a fair indication of the players that did well or poorly in that game. This doesn't seem possible for Football, which means you need to watch every single game in order to judge who is doing well.  Am I mistaken? Are there useful statistics that can be used to compare players? If not, how is this normally achieved? "
1497,How are jersey numbers assigned in Cricket?,"It is quite normal in international cricket matches(Test/ODI/T20) that players are having a particular Jersey number assigned to them. Some of the famous players such as Ricky Ponting always wears number 14, while Sachin Tendulkar wears number 10. So the question is who assigns these numbers and on what basis are these allocated? Is it on first come first serve basis? Are there some procedure followed for this?     "
1498,Rules against celebratory compensation in the ncaa,"I was listening to the radio, this morning, and heard that the Rick Pitino, the head coach of Louisville, wanted to bring his team to New Orleans. He wanted the whole team to support the Louisville's women's basketball team.   Jay Bilas had mentioned that NCAA rules prohibit them from supporting their team. The reason or intent of this would to circumvent universities or colleges for providing players compensatory benefits for winning a championship.  Is there an official rule that states that this is indeed true? If so, where does it specifically say so? "
1499,Super over for super over,"If the runs scored in a super over by two teams were level, how will the winning side be determined?  E.g. Team A scored 10 runs in 6 balls and Team B scored 10 runs in 5/6 balls with two wickets lost; what will they do?  Will they go for another super over? If so, how many times will they keep going for another super over while they all result in ties? "
1500,How would you score a hidden ball trick?,"If the defense runs a hidden ball trick on a base runner and gets him out, how would it be officially scored?  How about a scenario:  The defense meets on the mound where the second baseman is given the ball by the pitcher.  A runner on second is tagged out while wondering off the base by the second baseman.  Is this scored 4U?  Is it a caught stealing, a pick off, etc? "

1503,How to design swim practices for long distance swimming,"I've decided to swim a 2.5km race a year from now. For the last two years I have swum 3km daily, but at a uniform, comfortable pace which I believe is not optimal for boosting competitive performance. I wonder what swim practices should look like if I'm interested in getting really good at 2.5km freestyle? Also take into account that I swim every day, so maybe I should alternate between practice sets? "
1504,Who would hear a protest in an Inter-league game?,"In a game between the Chicago White Sox and the San Francisco Giants on 8/13/2014, the White Sox manager was ejected for arguing the application of the newly-clarified rule that a catcher may not block the plate while awaiting a throw (ie, without the ball).  Had this game been protested, who would have heard the protest?  Normally a game is protested to the League President, but in an inter-league game, is that the home team's President, the Commissioner of Baseball, or someone else? "
1505,Blocking three pointers in basketball,"In basketball, why don't players block three pointers by putting their hand above the hoop and pushing it away? Many players are close to 7 feet and can easily reach the hoop, so why doesn't a player just stand near the hoop and push away three pointers? "
1506,Defense against an isolation play,"I'm a geezer now, but when I played competitive ultimate, a specific type of isolation play was very popular.  Near the end zone, the handler would call out ""Iso bob"" (or whatever they wanted to signify the play), and everyone except bob would clear the end zone.  Bob's defender would then have the choice of either facing bob or facing the handler.  If he faced bob, the handler would throw, and bob would have a step on him for a crisp throw.  If he faced the handler, bob would cut and have a step on him for the cut.  If another player ran in to help, his mark would cut to a corner of the end zone.  If a team ran a zone defense, this didn't work.  Is there a good way to run a man defense and shut down isolation plays?  And, as an aside, are they still popular? "
1507,How does the Financial Fair Play rule work?,"When it comes to the transfer window, what is the Financial fair play rule? How does it impact the spending limit for the clubs? "
1508,What makes financial fair play fair?,"My understanding of the financial fair play rule from UEFA is that clubs can't spend more money then they take in from ticket sales, sponsorships, media deals, etc. The goal being to prevent a super rich owner from coming in and dumping loads of money into a team to buy all the good players and keep everyone else from getting a chance at them.  As I watch this happen though, I'm wondering how this is actually fair to the smaller clubs. The big clubs will continue to make millions and millions from sponsorship deals that the smaller clubs won't have a chance to get unless they somehow can break into that elite group.  If you use the EPL as an example, the best teams in the league have pretty much always been the same (or at least for the last 25 or so years since the silly amounts of money have been poured into the game). There isn't really a chance for even a medium level team like West Brom or Hull to break into the top 4 long term because they won't be able to keep their best players, even if they have a rich owner swoop in a give them millions.  So what makes this rule fair? Or am I missing the point of the rule? "
1509,How does NBA players' salary increase during the playoffs?,"In a sports column I was reading, the writer mentioned something about ""win shares"", that existed to provide a financial incentive to win games during the playoffs, especially since otherwise players weren't being paid any more for participating in the playoffs than they were otherwise. Does this still exist today? If not, is there any existing way of paying players for playoff games? "

Liverpool are in the middle of signing Mario Balotelli from Milan in the Italian Serie A. It is reported, that if the deal goes through, he could be available to play this upcoming Monday (4 days).  Presumably different leagues have different protocols, and if that's the case then the English Premier League could be focus since that is to be his destination if the transfer does go through.  Is a recently transferred player able to play ""instantly"" for his new squad? Or is there a period of time before the player may start a game? "
1512,"What does ""grade"" means for junior tennis tournaments?","When I look at calendar of junior tournaments on the ITF website, I see that each tournaments are given some kind of category: They are marked, for example, as Grade 1, ..., Grade 5, Grade B2, Grade A.  What does this mean in practice? Does it influence how much points can player get from the tournament into ranking? Does it somehow influence who can compete? "
1513,What kind of winter clothing will allow me to feel hits while still keeping me warm in outdoors arena,"Last time I played in winter, I got accused of cheating - likely truthfully but unintentionally. My winter jacket cushioned hits from BBs so much in some cases I didn't feel them at all.  The obvious solution is thinner clothing. Except it was -15C, evening, and thinner clothing would mean COLD. Especially in case you lie in wait in some bushes, sniping, or crawl through thick snow.  What kind of winter clothing (or other solutions?) will be thin enough not to cushion BBs too much while still giving a good cold protection? "
1514,Is it possible to enter junior tournament based on ATP/WTA rankings?,"Many players who are still eligible to play as juniors already enter enter senior tournaments. It is not uncommon to see, that some player plays qualifying at Grand Slam tournament and if they do not qualify, then they enter boys/girls competition.  It can happen that a player concentrates only on senior events, in which case they do not have points in the juniors ranking. But still such a player might want to enter at least some junior tournaments. For example, I think that junior grand slams are considered prestigious. If such player has enough points in senior ranking, but does not have point in junior rankings, can they enter the main draw? Or do they have to play qualifying?  I have noticed in Wikipedia article about  tennis at the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics that one player entered based on being in Top 450 in the ATP ranking. However, Youth Olympic Games are kind of a special event, so it is possible that this was an exception and not a rule.  To summarize my question shortly:     Is it possible to enter junior grand slam tournament (or other junior tournament) based on ATP/WTA rankings (instead of junior rankings)?   "
1515,2014 New Table Tennis ball material rules for ITTF,I was reading on reddit that there's a new ball being used for table tennis. Is this true?  Are there new rules in place regarding a new ball? If so what caused the change to of rules? 
1516,Baseball runner called out but still runs like he was safe drawing a throw allowing another runner to advance,Here is the situation. Runners at first and second nobody out.  Grounder to second throws out the runner going to second. Called out clearly by the umpire.  The relay to first for the double play is not in time.  The runner to second who was called out continues his run towards third base dugout....however the first baseman tries to throw out the runner on third who was off the bag a fair bit but the ball gets past the third baseman. The runner on third will score but then the out runner who was jogging towards home decides to try and deke out the third baseman by touching the bag and breaking for home.  It works. The third baseman throws home and throws that away allowing the runner on first to advance.  What's the right call??? 
1517,What does it mean when a scorecard mentions 3.6 in the Overs column in cricket?,"When I look at a scorecard I see a column ""O (overs)"" mentions 3.6 or 7.0. What does it mean? How to understand this statistic? I know that ""overs"" mean that player makes 6 legal deliveries to the batsman, but I don't understand what 3.6 stands for.  "
1518,Where does the football teams play home matches during the Rugby World Cup?,"Where does football teams play their home matches when the stadiums are involved in Rugby World Cup 2015 matches?  Apart from Twichenam it seems that other stadiums are used for Premier League's football matches, so how is it possible to play together those sports? "
1519,Does first or second place matter in Euro 2016 Qualification?,"When qualifying for the Euro 2016 competition, the first 2 placed teams of a qualification group automatically qualify.  Does the place in the group have any impact to the tournament draw or seeding?  Ie, will the team that places first in their qualification group get drawn against more favourable teams, than the team that qualified in second?  Or is the draw based on the ranking of the teams, independent of the qualifcation process? "
1520,Can an offensive lineman catch a lateral in high school football?,"In high school football, can an offensive lineman legally catch a lateral pass? Does it make any difference if a receiver is covering him from the snap? "
1521,Is a double-touch in beach volleyball OK as long as it's part of one action?,"There was the same question for indoor volleyball, but in the case of beach volleyball:     If the other team pass, set, hits it over to me and I kick it and then   it hits my chest (but it's only one action/motion) would that count as   a double hit fault?      What about if the other team attacks it and I go to set set it and it   slips thru my fingers and bounces off my head but it's only one action   on my part?  "
1522,Why are some offensive formations illegal in American football?,"In American football you have to have at least 7 players on the line of scrimmage. You can have more, but some of your players are then ""covered"" by others and are no longer eligible. What's the point of this rule? What if you allowed the offense to put a few people on the line of scrimmage as they liked? Or, if it's necessary to have five offensive linemen on the line of scrimmage for some reason, why force two receivers to be on the line as well? "
1523,Can an eligible receiver play at an ineligible position?,"I was reading through an older question here and I was wondering if a player whose number lies in the eligible receiver range can line up as an interior offensive lineman?    Also, if they can line up there (I'm thinking in case of some injury) are they automatically still eligible receivers without any additional declaration? "
1524,"How skillful are major polls at predicting the winner of sports, particularly college football?","And how does this skill vary during the season?  For decades we've heard the presentation that polls are biased, especially in preseason, and lazily voted on. Does empirical data generally bear this out? "
1525,Why are WR in the slot covered by non-CBs in American football?,"It's College Bowl season and I'm seeing/hearing some things from the announcers that I need some clarification on.  Please note, I have never played any organized football before so all I know is from watching with my dad and friends.  There was a WR who multiple times lined up either in the backfield, in the slot, or what looks like as a wing back (and motioned out to the slot area).  The defense for some reason played him with a LB or Safety and have gotten torched multiple times because of the speed mismatch (huge gains of 20+ yds, TD catch, etc).  Why can't the defense leave a CB to shadow the guy, even if he's in the backfield, slot, wingback position?    For each of the plays where he torched them, I don't know the offensive personnel package but in general the personnel package shouldn't be the problem.  If for example I see 3 WR and 2 RB, I'll have my nickel package to defend so the personnel match up shouldn't be the issue.  UPDATE: The game I am referring to is the Southern Miss vs. Univ Louisiana Lafayette game in the 2016 New Orleans Bowl.  The WR is on the Southern Miss team.  His name is Allenzae Staggers.  He's their #1 WR in all the passing categories (recs, yds, TDs, YAC) and doesn't seem like a possession receiver or 3rd string WR.  The highlights they played in the game during breaks showed he was beating man to man coverage.  I have seen and heard before on tv from many other announcers after a big play that it was a mismatch b/c so-and-so WR on (insert NFL or college team) was being defended by a LB or Safety and torched the defense.  I don't know what the offensive personnel was at the time for any of these plays were either but my guess is they had at least 3 WRs if some non-CB had to guard a WR but if as a defensive coordinator you see 3 WR running out, why wouldn't you trot out your nickel defense?  "

1527,Pittsburgh had to lose to make the playoffs,"Nearing the end of a historic season, it was possible for Pittsburgh to make the playoffs only if they lost a game:   by losing, they might be in a 3-team tiebreaker which they would win. otherwise, they would be in a 2-team tiebreaker, which they would lose.   What season was this, and what were the details of the potential tiebreaker situations?  Based on a recollection of late results, the scenario did not come about, and Chuck Noll was asked if he would intentionally lose if that was the only way to make the playoffs. His response: ""What do you think?"" "
1528,NFL blocked punt rules,During the Giants vs Lions game on December 18th 2016 there was a punt partially blocked by the Lions. The ball was deflected after the punter kicked it by a Lions player. This resulted in the ball going forward but much shorter than the average punt. The ball was eventually blown dead by the referee as it had stopped moving and no player was picking it up.  My question is that if the Lions touched the ball after it was kicked why was it not just a live ball that the Giants could recover? If a Lions player touched the ball and didn't catch it the Giants could recover so why was this any different? 
1529,What else can I do to my tennis racket to keep the ball in the court?,"I like to swing fast and hard....very hard. I get my stress out. But even with a head light tennis racket, on which I've weighted the handle, and top spin, my hits go too far.   I once borrowed a racket, and no matter how hard I hit it the ball stayed in court. Unfortunately I have lost contact with the person who had that racket.   What else can I do to my racket? I was thinking higher tension on the strings. Would that help? "
1530,Would the offensive line lying down at the snap be an effective trick play in American football?,"If the offense is confident the defensive line is going to rush the quarterback on a passing play, would it be effective as a trick play for the offensive line to lie down after the snap?   The idea being the defensive ends and tackles would be expecting resistance and thus be momentarily thrown off balance (or even fall down). Or would the defense simply walk over the prone offensive linemen?  BTW I realize this tactic would in no way counter the linebackers, but at the least it could reduce some of the pressure on the QB if played effectively. "

1532,Finished first Marathon training. Now what?,"This weekend I'll be running my first marathon. So, what comes next?  I know I shouldn't stop running (and don't want to). I followed a very detailed training plan, but haven't found a post-race plan. Is there such thing as a post-race plan?  So far I know I'll run 3k/2mi (as slow as I feel comfortable) the day after the race, but that's all I got.  Some more specific questions would be:   Is it too much if I run a half-marathon one week later? Should I still do long-runs every weekend?   What distance should I go for?  How long should I try to recover before signing up for my next marathon?  "
1533,"In tennis, how much is the server's advantage diminished if the game goes to ""deuce?""","In tennis, the person with the serve has a clear advantage. This is is certainly true at love-love, where four points are needed to win a game.  A server who lets the game go to ""deuce"" has squandered part of that advantage. From that point, two (consecutive) points are needed to win.  What do tournament (or other) statistics have to say about the server's advantage from ""deuce"" as opposed to from love?""  And do the statistics say that the receiver is actually favored to win the set, starting from an ""ad"" (advantage)? From this point, the receiver need to win only one game, while the server needs (at least) three. "
1534,"Are different skill sets required to excel at doubles, rather than singles tennis?","For example, America's Bryan Brothers excel at doubles tennis. Yet neither of them are recognized singles champions.  Do they communicate/co-ordinate better than other doubles pairs? Are there other skills that help them excel at doubles that aren't relevant to singles? Might growing up as (twin) brothers help them in this regard? "
1535,Is it worth fighting to hold serve in a losing set?,"Suppose you're down a couple break points in a set, so you have no reasonable chance of winning it. You are serving in what would be the sixth (and set) game for your opponent.   If you win the game, your opponent will have to serve for the sixth game, and you get to go onto to the next set with the serve. If you lose, your opponent serves first in the next set.  Yet, I've seen top players even at the grand slam events tacitly concede that sixth game, while on serve. Apparently they want to get to the next set. But why would they do this? If the server has the advantage, why not try to take advantage of this for a (relatively) easy win?  Conversely, if you're down 5-1, with the opponent on serve, might it make sense to concede the game on the opponent's serve to get to the next set with you on serve? "
1536,"Why are ""walkovers"" allowed in tennis tournaments?","Stan Wawrinka got a ""walkover"" in the third round of the U.S. open when his opponent had to withdraw from the match.  We're not talking about a situation where a player was, say, injured mid-match, but one where the opponent withdrew beforehand.  Why allow such a ""bye?"" Why not have aystem of ""lucky losers"" thatgive the last (defeated) opponent of Wawrinka's opponent the opportunity to face Wawrinka in the third round?  This would give defeated players an incentive to hang around for one more round, for the chance to be a ""runner up"" in case the winner can't go on. Also, it would mean that someone wouldn't get a ""free pass"" that would put him or her at an ""unfair"" advantage against other tournament competitors. "
1537,If the bat slips from the batsman's hand while he/she is outside the crease then is the batsman out?,"Let's suppose a batsman comes out of the crease and tries to hit the ball and loses grip on the bat and the bat flies and the batsman is outside the crease? Is this out? If yes, who gets the wicket? Has this ever happened in international cricket?  "
1538,What are the benefits of a golf club fitting?,"I am looking for a set of new golf clubs and get them fitted to me. I am looking at the TaylorMade Burner Plus iron set, with a steel, stiff-flexed shaft (my driver swing speed averages 115 mph and have had consistent advice to go with stiff-flexed shafts).   What are the benefits of a golf club fitting? Would it be more beneficial to buy the set of clubs I'm looking at and get them fitted or have a shop recommend clubs for me to purchase then get them fitted in-house? "
1539,"In tennis, is there any advantage to decline the opening serve?","In football, the winner of the coin toss can elect to ""receive"" or ""defer."" The advantage of ""deferring"" is that you get to receive after halftime, meaning that teams will often elect this option.  In tennis, the winner of the coin toss can elect to serve (or not). Are there any compensating reasons to decline the serve, as in football? Does any world class player routinely do this? "
1540,How often has an unseeded woman player gotten to/won the Finals in a Grand Slam tournament?,"If unseeded Shuai Peng manages to beat Caroline Wozniacki in the semi-finals of the U.S. Open (unlikely in my opinion), she will face either Serena Williams or Ekaterina Makarova in the finals. And if Peng wins the final, she will be an unseeded woman Grand Slam winner.  How often has that happened in the past? And to whom? "
1541,What are the dynamics of trading one veteran for several prospects?,"This question can be answered for any sport, but the one I understand best is baseball.  The Phillies' GM Reuben Amaro made a statement that prospects were overvalued in the marketplace, which is to say his opinion was that too few of them were offered for veteran players.  For instance, Amaro declined to trade veteran pitcher Cole Hamels to the Los Angeles Dodgers for anything less than their three top prospects, Joc Pederson, Corey Seager, and Julio Urias, NO deal. Maybe a deal could have been done for ONE of those three, plus two lesser prospects  My understanding is that prospects are something of ""lottery tickets,"" and you need  at least two, preferably three of them of the same category to replace the veteran you are giving up.  There is one hidden factor, and that is, by trading a veteran for prospects, you do a salary dump that enables you to hire another veteran, or retain another one (e.g. the Phillies dump Hamels so that they can afford to pay Cliff Lee).  Meaning that the Phillies offer of Hamels for the three prospects might have been ""fair"" if they had been willing to retain Hamels' salary as well.  So do teams actually manage to directly replace the value of their veterans by trading for prospects? Or is it the salary dump that makes up the difference? "
1542,8-ball call shot rules when more than one ball is scored,"If a player intends to score more than one ball in a single shot does he/she need to call all the balls he/she wants to score or just one of them?  I.e. I want to score ball 1 and 2 on a single shot, do I need to say I want to score ball 1 on pocket A and ball 2 on pocket B, or can I just call one of them and score both on the same play? "
1543,Why might a batter wear a leg brace?,"Watching an MLB Gameday live lookin today (7/6, NYM@CIN), I noticed Brayan Pena of the Reds batting with a leg brace. He singled, and removed the brace at first brace?  Why might someone do this? "
1544,runner in scoring position batting average,"Is ""runner in scoring position"" batting average a meaningful statistic?  I am simply a casual fan, but here is my logic.  Either one of these universes is reality:  1) when there are runners in scoring position, a batter changes his approach to ensure that he will get a base hit.  Perhaps he just tries to make contact, forgets about swinging for the fences, etc.  Therefore, ""runner in scoring position"" batting average is actually an important measure of a batter's ability to drive in runs.  It is a better predictor of a batter getting a base hit in a situation where there are runners in scoring position than batting average.  (If that is the case, why not always use this approach to increase the chance of getting on base??)  OR  2) a batter is ALWAYS trying to maximize their chance to get on base. ""Runner in scoring position"" batting average is simply a smaller sample of at bats measure of a batter's batting average.  It is not a better predictor of a batter getting a base hit in a situation where there are runners in scoring position than batting average.  Can someone help me understand? "

1546,"What is a ""Baltimore chop"" and why is it called that?","(I'm double asking because I'm pretty sure I know the answer to the first half, but would like confirmation anyways.)  Playing baseball recently, a batter chopped a ground ball hard, over the pitcher's head. This was referred to as a ""Baltimore chop"". That's what it is, right?  Why is it called that? ""Chop"" I get, but what's it have to do with Baltimore? "
1547,"Before the season began, what odds did Vegas give the Orioles of winning the AL East in 2014?","Looking at various websites' pre-season predictions for the major league baseball teams, many at places like ESPN and MLB.com had the Red Sox and Rangers doing very well and the Orioles typically out of the playoffs or worse if they got very specific.  Some magazines I saw had the Orioles dead last.  CBSsports.com's Jon Heyman seems to have come closest. What odds did Vegas give the O's at the beginning of the season? Also, were any bets taken that the Nationals and Orioles might play in the World Series this year?  If so, what were the odds? "
1548,How do doubles squash rules vary from singles rules?,"When playing doubles squash, what are the rules that vary from the singles rules?  For Example:   Do players in the team have to hit the ball alternately, or can either player hit the ball? Does a team have to elect a server or can either player serve or does it alternate wthin the team?  "
1549,what about a switch bowling action,"In the current era of cricket, we see batsmen using switch hits to play a ball. That is, while playing a ball they change their batting side (left to right handed and vice versa) just before the ball comes to them.  My question is, can a bowler bowl a switch ball? Meaning, can a left hand bowler bowl right handed to a batsman? If it is not permitted, then is it not unfair to the bowlers that batsmen can change their batting style but not the bowlers? Or are there are any rules against a switch hit? "
1550,Rules for Orange and Purple Caps in IPL,"In IPL, Orange and Purple caps are awarded to the highest run scorer and highest wicket taker.  I have three questions on this topic.   If more than one player has equal stats (highest runs or wickets), what will they do? Consider the following situation,   A player in the field is wearing orange cap for most runs, but in the middle of the innings (it may be first or second) a batsman from the batting side overtakes his runs.   Will he allowed to wear it anymore in that innings? I didn't see anyone wearing at the time of batting.  Is it permitted to wear these caps while batting?  "
1551,Which offences result in indirect free kicks?,"If a player commits a direct free kick offence in their own penalty area, this results in a penalty kick instead of a direct free kick. However, if the offence is an indirect free kick offence, it remains as an indirect free kick as shown here.  What offences result in an indirect free kick? "
1552,Why is on-screen technology not used in football?,"Time and time again I see situations in football matches that would have greatly benefited one of the teams had the correct decision been made - and had the referee used the screen which would have been of no hindrance, the correct decision would have been made.  For example:  In the Chelsea vs Man City game on Sunday, I think it was Aguero made a straight-red-worthy tackle on either Mata or Suarez (I can't remember which). The referee gave a free kick but no card as he hadn't seen the second, far more rash, part of the challenge. The rash part was clearly shown on the huge screen, which the referee saw. However, he wasn't allowed to issue the red card after seeing it - an absolutely ridiculous thing.  In the World Cup 2010, Argentina scored a knock-out goal against Mexico, which was actually offside. The referee couldn't make the final decision based on the on-screen replay.  Lampard scored a goal which bounced back out, but the referee didn't allow it, even after seeing the replay, because he wasn't allowed.   In Rugby this technology is made great use of, and it makes for a far better and fairer game, with tries only being awarded if they were actually tries.  Why can't referees look at the video and make the decision? It would really make hardly any difference to the length of the game - perhaps it would add on an extra several minutes (3 minutes is really no problem). It just seems absolutely ridiculous, and no one I've spoken to is in favour of the rule.  So why is it that whoever runs the football association doesn't change this? "
1553,How much is the fine for arguing with an umpire?, How much is a player fined for arguing with an Umpire? I have heard that it is a percentage of their match fees.

1554,Rules about the contribution in super over on statistics,"Do the contribution of players in super over influence their statistics?     The runs scored, wickets taken, catches, run-outs, stumping... in super over    Will they be added to their career statistics? Will the super over be added as a separate innings?   If not, how are batting averages calculated?  "
1555,What will happen when the batsman or bowler gets injured in super-over?,"   Three players from the batting side will be selected to bat in the   super-over. If the batting side loses two wickets, their innings   will end. One player from the fielding team will be selected for bowling the super over. -iplT20wiki.com.    What will happen if a batsman of those three, gets injured during the super-over and can't play anymore in that over? Will the batting side be allowed to take a fourth player to bat? What will happen if the bowler who bowled one or two balls in the super over gets injured? Will the bowling side be allowed to take another player to bowl?   If the answer is No to any two questions above then How will the winning side be decided? "

Side note:    My father had a surgery and got 3 stents for his heart attack. Would archery have a negative effect on his health?  
1558,"Meaning of the phrase: To drive the ball ""on the up""?","I have heard many times cricket commentators referring to players driving the ball 'on the up'. By the context, this is taken to be a difficult and risky thing to do and makes a good shot even better as the batsmen is displaying some boldness by playing the shot to that delivery. As in ""that was a fine cover drive, and he was playing the ball on the up"".  Why is this confusing to me? Anytime that you play a drive, the ball is 'coming up'. The only exception would be a full toss, but that is an unusual delivery so it would be hardly remarkable to play any shot to a non full toss.  There are many examples of nonsensical phrases in sports commentary and the viewer just needs to learn what a particular nonsensical phrase means. In this case I've never understood what is being meant by this. My best guess is that the ball is fuller or shorter than a delivery that you would normally expect to see a drive played against (one or the other, it couldn't mean both). Any ideas? "
1559,Is it possible for a bowler to bowl consecutive overs?,"In general, is it allowed for a single bowler to bowl two (or more) consecutive overs in international matches?  If yes, how many overs can the bowler bowl continuously? If no, is it not allowed from the beginning of international cricket history or did the ICC ban it recently?  As a special case, if a bowler bowls the first over, then an another bowler bowls two or three deliveries of the second over and can't continue bowling due to injury. Now will the first bowler be allowed to bowl the remaining balls of this second over? "

Or just because the football development starts late? "
1563,Is this a legal way to tag-up and run faster?,"Scenario: With 1 out and a runner on third-base, the batter hits a sacrificial fly ball to right field, enabling the runner to head for home.  Traditionally, the runner sits on third until the fly is caught, then begins his run home, starting from a dead-stop.  It appears the runner would be faster if he took a few steps down the third base line, away from Home, and begins his run at a full sprint, moments before the fly-ball is caught.  He'd tag up on third just after the catch, and already be moving at full speed towards home.  That is far faster than starting at third from a dead stop.  I cannot find anything in the MLB Rules prohibiting this, but I don't see it done.  Is this idea legal?  Is it faster? Or am I missing something? "

1570,How are (soccer) captains selected?,"I've watched a lot of BPL matches lately, and I've realized how awkwardly the captains are chosen.  The captains sometimes don't have many key qualities, or assist their team much.  What criteria make a player more worthy of being captain than others?  Here are some criteria I considered, and their exceptions:    Popularity  West Ham's captain is Mark Noble who is a stranger to neutral fans compared to Dimitri Payet. Liverpool's Jordan Henderson is injury-prone, and with an FPL score of 7, might as well be another benchwarmer.  Position  Manchester City selected Vincent Kompany, a central defender who rarely moves up the pitch, as their captain. Arsenal has Per Mertesacker, also a central defender, as their captain. Being the slowest on the team makes him an unlikely playmaker. The previous captain, Mikel Arteta, played as a defensive midfielder, which is slightly more reasonable for the position criteria.  Communication / Chemistry  Manchester City's Yaya Touré is one of few professional soccer players from Côte d'Ivoire. Based on KSI's gameplay video with him, it can be said that his English is not perfect. Tottenham Hotspur has their goalkeeper, Hugo Lloris, as their captain, despite being the only French player on the team.    Are there any specific properties that make a player more suitable as captain? "

1572,Why are shootouts used in the World Junior Hockey Championships?,"A simple enough question, but I'm having trouble finding a clear answer. I'm interested to know why the shootout is used in the World Junior Championships. I'm assuming it's either because:  The players are of a junior level  or  International hockey rules  Does anyone know?  EDIT: To add an additional level to the question. Assuming from the comment below that it's due to international rules, what is the reasoning behind the international rules? "
1573,Can a player who is out of bounds help a teammate stay in-bounds?,"This question came up among my friends while we were watching the Packers triumph over the Giants this evening:  Suppose a receiver is catching a pass along the sideline.  He's got one foot in-bounds, but is falling out-of-bounds.  A teammate also happens to be there; the teammate is out-of-bounds, but pushes the receiver to keep him from falling out-of-bounds, and the receiver gets his second foot down in-bounds.  Could this be considered an in-bounds reception?  Could the receiver then start running?  Is there anything in the rules that prevents an out-of-bounds player from supporting a teammate to stay in-bounds? "
1574,Number 5 seeds hosting NFL conference championship game,"Under the current format that 6 teams from each conference make it to the playoffs, how many times has a #5 seed hosted the conference championship game?  In order for the #5 seed to host the game, both the #5 and the #6 seed have to upset their higher seeded opponents in the wild card and the divisional round. So an equivalent question would be how many times the #5 and #6 seeds of a conference have met in the AFC or NFC championship game? "
1575,What are the pass interference rules on a quarterback throwing a pass to self?,"This may be a bit unanswerable but seeing if the community can come up with any historical conversations or rules.    We have a quarterback boot we put into the playbook.  The wide receivers are trips right and clear out the defensive backs on that side - if they don't one of them is wide open.  That leaves at most the defensive end and an outside linebacker somewhat unaccounted.  Based on running the play we feel that our tackle will block the end almost all of the time.    That leaves our quarterback one on one with an outside linebacker - literally the only receiver on that side of the field will be 25-30 yards deep.  For fun during one of our scrimmages I had quarterback throw a 15 yard lob to himself.  The play was very successful because once he rolled and felt the OLB come up hard he threw the ball and the OLB was well out of position.  But that beckons, can this be countered with the OLB just holding the QB after the throw?  At what point could the OLB hit/hold the QB?   Is there any rule to cite when talking to the refs before the game about the play (I am a ref too so it would be common to talk to the refs about a trick play before we run it) to get them to get their flags ready after my QB takes off for the ball that he threw? "
1576,Can a card given out by the referee be taken back?,"It is a common sight in football that when a referee calls a foul and shows a card to an offending player, that player as well as other players from the offender's team surround and argue with the referee. What is the motive behind the exchange with the referee?   The three questions I have are   Can the players make a case with the referee and force him to reverse his decision?  Is a referee allowed to change his decision of a card after he has already shown it? If it cannot be reversed, what do players hope to achieve when they surround and argue with the referee after a card decision?  "
1577,Own Goal adds to Career Stats?,I love watching football. I have an interesting doubt. Did the Own Goal(OG) scored by the player(obviously by mistake) adds to his career stats? OR Its ignored? 
1578,Why does Saint Silvestre get so many road races?,"I'm thinking specifically of two classic races, San Silvestre de Vallecana and the Corrida Internacional de São Silvestre, but those are far from the only such races. What is it about this saint that gets road races where others don't?  Is it as as simple as New Year's Eve being the saint's feast day and also a convenient day for road racing (in the same way that Thanksgiving is a big day for road racing in the USA)? Or is there something particular to associate the saint with running? "
1579,"Is pulling shirts allowed in football? If not, why is it unpenalized?","In many matches, defenders can be seen pulling the shirts of opppnents during corner kicks and free kicks. But referees never called a foul or award a free kick or penalty to the opposition.  Is pulling the opponent's shirt allowed? Why would it go unpenalised if it is not allowed?  An example of such an event is below.   "
1580,Are there any rules in Tennis regarding deliberately aiming the ball at the player?,"If a player decides to employ a strategy of deliberately hitting his opponent to try to intimidate or injure them, it would be considered unsportsmanlike but would it be against the rules?  If not, has anyone actually tried this at a professional level? Cause I'm thinking, especially in doubles where one player is at the net, given that a tennis ball can be hit at 200km/h+ - it would actually be an effective strategy to mess with your opponent and maybe win the point if you can hit them on the full. "
1581,What happens to runs scored when an umpire's decision is overturned by DRS?,"In many cricket matches, the decisions taken by the on field umpires get overturned especially in case of LBW dismissals, using the DRS system. What happens if the batsman scored a run off that ball or hit a boundary? Are the runs scored in that ball added to the team's total? Are there any stats about such runs added to team totals? "
1582,How many games does the UNC basketball team play as part of their regular season schedule?,"How can UNC have 32 basketball games in their 2016-2017 regular season schedule?  I thought the absolute max was 31 and everywhere I check online it shows the max to be 31(1). This article explains this phenomenon:       Under the new rules [instituted in 2006], teams can play either 29 regular season games or   27 regular season games plus no more than four games in one multi-team   tournament for a maximum of 31 games. Conference and other postseason   tournaments do not count against the limit. Before the change, teams   were limited to 28 games, with exempt multi-team events counting as   one of those 28 contests.  "
1583,Why did Verratti get a card for this back pass?,"During the match between PSG and Nantes, Marco Verratti was cautioned (received a yellow card) for this pass to the goalkeeper, which was headed back rather than kicked.  I believe the referee has interpreted the behavior as unsportsmanlike, but do the rules confirm this? "
1584,Is it permitted to wear shorts below the knee in football?,"   We can see the football players wearing half trousers all over the   world during playing.   Is it allowed for a football player(including goal-keeper)to wear long shorts(below the knee like the image below) in international football matches?    Shorts above the knee are more comfortable for them but, what is the rules of football say about this? "
1585,What happens if the result of match was found wrong after the match day?,"Consider a situation where Team A and Team B are playing a cricket match,  Team A scored some odd runs (lets assume 250 runs).  Team B is chasing the score, while chasing they require 2 runs from a ball. Bowler bowls the ball Umpire somehow declare it as a NO ball and batsman is able to take only single run from that ball in this case the Team B wins the match because of that NO ball.  Now my question is after a day of the match Team A checks the replays and finds it was not a NO ball or it was not appropriate to say that ball was not legal to be bowled and if that is considered the result should have been tie instead of Team B winning the match, will the result can be changed on the appeal from Team A?  Does they have any right to ask for or report for the same?  If yes then is there any team who have done like this in Cricket History? "
1586,What happens if a basketball stops on the rim as time expires?,"In Game 5 of the first-round playoff series between the Memphis Grizzlies and the Los Angeles Clippers, Tony Allen's layup attempt stopped on the back of the rim: youtube  This is ruled a jump ball.  Meanwhile, in Game 4 of the series between the Houston Rockets and the Oklahoma City Thunder, Serge Ibaka's potential game-tying layup at the buzzer came up just short: youtube  What would have happened if Ibaka's layup had stopped on the rim? There couldn't be a jump ball after the buzzer has sounded, could there? It seems impractical to wait longer and see if the ball would eventually drop through the hoop. Does that mean it would simply be ruled a missed shot and the game would end? "
1587,"What does it mean by ""Hitting the wall"" in marathon run?","I heard some people say it few times - ""He hit the wall and couldn't finish the race..."". What does it mean? what happens to the body in this situation? How can this be avoided? "

1589,Why there is no number 13 in Formula 1?,Why is number 13 not used in Formula 1? Is it just superstition? Was the number ever used? 
1590,Sachin Tendulkar's bowling record,"In a YouTube video, when I was watching Sachin Tendulkar's feat as a bowler, one of the commentators commented that Sachin holds the record for dismissing Inzamam-ul-haq the most number of times. How true is that?   How many times has the little master has had the best of the former Pakistani skipper? "
1591,How is a surfing contest judged?,"I've never really quite understood surfing.  How is a surfing contest judged? As in, who is declared the winner of a contest? Is it the one riding the waves the longest or the one riding it with stunts and tricks of varying difficulty or by an entirely different criteria?  "
1592,Basketball Throw In,"When is the ball technically in play? In other words, can the defensive team 'steal' the ball from the inbounding players hands?   A ref allowed this to open stating the ball was over the baseline and therefore in play. And if this is legal, does the ball have to be fully over the baseline, otherwise would the defensive player not be breaking the plane of the line? "
1593,What is MVP award in IPL?,What is MVP award in IPL? How is it calculated?    I see the list of award leaders from here. But I can't understand how is it calculated? 
1594,Who is run out if both batsmen are out of their grounds?,See following image. Who is Run-out?    A is crossed the crease and B is crossed half of the pitch. Run-out happening in B's side. Then who is out? A or B?  
1595,Why are most of the Europa League games played at 20.05 GMT?,"I mean, instead of the usual 19.45 GMT for the UEFA Champions League games? Is this due to sponsorship reasons or are there no reason at all? "
1596,How does a typical spread offense contrast from a typical pro-style offense?,"In the NFL, several teams such as the Carolina Panthers (with Cam Newton), the San Francisco 49ers (with Colin Kaepernick), the Seattle Seahawks (with Russell Wilson), and the Washington Redskins (with Robert Griffin III) to name a few are utilizing a spread offense.  When Tim Tebow was a starter for the Denver Broncos, he led his team to a division title and a playoff win utilizing the spread offense, proving the formation can be successful.  How does a typical spread offense contrast from a typical pro-style offense? What positional/role players are suggested for optimal use of such a formation? "
1597,what actually is considered obstructing the field in cricket,"What are the things considered as obstructing the field in cricket,  as like the match played between KKR and PWI in which Yusuf Pathan was given out obstructing the field as he pushed the ball with his leg for which the team approached the umpire.  The other incident which i know is for PAK vs IND where Inzamam - ul - Haq was given out when he placed his bat in middle of a throw on account of which he was given out.  One more incident (i am not able to remember the match time and opponents)  which i have seen in which Rahul Dravid used his leg to stop the ball going on the stump after it hit the bat and he was also not given out - is it was not obstructing the field  But when the same thing happened with David Hussey in CB series in the match IND vs Aus he was not given out.  My question is not ""Why he was not given out?"" My question is ""What are the things considered as obstructing the field?"" "
1598,Why doesn't Los Angeles have an NFL team?,"The Los Angeles metropolitan area is the second largest metro area in the United States.  It is big enough to support 2 NBA teams (Lakers and Clippers), 2 MLB teams (Dodgers and Angels), and 2 NHL teams (Kings and Ducks).  Why doesn't it have any NFL teams?  I know it used to have the Rams and Raiders, both of whom moved in 1995.  In 1999 and 2002, the NFL added the Cleveland Browns and Houston Texans, respectively.  Why wasn't a team added to the second largest market in the United States?    Editor's Note: When this question was originally asked in 2014, there were no NFL teams in LA.  Since then, two teams have moved to LA: the Rams in 2016, and the Chargers in 2017. "
1599,Name of an old tv show,"There was an old program on ESPN/Star Sports. In this show, international cricketers used to participate in different small tasks like hitting the ball from bowling machine to the area marked on the grounds, getting points if they managed to hit it in the right area.   Another one is longest six. Another one is for the fielder where he has to catch the ball and hit the target.   A team has to accumulate points like this. Does anybody know the name of this old tv show?? "
1600,Is the 25 game suspension for Chris Davis too much?,"Chris Davis just got a 25 game suspension for violation of the MLB's drug program for use of Adderall. He had a medical exemption in the past, but for whatever reason did not have one this year.   I could see if it was a PED for a suspension like this, but for Adderall? It might give him better focus, but he clearly had a medical reason to take it. Per the MLB Drug Rules is there much flexibility when it comes to something like this, i.e., previous exemption? "
1601,What is it called when 2 players make a full run around a table in table tennis?,In modern table tennis it is a common practice to acting the fool when the match is almost over. I.e. players used to flip the side and play a little bit awkward analogue of table tennis when you need to hit your own side and not the another one.  Here is a couple examples what I'm talking about.   World Tour Grand Finals Highlights: Ma Long vs Xu Xin (7:34) Another example   Is there a special name for it?  Is it a valid table tennis draw according the rules?  And why actually this trick become so popular?  Maybe there is some story behind it? 
1602,NBA rule - how far does the ball have to go in the hoop to count for points?,"Say the ball goes in halfway past the rim, and an opponent knocks the ball back upwards and out. Does this count for points? How far does the ball have to pass the rim to count as a successful score? "
1603,On-the-fly changes in ice hockey,"During an on-the-fly player change, it is generally acceptable for the replacement player to step on the ice a second or two before the player he is replacing steps off the ice, if such a change doesn't impact the play of the game. In this case, does the time when both players are on the ice count towards the time-on-ice stat for both players?  Also, how is the +/- stat counted for the two players if a goal is scored during those couple of seconds when both players are on the ice? "
1604,Fouling a teammate in football: what is the correct referee decision?,"I have just seen this snippet of the recent Argentina-Colombia match in which James (Colombia #10) deliberately pushes his own teammate Torres (Colombia #16) to get to the ball.  [website]The referee's call in this particular case was clearly incorrect (he gave an free kick to Colombia because he believed that Biglia, Argentina #6, who didn't actually do anything, was the one to cause Torres to fall).   But what would the correct call have been? More generally, if you foul your own teammate, do the Rules of the Game allow the referee to award the opposite team a free kick? Can you even be yellow-carded or red-carded for such an action? "
1605,"In North American football, why are 2 of the 5 offensive linemen called ""tackles""?","In North American football, why are 2 of the offensive linemen referred to as ""offensive tackles""? I mean, 1) they're not allowed, under the rules, to tackle anyone, and 2) there is no equivalent defensive position, though ""tackling"" is an important part of the defense's job? "
1606,Is there a standard for football (soccer) balls to be accepted for a goal?,"If a ball is kicked towards the goalpost, breaks mid-air (or during the kick) and only a piece gets into the goal (crosses the line) - is the goal going to be accepted?  There are some edge cases for this question:   what about two or more pieces flying towards the goal (and therefore making it difficult or impossible to stop them)? if the integrity of the ball must be conserved - does ""integrity"" means ""exactly one piece""? (could it be flat for instance?)   In other words: is there a clear standard for a ball to be accepted for a goal?  My son asked this question this morning and I could not find anything which would even be close to an answer (there were discussions about the net, which is less controversial) "
1607,Is it easy to learn how to use an American pool cue if you're a snooker player?,"The only cue sports I have good experience of are Snooker and British pool. For these cue sports one usually play with a 9mm tip. Even though American pool balls are slightly bigger and heavier than the balls used on British tables, I still think that I might struggle to get used to a 13mm tip (this seems by far the most common option when buying an American pool cue; other sizes like 12 or 11.75 mm are quite rare, so I presume they are not as common as the 13mm tips among players?). An American cue might feel very different from what I'm used to, almost like I'd be playing with a broomstick rather than a cue. Furthermore, I'm afraid that the amount of spin (or ""English"" if you prefer) that I can put on a ball with a 13mm tip is far less than what I could do with a snooker cue, thus increasing my sense of frustration.  Has anybody undergone a similar experience? Of if you have used a 13mm tip, are my fears not grounded at all? "
1608,What does HS in ski-jumping means?,This is the ski-jumping calendar for men competitions in february 2017.  Is it possible to view several type of competitions:   HS225 HS140 HS134 HS130 HS100   What does those abbreviations means? 
1609,Unfair usage of DRS,"I have a doubt regarding the usage of DRS. I have seen players make an appeal for DRS and then  the batsmen don't take any runs. So is it like the game stops as soon as an appeal DRS has been made?   If so then can it be misused in the following way?  It's the last ball of the game and batting team needs 2 runs to win. As soon the ball is bowled , the fielding team starts appealing for out and immediately the captain does for DRS( even though the batsman may be nowhere near out). The play would be stopped and thus, batting team would be denied an opportunity to win. "
1610,Is it more common to score on a kickoff return or a punt return?,"During the Super Bowl LI last night, the FOX commentators mentioned that a punt has never been returned for a touchdown during a Super Bowl.  My first thought was of Desmond Howard in Super Bowl XXXI, but my wife reminded me that that was a kickoff return, not a punt return.  (She was absolutely right, as usual.)  That 99-yard kickoff return for a touchdown helped earn Howard the Super Bowl MVP that year.  It turns out that a Super Bowl kickoff return score has happened at least one more time, during Super Bowl XLVII (for 108 yards!).  But that got me wondering: Which happens more often: a kickoff return for a touchdown, or a punt return for a touchdown?  And why? "
1611,Has a no-ball call from the on-field umpire ever been overturned?,"In Cricket, we come across so many instances in which a batsman gets called out, and then is changed to not-out because the replay shows the bowler bowled a no-ball. Has the inverse instance ever happened, where an on-field umpire signals no-ball and it is overturned after replay?  If yes, what happened to the Bowl bowled? "
1612,Are 2016 Patriots the only Super Bowl Champions who never led during the game?,"The New England Patriots beat Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI in overtime. During regulation they never led the game. The only time they ever led was at the end of the game. Does this make the Patriots the first team ever to win the Lombardi trophy without ever leading except for the final results?  Equivalently, has there been any Super Bowl runner ups who never trailed except at the final whistle?  EDIT: Note that it is possible for a team to lose if they lead the entire game and the opposing team scores on a field goal that ends the game. Also for the purpose of the question, what I mean by saying not leading during the entire game is not leading in any time except the very last second of the game.  "
1613,"What did a ""utility player"" become after Moneyball?","Background:      I heard a manager refer to an employee as a ""utility player"" in the pre-moneyball sense.  That means that the employee ""[has] a wide breadth of skills and can work across many org's and disciplines"", so it is quite a compliment.    Moneyball was a movie, a book, and a statistical revolution in sabermetrics.  In Moneyball, they discarded the notion of a ""utility player"", and has much more strongly mathematically/statistically defined nomenclatures such as ""slugging percentage"" and ""on-base percentage"" (ref).      Question:      What is the post-moneyball version of a ""utility player"" and how is one identified?  I just think ""utility"" wouldn't have existed if it was 100% false; there had to be truth behind the myth.  Where did that truth go in the new way of looking at things?  It has to be somewhere, and if the Moneyball measures are informative, then it is likely more clearly measurable than before. "
1614,What are the obstruction rules in squash?,I've been struggling to find anywhere that speaks in detail of the rules of obstruction in squash.   How close does the player have to be to the squash ball for it to be considered obstruction?  Is it obstruction whenever one player has to run around the other to reach the ball? 
1615,What is the rule when the ball touches both the bat and the batsman's body?," If a ball bowled to a batsman hits the bat first and then hits the pad/any part of the batsman's body, what is the rule on getting runs or boundaries or catch at this situation? If a ball bowled to a batsman hits the pad/any part of the batsman's body first and then hits the bat, what is the rule on getting runs or boundaries or catch at this situation?   We can see the above situations most of the times in international cricket matches. "
1616,Penalty runs for hitting on to the helmet of the wicket keeper which he is wearing,"As the answers here acknowledge that if the ball hits the helmet behind the wicket keeper then 5 runs are given to the batting side as obstructing the field.  My question is will the same apply if the ball hits the helmet of the wicket keeper which he is wearing and not behind him.  Will runs be given for this also ?  If yes,  Is there any past reference for this ?  If this applies for helmet then why not for the pads worn by the fielder at silly point. "
1617,Front crawl training,"I am a hobby swimmer. I train each day, swimming front crawl with the following regime:   500 meters using just my legs 500 meters using just my arms  500 meters using both legs and arms.   It takes me about 1h to complete this. I have noticed that I go significantly slower when I use just my legs. Is this normal, or is my technique/legs to blame?  Also, how does my training regimen compare to that of a professional swimmer? I suspect that 1500 meters/day is very little, but I am not sure... "
1618,Holding the ball up with two hands,I will like to know if it is a foul to take the ball from a player who picks the ball from a rebound and holds it up with two hands? Can the ball be taken from his hands even if they are held high up with both hands? 
1619,How is a pitch supporting fast bowlers or spin bowlers?,I've heard some pitches will support only fast bowlers and some pitches only spin bowlers. What is the mechanism behind this? How can a pitch support either one? What will be difference between these two pitches? 
1620,Do all 11 fielders need to be in the field?,"I was just wondering if there is a rule about how many fielders need to remain in the ground during a cricket match.  Can't the fielding captain argue that we do not need the 11th man on the field, for whatever reasons?  Also, will the umpire call no ball if a fielder is standing just outside the boundary before the ball is delivered? "
1621,How far can a fielder go to stop a six?,"This is an extension of this question asked earlier.  Is there a limit that the fielders cannot cross when taking catches or saving runs for the team?  For example, if the batsman hits far enough, lets say in the third row of the seats, then is there any rule to restrict the fielder from entering the crowd, collecting the ball air-borne, and throwing it back into field (if it is feasible)? "
1622,Best career record vs par,"I read a USA Today article that talked about how Tiger Woods is nearly 2000 under par* for his career.  I've tried searching, but how does this compare to others all-time?  Obviously this is a rolling score since Tiger could end up shooting over par for the rest of his career and end up at 1500 under or something, but is this the lowest in history?  I'm just looking for some comparable stat to compare against the other all time greats' career scores. "
1623,Can a baseball catch (out) be taken with the non-mitt (no glove) hand?,Are there any rules against making a catch with the hand without a mitt? Will the batter still be out?   Can a baseball catch (out) be taken with the non-mitt (no glove) hand? 
1624,Why is Hawk-Eye not used on clay courts,I have never seen Hawk-Eye technology to be used on clay tournaments. French Open is running at the moment and it is not being used there.        What are the reasons for not using this technology on clay?   Do tennis federations have some rules against it?     
1625,Run Out without bails,"   A batsman is Run out if at any time while the ball is in play no   part of his bat or person is grounded behind the popping crease and   his wicket(bails) is fairly put down by the opposing side.                   - Wikipedia   Consider the situation, if a batsman was bowled on a no-ball and the bails were down the stumps then the batsmen are running for a run, at this time, how the fielders will try to run out the batsmen?  Consider this situation,   Batsmen are running between the wickets after hitting the ball inside the ground, the ball was thrown to the fielder/WK, he(WK) then hit the stumps with the ball, all the three stumps were pulled off the ground, but the batsman got reached and the ball slipped from his hand and gone for overthrows, now the batsmen started running between the wickets, now how the fielders will try to run out the batsmen? "
1626,How much revenue does a team make for a playoff game?,"Before the 2013 NBA playoffs, many people speculated that the Miami Heat would go 16-0 (e.g. sweep every series) en route to their 2nd straight title.  As I watched the Miami Heat trounce the Indiana Pacers in game 7 of the 2013 Eastern Conference Finals, it seemed apparent that they definitely had the capability to do so.  I then thought of what is most certainly a ridiculous but nevertheless interesting idea.  What if the Heat players were instructed to lose in order to have more home games, e.g. increase revenue.  (This is not my question, so please don't answer that!)  I agree, there's no way a group of professional athletes would even risk such a thing, but it got me wondering, how much revenue does a team make for a playoff game?  I know it's driven largely by ticket cost and arena size, but is there any per-team data available?  (FWIW: This article paints Heat owner Micky Arison in a pretty selfish light, so perhaps my conspiracy theory isn't far off ;) ) "
1627,What is the minimum over-rate?,"We can see many times, the captains and the players of the bowling team were suspended for slow over-rates.    How the over-rate for a fielding team is calculated? Is it vary between different forms of cricket? If the batting team delays the match by changing gloves, bat or other things means will it affect the over-rate?   "
1628,How to select watch able to sustain sprinting and heavy sporty usage 24/7?,"I have broken far too many watches: their knobs, their hinges, their internal metallic support, scratched the glass, etc. I have scaled back to very cheap watches because so fed up to breaking expensive ones let them be any sport thing such as Suunto, Polar or any normal watch. I want to wear my watch everywhere such as sauna, asleep, school and work. Sauna infers material of low heat conductance such as stainless-steel or titanium. Asleep infers screw-style strengthening of the knob not to get open/broken during sleeping. Running infers strong mechanical features and still needs to be lightweight. 24/7 infers it needs to look great, two time-zones for traveling could be great. There are probably many other things such as interval-training and timing to consider. For now, I am trying to find ways to find a watch that is able to last even at the first place. I may need many watches but for simplicity:  How should you select a watch that you want to wear 24/7 during sport, shower and daily life? Which features do you think are the key things to sustain the 24/7 usage? Does there exist any bionic watch attach to the skin so the watch would not stuck to anything like rocks while climbing? "
1629,What is the motivation behind using the 2-3-2 (vs. 2-2-1-1-1) series format for the NBA Finals?,"Each conference round in the NBA playoffs is a best-of-seven series played in a 2-2-1-1-1 format...or the team with home-court advantage hosts games 1, 2, 5, and 7 while their opponent hosts games 3, 4, and 6.  However, the NBA Finals is a best-of-seven series is played in a 2-3-2 format...or the team with home-court advantage hosts games 1, 2, 6, and 7 while their opponent hosts games 3, 4, and 5.  What is the motivation behind using the 2-3-2 series format for the NBA Finals? Do factors of home-court advantage change in a 2-3-2 series format vs. a 2-2-1-1-1 series format? "
1630,How can I get my overhand throw to properly turn over?,"I've been playing disc golf for several years and have experimented with an overhand (or tomahawk) shot for several years. However, the shot has always been inconsistent for me. It always gets the required height, but rarely achieves the distance I want on it. I know that there is a way to get it to turn over (so that the disc is flying upside down) and I occasionally achieve this, but I cannot do it consistently.  What is the technique for achieving this shot? Are certain discs better at achieving the turnover than others?  "
1631,How to manage wear in long-distance running?,"The skin can get broken. The skin can get too dry and then broken. Blisters may develop with certain shoes. Pain in tibial tendon may be more regular with fore-foot training. Pain in knees may be more regular with with middle-foot training or back-foot training. If you have too much weight, it may be better to train more in swimming pool rather than on tracks to avoid injuries in bones and muscles.  What are ways you manage wear as a long-distance runner? How have you planned your life-style and training to avoid injuries? "
1632,Which team has gotten the most punishments for slow over rate?,"We know that slow over rate is an issue of the fielding team that can be punished by ICC.  In June 2012 Misbah ul-Haq got punished (banned for one match) but their players didn't get that.  But in May 2012, England v West Indies, 1st Test, all the players of WI got punishment.   Which team has gotten the most punishments for slow over rate? I think it's possible to trace this out.  Bonus question, if it's even possible to answer: Which player has gotten the most punishments for slow over rate including overall formats of cricket? "
1633,Squash Raquet Grommet Strip,"I have been playing squash for several years now and gone through several racquets, a Wilson, a Black Knight, and now a Dunlop. My friend has had a Dunlop racquet for the last few years as well. He has had to replace his grommet strip on several occasions. I believe these damaged grommets to be the reason for his strings breaking. I had a Black Knight racquet for over four years before I broke it on an ill place backhand shot, and in all those years I never had a single grommet break even once. now that I have a Dunlop racquet I am worried that the grommet strip wont stand up as well. if I ever need to replace the string is there only one grommet strip made for a design of racquet or are there tougher grommet strips that I can buy? Or even get a Black Knight one? "
1634,How can quality of a domestique be rated?,"Various criteria, such as number of wins, UCI points, are good for comparing GC contenders and sprinters. Climbing times and wattage can say a lot about quality of a climber.   But quality of domestiques is a very important factor in order to achieve team's objectives in any race, too. I am not able to think of some (at least partially) objective criteria to evaluate domestiques.        Are there some criteria by which performance of domestiques can be rated?   Are there some websites which give rankings/ratings of cycling domestiques?     "
1635,Does the maiden over includes extras?,"Today, Malinga bowled an over with 4 leg-byes, but it was given a maiden over. Then I searched about that and got the details as,     If a bowler delivers a complete over without a run being scored from   the bat (even though the opponents may have scored extras by means of   byes or leg byes), he has achieved a maiden over. - Source.   I have a doubt, if the bowler bowls a wide or no-ball, will it be considered as a maiden?  The above statement only states about byes or leg-byes, wides and no-balls are also considered as extras. The wide can't be dealt with bat, but a no-ball can get contact with the bat.  So, the clear question is,  What are all the requirements for a maiden over? "
1636,Rain fall a full day in big matches,What will happen if the rain stops play for the whole day in big matches such as finals played for World Cup or Asia cup or currently being played Champions Trophy.  Does the match will be played again if the rain does not stop? as the match which was supposed to be played was having a big value.  Also what will be action if the match stopped for whole day after the toss was won by a team ?  What will be considerations for such rain affected matches? 
1637,Opening Day Baseball Location,"As far as I can recall, the Orioles have had opening day at home every year since they moved to Camden Yards in the early 90s.  Even if it was not every year, it was definitely the lions share.  This would seem to be advantageous or at least desirable.    How is this decided?  Is it luck?  Contractual stipulation?  Record related ( the Orioles went from 98-2011 without approaching .500, so that seems unlikely )?  Something else? "
1638,How to beat 2 singles players playing doubles,What kind of strategy should you use if you are 2 doubles players playing against 2 singles players? Would lobs be a good option? 
1639,Color of the sprint jersey in Tour de Suisse?,"Tour de Suisse has two separate jerseys for sprints competition (based only on points from intermediate sprints) and points competition (where the points obtained from placement in stages are included; I am not sure whether they count here the intermediate sprints, too.)  The current revision of the Wikipedia article White jersey says that:     The Tour de Suisse awards a white jersey to a somewhat unique competition, the Sprints classification,[5] which awards placings not on stage finishes but strictly in intermediate sprints.   The link given there shows the leader of the sprints classification in 2008 wearing the white jersey.  Seasons 2005-2013 have individual articles on Wikipedia - the links can be found in the article about Tour de Suisee. When I checked these articles I have seen that:   In 2008, the color is shown as white. In 2007, sprint classification is mentioned, but no information about the color of the jersey is in that article. In 2012 the sprint classification is not mentioned at all, so it was probably not awarded. Wikipedia articles on seasons 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2013 show the color of the sprint jersey as blue.   Of course, there might be mistakes in Wikipedia articles and Wikipedia gives no information about sprint competition before 2005.  I would like to know:        Was the year 2008 the only year, when the color of the jersey for the sprints competition was white?   When was the sprint classification (separate from the point classification) introduced in Tour de Suisse for the first time?     "
1640,What happen when two players touch the finish rope at same time in running?,"I don't know whether it would happen or not.  My question is,   What happen if two athletes touched the finish rope at the same time in running(irrespective of distance either it may be 100m or long distance)?  How the winner will be decided?  Will they run again for a shorter distance? (like super over in cricket, tie breaker penalty shoot out in football). "
1641,What do referees do during halftime?,"This question largely pertains to basketball and American football. I've seen footage from the team locker rooms during halftime where the coaches and players go over issues from the first half that need to be addressed, key statistics, etc.    I've often wondered what the referees do during the halftime break (other than get a breather).  Do they go over replays where they botched calls?  If so, do they have someone whose job it is to create the ""highlight reel"" of missed calls, e.g. a coach for the referees? "
1642,What is a dynasty in sports?,"Now that the Blackhawks have won the cup twice in four years can they be considered a dynasty?  More importantly what is the definition of a professional team sport dynasty?  I vaguely recall, from football, that a team must win the championship three times in five years to be called a dynasty, but I'm unsure if that was correct. It probably depends on the sport. "
1643,How do the leading makes of red cricket ball vary in performance?,"Cricket balls are manufactured to conform to the specification laid down in Law 5 of the Laws of Cricket.  However, there are several different manufacturers of cricket ball, and  normally the host country's cricket board will choose which manufacturers' cricket balls they will use.   For instance, Australia typically use a Kookaburra cricket ball (as do many other countries - Kookaburra claim ""85% of Test Matches and One Day Internationals"" use their Turf ball.)  At least anecdotally, each manufacturer's products are supposed to vary, so the home team, with its familiarity with the cricket balls of its chosen manufacturer, may have an advantage.  Which manufacturers' cricket balls are currently used at Test level, and by which teams? What are their key differences in behaviour? (Note that I am not specifically enquiring about differences between red and white cricket balls.) "
1644,Do batting scores in abandoned matches still count for your career stats?,"In the most recent T20I between England and New Zealand, only two balls were bowled before the match was called off.  However, in that time, Lumb scored two runs, and then was caught behind.  Does this still count in his career stats officially, or do all results get ignored? Similarly, if you scored an unbelievable 250 (ie it'd be the highest ever score in an ODI/T20), and then the match was called off, would it get ignored, officially? "
1645,When will a bowler's delivery be declared as a dead ball?,What is the term dead ball mean in Cricket?  and  When will be a bowler's delivery considered as a dead ball? 
1646,Different uniform/jersey for same team in American-Football,"I heard that two different jerseys are used for offense and defense in american-football.  Is it so?  If yes,    What is the reason for that?   I saw in the normal football matches that the goal-keeper worn different color jersey to differ from all others.   so  there are three different jerseys used for a team(including goal-keeper) in american-football, am I correct? what about the jersey of players playing at center?  "
1647,How is the annual cricketing schedule of an international team fixed?,"How does the ICC fix the cricketing schedule for each cricket playing nation?  Do they fix it on their yearly rankings and points ?  Is there any process for this or the National team boards decide on which team they  will be playing by discussing with each other ?   such as India will play Australia for this year with 4 ODI and 2 Tests etc.  How the schedule for the fixed tournaments like ASHES,CHAMPIONS TROPHY etc is decided ?   Is it decided by the previous fix of these tournaments.  Does the schedule for Test Playing Teams and ODI Playing Teams are differently fixed ?   As some of the cricket nations like Afghanistan are not even known for test matches  how it is decide on which ground the match will be played ?   Does the playing teams decide which ground will host the matches ? "
1648,Basketball teams and positions?,"I'm going into high school after the summer, and I have some questions about basketball. Believe it or not, I've never played for a team before this, and I want to join in high school. I have some questions about some types of teams and positions:   What is a rec basketball team? What is a travel team? (In basketball, and just in general.) What is the difference between varsity and junior varsity? I'm pretty short (5' 2"") would this be a hinder in my chances getting into the team or have any significance as to what position I play in the team? What is the main thing I have to worry about over the summer, if I want to tryout for the school's team?  "
1649,Tune Easton FMJ arrows for a 30# bow?,"I'd like to shoot the FMJ series of Easton because I really like how easy you can pull aluminium arrows out of the target in comparison to carbon ones. But the spine will only get as light as 500.   Is there any way to get them working with a bow weight of 30#@28,5"" by adjusting the point weight far enough up? If yes how much point weight would that need? The easton chart only shows up to 125gr point weight. It would fit with that according to the chart, but the chart is giving too hard spine values all the time. "
1650,What is reserve day in ODI cricket?,The match between Sri Lanka vs West Indies in Tri-Nation Series was stopped calling it as a reserve day and it continued the next day (08-07-13).  What is meant by reserve day? And why ICC not following this for even some big matches? In what basis this rule will applicable? Is there any other matches was called off as a reserve day and continued on next day? 
1651,Unique baseball scoring situation: Who gets the Win?,"The question is which pitcher gets the win A or B?  My baseball team played a double header (each game 7 innings) recently. Pitcher A started game 2. Because he also pitched in game one (all 7 innings), he only went 3 innings in game 2. He didn't give up a run and when he left the game his team was winning 4-0.   Pitcher B came in to pitch the 4th, 5th 6th and 7th innings and never gave up the lead. However he did give up 4 runs in four innings. The final score of the game was 11-4.  Under MLB rules, who is credited with the win? A or B? And why? "
1652,Sequence of national/team flags on cricket ground,  In every cricket match there are flags which are placed around the edge of the cricket stadium as shown in the figure.  I think it is done for all the sports played (though not sure about it).  My question is in what sequence they are placed ?   Does they are placed according to their rankings ? or there is not any sequence they are randomly placed ?  What is the motive behind the flags is there is any special reason / history behind this ?   Is it only to indicate about the nations playing the cricket match ?  Who holds the decision to place National flags ?   Does it depends on the ground authority for that particular match ? 
1653,0:0 score in basketball,"0:0 is quite common score in football (soccer), it also happens in other sports. Is it possible in basketball? In other words does it ever happen in official game? If not what was the closest result? "
1654,World Series and Playoffs,If a MLB team won all of it's games during the season then lost three games in a five game playoff at the end of the season could they play in the world series? Their final season end record would be 162 wins and 3 losses. No trip to the world series? 
1655,How does FIFA rank national teams?,"Which stats are taken into account when ranking a team? How are the points distributed?  I've been wondering recently about how strange it is that the present ranking puts Columbia at the 3rd position above Brazil, Italy, England, Portugal etc.!  Also if suppose European championship is being played where the South American teams don't play (obvious!), and lets say Brazil is ranked #1 and Germany a close #2 by a few points. If suppose Germany wins the Euro then Germany gets the points and gets ranked #1. But Brazil didn't play at all! This strikes me as unfair...  Can somebody please explain? "
1656,Sac Fly or not?,Runners on 1st &amp; 3rd with one out.  Runner on 1st attempts to steal as batter lines out to RF.  runner on 3rd tags and scores before runner attempting to steal is doubled off of 1st.  The run counts. How is the AB scored?  Sac Fly w/RBI or Double Play w/no RBI? 
1657,Tre Flip (360 flip) on a skateboard,I am currently trying to perform a 360 flip on a skateboard and I can get as close as varial Kickflip (180 degrees as appose to 360 degrees shuv with flip) I would like to know how I ensure that the board shuvs 360 degrees as well as staying under my feet for the full Tre Flip. Any ideas? hints? tips? Thanks :)  Ive been hard at work on this trick lately but ive noticed as soon as I get the full flip I cannot get the 360 degree shuv and when I get the 3' shuv I cannot get the flip... its rather annoying how can I get the board to flip and spin at the same time? 
1658,How to prevent cramp when longboarding?,I have been riding a longboard from time to time and I find that afterwards I often get cramp in my right thigh (my front foot on the deck) I think this is due to misplacement of my body of some kind... is their a way that I can prevent this? maybe by the way I distribute my weight on the leg or something like that? 
1659,What is the motivation behind tweaking a clubhead's loft?,"In a video to build Sergio Garcia's driver, the equipment builder takes a clubhead with a stock loft of 10 degrees and tweaks it to have a final clubhead loft of 8.5 degrees.  What is the motivation behind tweaking a clubhead's loft? Are there advantages to tweaking a clubhead's loft (10 to 8.5) vs. using a stock loft (8.5 with no tweaking)? "
1660,What or who decides whether extra time is given in football?,"How is extra time decided to be given in football, either when the teams have scored the same number of goals, or when one team has scored more goals?  Can teams have extra time by requesting it, in either of the above cases?  Can they request extra time if extra time has already been given? "
1661,"Are fielders (non-catchers) allowed to start from foul territory, and where should the catcher be?","Are fielders (not being the catcher) allowed to start in foul territory? This is actually something that I did. As a left outfielder I played/started on foul territory, because of a very strong and low sun in my eyes elsewhere. It could also be useful for right fielders with very fast pitchers. Or place a fielder at the back-stop for a wild pitch.  Also, is it allowed to have the catcher at the back-stop (fence), or right next to the home dug-out (say, for catching foul balls), or somewhere right of the right foul-line but 60 yards away from home plate, or in the infield six feet away from the plate?  Which rule applies, if any? "
1662,"What is the appropriate action to take, if any, if a fielder is too close for her/his own safety?","In amateur cricket, as a batsman, if you have only one planned shot, a hard one, and you know you are quite able to execute it, but a fielder, without obvious protection (e.g., a helmet), creeps up on you to say 4 yards, in front of you, what is the right thing to do?  Should you warn her/him? Should you inform the umpires? Should you refuse to bat? What? "
1663,Is it unlawful or not-done to field between bowler and sight screen?,"In cricket, play usually stops temporarily when spectators or personnel walk or stand in front of the (live) sight screen. What about fielders? Should they move elsewhere on request? "
1664,Who has the right of way in this case: a fielding bowler or a batsman in his/her regular path?,"The striker hits the ball forwards, very slightly to off, but mostly up. The bowler makes his/her way towards the area where the ball will land in order to catch it (before it lands). The non-striker is headed in the same direction and running along with the bowler (on the bowler's right), on his/her normal path to the other end. They touch, but the bowler catches the ball anyway. Should the non-striker receive a warning or does he/she have some right for his/her path towards the safety of the other end or is this require something else? (The non-striker claimed that he couldn't be at fault, because he didn't see where the ball was.) And what if the bowler missed the catch, judged likely due to the faint touch or distraction? "
1665,Why players showing a T-signal for umpire decision review system?,"While calling for the Umpire Decision Review system,     The fielding team captain or the batsman being dismissed invokes the   challenge by signalling a ""T"" with the arms.- Wikipedia.   What that signal 'T' refers to?  Does it refer the third umpire/TV umpire?  If yes, where is it documented/stated by any cricket officials/players? "
1666,Who is Sikander Raja?,There is a cricketer in Zimbabwe named Sikander Raja.  Can anyone tell me the details about him and his proper identity?  I would like full information about him. Where can I find it? 
1667,Is there a particular reason why brittish players rarely make it out to other major leagues in Europe?,"Football is more global than ever and clubs are constantly out on the hunt for talent all over the world. Biggest clubs not only have the money to buy best players regardless of origin, many clubs have youth academies that reach out to talents pretty much all over the world.   Now in the midst of Gareth Bale's potential (and according to some, imminent) transfer to a larger club (Real Madrid has stated interest in multiple occasions), I came to realise that few British stars play outside England. In comparison to South American and French, Dutch, German etc players that are all over the football scene, how come British players don't get headhunted nearly as often as players of other nationalities? Is it used to be like this in the past (70s-80s)?emphasized text  I did some mental exercise to try and recall British stars going to major clubs; and I can only recall Beckham (from Man Utd to Real Madrid), McManaman (from Liverpool to Real Madrid) and Woodgate (from Newcastle Utd to... well you know it, Real Madrid). Am I missing some notable examples?   I would also argue that none of these players really excelled in Spain. Looking at the stats on Wikipedia:   Steve McManaman: 14 goals, 33 assists in 157 games (4 seasons in the club) Jonathan Woodgate: 1 goal in 14 games (2 seasons in the club) David Beckham: 20 goals in 155 games (4 seasons) While it's not too shabby as a performance for a winger, compared to his goal/app average in United (0.234) his performance in Real is significantly inferior (0.112)   The only answer I can imagine that makes sense is that Premier League has a very different culture to it and that British players either aren't versatile enough to do the job in another league, or that they do not want to adapt. But even that's a weak answer. So what reasons could be responsible for this situation? "
1668,What Records did Yoav Bruck break as a swimmer?,I know Yoav Bruck broke a few records during his time at the swimming pool. Can you tell me what they are? Does he still hold any that haven't been broken yet? 
1669,"NFL overtime: after a field goal, clock runs out on second team's possession","Under the NFL's current ""modified sudden death"" overtime rules, if the first team scores a field goal, the second team is entitled to one more possession.  What happens if the clock runs out during that possession?  Suppose the score is tied 20-20 at the end of the 4th quarter. Team A wins the overtime coin toss and receives the kickoff to begin overtime.  After a long slow drive, Team A scores a field goal to make the score 23-20.  Now they kick off to Team B.  Team B is not able to score, and the overtime period ends with Team B still in possession.  What happens?  Rule 16 is not very explicit on this point.  Article 4 (a) says:     There shall be a maximum of one 15-minute period, even if the second team has not had an opportunity to possess the ball or if its initial possession has not ended. If the score is tied at the end of the period, the game shall result in a tie.   I think this means that Team A wins, 23-20, but I am not completely sure.  Has this ever happened in a regular-season NFL game? "
1670,Sprinter but now want to take part in marathon,"I was a sprinter who used to run 100, 200 metres races, but now I'm training myself to improve my stamina and run long distance races.  I run on a treadmill 1 km everyday. Will a treadmill help me increase my stamina or do I have to choose an open field/road?  Also, I have completed 1 km in 4:05 minutes, is it good enough if I'm preparing for a 10 km race? Half and full marathon is a distant dream as of now. Also, I want to run marathons as a personal achievement only.  I'm open for any valuable suggestions. "
1671,Should your feet be in the air when serving?,"I have seen it being taught two different ways:  1) Lifting only left heel, but left foot stays on the ground.  2) Bending knees, and doing leg spring action, lifting your legs off the ground, propelling yourself up and into the ball.  I have seen pros and they seem to have feet in the air. Which way is correct? Have you seen anyone using #1?  Wondering if #1 is better suited for older players who don't want more strain on their lower legs/ankles. "
1672,Can football players play multiple positions?,"Can American football players play multiple positions? I know that in the one-platoon system, the players played both offence and defence. But in modern football can they play other positions than what they are assigned in the roster? "
1673,Is there a penalty for kicking a PAT from the 2 yard line in the NFL?,"This year the NFL changed the way extra points work so that 2-point-conversion attempts are snapped from the 2 yard line as they always were, but extra points are now snapped from the 15. If a team lined up from the 2 yard line (maybe the told the officials they would be going for 2) and kicked an extra point, is there a penalty? What if they attempt a drop-kick after snapping the ball from the 2? "
1674,Is there a rule for when K-Balls are used?,"In the NFL, special balls (""K-Balls"") are used for kicking plays. These balls are harder and slicker than the balls used during normal play. My understanding is that kickers don't really like using the k-balls because they are harder to kick. Is there a rule that governs when a k-ball is used and is there any way for a team to exploit those rules?  For example, could a team line up as if they were going to go for it on fourth down with the punter lined up in a wide-receiver position and then shift before the snap to normal punt formation without having the ball changed? "
1675,American football delay of game,"Scenario:   Your team is up by 5. There are 5 minutes remaining in the game. It is 4th down and goal-to-go from the opponent’s 40 yard line (you’ve had a lot of penalties). Your punter can guarantee hang-time of 10 seconds, but his minimum distance is 41 yards beyond the line of scrimmage. Your placekicker has been in the league for 20 years and has never successfully kicked a field goal longer than 50 yards, after having tried 100 times.   In order to provide room for your punter, you take a delay-of-game penalty in order to push the line of scrimmage back to the opponent’s 45.  Question:  can the defense decline the penalty? If yes, can you take another delay-of-game penalty?  What would cause you to ever snap the ball on time? "
1676,What options does a player have if the club carries out the threat of 'Rot in reserves'?,"If a player is under contract, and is obviously the first choice player for the team, but is forced to play in reserves due to conflict with the management, what options does he have to get out of the situation?   Few years back when Ferguson had made a statement saying Glazers were more likely to let Cristiano Ronaldo rot in reserves rather than be allowed to go to Madrid, there were some reports saying that it wasn't possible for the club to do so.  Apart from negotiating with the club or waiting for a very large transfer bid, what other options does a player have in case he ends up in such a situation? "
1677,Why do batsmen tap their bat on the pitch?,"Whenever any batsman comes to the crease, he almost always taps his bat on the pitch. Is there any reason for them to do this? Maybe to make the bowler wait longer to try and put him off? Could there be any other reasons behind it? "
1678,How teams are ranked if they are equal in points in UCL groups,"Quoting from from the UEFA rules:     If two or more teams are equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following criteria are applied in the order given to determine their rankings:      a. higher number of points obtained in the group matches played among the teams in question;   b. superior goal difference from the group matches played among the teams in question;   c. higher number of goals scored in the group matches played among the teams in question;   d. higher number of goals scored away from home in the group matches played among the teams in question;   e. if, after having applied criteria a) to d), teams still have an equal ranking, criteria a) to d) are reapplied exclusively to the matches between the teams in question to determine their final rankings. If this procedure does not lead to a decision, criteria f) to l) apply;   f. superior goal difference in all group matches;   g. higher number of goals scored in all group matches;   h. higher number of away goals scored in all group matches;   i. higher number of wins in all group matches;   j. higher number of away wins in all group matches;   k. lower disciplinary points total based only on yellow and red cards received in all group matches (red card = 3 points, yellow card = 1 point, expulsion for    two yellow cards in one match = 3 points);   l. higher club coefficient (see Annex D).   I don't see the point of rule ""e"". For me      group matches played among the teams in question   is exactly the same as      exclusively to the matches between the teams in question   I'm not the only one confused by this:     But then Uefa throws us a curveball:      5) if, after having applied criteria a) to d), teams still have an   equal ranking, criteria a) to d) are reapplied exclusively to the   matches between the teams in question to determine their final   rankings. If this procedure does not lead to a decision, criteria f)   to h) apply;      Say what now? Is that not what we just did? Applied those rules to the   ""teams in question""? I thought, perhaps, I'd read something wrong and   Uefa meant all members of the specified group, rather than the three   even on points. But that doesn't make sense either:   Could someone give an example of when rule ""e"" applies? "
1679,Is there a place to get timing stats for historic games?,"I am specifically interested in how much stoppage time was added to each half of a football game, for the major leagues, usually the first division in each country. An example list can be found here: [website]For example, on that date, in the match between Salmohr and Bochum there was definitely stoppage time as a goal was scored at (90+1), but no where in the espn site can I find out exactly how much time was added in each half. "
1680,I want to improve as an older skater- I've started with Penny boards - what is the next stage?,"I've been learning how to skate around the back streets and on my brief commute to work over the past few months. I'm a 45yo 165cm 77kg man.  I've been using a penny nickel and a penny 22 that I got when my 10yo son was briefly interested in skating up and Dow the street with his friends.   For someone who has never skated, surfed or snowboarder I'm pretty happy that I can stop, carve(sort-of) and generally get around my local streets at a reasonable pace. I'm faster than my son on his micro scooter and I can carve from the top to the bottom of our street - it is a shallow incline but you can go pretty fast. I can't Ollie or slide. (Yet!)  On the suggestion of the guy at the lavas skate shop I got some hard (99) wheels to try sliding, but I don't think I adequately described the road surface. I quickly switched back to the penny wheels(84 I think).  I'm really enjoying skating as a way to get round and I want to get better.   I'm liking the penny boards, but I have some misgivings: the 22 is light but probably too small - I find it easier to skate in blundstone boots because the sole is so large an rigid it effectively gives me a larger board. The Nickel is a nice size - but it is heavy to carry on public transport. I also feel safer on the nickel in wet conditions. (Around Ealing UK FWIW)  Should I get a new board? If so what?  I'm not really constrained by price, but I can't be arsed building a board unless there is a really compelling reason.  Thanks in advance for any advice,  Stephen "
1681,Does KERS in F1 cars cause sparks?,"I'm watching the Abu Dhabi GP and I keep seeing sparks coming out from behind the cars. Maybe it's more clear because it's in the evening and it's dark, but the commentator doesn't say anything indicating a problem with the car, and it doesn't happen all of the time so I can only assume it's something that is supposed to happen and is maybe related to KERS.  If so, what is it that causes the sparks? And if it's not KERS, what is causing the sparks? "
1682,American Football: Why take knee before halftime?,"I'm interested in the following situation: a team in American football possesses the ball with less than a minute left in the first half of a game and is facing a long field to score.  Oftentimes, teams will have their quarterback take a knee here to effectively end the half.  This seems to be pretty common and it's commonly accepted as sound strategy, but I'm struggling to see how it is the most beneficial choice for the team.  You can sometimes see teams do this at the end of a tie game--""playing it safe"" and taking their chances in overtime.  From my point of view, the only outcomes that matter from running an extra play or two are either A) Your team scores, or B) The other team scores --any other result is meaningless.  Do you teams really think that running a play (even a ""safe"" one like a run up the middle) will result in an opponent scoring more often than their own scoring probability?  If so, what makes this different than any other play; i.e., why run any offensive play at all at any point?    Another consideration that I've surmised is that a team may be worried about having a possible injury.  That seems like a pretty small risk to me and you're just as likely to have an injury happen to the opposing team.  I know that these plays aren't usually a big deal, but what am I missing that makes this strategy so well-accepted? "
1683,"In a video challenge in volleyball, does the challenging team have to specify the challenged fault?","Assume the following situation: In a high-class (high enough for a video challenge system being in place) volleyball game an attack hit goes out of bounds and the referee assigns the point to the defending team. However, the attacking team thinks they have seen the block touching the ball and call a video challenge. When reviewing the video replay, the referee does not find a ball touch by the block, but it shows a touch of the net by one of the blocking players, so it would indeed be a point for the attacking team.  My question is now, what are the rules of such a challenge? Must the challenging team specify which type of fault they want to have reviewed (such as ""block touched the ball"") or is it enough to just challenge based on ""during this action, we think that the situation was different from what the referee decided"" and then just the whole situation is reviewed in the video material? And if the former is the case, is the referee obliged to give the challenge to the challenging team if they cannot confirm the reason for the challenge but finds a different fault that would change the original decision – such as the net violation in my example situation above?  Additional clarification: Since the video challenge is obviously not part of the official FIVB rules, let's restrict this question to international tournaments directly organized by the FIVB, i.e. World Cups and World League/World Grand Prix competitions. "
1684,How does a ice-hockey team's strategy differ playing 3-on-3 rather than 5-on-5?,"In 2015, the NHL Board of Governors approved having overtime periods played in a 3-on-3 format (as opposed to 5-on-5 during regulation), which has led to a noticeable scoring boost (due to the increase of shots and shooting percentage). Furthermore, the NHL All-Star game was reformatted into a series of 3-on-3 ""mini games.""  How does a team's strategy differ playing 3-on-3 rather than 5-on-5? There is an increase in scoring, but the goalie has to adjust to more shots being taken, there isn't much of an opportunity to create traffic in front of the net, and with less players, their endurance becomes more of a factor.

1687,What happens if an NFL kicker totally misses the ball on a kickoff?,"If during a kick-off, for example at the beginning of a half or after a score, the kicker totally misses the ball when he goes to kick, what happens? Would it be a penalty for delay of game? "
1688,What happens when a boxer/fighter/wrestler retires while holding a title?,What happens if the title owner rejects to fight anymore or announces that he/she is retired? Is a new belt made? Should he/she return it? 
1689,How can F1 teams be competitive if they produce engines for each other?,"There are several aspects I don't understand about teams who build engines for their competitors. Take for example Mercedes AMG who build engines for other teams like Sahara Force India, Williams Martini Racing and so on.   Since the engine is optimised for the remainder of the vehicle, wouldn't this mean that only Mercedes AMG has the optimal chance to get the best configuration? In other words, wouldn't the team building the engine clearly favour and have the best relationship with their own F1 team? Could they not put secret features in the engines which make them perform worse for the other teams? For instance, take advantage of a different chassis and make it perform worse in that case? I'm not saying this is what they should do, but rather, is there anything in place to prevent this?  "
1690,When is the setter allowed to leave his position?,"Every player has to stay in his position and may not violate the positioning rules until the opponent's server has touched the ball (of course, assuming that the referee has blowed his whistle).  Every setter in every game I've attended on FIVB level leaves his position earlier.  I think this is due to the velocity of the serve, so the setter has enough time to get to the net.  What are the rules in this ""violation""? In particular, I am asking for   How many seconds before serving the setter may leave his position? Is this standardese or FIVB-specific? Does this only apply to the setter?  "
1691,Is there a technical name and rules for a double-touch in badminton?,"Double-touch (at least that's what people call at my court) is when the shuttle touches the racket more than once in an instance.  So, what are the rules regarding this?  Does the point count?  If not, then is the point awarded to the opponent or is the rally abandoned?  Is there a technical/official term for ""double touch"" in Badminton? "
1692,Did some ice-hockey players change their position during their career?,"Does it happen often that an ice-hockey player changes during their career the position? For example, somebody who plays for some years as a left or right wing then becomes a centre. Or that somebody starts playing as defenceman and then becomes forward. (It is very hard to imagine that some goaltender became a skater or vice-versa, so the above examples are more likely.)  Are there some famous player who has such change in their career? Did it happen at least for some players at NHL level (either during their NHL career or in their transition from junior/minor leagues to NHL)? "

1695,"In golf, what is the relationship of shaft flex with accuracy?","In golf, what is the relationship of shaft flex with accuracy, with NO regard to distance?  Most sources seem to talk about shaft flex as being a balancing act with distance. I am trying to separate out the distance variable and consider it with accuracy only. Does a stiffer shaft mean more accuracy? "
1696,What happens when a member of the away team scores a hat trick in NHL?,"When a member of the home team scores a hat trick, it is normal for fans to throw their hats on the ice (usually causing a delay).  Does the same apply for when a member of the away team scores a hat trick?  Is it 'frowned' upon to throw your hat on the ice if you are cheering for the away team ? "
1697,How is WAR defined as a baseball statistic?,WAR (wins above replacement) is a statistic that is often used to describe the value of a baseball player's performance in a given year.   How is this statistic determined? What are the differences between WAR as defined by the two major providers (fangraphs and baseball-referenced)? 
1698,What seat is the best overall seat in an American football stadium?,"Sitting front row at the 50 yard line gives a spectator an intense (and expensive) view of a small focal point of an American football field.  Sitting higher up gives a spectator a better overall field view, but keeps a fan from enjoying the full violence of the game.  Sitting in the corner gives a great view of a single endzone, but the opposite endzone can appear a mile away, and your team (presuming you have one) will only score in that endzone during a single half (which a ticket buyer cannot predict prior to the coinflip).  With all this in mind, what seat in the average American football stadium offers the best overall view? What about best view for one's buck? "
1699,Is it possible to effectively practice zone defence in basketball if you don't have 10 people?,How would you practice basketball zone defence with less than 10 people available?  I understand that you can put 5 on defence and the rest available in offence but it simply would not produce as much movement in the offence to really practice good one movement.   What is a good technique to simulating/compensating for missing offence players? (E.g. is it possible to get 3 offence players to make offence plays on one side of the court first then switch to the other side?)  Reference to some professional materials (books etc.) would be much appreciated. 
1700,What is the safe technique of coming out of a fall on a snowboard?,"When you ""bail"" on a snowboard a multitude of nasty things can happen due to the facts that you are strapped to the board and that the board is great at catching snow with its edges. So you may end up tumbling, twisting your joints and spraining muscles in the process.  The question is: once you realised you are destined to fall what is the effective way of minimising the risk of serious injury (or simply minimising the risk of tumbling and/or stopping in an awkward position with a twisted knee)?  One things I saw and tried is to rotate onto your back as soon as possible and slide on your back while lifting the feet with the board up to avoid catching the snow and causing a tumble. Is this safe? How could you get into such position quickly? Is there a better approach?  And please, don't tell me not to fall - I already try not to :)  Bonus: Is there a good technique to quickly recover from a fall? I.e. use the residual momentum of to get up and get going again quickly (if you aren't hurt of course) "
1701,How do you correctly learn how to hockey stop,"I am having the damnedest time learning to ""hockey stop"" on ice. I used to play a lot of roller hockey when I was younger and started to learn to ice skate and played a very little bit when I was in college but due to certain factors, stopped. Now I am attempting to pick it up again but I cannot learn to stop for the life of me.  I have gone over this video of How To Hockey Stop for Beginners! (YouTube) numerous times. While it really is the best beginner tutorial I've ever seen (and I've seen them all), I can't get my skate to shave ice like he says in basically step 1. Are my skates too sharp (they're brand-new)? Am I too heavy (I'm about 230lbs) for the depth of the skate sharpening I have? Is there some movement that's become so ingrained that he forgot to mention it? I can't even turn my foot the way it looks like he does in the video (though I can turn them enough to turn my body). Any help appreciated. "
1702,How to make running intervals more challenging as I improve?,"I have access to a treadmill, and living in the Northeast during the winter time I generally prefer to run indoors from December through about March. I do occasional long runs, but the goal of my weekday treadmill runs is to keep up my conditioning and perhaps work on some speed.  I've been running intervals one day a week to vary my workouts.  The treadmill I use has an interval setting with ""jog"" and ""run"" speeds, which I set to 6.0 and 7.0 miles per hour, respectively. I do a 35-minute workout in which the first five minutes are at the slower pace, run seven intervals spaced four minutes apart (1 minute run and 3 minute jog), then finish with two more minutes of jog.  I do this at work during lunch so increasing my total workout time really isn't an option.  What's the safest and most effective way to progress? As far as I see it, I can   Increase my jog speed (in my case, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3... mi/hr) Increase my run speed (7.1, 7.2, 7.3... mi/hr) Increase my run times (e.g., run two minutes, jog two minutes keeping a four minute ""block"") Decrease the ""block"" time (e.g., run one minute, jog two minutes making a three minute block)   Runners, what have you tried? And what does science say is best? "
1703,How can I calculate the best sail size for the current wind?,"Being a beginner in windsurf, I have several sails from 4.7 to 7.5 meters sq.  I find myself wondering how I can set the correct sail for the current wind.  How do we know what sail to use, and when to use it?  Is there any rule of thumb? "
1704,How to attack zone defense?,"What gameplays do you use to attack a zone defense, and specially 2-1-2 type? And how do you work it in practice?  I usually practice it with game situation, but are there some exercises to develop team level?  I also appreciate if you have videos, articles or book to recommend. "
1705,Difference between one gap and two gap techniques for defensive linemen,"While watching American football, I frequently hear about ""one gap"" or ""two gap"" techniques when referring to defensive linemen. I found this terminology to be a bit unclear, so I looked for an explanation online. I found a few articles like this one.  What is the primary difference between these techniques? It seems that the way the defensive linemen are lined up and their defensive responsibilities are the main factors. My understanding is that one gap defender is lined up between two offensive linemen and only worries about the gap between his opponents, while a two gap defender is lined up directly across from an offensive lineman and has to defend the space on either side of the blocker. From the diagram, it seems that 3-4 defensive linemen would tend to be two gap defenders, while 4-3 defensive linemen tend to be one gap defenders. Is my understanding correct?  Is there a simpler way of explaining these techniques? "
1706,How is the BCS rank determined?,How are BCS ranks in NCAA football determined? Is it determined by popular vote and record?   What factors affect a ranking? 
1707,Why are there different stars on table tennis balls?,What determines the rating of a table tennis ball? I know there are several different star ratings. The ratings go from 1 star to 4 star. I think there maybe a 5 star ball.  What factors determine the ball's star rating? 
1708,How do defenders score goals when part of a formation,When playing in a 4-5-1 or 4-4-3 formation you are meant to stay in your zone on the pitch.   The defenders need to be part of the back 4 and not move into the forward postions.  How then do defenders get out of position and actually score goals ? Given that goals are encouraged (obviously) but isn't being out of position a bad thing from the manager's point of view? 
1709,What is best for hydration during a run?,"I'm a less experienced runner, training for a half marathon. Up until now I only ran a maximum of 10 miles and I never felt the need to hydrate, but I read it's better to hydrate during the run.   What should I use for hydration, just water? I read that energy drinks don't make a lot of sense during a run, and are better to drink after the run, or not at all. And how would I carry it? I've seen belts and hydration packs, but they don't seem comfortable.  "
1710,Screening in volleyball,"The volleyball rules prohibit screening during a service (preventing the receiving team from seeing the ball or the serving player; rule 12.5), however, during any professional game you can see players at the net grouping with their hands above their heads. If that is not screening, what is?  Is this rule enforced at all? And if yes, what are the real criteria used to call a screening fault? "
1711,If a play ends with two runners at the same base who is safe?,In baseball if a play ends and two base runners are at the same base who is safe and who is out? Does the situation change if one of the runners can be forced? 
1712,Why are substitutions commonly made right at the end of the game?,"I often see the manager of a winning team making substitutions as the end of  the game nears (sometimes as late as during injury time).  The player being replaced is not injured, and doesn't time get added on to make up for the time lost for the substitution to take place?  So, what are the tactics behind this? Is it related to giving the player another cap? (perhaps pay related for an appearance?) Is it a mind-game to try and break up a run of play which may have been in the opponents favour? "
1713,Stomping after a table tennis serve or follow through?,I often see a lot of veterans stomp their feet after hitting the ball.  Why would one want to stomp after hitting the ball?  Is this purely a stylistic issue? Or does it improve ones follow-through?  You can see an example here. 
1714,Is it true that a line backer is the quarterback for the defense?,"I've often heard that the linebacker is the quarterback for the defense.   Thus, is it really true that a linebacker's role is sometimes to produce calls to change the defensive's game plan or an audible?  Is it possible for the linebackers to call audibles to counter the offense's call?  "
1715,Why does a foul ball not count as a third strike?,"From the Wikipedia entry for foul ball     A strike is issued for the batter if he had fewer than two strikes ...   A strike is, however, recorded for the pitcher for every foul ball the   batter hits, regardless of the count.   Why isn´t the batter struck out if he hits a foul ball while he already has two strikes? Why is this situation different than if he has zero or one strikes? "
1716,Enforcement of traveling in basketball,"In most levels of basketball, from youth leagues to the college level, traveling seems to be enforced fairly regularly. However, at the NBA level, traveling seems to be rarely enforced, with the rules now updated to state:     A player who receives the ball while he is progressing or upon   completion of a dribble, may take two steps in coming to a stop,   passing or shooting the ball.   Since it appears that FIBA rules seem to be similar to those of the NCAA used in the Olympics, does this change in rule enforcement affect the play of NBA stars in the Olympics and other international competition? "
1717,Cross-training to increasing pace for a beginner,I'm fairly new at running.  I really enjoy it but definitely wouldn't consider myself very serious about it.  I ran a couple 5k races and a 10k race last year.  I'd like to increase both my 5k and my 10k pace and also prepare to possibly run a half marathon later this year.  What types of cross-training would be effective in helping to increase 5k/10k pace as well as the pace I'm able to run at in general?  What are some of the more effective types of cross-training for increasing running pace? 
1718,Why do the balls used in rugby and American football have a similar shape?,"Is there any reason for the fact that rugby and American football share this (quite unusual) ball shape?  &nbsp;  Do they have common roots? Does the American football ball come from the rugby one (which doesn't have the laces)? Is there any accepted ""proof"" behind this? "
1719,Cross-training versus specificity,"When undertaking physical training, as opposed to practice and skills drills, for your chosen sport, how much benefit is there in cross-training?   For example, I'm a cyclist, I'm preparing for various long distance, quite hilly events. Should I train solely on the bike, what is the benefit in shifting to running, skiing or swimming?   There's the theory that says train the body to do the thing you're training for, after all you don't get better at the violin by sitting at the piano, but that's skills. If you're training the body to be in the saddle for 6 or 7 hours, with lots of time with the pulse well into the red zone, is doing running for an hour or two still training the right stuff?   Mentally, breaking up the sessions is important as a bit of a rest from the routine, but am I wasting a session?  "
1720,Why is a foul bunt on strike three an out?,"Following up on ""Why does a foul ball not count as a third strike?"", I can understand caught fouls and foul tips being counted as strike 3. But what is the logic behind a 3rd strike foul bunt being an out? Bunts are some of the most exciting plays in baseball. Is this just to encourage good bunting skills?  "
1721,How can I better understand and appreciate curling?,"I have watched many curling matches (games? I'm honestly not sure of the terminology) during coverage of the olympics. I have read the basic rules, which seem simple enough, so I understand the mechanics.   However, I feel like I am missing most of the strategy and theory of the game. Where/how can I better appreciate curling? "
1722,Is the home team allowed to set the boundary as they wish?,"Is the home team responsible for the setting of the boundary? Can they set the boundary in such a way that may benefit them? E.g., supposing they tend to hit the ball straight (or to cow corner), can they shorten the straight (cow corner) boundaries and lengthen the other boundaries? (And, if the boundary needs to be in a certain shape, can they shorten/lengthen it at will?) "
1723,What is this three-against-one game with red and blue balls?,"On a recent visit to the University of Colorado, Boulder, I saw some students playing a sport I've never seen before.  I'll do my best to describe it.  On a grass field, a rectangle is marked out with string, about 5m by 10m.  Inside the rectangle are six balls, about 20 cm in diameter, three red and three blue, placed at specific locations.  There are four players, who start out standing outside the rectangle: three at one of the short edges (marked X below) and one at a long edge (marked O).  Here is a very crude drawing.   In addition to the four players, there is a fifth person who seems to be a judge.  The play of the game appears to go as follows.  The judge calls ""Go"", and the X players try to run into the rectangle, pick up a ball, and return to their original position.  When one of them picks up a ball, the O player runs into the rectangle and tries to tag him.  There seems to be some rules or strategy governing how they do this.  The X players can wait for a favorable moment to make their attempt.  Sometimes they chose a red ball and sometimes a blue ball; I couldn't tell what was the significance of this choice.  Also, sometimes an X player would get a ball and the O player would apparently decide not to try to chase him.  It also wasn't clear whether the X players were cooperating or competing with each other.  I saw at least two simultaneous games going on, so I don't think it was just random fooling around.  The players seemed to know what they were doing.  What is this game called?  Does it have formal rules, and if so, where can I find them? "
1724,How is the Duckworth-Lewis Method applied?,"I have seen lots of matches in which the D/L method was used to decide victory, but I never found out how it actually works. I know there are two keys in this method: overs and wickets in hand. Can anyone please explain it? And why does it not apply in test matches? "
1725,"Are there any rules in baseball which prohibit teams from ""borrowing"" players via trade?","Every season near the trade deadline, we see teams that are out of it trading expensive players and/or free agents-to-be, typically for younger players or prospects.  For example, Matt Garza, set to become a free agent after the season, was traded to the Rangers for a few prospects.  It made sense for the Cubs to trade Garza, because he wasn't under contract any further than this season, and thus doesn't have much value to them.  Compare Garza to someone like Mike Trout, who is likely the most valuable property in baseball, given his skill and inexpensive cost over the next several years.  There's no way the Angels would trade him, because he'll be the cost-controlled centerpiece of the team for years to come.  However, with the Angels out of it this year, what if they wanted to trade Trout to a contender (say the Pirates), but only for the remainder of this season?  That is, they'd get several top prospects now, and would have an agreement with the Pirates that they'd trade him back in the offseason (for something pretty worthless, say for a journeyman minor leaguer).  The Pirates get Trout for the stretch run and are happy to give up a few prospects.  Trout doesn't have much value to the Angels this year, but he has a ton of value for next year.  So they get a few prospects for him, in exchange for the part of his career which has very little value to them.  So in effect, the Pirates are renting or borrowing him for the remainder of 2013.  Why don't trades like this happen?  Are there any rules prohibiting trades like this?   "
1726,Can a rugby player who has hit the ball forward be tackled before the ball hits the ground?,"If a player accidentally hits the ball forward into the air, it isn't a knock on until the ball hits the ground, but is that player considered the ball carrier?  Can that player be legally tackled, forcing a knock-on?  For example, a pass is made and a defender is able to bat the ball forward into the air.   Can the intended recipient of the pass tackle the play who just batted the ball?    I believe that they can be tackled legally, but I haven't been able to find the supporting laws. "
1727,Why maximum time soccer player doing as an acting without any hurt by opponent?,"I saw many times, many matches if matches are world cup, league matches or any of friendly matches, but if player touches from the opponent player only slightly touch or even just air touch, but player doing more acting, as a very hurting opponent. if we see on reply we clearly see, there is nothing to do this type of acting. FIFA, UEFA or any association any charge if they found only acting without any hurt?? "
1728,What is the difference between googly and doosra spin?,I can see some of the spin bowlers bowl googly and some bowl doosra in international cricket matches.  What is the basic difference between googly and doosra spin?  How they differ from each other? 
1729,Unclean hits in tennis,"How are “unclean hits” judged in tennis? I mean situations like a ball slipping on a racket, or unintentionally hitting the racket twice (e.g. when the player does not hold the racket firmly enough).  In the official rules, I have found rule 24 (f), stating the point is lost if “The player deliberately carries or catches the ball in play on the racket or deliberately touches it with the racket more than once” (emphasis mine). Does this mean unintentional double touches or prolonged contact are fine?  Also, my friends debated whether hits by the rim are allowed or not. As I have found no mention about that in the rules, I suppose hits by any part of the racket (not only the strings) are allowed. Is that correct? "
1730,Error or Earned Run?,"There seems to be great disagreement about whether Starlin Castro made an error in the 5th inning of the Cubs-Athletics game on July 2, 2013.  The AP recap of the game reads:  ""The Cubs collapsed on defense in the bottom half behind Carlos Villanueva, who allowed two unearned runs in 3 1-3 innings of relief. Running back and to his right on Adam Rosales' short fly, shortstop Castro collided with Soriano in left field and the ball dropped. Coco Crisp followed with a tying, two-run single.""  Yahoo's box score shows that Castro made an error and that the two runs were unearned.  However their season stats for Villanueva count the runs as earned (and an extra hit).  Their play-by-play says that Castro made the error.  ESPN's box score shows no error and two earned runs.  Their play-by-play says it was a double, not an error.  MLB.com's box score, amazingly, shows that the Cubs had an error (at the top, in the ""9-inning view"" with Runs/Hits/Errors), but in the details below makes no mention of an error.  It shows 2 earned runs.  I have been a huge baseball fan for 25+ years and have never seen anything like this.  What's official?  What really happened?   "
1731,"In European Football, what exactly is a release clause?","Often times during the transfer window, the term ""release clause"" is thrown around. What does this mean?  For example, say a player has a 40 million euro release clause, and a team bids 40,000,001 for him. What have they accomplished by doing so.   What would the release clause impact if the team instead bid 39,999,999? "
1732,Understanding the roles of different types of offensive lineman in American football,"When New York Giants drafted Justin Pugh this year, the ESPN announcers said they picture him as a guard because his arms are short. Football announcers rarely give technical details and tend to over-simplify things as they speak.    What do teams look for to determine whether someone is best as a tackle, guard, or center? How hard is it for a quality offensive lineman to switch between these? Is there any difference between a left side player and a right side player other than that one tends to protect the quarterbacks blind side so you probably want your best tackle on that side?  "
1733,"Whats the motivation behind ""co-ownership"" deals in Serie A?","To my knowledge Italy is the only country that permits transactions where a club can purchase ""half"" of a player's contract from another club. I find this very peculiar and unpractical. First off, how do you figure out for which club the player plays? Second, why would you want to buy/sell ""half"" of a player?   The only way I can make sense of it, is if a bigger club wants to have the option of buying a promising player in the future, so they buy 50% of the contract in advance (presumably for a lower sum) to possibly buy the other half later on and make some money as such. But then again why would a smaller club want to accept a much lower fee and a complicated contract for a promising player?  "
1734,How does Hawk-Eye differ in tennis & cricket in terms of technology & philosophy?,"What is the difference in terms of accuracy of Hawk-Eye technology when it comes to cricket and tennis?  The tennis authorities throughout the world (except for the French Open and some clay court tournaments) have accepted the Hawk-Eye technology, completely trusting its results and awarding decisions on its basis.  But in cricket, in the form of the Decision Review System (DRS), there has been and is a lot of controversy surrounding Hawk-Eye. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is completely against it and many others are skeptical about it.     So what is the difference in Hawk-Eye technology and philosophy when it comes to tennis and cricket? "
1735,How can I improve my vert and park skateboarding skills?,"I consider myself very much a Street and Old School skateboarder but I would like to learn how to better myself in parks and on vertical ramps.   As I'm starting to take part in tournaments, what skills do I need to work on (for example balance and pumping to gain speed)?  Most of all, I want to know the ways in which I can improve my slides/grinds, stalls and airs in parks and verts. Also I would like to know when would be the best time to Pump on the ramps and pipes to gain the most speed?   Any ideas?  To clear up any confusion, by vert I mean pipes like quarter and half pipes that have a ramp to vertical and over vert refers to ramps that bend backwards to almost make you go upside down. ramps such as full pipes.

1736,Basketball throw-in - deflected inbound pass,"Player A inbounds the ball but Player B knocks the ball back at him.  Player A is still out-of-bounds when the batted ball hits him.  Is it Team A's ball because Player A never became a ""live"" player?  Is it Team B's ball because the ball hit him as he was standing out-of-bounds? "
1737,"NFL rule changes to balance defense more, but do not reduce player safety","This might get flagged as an opinion question, but I hope not. I think its interesting. Offensive numbers started to rise in the early 1980s. According to wikipedia, the 1978 season had a series of rule changes to increase scoring. I think there have been alot of rule changes over the last 30+ years to improve offense. I do not think most of them were done to help player safety. Are their rules changes that the NFL could make to balance the game more that would not make the game less safe? I don't think the NFL wants to because offense generally brings more ratings. I was thinking of a few. I hope this question is ok.    offensive pass interference includes loss of down. The penalties for defensive pass interference are so much worse.  Defenders can now touch players up to 10 yards down field instead of 5 (this dates to the 1978 rule changes) possibly unless that defender is inside the opponents 20 yard line. (not alot of space when you are near the goal line). This might be really complex to enforce...  I think pass interference rules have changed many times over the years. I am wondering if you can make things in a little (should be phased in ) more lenient on defenders.    any other ideas?  "
1738,Can a runner be on base in baseball when it is his turn to bat?,"I don't know if this is actually possible based on 3 outs in an inning, but is it possible to be on base when it is your turn to bat? If so what happens to your at-bat.  Scenario would be lead-off batter gets on can the order return to his turn at bat before he scores?  Single, then on 3rd base when he is up to bat?  Does this make sense?  Thanks "
1739,"When a tennis player comes out of retirement, what happens to their points & ranking","In the game of tennis, in ATP &amp; WTA tournaments &amp; Grand Slams, the player's points &amp; rankings play a very important role in the qualification &amp; seeding for the tournaments.     When a players retires from professional tennis, he/she is obviously removed from the rankings. But if the players comes out of retirement after a year or so (Henin,Clijters,Devenport) do they start on zero points? Or do they get a portion of their previous points back?      The star players, which I just mentioned above, will get a wild card entry into tournaments irrespective of their points. But what happens in the case of an unknown player? What happens to their points &amp; rankings? Do they have to start all over again? "
1740,Is it permissible to wear caps while playing football?,"I couldn't see any football players wearing caps while playing international matches, but I could see some of them wearing large headbands.

1741,Why don't more NBA teams use the triangle offense?,"Does anyone use the triangle offense other than Phil Jackson? He won 11 rings with it. In the NFL, teams copy each other all the time. How come teams don't copy Phil? I don't think the argument that 'Phil and Tex Winters' are the only guys who really understand it. These are professional coaches that typically have decades of experience in basketball before getting a job.  "
1742,Why two new balls in One Day Internationals?,"Why two new balls in One Day Internationals? Ground is getting smaller [true]. Bats are becoming powerful [true]. I don't seem to get the argument of two new balls helping the bowlers. Ideally, new balls are used by fast bowlers to good effect. Spinners can use the old ball to good effect too. Spinners can bowl with new ball [a different argument]. I want to know technically how will it help the bowlers?  "

1744,Can a batsman be out hit wicket in the midst of playing a shot that would be a boundary six?,"Suppose a batsman clobbers a ball out of the park and while the ball is in the air inside the boundary, he falls onto his wicket and is out. Shortly after the ball crosses over and falls outside the boundary.  Is this out because the batsman is hit wicket? Or is the ball deemed to be out of play as soon as the batsman hit it? I guess the question hinges on when a ball becomes out of play - on leaving the bat or on falling somewhere.   "

1746,Which soccer players have more goals than games at the club level?,"Are there some football players who have better average than 1 goal per game in their club career? Or if we restrict only to one competition, not the whole career? Or to one season of a competition?  I think it would be good to restrict the question to top club competitions, such as top European leagues, Champions league, etc. (Although not everyone will probably agree which club competitions should be considered top.) And, clearly, we should also omit players who only played a few games.  Similar question for games at international level was posted recently here: Who is the best striker (best goals/appearances ratio) with 25/50/100+ national caps? "
1747,How to brake in rollerblade?,"I just began rollerblade, or inline skating. After tried it twice, now I can skate on the pavements in a park nearby (I choose late night to avoid pedestrians). However, I don't know how to brake without using the brake at the heel of the right boot.   I've checked on wikihow, it says:      Learn to brake. Just like driving a car, riding a bike, or even   running, anticipate where you want to stop. Move one foot forward and   bend the knee slightly, applying pressure on your heel until you   slowly come to a complete stop.   This is to use the brake at the heel of the right boot, isn't it?  However, seems all advanced rollerblade skaters take off the brake at the heel of the right boot? At least is what I observe from youtube videos, people stand on one foot, and brake by using another boot's side or tip.   But the skills are a bit too advanced for me. When I try to place the two feet as a ""T"" shape, I always go sideways. Should I just practice more, or there's some trick?  I'd like to seek some advice. Just to summarize my questions:  Q1: Is it true that advanced rollerblade skaters take off the brake at the heel of the right boot (and brake use other ways)?  Q2: After taking off the brake at the heel of the right book, is there an easy way to brake ? e.g. ""T"" shape? If so any suggestion to practice?  Q3: After taking off the brake at the heel of the right book, what are the different ways to brake ? e.g. which one is faster, which one is safer...? "
1748,Why are there so many pitcher types in baseball?,"I understand when the various types of pitchers come on: starter, middle reliever, setup, closer.

On the flip side, if the closer is so good a shutting down an innings, why not use him more? "

1751,Why are NFL hash marks closer than NCAA hash marks?,"Typically as you move up to more competitive levels of a sport, elements are adjusted to account for the increase of skill/speed/power of better players.   NBA 3-point line is farther from hoop than NCAA 3-point line MLB uses wooden bats while NCAA uses metal bats NFL requires 2 feet for completion, NCAA requires 1 foot for completion   Why are NFL hash marks closer together than NCAA hash marks?   If the difference relates to field goals, I don't understand why the NFL would narrow the marks and make it easier for kickers. If the difference relates to location of ball spots, is there a reason the NFL chooses to keep lateral ball spots closer to the center of the field?  "
1752,Betting on even quotas,"Assume that you want to bet for football game and the odds are as following:  Victory Team 1: 2.30 No Winner: 3.00 Victory Team 2: 2.30  Is it correct, that in this case, the bookie considers both sides as even and in this case, the best thing you can do is to bet for tie/draw? (of couse only if you do not have any information or reasons to assume that Team 1 or 2 has better chances to win.)  And if so, then why is tie/draw-odd higher than the other two? "
1753,"Is there any advantage to playing two home games versus one away game in a ""tiebreaker?""","The baseball season is coming to a close, and with several clusters of closely matched teams, ""tiebreaker"" rules are coming into consideration, especially for three teams with identical records playing for the second wild card spot.  In that case, the three teams will be designated A, B, and C, with A and B playing at A's home field, and C playing the winner in the winner's home field.  The choices are made by the teams, with the teams getting choices in (descending) order of their head-to-head record.  The ""natural"" choice is C (only one game to play). I can't see anyone choosing B (worst of both worlds).  But might some teams choose A (two home games to qualify) over C (one road game)? Perhaps someone with a large home media market like the New York Yankees or Mets? (Neither are candidates this year.) Or perhaps a team that plays WAY better at home than on the road? "
1754,Personal Foul causing fumble,"In the NFL, supposing a player catches the ball legally and runs with it, for a total of a 25 yard gain, but is hit to the head, causing a fumble before he makes contact with the ground (and is knocked out cold).   The opposing team lands on the loose ball and the refs whistle. I'm pretty sure the ruling would be the foul is assessed at the end of the run before losing the ball, thus the offensive team would have gained a total of 40 yards on that play.   However, the play was not dead at that spot (all other fouls would have nullified the play if the opposing team accepted the foul, so how can you nullify just half a play?). My question is, where would the ball be spotted and is there a reference that points to this scenario? "
1755,Requirements for Touchdown Catch Near the Goal Line,"When a ball carrier has possession in the field of play, and carries the ball toward the end zone, the requirement for scoring a touchdown is that the ball cross the plane of the goal line.  The position of the player's body parts is irrelevant, so long as he is not out-of-bounds, or down.  For a pass play, a receiver must have control of the ball with either two feet down, or equivalent (e.g. one knee down).  But, to be considered a touchdown, does the ball not still need to break the plane of the goal line, even if the receiver gets two feet down in the end zone, with control?  In today's San Francisco / Philadelphia game, Stevie Johnson was awarded a touchdown on a great catch, where he came back to the ball, and got two feet down in the very front corner of the end zone, while falling out of bounds.  ([website]Given the angle that his body fell (back toward the line of scrimmage and toward the sideline), where the ball in his hands landed as he hit the ground (the 1 yard line), and the proximity of his feet to the front corner of the end zone, it seems to me like this should not have been called a touchdown, with the ball instead being placed on the half yard line (ish).  Am I misunderstanding a nuance of the rule for catches in the end zone?  Does it matter that the player established his body in the end zone before coming back to the ball?  Is this just an instance of announcers and officials not noticing something that usually isn't an issue?  I heard no mention of the question of whether the plane was ever broken on the broadcast, or sports media write-ups of the game.  The focus only seemed to be whether a catch was made (which it clearly was). "
1756,Offside when the ball was last played by the defending team,"In football; after an attack on goal, the goalkeeper gains possession.  An attacking player quietly remains behind the goalkeeper in hopes to be forgotten.  The goalkeeper drops the ball to feet in order to play (not having noticed the attacker loitering behind).  The attacker springs to action and steals the ball and knocks home a goal.  The player is not considered offside.  What rule allows this play to continue?  It seems counter to the offside rule or could be labeled as trickery?    Further, in a recent match, a player 10 yards offside received a glancing ball off a defender's attempted clearance header and hit one home.  What is the correct ruling? Thanks. "

1761,Accidentally striking a ball with the cue after the first successful shot,"In 8-Ball, after a break where no balls were sunk, the next player takes their turn. They successfully sink a ball and the balls have stopped moving, but while moving away from the table for the next shot, strike a ball with their cue. Is this foul considered part of the first shot, and the table remains open? Or is it a foul for the next shot, and the table is no longer open? "
1762,Why doesn't a player have to catch the ball from a punt?,I've been getting in to NFL this season and really like the sport. One point I was unclear about in the rules is when a team punts the ball. Why does the receiving player not have to catch it? I noticed that a player the other week let the ball go over his head and bounce but the opposition could not pick it up? 
1763,Do team owners earn or spend money for their clubs?,"Are there statistics that collect information about the cash flow of sports clubs?  What I am wondering is, in general do the team owners have to spend money to manage the club, for passion (I hope), or can they earn money from this activity as a job or an ""financial investment""?  I am thinking about the most important European football/soccer clubs, or US basketball/hockey/football teams and so on "
1764,"Why do pitchers sometimes pitch ""out of the stretch?""","My understanding is that this is done in critical situations, as when there are opposing men on base, usually more than one.  Is this true and if so, why is that? Is it to increase the chances of striking out the next batter, or otherwise decrease that chances of the batter making contact with the ball that may even get him out, but advance the runners? "
1765,"Who qualifies for a ""save"" in this example?","The starter left after five innings with a one run lead. (Actually, he was ""pulled"" after letting the first two batters on base in the sixth.) A reliever comes on, ""strands"" the two inherited runners in the sixth, then pitches the seventh and the eighth, that is a total of three innings. From what I understand, pitching three innings is one way to earn a save.  A closer pitches the ninth. And neither side scored after the starter left so the lead remained at one run.  Does the closer automatically get the save? Or might the three inning pitcher get the credit since he stranded two inherited runners? And it isn't possible for both of them to get the save, is it, even though both ""qualify?"" "
1766,Does triathlon biking passing-penalty rule apply if the rider ahead accelerates?,"According to USA Triathlon 5.10, there is no drafting (a.) (being in a 7m x 2m zone behind the rider in front of you) except in the case you are passing (h.1.), in which case you have 15s to pass (g.) as measured by your front wheel.  My primary question is, what happens if the rider in front of you happens to decide 5 sec into your passing attempt to pass the rider in front of them -- you've encroached their drafting zone but are going to same speed as them so are unable to pass them within 15 sec? If you drop back you're penalized, but if you continue to attempt to pass you're also, still, penalized?  Also, please address whether during the passing scenario above whether you can immediately enter the draft zone of the rider in front of you without first moving 2m to the left (i.e. can you ride up directly behind the rider, then move to the side to pass)? "
1767,How to calculate IAAF points?,The ways to translate results into IAAF points are published in form of huge tables. I am working on a statistics system and need to calculate these points.

1768,Why do pro golfers fall back slightly after their putt?,"Just about every time I watch a pro golfer make a putt within about 10 feet, I see them fall back a step after the ball is just about in the hole.  Why is this?  My theory is they are trying to keep their balance on their heels during the putt, or they are leaning back in suspense as the putt gets closer to the hole.  Phil Mickelson and Jordan Spieth are good examples of pros who do this often.  Any other theories, or a real explanation? "
1769,What happens if a cricket team has more than 11 fielders?,"What is the rule concerning the violation of a 11 player rule? What if the team fielding 12 players played half an inning without anybody noticing it? The game was a 20 over/side game and each team was allowed a super sub. Any 11 can bat and any 11 can bowl however only 11 can field.  I don't know if this has ever happened before, however it did to us. The team chasing noticed that the fielding team had 11 players on the field. Not sure when they added the 12th player, but there was no substitution called. I think the team played with 12 from the beginning. I cannot find any rule that addresses this violation. I wonder if this was the first time that this rule has been violated in such a way. It's dumb and funny at the same time.  What should have happened!?! "
1770,How often do people in the golf tournament crowds get seriously hurt or killed by errant golf shots?,"You couple the guys who can hit the ball the hardest... and the greatest gatherings of people to within just feet of the fairways and greens, it would seem that crowd members would regularly be hit.  Catch someone on the temple or a weak bone, and I'd imagine there could easily be serious injury.  Yet I don't remember any big stories about this happening.  And the only remotely helpful result from Google seemed to be this Quora discussion.  Is this an under-publicized problem?  Or an insignificant danger?  Or a disaster waiting to happen? "
1771,8-ball: is it a foul if the shooter doesn't touch the call shot ball?,"I'm not sure if this is covered by the 6.2 Wrong Ball First. Basically I want to know if it's a foul in this case/example:   the shooter is assigned the stripes group the shooter calls the shot: ball 13 and the head right pocket the shooter fails to touch the ball 13 but doesn't commit any other foul (e.g. the 6.3 No Rail after Contact, maybe hits another striped ball)   So in this case the shooter committed a foul and the opponent gets the cue ball in the hand or the shooter only lost his turn?

1772,Soccer: How to thwart someone who's pushing you on the back when receiving the ball,"I'm a fairly big guy for a soccer player, which has some advantages and disadvantages.  Two of the disadvantages is that referees think that I'm clumsy when I fall over, or that I'm not being fouled when I don't fall over after someone pushes me.

1774,Is the 1925 White Hart Lane match real?,"This is the story but I couldn't find any real proof. Is this real? Or is there a way to find out?  One of the funniest matches in football: Arsenal VS Spartak Moscow (1925)  Fog was covering the pitch (White Hart Lane), and it was too hard to see, impossible to play a match.  But the ref refused to cancel the match, because the other team came all the way from Russia.  Anyway the match was a total mess, an Arsenal player was sent off because he kept arguing with the ref. He came back in to the match later and the ref didn't notice him. Spartak made a change, but the subbed player didn't go off the pitch, the match continued this way and the ref wasn't able to see anything.  At a moment in that match, Spartak played with 15 players. Arsenal players started to feel something was wrong, but nobody was able to count the players.  And the real problem was when the Arsenal keeper got injured because his head smashed into the post while trying to save a ball. The keeper went out of the game, and a fan jumped there instead of him, and nobody noticed. "

1776,Has W.A.R. been used in this fashion?,"Whether justifiably or not, in modern baseball conversations, W.A.R. (wins above replacement) has become the goto statistic to qualify who's the best in the game.    My question is, can it be applied to teams?  And has it?  What I mean is:  say we figured out the record of an all replacement level squad -  it seems like it would vary based upon the year, but for ease of this question, let's say 62 wins, 100 losses.    Maybe it should be less, but whatever the case, what we're talking about here is the win-loss record for a team with a combined W.A.R. of 0.0.  Now - if we took at a team with 92 wins and 70 losses, how close would their record come to their combined team W.A.R.?  In other words, could we expect them to have a combined team W.A.R. of 30?  If not; why not?  Is there any sort of statistical interest in combined team W.A.R., and / or has any sort of analysis been done to see how closely team W.A.R. correlates to actual Wins and Losses?  And if it doesn't correlate in that manner, shouldn't the name be changed? "
1777,How often does pulling the goalie work?,"In ice hockey, when a team is losing by one goal in the waning minutes, the goalie is often replaced by another player, giving more offense, but creating the risk of an empty-net goal.

1778,Is this a subtlety in the icing rule?,"I feel like I have a good grasp of hybrid icing in the NHL, but every couple of games I notice what looks to be a missed icing call.   The defensive team gains possession of the puck in their own zone. Both teams immediately begin changing some players (benches are on each team's defensive side of the rink), as one defensive player slowly carries the puck into the neutral zone. Two opposing defensemen -- slowly retreating, anticipating a trip to the bench -- have left a small lane for the player to carry the puck just past the center line, but the defensive player does not take it. While between his team's blue line and the center line, the defensive player clears the puck past the opposing defensemen to the opposing goal line, but not directly at the goal. The puck leaves his stick at least 3 feet before the center line.  The opposing team will clearly be the next to touch the puck. All skaters are now changing or have just come onto the ice. Fresh opposing defensemen skate back to their goal to retrieve the puck. The opposing goalie may or may not come out to play the puck, but it was apparent before this fact that icing would not be called.   Since the puck crosses the center line and goal line, and no players touch the puck before it crosses the goal line, I always expect an icing call. The body language of the players on the ice indicates that they know it won't be called for icing, so the goalie's choice to come out and play it does not seem to be a factor.  Is icing called off when both teams are substituting, even if the cleared puck meets all criteria of an icing?  Otherwise, are the officials missing an occasional icing call, or do they allow the puck to be released less than some distance (like 5 feet) behind the center line when possession is clearly being exchanged for a full change? The defensive player is trending toward his bench as he clears it, so he knows it won't be called. I'm wondering if this has something to do with bench location, as I only see this play when the bench is on the defense's side. "
1779,What do the numbers on Mavis (Yonex) Badminton cocks mean?,"I have seen sports shops selling Yonex Badminton cocks in boxes titled ""Mavis 350"", ""Mavis 500"" or ""Mavis 10"".  Do these numbers mean anything in particular, or is it just that the Brands can't get creative with their names?  I have tried to look into this a bit, and some say it may imply its resemblance to a feather cock. So a Mavis 2000 is better than a Mavis 10 in resembling a Yonex feather cock. Is this true? "

1783,MLB - process of signing guy off of streets,"This is a theoretical question, but I am curious of the process. Let's say the owner of a major league ball club is driving around somewhere and sees a baseball game happening on the streets where a pitcher is throwing 250mph (yes I know not possible, but this is to exaggerate his skills). So obviously the owner is very intrigued and finds out the guy is just a regular guy who never played any organized baseball. Could that owner just sign him right there if he wanted to? Does he have to get drafted?  "

Neither team's news or transaction logs describe the conditions of this pick, and the many NHL trade trackers I've found simply call it a ""4th-round conditional pick in 2019"".

1788,2 players steal at the same time on 2 outs,"There are runners on 1st and 3rd, 2 outs, and while a pitch is in progress, the runner on 1st attempts to steal 2nd. The catcher throws to 2nd, and the runner is caught in a pickle, eventually tagged out. During the pickle, the runner at 3rd steals and reaches home before the runner at 1st is declared out.   Does the run scored count? Or does the 3rd out supersede the run scored? "
1789,Can physically disabled people participate in the Olympics?,E.g. can a person without a hand technically participate 100-metre dash? Was there any precedents(in any sport)?  NB: I don't ask about the moral side of the question and don't want to change the judging system. 
1790,"What are the rules of jump balls / tipoffs in basketball (nba, or others) about where the players on each team can stand?","In the opening tipoff to start the game, can they only stand on the opposite side of the halfcourt line? And for the other tipoffs I feel like the players on each team always stand in the same place (right?) -- are there rules that force them to do that? Or could they stand wherever they want? "
1791,Why is a batsman not permitted to consult with team on DRS?,"Australian captain Steven Smith was recently embroiled in controversy after looking towards the dressing room while deciding whether to call for review of his LBW decision.  I gather the rules state that the batsman may only consult with other players on the field, and not with the umpires or his team on the sideline.  Why do the rules forbid the batsman consulting with his team on the sideline? What is the problem that this rule is trying to avoid? "
1792,Has a pro golfer ever worn a sports logo during a televised tournament?,"Golfers on the pro tour will wear logos on their hats and clothes which undoubtedly yield them revenue in endorsement money.  Has a golfer ever worn a college or pro sports logo on tour?  Specifically during a notable season, like a deep playoff run? "
1793,Who holds the Modern Era record for most hits in a nine inning Major League Baseball game?,Only one man in Major League Baseball history has recorded seven hits in seven at-bats during a regulation nine-inning game.    Who was this player?  For what team did he play?  Who was the losing team?  Why was this game particularly embarrassing for the losing team?  What were the stats for that game?  What kind of hits did he have in his seven at bats?  Who pinch-hit for this player and why?  What are the most important events in this player’s Major League Baseball career?  Why is this player’s bat from the record-making game in the National Baseball Hall of Fame—but the player himself is NOT in the Baseball Hall of Fame?

1795,Is there any reason why you get 4 points for a win and 2 for a draw in AFL,"Is there some way you can get 1 point or 3 points for a match?  If not, it appears to be easier to do the standard 2 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 for a loss. Is there some historical reason why this has been the case? "
1796,In what percentage of test matches did the team lose when enforcing a follow-on?,How many times have teams lost the matches when they enforced the follow-on?  Were any of these teams from Asia? 
1797,Playing after buzzer beater with almost no time left,"In LeBron James's buzzer beater against the Raptors the ball passes through the net with 0.3 seconds left. There are buzzer beaters with plays starting with 0.3s left, such as this one.  I thought the criteria for stopping time was the ball passing through the net; plus, the factor of 0.3s not being enough time to bother playing it contradicts the second video.  Why didn't the Raptors get to play the 0.3s left? What are the rules in this situation? "
1798,"Does a shot hitting the woodwork count as a ""shot on target"" in football?",Is a shot that hits the woodwork considered a shot on target? Apparently this is not counted in the EPL and La Liga? Is this true? I searched all of this extensively but could not find anything.  
1799,Can a bowler change hands for different deliveries in the same over?,"Can a bowler, within the same over, bowl three balls with their right hand and three balls with their left hand?  Can they do this alternating sides or must they complete all deliveries with each hand consecutively before changing? "
1800,Record of consecutive sets won,"Rafael Nadal, recently won his 50th consecutive set on Clay in his match against Diego Schwartzman in 2018. This apparently moved him in front of John McEnroe who won 49 consecutive sets on carpet in 1984.  My question is, is there any official statistics that show who has won how many consecutive sets in a particular court? And if yes, who is the third best in that category? "
1801,What happens when 2 balls partially fall into a pocket and then get stuck?,"In a recent game of pool, my opponent hit a shot that resulted in 2 balls getting stuck in between a pocket's walls.  They were both still touching the table surface, while at the same time partially below the table surface (partially in the pocket).    Here is what happened:    What is the ruling in this situation?  Both balls pocketed?  Neither ball pocketed? "
1802,Is a fielder allowed to change position during the bowler's run up?,"If a fielder standing in the gully position moves to cover point (as bowler starts his run up) before the batsman plays the ball what action will the umpire want to take?  Often a fielder will move forward or backward, but in this situation the fielder standing in gully moved to cover point before the batsman faced the ball.  He checked the ground fielding positions before facing and at that time the fielder was in the gully position, then suddenly he was at cover point and took a catch. What is the reply by the umpire? "
1803,What constitutes a legal safety shot in 8-ball pool?,"In a recent friendly game, I successfully snookered my opponent between the rail and one of my balls. To achieve this, I played the cue ball off a single rail and ended up touching my own ball before the cue ball stopped.  My opponent claimed a foul, since ""only the cue ball touched a rail, and not the object ball"".  Coming from a snooker background, I find the rules of 8-ball safety play somewhat confusing. I read the official 8-ball rule guide, however I did not see an explicit rule that corresponds to my situation.  So what constitutes a legal ""safety shot"" in 8-ball pool? Can I only snooker my opponent when both cue ball and object ball touch the rail? Is there an order in which this must happen (i.e., does the cue ball have to touche the rail first, or last)? "
1804,Can you ever touch the ball with two hands between bounces while dribbling?,"Look at this video at 6:42. NBA rules today state that this is not legal. Is this legal under NFHS/NCAA rules?  He tosses the ball behind his back with his right hand and then continues his dribble with his left hand. At no point does he ever touch the ball with both hands simultaneously. Let's assume he doesn't carry (go under) the ball with his right hand on that behind-the-back toss.  Excerpt from the 2017-2018 NCAA rulebook:     Art. 4. The dribble ends when:        a. The dribbler catches or carries/palms the ball by allowing it to come to rest in one or both hands;      b. The dribbler touches the ball with both hands simultaneously;      c. An opponent bats the ball; or      d. The ball becomes dead   It doesn't look like the rules prohibit this type of move when done well, yet people often say that it's illegal. Are there other rules or interpretations that I'm missing? Please provide any official sources you use in your answer. "
1805,"In badminton, which part of the shuttle determines ‘in’ or ‘out’?","The basic rule of whether a shuttle is considered ‘in’ or ‘out’ in badminton is whether it:     lands outside the boundaries of the court    i.e. not on or within the boundary lines (Laws of Badminton, §13.3.1). That rule doesn’t seem to have been clarified in any more detail anywhere that I can find, though.  A few times now, I have seen cases in professional matches where the instant replay in slow-motion seem to show the shuttle landing very horizontally, with the cork base of the shuttle landing just outside the line, but the feathers landing simultaneously (or at least so simultaneously that it was impossible to tell, even in slow-motion, which part landed first) on the line.  I seem to recall some of these having been called in and some out, but I don’t recall any Hawk-Eye-enabled challenged being taken to decide.  Hawk-Eye systems show the shuttle as a single circular shape at the point of impact, which might imply that the base of the shuttle is the part that actually counts; but then again, it’s just a simplified CGI animation and not necessarily intended to encode any such deeper meaning.  So in a case like this, where the base lands outside the land but the feathers simultaneously land on the line, should the shuttle be considered in or out? Has this been clarified in any official capacity? "
1806,Where do folds come from on a surfboard and are they bad?,"Why are there sometimes folds on the top of a surfboard and where do they come  from? Do they mean the board is in bad shape (or more exactly, is the board less usable or less effective)?   "
1807,Can a Hall of Fame player come out of retirement and play again,"In (at least) North America it's a tradition to induct the very best players of a league who have not been playing for a certain amount of years. All major leagues in North America: NFL, MLB, NBA, and NHL practice this tradition.  Almost all of the athletes who make it to the Hall of Fame have long careers. Furthermore, most these athletes retire either because of injuries and health reasons, or because they pass their prime and are no longer as effective as they used to be. In both these cases, it is improbable for these players to come out of retirement after the minimum inactive period required by their respective league to become eligible for Hall of Fame. This makes it even harder for a Hall of Famer to make a comeback, and frankly I can't think of any player who has done this in recent years. The only players who I think could possibly do this (but don't believe they'll do) are Chris Pronger, and maybe Brett Favre.  Can a player who's been inducted to the Hall of Fame come out of retirement and start playing in that league again? I personally don't see why the leagues would have problem with this, but if it happens what is the policy of the leagues cited above regarding this situation. Will the athlete's Hall of Fame status be suspended for the time he continues to play? "
1808,"In basketball, what would be the result of a foul on the shooter and then a foul on the player attempting to block the shot?","Inspired a bit by this question...    The scenario:     A player is fouled by a defender while in the act of shooting, and puts up a shot.   Another defender sees the shot being taken, and has a path to block the shot on its upward trajectory.   As he goes to block it, another offensive player steps late into the path of the defender, illegally impeding him.   What would the result be?    I'm assuming a player is legally allowed to block a shot after a whistle (when continuation is given... or also after the horn to end a quarter) since the shot is still live.  I'm also under the belief that typically an offensive player illegally impeding a defender's block would be a loose ball foul if the shot has already been released (an offensive foul before the ball is shot)?  Would the result be akin to a typical double foul? "
1809,Shot on target with deflection - a goal or an own goal,"It's generally accepted that if a shot was on target but then deflected from another team's player and went in, then the goal is not considered as an own goal. ""Generally accepted"", because there are no official rules regulating these scenarios.  But what about Sergio Ramos's 2nd goal in Napoli vs Real Madrid, Round of 16, 2nd leg, 2016/17 Champions League game (Europe video) (US video)? This goal was accounted by UEFA as Dris Mertens's own goal, although the shot was clearly on target.  The only guess I have is that as this shot was directed towards the goalkeeper Pepe Reina, the guys who define the authorship of the goals decided that if there hasn't been a deflection, Reina would have easily caught the ball. So, why this goal is counted as an own goal? "
1810,Rushing yards vs passing yards vs receiving yards?,"I'm trying to understand football and some of its basic stats, and I'm not clear on the difference between these three.  Rushing yards:     A statistic in football that records the total number of yards gained by a single player as the result of a rushing play (or plays), in which the player carries the football (as opposed to receiving a pass).   Passing yards:     A statistic that measures the amount of yards gained by an offensive team on completed passes. Passing yards are measured for a given completion as the number of yards from the original line of scrimmage and the point that the player was tackled, forced out of bounds, or entered the end zone for a touchdown.   Receiving yards:     This is a statistic used in football defined as the number of yards gained by a receiver on a passing play. Included in the calculation of this statistic is the distance the ball was passed and any additional yardage the player gained after the reception.   What is a rushing play? How does a player get a ball other than by having it passed to them, excluding interceptions? If the ball always starts in a QB's hands, how can it possibly end up in anyone else's other than by a pass?  Honestly all three of these sound like ""yards gained in a play by passing the ball to someone and having them run with it.""  My understanding is that despite the phrasing in these definitions, these stats can apply to single players or to teams as a whole, but even so I don't see the distinction between them. They all seem to measure yards gained by a player who received the ball and ran with it. "
1811,At what point does a player earn his prize money and points for getting to a certain stage in a tournament?,"If a player pulls out of a match (eg. due to injury), do they still get the prize money and points for it?   So say, player A has qualified for the australian open which has a prize money of 50k and 10points for a first round loser ([website]Now if he pulls out before the match, I assume he doesn't get the money and the guy replacing him would get it.  But what would if he limps onto the court and plays one point and retires, would he pocket 50k for doing that or would he need to play up to a certain point (eg. similar to some betting agencies, which will only honour as having played if the match lasted beyond the first set)?  How about if this is not the first round but after the tournament has progressed and therefore there is no one to replace him. Would he still get the prize money and points even if he retires? So say, the player wins the 3rd round then pulls out of the tournament, would he get the same prize money and points as someone losing in the 4th round? "

1813,Why did the NHL move to the current playoff format?,"16 teams make it to the playoffs each season, 8 from each conference. Until a few years ago, within a conference the number 1 seed would face the number 8, number 2 would face number 7, 6 vs 3, and 4 vs 5.  Under the current format, teams face division opponents. Each conference get 2 wild cards. The top seed of the divisions play the wild cards, and the 2nd and 3rd ranked team within each division play a series. Then there will be a division championship followed by the conference championship.  Eventhough the current format promotes divisional rivalry, it seems very unfair. As of March 27 2017, the top 3 teams of the NHL - Washington Capitals, Columbus Blue Jackets, Pittsburgh Penguins - are all in the same division. This means that one of the top 3 teams is guaranteed to be eliminated after the first round of the playoffs when the 2nd and 3rd rank teams of this division face in the first round. This also allows for lower quality teams to enter the playoffs in the weaker division.  So given the above argument, I'm wondering why the NHL has stuck to this format? I can understand they wanted a change and came up with this system. But the system is clearly flawed. So why doesn't the NHL come up with another scheme or revert back to the old format?  Note: I say ""clearly flawed"" since there is a huge difference in the strength of the teams playing in the postseason. The league is trying the maximize the parity of the teams getting and moving forward in the postseason. But the current format benefits weak divisions and disfavours strong divisions. Back to my example, with a very high probability one of the 2nd or 3rd best teams in the NHL is guaranteed to exit the playoffs in the first round. There has been a long discussion whether any team in the Atlantic division really wants the 1st position. The division winner will most likely face New York Rangers, the Wild Card from the Metropolitan division who have more points than any team in the Atlantic. Hence finishing 2nd in the Atlantic division gives the division champion a much easier road to get to the Stanley Cup final. "
1814,Puck completely crossing the goal line for a legal goal - does it need to be placed to settle beyond the line too?,"The puck has to entirely cross the goal line in the net to count as a goal. Does that ​include a case where the puck is standing vertically on end parallel to the goal line but just a sliver beyond it, but when it falls or settles to the ice, would be touching the line?  I guess I'm asking, does the puck need to settle or be in a position to land flat entirely beyond the goal line to count or can it count by standing on end parallel to the line but a sliver beyond it, but then is touching the line when it settles flat?  I understand that the NHL has had controversy on some of these kind of ""goals"" or ""no goals"", because it can be tough to tell. I just want the official ruling on my scenario and how it would be decided. "
1815,NFL record for most number of interceptions within one instance of scoring?,"My brother and I were discussing some things when a question of curiosity came up that Google could not seem to answer:  In the NFL, what is the record for number of interceptions (by either team) within one instance of scoring (either touchdown or field goal)?  To be clear, we're curious as to the greatest number of interceptions that occurred before either team in an NFL game managed to score any points. Note that this could happen before the first score of the game or between two instances of scoring. For example if team A scored a touchdown, and went on to intercept team B, and then be intercepted before team B scored themselves.  I'm guessing it's probably 2 or 3 interceptions before someone scored, but who knows? "

1818,Illegal Substitution and Awarded Goal,"This is about an awarded goal on an illegal substitution in NHL hockey, or what I think would make for one. This has to do with an illegal substitute trying to stop disaster from occuring. Call it a kneejerk reaction. I only ask you use your imagination; I know this is the very definition of uncommon. But that's what I do, ask the uncommon questions no one wants to ask because they have wives and lives.  A team has its goalie pulled, either for a delayed penalty or at the end of the game; while in the attacking zone, they pass the puck back to the point, only to have it missed by the point man and head toward the unoccupied goal. Would it be an awarded goal if an illegal substitute from that team enters the game off the bench to race to stop the puck from going into the net somewhere in the neutral or defending zone?  The rule for illegal substitution has a clause in it for an awarded goal when the goalie is removed. However, it only takes into account a case where a ""player"" of the side attacking the ""unattended goal"" is interfered with in the neutral or attacking zone. It says nothing of the puck or its movements. So that's no good.  Rule 56.7 seems to support this, almost perfectly. It says, ""If when the goalkeeper has been removed from the ice, any member of his team (including the goalkeeper) not legally on the ice, including the Coach or non-playing Club personnel, interferes by means of his body, stick or any other object or piece of equipment with the movements of the puck or an opposing player in the neutral or attacking zone, the Referee shall immediately award a goal to the non-offending team.""  I'm guessing the above scenario is covered by this, since an illegal sub is not ""legally"" on the ice. I think the spirit of the rule is for obstruction from the bench, but it bolsters my case as well. The actual rule for illegal substitution doesn't say this - it's located under interference. Am I right with my analysis? "
1819,"For a goal while there's a change of players, who gets the +1/-1?","In hockey, there is a stat where players get +1 when their team scores while they are on the ice, and -1 when the opposite team scores when they are on the ice. (Cant remember the exact name of the statistic, if someone could inform me)  If a goal happens while there are not the expected number of players on the ice (like during a change of players, there is, at some point (for like a second) 4 or 6 players on the ice) who gets the +1/-1 in their stats?  Is it the outgoing player of the change? The incoming player? or does every player that has their skates on the ice at the precise moment the puck goes in gets the +1/-1? "
1820,"Do minor penalties become penalty shots when there is ""insufficient playing time""?","A couple of situations that call for minor penalties in the rulebook become penalty shots if they are committed when there is ""insufficient playing time"" to serve them (applies to regulation and overtime). For example, one situation is a defending player displacing the goal frame intentionally; from the 2017-2018 Rulebook, Rule 63.5, Penalty Shot:     If by reason of insufficient time in the regular playing time or by   reason of penalties already imposed, the minor penalty assessed to a   player for deliberately displacing his own goal post cannot be served   in its entirety within the regular playing time of the game or at any time   in overtime, a penalty shot shall be awarded against the offending   team   Does this mean that 1:59 or less must be remaining in regulation for a minor penalty to become a penalty shot? Technically, the rule doesn't even mention two minutes; it mentions ""insufficient playing time."" Does this mean if two minutes remain exactly, the minor penalty can be served in its entirety? "
1821,"Boarding, NHL vs USA Hockey","in the USA Hockey casebook, I came across an interesting little nugget.  ""Player A1 pushes teammate A2 into an opponent who is thrown against the boards violently enough to warrant a boarding penalty. Which Team A player is assessed the penalty?""  In this, a1 is called for boarding, instead of a2, unless a2 does something on his own that might deserve the call.  My question is, would the NHL use this approach too, for this kind of play? Ie, would it likely be penalized? The NHL rule is worded very specifically about a player who 'checks or pushes' an opponent who impacts the boards violently or dangerously; the USA hockey rule just says any 'action' that causes an opponent to go violently go into the boards.  They are just different enough to ask. "
1822,"At the end of the season, what decides tiebreakers in the NHL?","If at the end of an NHL seasons if 2 teams tie in points, who gets the higher seed? What break ties? And if that thing is tied too, what further breaks the tie? And what would a perfect tie be? "
1823,How can I prevent football/soccer net theft?,"I work at a primary school and the soccer nets have been stolen. The goal frames are still there, but the nets are gone. Is there a way to replace them so that they won't be stolen again? I thought perhaps making the nets removable? I've seen anti-vandal anti-theft goals online but I'm not sure what makes them so. "

1825,Position of holes on a floorball ball?,"I'm not a floorball player, I'm a mathematician. I got recently curious about the floorball ball: it's got 26 holes, which is an unusual number, and I wondered how they are placed on the ball.  It seems there is no regulation for this, certainly it's not in IFF Material Regulations (2016) document. There is some drawing in the appendix, but still, the placement seems to only have some general rules (like minimal distance between holes).  Is it really true that the balls do not have a predefined shape? And if so, what is the most common placement of the holes? "
1826,Is an own goal scored with hand a valid goal?,"In La Liga game between Leganes and Real Madrid on 5th April 2017, Leganes defender Martín Mantovani scored an own goal with hand †. Was it a valid goal?  † This goal apparently counted as Alvaro Morata's goal, which seems strange to me as he didn't even touch the ball. But if Morata wasn't involved at all, would it be still a valid goal if defender scores an own goal with his hands? "
1827,Elimination system where both opponents can lose,"Is there any tournament system that deals with the fact that both opponents can lose? Or is there an easy, non-complicated and fair way of modifying an elimination-like system to deal with it?  Context  I'm doing in historical fencing (HEMA). In this type of fencing, we want to strongly discourage so-called double hits, i.e. a situation in which both opponents hit each other at approximately the same time.  When we do tournaments, there are several options of dealing with double hits. The simplest one is that a double hit is a point for both opponents but that does not discourage the double hits, on the contrary, it encourages it in some situations (one of the opponents is one point from victory while the other one is not).  Another system is that double hits are not counted at all. This is a bit better but it can lengthen the matches.  The last system is that double hits are punished by both opponents losing (either right away or after some amount of double hits). This last option is closest to what we would want - it punishes double hits and can be scaled depending on the experience of the contestants (by the amount of double hits allowed). However it has one major drawback: it works only in round-robin-like tournament systems and any elimination-like system is broken by the fact that both opponents should lose. Hence my question. "
1828,What decides if a faceoff is Won or Lost?,"  How is a Faceoff decided as a won faceoff, or a lost faceoff? Is it all which center get the puck where he wants, or is it decided by another factor? "
1829,How to handle a short ball which has dropped below the level of the net,"If I am a bit late to a short ball which has dropped below the level of the net I tend to hit up fairly crudely and the ball will land somewhere in no mans land which can be easily attacked by an opponent.  What is the best approach for handling this scenario, take it as a topspin forehand or backhand and really accelerate up the ball to give it some lift? Do a low volley? Or something else? "
1830,How are ends chosen to start a new set following a tie-break?,"After a tie-break, how is it decided which end to start serving from in the following set?  Do players get a choice or do they keep the current end for one game or swap immediately? "
1831,How are doubles tennis players matched?,"I have a few questions regarding doubles players playing together on the mens', womens' and the mixed tournaments.   How are the doubles tennis players partnered up? Is this totally based on players' decision?  How do the doubles players qualify for tournaments, specially if they just begin playing together? Are there any requirements that the players need to respect in order to play together? Are the rules the same for the mixed and non mixed doubles players?   If different tournaments have different rules, then please at least list those of the grand slam's. "
1832,What is the use of the panels in F1?,"  You still always see those panels in F1 that some guy is holding out close to the finish line.  Since they have constant radio communication around the track, I really wonder... what is their use?  Like here we see it tell Kubika he won the Canadian GP a few years back, but he probably already knows with the radio that he was P1? "
1833,Responsibility of the batsman to be ready for the bowler,"Is there a rule that states that a batsman must be ready for the bowler, or is it just good etiquette? I'm not referring to waiting for a new bat to come in after a wicket has fallen. I'm talking about a bowler having to wait for the batsman mid-over, to get ready to receive the next delivery.  In a recent match, the bowler was bowling off a 10 yard run up. For every ball, a particular batsman was waiting 3-4 yards leg side of the wicket. He waited for the bowler to get to his mark and be ready to start the delivery, before he then walked into the crease and took his guard to receive the ball.  This was adding a slight delay to every ball, and (perhaps intentionally) annoying the entire field!  On occasion this would be fine, but this batsman did it every single ball. I was always taught that it is the batsman's responsibility to be ready for the bowler (assuming the batsman has reasonable time). In this case, with the bowler having a 10 yard run-up there was always plenty of time for the batsman to get ready.   I have scoured the rules but can't find anything that explicitly states one way or the other. All I can find under the dead ball rules is     Law 20.5 Ball ceases to be dead.      The ball ceases to be dead – that is, it comes into play – when the bowler starts his/her run-up or, if there is no run-up, starts his/her bowling action.   and under 20.4.2 Either umpire shall call and signal Dead ball when      20.4.2.5 the striker is not ready for the delivery of the ball and, if the ball is delivered, makes no attempt to play it.  Provided the umpire is satisfied that the striker had adequate reason for not being ready, the ball shall not count as one of the over.   This implies that unless the batsman has a good reason not to be ready, he has to be ready to receive the ball. ""adequate reasons"" is a bit vague - there are many adequate reasons that could fit in here, but if the batsman's batting mannerisms are simply that he likes to wait for the bowler to be ready, then surely that doesn't apply?   Was it reasonable for the batsman to oblige the bowler to have to wait for him to be ready every single delivery, or, given there was no adequate reason, could the bowler have legitimately just started bowling?   Where in the rules does it govern who has to be ready for who? "
1834,shortest odds in a top-class horse race,"In his final non-walkover race, the 150 Guineas at Newmarket in 1770, the undefeated Eclipse was offered odds of 1/70. These odds seem remarkable. Are there prominent examples of shorter odds in top-class horse-racing? Maybe in more recent races? "
1835,How are UFC scores awarded?,"How does the UFC point system work?  From watching fights I can tell that there are multiple judges that submit a scorecard, and the fighter who is the winner on the most scorecards is the winner of the match. But I'm not sure what criteria the judges use for determining which fighter wins a fight. They obviously care about punches, kicks, and takedowns, but do they care more about their frequency or about the amount of damage a fighter causes?  Watching UFC 225's main card fight between  Whittaker and Romero, the commentators mentioned a few times that they were surprised no judge awarded Romero a 10 - 8. Normally the round winner gets a 10 and the loser a 9 on a judge's score card. Is there a minimum to the points the loser of a round gets?  So how does a judge decide which fighter should win a round? And how do they decide by how many points they should win a round? "
1836,Where do fractional points in UCI ranking come from?,"If you look at various UCI rankings, you often see riders that have non-integers as their rankings. For example, if you look at the current UCI World Ranking and this year's UCI World Tour rankings, you can see Froome with 4918.13 and 1205.43 points, Van Avermaet with 2734.57 and 993.57 points.   However, when I look at explanation of UCI ranking points at Wikipedia (current revision), the points awarded for various placings are never fractions. So the best guess is that under some circumstances points are divided between several riders. Checking ranking breakdown for Froome and Van Avermaet I see that in these instances the non-integer points come from team time trials. (I am not sure to which extent these links are permanent, so I will explicitly mention that Froome has 1.43 points from TTT at Tirreno–Adriatico, where Team Sky finished 3rd. Van Avermaet has 8.57 from exactly the same event, BMC Racing Team won this stage.)  Is team time trial the only possibility when points are divided between several riders? What are the exact rules how the points from TTT (or some other situations where the points are split between several riders) are divided among riders? "
1837,What's the difference between the two skateboarding categories in the Summer Olympics?,"Skateboarding was approved in the 2020 Summer Olympics. The official program lists two categories: park and street.    I was expecting vert and street. To me, park was the same as street, but in skate parks, like this:    So what's the difference? Is park more like bowl? "
1838,My ping-pong paddle's rubber broke. How can I prevent this?,"I was playing ping-pong the other day. Little did I know at the time, my rubber was slowly coming off with every stroke of my paddle. When I was about to close out the game, I attempted to smash but twice, my balls died on the return and didn't clear the net. Knowing this was unusual, I checked out my paddle and saw a quarter of my rubber detached from my paddle with a slight tear. I still was able to win, but not without adjustments. This has happened during practice, but never during the heat of the moment. I'm considering replacing my paddle.  Is there a foolproof way to prevent this? Would a higher quality rubber/paddle prevent this problem from occurring in the future? "
1839,Use of Video Assistant Review (VAR) in FIFA World Cup 2018,"FIFA is going to use Video Assistant Review VAR in the Russia 2018 World Cup. This is is the first time it's going to get used in a major tournament.   Under this new rule there are 4 reviewable actions:   Goals Penalties Direct Red Cards Mistaken Identities   When it comes to reviewing any of the actions, does a team have to challenge or argue a call, or is it the referee itself triggering the event?  Also when reviewing goals, how far back in time would the referee or the video assistant referees go? The answer to this can be straight forward if the goal was actually offside and shouldn't have counted. But what if there was a foul or another offside that wasn't called earlier on before the last time the ball was stopped? "
1840,How to identify the teams playing a particular football match?,"This might seem like a silly question to a football enthusiastic but how can I tell which team is which in a particular match? I don't know any players, and the jerseys also don't have country names on them. If I don't have access to commentary, it becomes difficult.     Is there any easy way to identify the teams playing a match? "
1841,NBA mandatory timeout rules,"From the NBA rule book, on pg. 22, there are the rules for mandatory timeouts, which state:      If neither team has taken a timeout prior to 6:59 of the  period, it shall be mandatory for the Official Scorer to take it at the first dead ball and charge it to the home team. If no subsequent timeouts are taken prior to 2:59, it shall be mandatory for the Official Scorer to take it and charge it to the team not previously charged.   Now, the question I have is what happens if both the home and road teams have taken a timeout in the first 5 minutes of a quarter, and there are no other taken timeouts? Certainly, in this case, there is no timeout charged at the first dead ball after the 7:00 mark. Because there are no subsequent timeouts, one of the teams must be charged with a timeout on a dead ball at the 3:00 mark, but which one will be charged with this timeout. Or, would this be scored as an officials's timeout? "
1842,Why aren't oldschool skateboard tricks seen much today with modern skateboards?,"Why are skateboard tricks like those seen in this video (starting at 13:30) not seen much anymore, at least not with modern boards?  The kinds of tricks I'm referring to are handstands, hand flips with the board, other fliptricks that aren't based on ollies, style heavy on spins pivots and slides, etc.  [website]Are modern boards not suitable for these kind of old school tricks and style or have skaters and skating simply changed? If the boards are not suitable, what specifically stops people from getting into this kind of thing? Weight, material, shape and of deck, wheels, trucks, risers, or what? "
1843,When and why did rugby union change the number of reserves?,In the 2011 world cup teams fielded 22 players each and in the 2015 world cup fielded 23 players.  When was this changed? Is there a reason given by world rugby as to why this decision was made? 
1844,How long was the longest given extra time in a half in football?,"While watching a World Cup game, I noticed how the extra time given at the end of the first half is usually shorter than the extra time given at the end of the second half. That led me to wonder what was the longest extra time awarded at a football game, and after some reasearch I found this Bristol City game in 2000-2001 in a The Guardian article, where apparently 23 minutes of extra time were added:     ""When Brentford played away at Bristol City in 2000-01, there were about 23 minutes of stoppage time in the first-half alone after a broken leg, a dislocated shoulder (Bees striker Lloyd Owusu passed out from the pain and an ambulance had to be driven up to the pitch), and serious concussion caused the delay,"" noted Will. ""In fact, two goals were scored in that first-half injury-time, with the second being clocked in the 67th minute, I believe. The fourth official had originally held up 13 minutes' stoppage time, but one of the injuries occurred in that period to bump it up to 23. I'd be surprised if there were many games that contained more added-on time!""   Is this the longest extra time ever given during a professional football game? And if it isn't, what is the longest extra time period ever given during a professional football game? "
1845,Why do countries start to build stadiums after getting elected to host FIFA World Cup?,"I have observed this time again that a country starts building new stadiums whenever they are elected for hosting a FIFA World Cup.   Why is that?   Why don't they have sufficient stadiums already given that they certainly have domestic leagues? If they don't have sufficient stadiums already, why are they elected to host a world cup?   Note.  I am not talking about renovating the old ones. "
1846,"Is it legal to go under the net to play a ball going out, back in play in volleyball?","Is it legal to go under the net, on the other players side in indoor volleyball to play a ball that was going out?  From my understanding, you would have to hit it around the net, then another team member would have to hit it over the net and as long as you don't interfere with the other team (or it isn't a dangerous play) - it is legal.  Is that correct?   Does the same apply to Sand Volleyball? (both 2s and 6s)   "
1847,How to become a cricket umpire for icc?,"I like cricket very much, is there a way to take umpire as carrier? If so what should i do? "
1848,8 ball Pool: Left only with black ball,What happens if I have only the 8 (black) ball left to pot and my opponent who has a colored ball scratches the cue ball? Do I get a ball in hand or do I have to try potting the black ball from behind 'the line'? 
1849,Foul after a goal,"What if, in soccer, right after the attacking team scores a goal, the defending team makes a foul? Say, it was a corner, and the ball already crossed the line, and then a defending player slide-tackles a attacking person. What is the result? A penalty? Or maybe a direct free kick inside the goal?!? "
1850,"In golf, does the club shaft increase clubhead speed through shaft flex?","In golf, does the club shaft increase clubhead speed through shaft flex (shaft kick)? On the downswing, the shaft has a tendency to flex from backwards to forwards. While the shaft is in the process of flexing forward, it could increase clubhead speed (which would then be transferred to the ball). If so, is the amount of increased speed negligible? For example, if the clubhead was moving 100mph, what kind of shaft flex would be necessary to increase the speed of the clubhead to 105mph? Would it even be possible within human constraints? "
1851,Can a football team assign a HB or FB as passer and QB as Running Back?,"Is it legal within the NFL and NCAA rules that the main passer is assigned a halfback or fullback number on the team while the running back is assigned to the quarterback one? For example, could Tom Brady, a quarterback, be assigned the number 20, which is reserved for running backs (and defensive backs)? "
1852,"If a runner gets pushed back into their end zone and does not try to advance again, is it a safety?","If a runner gets forward progress out of their end zone but gets pushed back into their end zone and tackled, is he awarded with forward progress or is it a safety?   Example: Team A is on their own 2 yard line and the runner makes it to the 4 yard line before getting pushed back into their end zone.  That runner did not try to re-establish the run and was tackled in their end zone. Is that a safety?   "
1853,Why does FIFA have so much authority over the entire sport of football?,"With respect to all of the recent headlines regarding FIFA, Sepp Blatter, and corruption, there are several aspects that don't make sense to me.  For instance:   Why does FIFA have the power to conduct trials, issue fines and bans, and otherwise exercise powers that are generally reserved for the judiciary branch of a sovereign government, and from whence does this power over private individuals derive? How can FIFA ban someone from an entire sport? What does being banned from an entire sport even mean? If there's such corruption in FIFA, why do football teams allow FIFA to have so much influence over their sport in the first place instead of just looking elsewhere and/or doing their own thing? Who gave FIFA control of all of football in the first place? Why is nobody proposing a world where people continue playing football, without FIFA?  That seems like such an obvious solution to the corruption issue to me, but I'm guessing in actual fact it's not?   Can someone shed some light upon what's going on, and especially upon the background details about how/why FIFA wields so much influence over an entire sport (and continues to do so, despite such obvious corruption)?   "
1854,Are linemen required to use a 3-point-stance in American football?,"In American football, are linemen required to use a 3-point-stance?  If they wanted to, could they stand (without moving) next to the line of scrimmage before the snap?  Are there different requirements for offense and defense in regards to lineman stance?  Any differences between professional NFL football and college football? "
1855,80 as opposed to 100 pitches in training as a starting pitcher,"I was listening to Tom Verducci describe The Mets' Steven Matz and he said he usually only throws about 80 pitches. He then said he shouldn't throw a usual 100 or 110 like Harvey or deGrom. He said he wasn't ready yet.   So I ask, what does it take in the MLB to throw an extra 20 pitches? I understand the difference between a closer and starter, where you can't burn yourself out with just straight gas, but what does it actually take to throw an extra 20? Does it matter? "
1856,Why do NFL QBs spike the ball after penalty causes refs to call play dead?," QB snaps the ball Refs call penalty - off-sides, false start, or other line-related penalty Before or as refs blow whistle, QB drops back 2-4 steps After penalty called, QB spikes ball into the ground   Why do quarterbacks do this?  If they do this as a precaution in case there was no penalty, wouldn't they be flagged for intentional grounding?   Below is a link for intentional grounding as I understand it.  Intentional Grounding "
1857,What type of gas(if it is not air) is a soccer ball (football) filled with?,"In any FIFA World Cup or UEFA competition or the Barclays Premier League and other professional football matches, what type of air is the ball filled with?  Are there any regulations on the type of air used? "
1858,Division Tie Breaker - Common Games,"I understand the common games tie breaker between division teams but what if Team A has played Team C twice (one loss, one win) and Team B has played Team C only once and won? Would Team A's pct = .500 while Team B's pct = 1.000 ? Do I count both games for Team A or only one (and if so, which one?) Thanks! "
1859,How can footballers head or hit the ball so high?,"In football(soccer), we often see defenders heading the ball almost 25-30 yards, and seemingly light touches taking the ball very high. It's also said that the football is very light and hence is difficult to keep low while shooting. Why is that? Is the ball filled differently? Or are those balls made in a different way?  "
1860,"Football field: Defensive goal line ""plane"" is actually the back of the painted line?","In the NFL and presumably in most football leagues, the goal lines, yard lines, and hash marks are all four inches wide.   The hash marks/yard lines are  painted at 36-inch intervals; that is, they are 32 inches apart so that they mark exactly one yard each.   Easy enough.   However, doesn't this make the field between goal lines exactly 99 yards and 32 inches from goal line to goal line?  It is less than one hundred yards, right?   Since that cannot be,  I must conclude that the rear of the defensive goal line is the actual defensive goal line. Am I right?  Come to think of it, this would be consistent with how balls are spotted.   On a touchback, for example, the ball is spotted with the nose just kissing the back edge of the 20-yard line. Thus a ball spotted at the one-yard line would just kiss the painted hash mark, and so a ball spotted at the one-inch line would be three inches behind the front of the goal line, which we normally think of as ""in the end zone,"" but it must not be so.   I suppose it would only matter in the question of a loss of yards from scrimmage or a terrible kick return within four inches of the goal line.  If a ball carrier is down by contact with the nose of the ball spotted three inches behind the front plane of the defensive team's goal line, this must not be a safety/touchback, right? That is, the ball can be spotted for a play from scrimmage with its nose at three inches behind the front of the painted goal line (one inch from the back of the painted goal line), from which the offense would have to advance 99 yards and 35 inches for a touchdown.  Is this right?  "
1861,How valuable is winning the coin toss in test cricket?,"Often in international test cricket the captain that wins the toss chooses to bat first. This is largely because the pitches tend to deteriorate meaning batting becomes more difficult and going first is an advantage. I wonder though, how much of an advantage is it to win the toss?  What percentage of test matches end with the team that won the the toss winning the the match? (How does this compare to the percent won teams losing the toss, and matches drawn?)  What's the average run score for teams who win the toss and teams that loose the toss?  *I'm after figures for the team winning the toss, not the team batting first - occasionally the toss winning captain will choose to bat second! However, it would be interesting to compare the figures for times toss winners bat first and second too! "
1862,"How did Hideki Matsui's ""one day"" signing affect the Yankees' 40-man roster?","Hideki Matsui, a Japanese player, played for a Japanese baseball team, then the New York Yankees for several years, then several more U.S. teams. On July 28, 2013, he signed a final one day contract with the Yankees, in order to retire as a Yankee.  How, if at all, did that affect the Yankees' 40 man roster? 1) Did they pick a day when they had only 39 men because of injuries or other reasons, making Matsui the 40th for one day? 2) Is there a ""window"" of say, 24 hours whereby the Yankees could temporarily have 41 men, as long as Matsui leaves within that window? 3) Or did the Yankees actually have to make a roster move to accommodate Matsui. "
1863,Lane occupancy in swimming,"During a session of free swimming into italian public pool is good practice to occupy always the right side of the lane.   I do not know if it is related to the way of driving car.  In Country like UK, Australia and Japan, where you drive at the left, is there a common behaviour? Which side you tend to swim if you have to share the lane with other athletes? "
1864,Interchangeability of referees and assistant referees,"Some questions about interchangeability of referees and assistant referees:   Are referees exclusively referees and assistant referees exclusively assistant referees?  Can assistant referees officiate football games under normal or under some special circumstances, and vice-versa? Is there a difference in rules of how referees and assistant referees are chosen / appointed between countries or level of competition? Or is this governed by FIFA and standardized?   I'm asking this because I never saw an assistant referee in the role of the main referee or vice-versa. This obviously watching the top-level leagues only, so I might be missing something - let me know if that's the case. "
1865,Differences between referees and assistant referees,"Some questions about referees and assistant referees:   I assume there's a difference in knowledge / experience between these, correct? I.e. it's not just rolling a dice to decide which one is a referee or an assistant referee? Are they able to get promoted from being assistant referees to referees, similar to e.g. how an assistant professor can become a professor? Is it a different ""track"", analogous to e.g. doctors / nurses?   Mostly asking because I only see them in one role, so I was wondering why. "
1866,Dealing with tension and poor behaviour among teammates,"I am the captain of a quidditch team, ""muggle quidditch"" if you prefer, experiencing a few more or less regular issues with some of my players. We play a recent sport that puts together athletes from very different backgrounds, I believe this makes it in some ways comparable to youth leagues: while the average player is a college student, most teams don't have a coach, or the coach is just another player, or someone of similar age and experience as other players in the team. This lack of the typical authoritative figure exacerbates problems that are normally solved by the presence of the coach.  So for an example of the problematic ""types"" of players, I found myself with...   Experienced athletes who have played other competitive sports and have an ego problem. Experienced athletes who have occasional instinctive outbursts towards opponents and teammates, but otherwise fit in well. In other words, normal athletes. Less experienced athletes who may be more or less good, with some previous sports experiences - generally at amateur level - who overestimate their abilities. Unexperienced players at their first sporting experience.   I have found that:   on the field 1. and 2. don't mix well with 3. and 4.: the latter don't react well to the more experienced athletes' yelling, sometimes resulting in a buildup of tension, back and forth yelling, loss of concentration, in other cases loss of confidence on and off the field 1., 3. and 4. don't always react well to constructive criticism from teammates and respond either aggressively or by ignoring directions; in the case of 4. specifically, more often than not they'll make up excuses for not trying something, or after failing a first time, and lose confidence     How can I promote and insure a better cooperation for team members and minimize conflict among these different types of players? Is there any method normally used by coaches/captains? "
1867,How can I choose a type of golf ball to play with?,"Personally, I order Titleist Pro V1s and V1xs from eBay. They are great golf balls, in my opinion, without the cost of buying them out-of-the-box (MSRP: $62 USD). I'm not an expert golfer, but I have noticed a difference between inexpensive golf balls bought new at the store and Titleist Pro V1s and V1xs. Moreover, between the Golf Digest hot list (that spotlights different golf balls and is released annually) and this golf ball buying guide, different types of golf balls are constructed differently.  How can I choose a type of golf ball to play with? Is there a way to determine what type of golf ball is best suited for my game? (ie, if I can use improved performance around the greens, should I opt for a golf ball designed for feel? or if I can use improved performance off the tee, should I opt for a golf ball designed for distance? or should I opt for a golf ball that provides a blend of both feel and distance?) "
1868,How to change cross country ski bindings,"I bought used cross country skis that have SNS Pilot bindings on them, and I also bought NNN boots. What equipment do I need to swap the SNS bindings for NNN bindings? And how do I do it?  I've searched the web, and I found many results about how to mount bindings on new skis, but I couldn't find any instructions for swapping bindings on used skis.   In particular, if there is epoxy, do I need a solvent to release the epoxy? "
1869,why is 2/222 called Richie benaud score?,I came to know 2/222 is called Richie Benaud score. Why is it so? Does it have anything to do with his commentary? 
1870,Why do basketball players wipe their hands on their shoes?,"I see them do this all the time during basketball games, for some weird reason.  It seems so unsanitary, considering they're running all over the place and wiping their hands there. I thought maybe it's related to getting a grip on the ball? Or is it to get rid of sweat? "
1871,Greyhound Racing Descriptions,"When a greyhound race is described as A4 480m, what does that mean?  I guess the 480m means that it is a 480 metre race. But what does the A4 mean? Or if it is S2 or OR? "
1872,Linesman puts finger in the air after deking a face off,"I was watching the LA Kings vs San Jose Sharks game tonight and saw something I hadn't see or realized before.  There was a face-off in one of the defensive zones.  The referee fake the puck drop and the players came together, the referee in the neutral zone blew his whistle (I am assuming to indicate an infraction).  Instead of throwing a guy out of the face-off, the linesman held up his pointer finger indicating a ""1"" and showed it to the referee that blew the whistle.  The face-off went on as usual, but I hadn't seen that before.  My questions are:   Is this new? What does it mean? If it was an infraction, why wasn't a player thrown out of the face-off?  "
1873,"Sabermetrics Applied to American Football, Specifically the NFL","Sabermetrics and advanced stats have become a big part of baseball in the recent years.  Defensive shifts are growing rapidly.  ""Old School"" stats are becoming less relevant compare to ""New School"" stats.  This has trickled into the NBA, with the Houston Rockets starting to make organizational decisions based on advanced stats.  I know that there are advanced stats for football, but it seems that most teams play by the book still.  One difference between football and other sports is the spending and the market size.  There aren't any football teams that are referred to as small market and the salary cap rules keep most teams similar in spending.  In college, the spread offense has leveled the playing field some between power house schools and smaller schools, but the NFL is the collection of the best 2,000 (roughly) players.   Are there any teams, organizations that are applying a deeper level of sabermetrics to the game and personnel decisions? If advance analytics were used in football more, what would we expect to see? (I've seen that punting would become a thing of the past, more onside kicks, etc.)  "
1874,Is hiking the football required or just a good idea?,"In football, the ball starts at the line of scrimmage and from there is hiked back to the quarterback. Doing this creates room for the quarterback to make passing or running plays. Clearly hiking the ball is a good thing; but do the rules absolutely require it? Or, as bad an idea as it may be, could a team try to move the ball forwards directly from the line of scrimmage with out hiking it back first? "
1875,"Has any baseball team used a ""platoon"" for fifth starters?","A pitcher can be either left- or right handed, but the better ones pitch reasonably well to both left and right handed batters. When you get to the fifth starter on the roster, however, many teams are dealing with marginal throwers.  Some bating teams have relatively more of left-or right-handed batters. So use one pitcher against the one set of teams and the other pitcher against the other set of teams. Jeff Locke and Brandon Cumpton of Pittsburgh come to mind. One is a lefty and one is a righty.  Are there any teams that in fact, do this, because they have ""fifth"" starters on the roster who throw a lot better against either left- or right handed batters? Perhaps combined with another back end starter who has ""platoon"" splits the other way? Meaning that it would make sense to ""platoon"" a ""backend"" starter role so that the tandem may actually be better than a fifth starter? "
1876,What criteria determines which team makes the national college football championship playoffs?,"With the inaugural year of the college playoffs, what criteria/criterion determines who makes the national championship playoff?  Also, does it make a difference if you win your conference, etc.  I searched. And the closest answer was regarding the effect the college football playoff has on the bowls: What will happen to the current Bowl games when the playoff system commences? "
1877,Historic statistics,"I've noticed baseball announcers, during an at-bat, using information on lifetime at-bats for the specific batter-pitcher combination.  Have these statistics been extended into the past, to answer questions like:  ""What pitcher gave up the most home-runs to Babe Ruth?""  and  ""What pitcher-batter combination produced the most life-time home-runs?"" "
1878,Shoes and shirts after football matches?,"What is the destination of the football players' shoes and shirt after each official match? After the matches it is easy to view players exchanges eachother the shirts. Does they use a new shirts every match?  What about the shoes? I find comfortable to play with used shoes because they fit well to the feet, but I do not know about the football players "
1879,Can a pitcher throw a strike during an intentional walk?,"Intentional Walk  I know that there have been times where a pitcher has thrown a ball over the plate enough for a hitter to get a hit, and even hit a home run in some cases.  My question is more along the lines of:  If he throws one over the plate and in the strike zone, and the hitter does not swing, is it a strike?    Is there anything in the rule book saying that a catcher cannot deke the hitter by standing up and signaling for an intentional walk and then having the pitcher throw a strike?    This would be frowned upon as far as ""unwritten rules"" go, and someone would probably get hit by a pitch as a result.  I haven't seen it happen, but it could be a strategy against a good hitter in a big game (ie- playoffs, world series, etc). "
1880,Can a player rotate from the back line after the serve and become a blocker?,Can a player rotate from the back line after the serve and become a blocker? Or is the designation of backline player at the time of the serve? 
1881,"Walkoff homer, decisive run scores but following runner leaves base path","This question is a hypothetical based on the last play of Game 5 of the 2014 NLCS.  San Francisco batting in the bottom of the 9th, score tied 3-3, runners Arias at second and Belt at first, one out.  Batter Ishikawa hits a home run out of the playing field.  As Ishikawa trots around third, he is mobbed by his teammates from the dugout.  In the actual event, he pushed them out of the way to touch home plate, and the game ended with a score of 6-3.  But what if he had not?  I understand that a batter who hits a home run out of the playing field must touch all bases in order for the run to count, and if he fails to do so he can be called out on appeal at the missed base.  I also understand that if he leaves the base path he is out.  But in this case, the preceding runners Arias and Belt have already scored, so the game is apparently won anyway.  If Ishikawa had left the base path before touching home plate (but after Arias and Belt had scored), what would have happened?  My guess is he would be called out and the game would be over with a score of 5-3, but I can't find this addressed in the official MLB rules.  (Also, would Ishikawa be in the unusual position of being credited with a HR and 2 RBI but no R?)  A comment on Rule 7.08(a) discusses a related case: if the leading runner leaves the base path, he is out, and if he makes the third out, the trailing runner does not score and the game continues.  But it doesn't address what happens if the leading runner scores and then the trailing runner leaves the base path.  As another variation, what if Arias scores, and then Belt and Ishikawa both leave the base path?  If they are both out then that would make three out.  Does Arias's run count and end the game at 4-3, or does it not, and we go to the top of the 10th still tied 3-3? "
1882,Are you allowed unlimited challenges in a hockey game?,"In hockey, they often challenge penalty calls, goals, etc.  Sometimes a goal is called back, sometimes it's awarded. Are you allowed to challenge everything? Why don't they often challenge offside calls? What stops a coach challenging every call against his team, just in case it gets called back? "
1883,What is the lowest number of hits to lead a team for a major league baseball season?,"For a full major league baseball season, what player has led his team with the fewest number of hits?  If the season did not have 162 games, what is the answer for 162 game seasons? "
1884,"What does it mean that ""a group is open"" on the first pot of the CL group draw?","I know what a group being open means in the later parts of a group draw, normally teams of the same country cannot play in the same group. But I find it very peculiar on the first pot, in other words the first teams to be placed to groups some groups are not ""open"" to a club. Does that have anything to do with the game schedule Tue/Wed and TV viewership? So that for instance Real Madrid and Barcelona do not play the same day? Or is it a completely different story? "
1885,who serves after tiebreaker in doubles tennis,"In doubles tennis, who serves 1st after a tie breaker set? I realize who starts the tie break but who serves the first regular game after the tie break? "
1886,Waived/Injured for non-guaranteed contracts before the season starts,"If a player is injured in OTAs, minicamp, or training camp, and is waived/injured, is the team responsible for a negotiated amount of a non-guaranteed contract?   So, if a player has a $5m non-guaranteed contract and suffers an ACL before the season starts and is out for the year, does the team have to pay the full salary? If so, why would a team waive/injure instead of putting a player on injured reserve (IR) if they have an injury that knocks them out for the season? "
1887,How can a player have more points in race rankings than in the ATP world rankings?,"I have noticed that Rafael Nadal had more points in Race rankings than in world rankings in several recent editions of ATP rankings.   As far as I know, the race rankings are based on the tournaments from the current calendar year, whereas ATP world rankings are based on the tournaments from the last 52 weeks. So the latter includes longer period. How is it possible that a player has more points in the race rankings? Are there different rules for which tournaments are countable for these two rankings?  For example, as of August 19, 2013, Nadal had 9010 points in the race rankings and 8860 points in the world rankings. You can check this on Wikipedia (here and here or in the Race to London rankings and ATP rankings published on the ATP website.    When I check rankings breakdown on the ATP website then for the ATP Rankings I see (at this moment):    For Race to London I get the following:    So in this particular case, the difference seems to be that 150 points from the tournament in Viña del Mar in February 2013 are included in Race to London rankings, but not in ATP Rankings.  I do not know whether it is possible to somehow find ranking breakdowns from the past, but according to this blog post Vina del Mar was included on February 11th; but this was before the tournament in Sao Paolo. He had 5550 points on February 11th (after Vina del Mar) and 5755 points on February 18th (after Sao Paolo).  Maybe the rules about number of required ATP World Tour 500 series tournaments could explain this? According to Wikipedia: It is mandatory for leading players to enter at least four 500 events, including at least one after the US Open; if they play fewer than four, or fail to play in one after the US Open they get a ""zero"" score towards their world ranking for each one short. "
1888,Becoming a professional rock climber,I been looking online everywhere to see what level of climbing you have to be at to become a sponsored climber (sponsored enough to make it your profession).  I know there are a lucky few that get sponsored despite not being very good. I wonder however what ratings most athletes can climb when they become professional rock climbers. Is 5.13 enough to get sponsored by a certain company? If not then is 5.14 enough? Can you climb 5.14 and still not be able to find a sponsor? If so what does it depend on?   Is it harder to get sponsors as a person that only boulders?  
1889,Match lost because of Umpire's obstruction,"Imagine a situation where the batting team needs a boundary to win last ball.  If the batsman hits it straight where no fielder is present and it got obstructed by the umpire, what will be in favor of batsman? Has any match ended in such negative results for batting team, due to Umpire's obstruction of ball? Will it not be dead ball as umpire has wrongly obstructed the ball? "

1892,Why do long distance triathlon (ironman) races have the running course through paved roads?,"After looking through a number of ironman (*) running race courses, it seems all of them are laid out to run through cities, which implies paved/asphalt roads. Is that because this way it makes it easier (better) for spectators? Or is there another explanation? From my limited experience (hobby long distance runner/cyclist and occasional swimmer) it sure feels like it's much better to run on trails and dirt roads than on paved ones....  (*) I'm referring to the distances, not the brand "
1893,What do these tennis words mean?,"[website]1, does this mean he quickly goes back to the corners from the center to hit those attacks that land so close to the baseline?  2, dig up a drop shot ...does this mean he returns the shot? dig up is a tennis word?  3, starfishing for a high forehand...what does he mean by this?     He bounces the ball a million times before he serves. His play is   plasmatic. He seems to flow toward the corners of the court. He is   an origami man, folding at the waist to dig up a drop shot,   starfishing for a high forehand return, cocking his leg behind his head in an arabesque as he blasts a backhand down the line....  "
1894,"If the ball hits your opponent, do you get a point?","I saw this question: ""Can my body touch the table in table tennis?"", but I am wondering something far more sinister: if I hit my opponent with the ball, and it doesn't touch the table, do I get a point?  These are the rules: [website]"
1895,How does one get 5 points in a football game?,"During today's Niners vs Seahawks game, the score by the end of the first half was 0-5.  What I don't understand is how the Seahawks scored 5 points. My understanding of football is :   6 points for a touchdown  1 point for following field goal 2 points for following conversion  3 points for regular field goal   In no way can I see a possibility where 5 points would be the combination of any of above said criteria.  Am I thinking something wrong? How is it possible to have 5 points only? "
1896,When was the first tri-series for cricket held?,Tri-series is a series/tournament with three nations playing for the trophy.   When was the first international tri-series for cricket matches held? Which nations participated in it and who was the winner?  
1897,Can a pitcher also be a designated hitter?,"Suppose an American League Team ended up with a good-hitting pitcher e.g Yovani Gallardo, or from an earlier era, Ken Brett, who had established this reputation in the National League.  Could such a pitcher be a ""designated hitter"" (dh) for himself? If yes, could he continue to ""dh"" after being relieved as a pitcher? "
1898,"Ring of honor, pride of the lions in NFL","I heard that Ray Lewis will be inducted in the Ring of honor. Do all NFL teams have their own version of this ring of honor?  Besides special recognition, is there any other special rites as a member of this exclusive group?  "
1899,Number of gap techniques in American Football,"While reading this thread and this one I had trouble following the football terminology of the different ""techniques"" for defensive line men.   What does it mean to have a 1 / 2 / 3 / 5 gap technique defensive linemen?   What does that gap mean?  "
1900,What are the disadvantages of the wide nine defensive scheme?,"Correct me if i'm wrong I've read a little about a wide-nine defensive scheme. Trying to get an understanding of this.  From my understanding, a wide nine defensive philosophy depends on defensive ends advancing way beyond the line of scrimmage in order to contain the play between the defensive ends.   What disadvantages are there to this scheme / philosophy? What other factors does one have to depend on to make it effective? "
1901,Is running uphill harder or easier than running downhill?,"Which is harder, running uphill or running downhill?  I have done the Salt Lake City, Utah marathon and it has a huge chunk of descending.  I think circa 5000 feet vertical the route of the year I ran it.  I was surprised how much my quads hurt from catching myself on every downhill step.  I suppose if you trained for it, it would not be so bad.   But which is actually harder?  Uphill or downhill?  "
1902,What is the on-field role of the captain?,"After watching the John Terry ""stripped of captaincy"" episode in the England national football team, my question is what exactly does the captain do on the field?  The team tactics are decided by the manager, and the managers do pass on instructions during the game via the closest available player to the touchline/dugout.  What does the captain do on the field?  I assume off the field they can be providing strategic inputs and mentoring youngsters and so on "
1903,"What factors give a ""Home Advantage"" and how big is it?","Often you hear about the team whose ground the match is being played at having a ""home advantage"".  During a discussion with a friend they said teams go as far as to style the opposing teams changing room to play mind games; i.e. making the room layout hard for discussion, and the colour scheme being dull so as to lower any motivation.  Personally I thought this was a bit too far (sportsmanship anyone?), but I was curious as to what actually contributes to a home advantage?   Additionally, does anyone know of any studies/ statistics which can prove whether the home advantage is merely a myth, or is a real thing? "
1904,"How to decide the ""Par"" for each hole","How is the ""average number of strokes"" decided for each hole? While watching golf competitions, the majority of players are far below the par.    Shouldn't it then be adapted? If 90% of players are doing an eagle on a Par 5, why isn't it converted to a Par 3?  It should work as long as you don't try to compare from year to year if there has been a change in-between. "
1905,What advantages does a softer putter provide?,"I've seen soft putters advertised on disc-golf websites and in stores. What advantages does a soft flexible putter provide? I've heard that they ""grab the chains"" better but what does that actually mean. Is there a physics explanation or is this just all hype? "
1906,Are referees biased toward the home team?,"Inspired by this question but hopefully different enough to warrant a different question.  I often hear fans complaining that the ""home team always gets the calls"", which means that more fouls are called against the away team than the home team. This has been attributed to a number of things:    The emotion in the arena sways the officials The home team coaches have longer conversations with the referees before the beginning of the game, and they are instructed on what types of fouls to watch for. The referees, or the sideline replay officials, are natives of the home town and want their team to win. The referees are paid money to make calls for the home team.   First question is: Does the home team actually get more favorable calls from the officials? Statistical research would be nice.  Second question is: If the home team gets more calls, are any of these specific complaints (or others) valid or verifiable by research? "
1907,Gel packs: to use or not to use? When?,"I've heard that gel packs can help performance on long runs. How should I use them? How long of a run should I use them on, and how often during the run? Should I take them with water at a water station? "
1908,Pace strategy for Marathons,"Very short: what is the best pace strategy for a Marathon?  A little longer: usually when I participate in a race (10 km, 15 km or HM), I tend to run the first part of the race at a pace that is 5-10 seconds slower per km than my target pace. And then make up for that during the rest of the race.  But is that a good strategy for a Marathon as well? Or should you aim at the same pace throughout the race? "
1909,"In cricket, how is it decided from which end to start the match?","In cricket, how is it decided from which end to start the match? Is this a per-ground convention, a decision of the umpires, or either of the captains? Is each innings necessarily started from the same end? "
1910,"During a race, how often should I drink water?","I've run a number of races, and there are almost always a number of water stations. I don't usually stop for water on the short races, but I'm not sure how long of a race I should do that for - when should I start drinking water? How much and often should I drink it? "
1911,When does MLB use instant replay?,"I was inspired to ask this question given instant replay was mentioned in this thread: Why is FIFA against adding instant replay to the game?  For the 2012 season, has baseball changed any rules regarding instant replay?   Also, does the MLB use instant replay at all and in which cases do they use instant replay to review officiating? "
1912,How are individual turnovers determined on errant passes?,"When determining turnovers for a given player, how exactly are they determined? Wikipedia defines turnovers as     In basketball, a turnover occurs when a player from one team gives possession to a member of the opposing team by losing the ball. This can result from the ball being stolen, the player making mistakes such as stepping out or throwing the ball out of bounds, or committing a violation (such as traveling) or committing an offensive foul.   However, I'm not clear on what happens on errant passes. When a player in possession of the ball makes a pass that is immediately intercepted by a defender, then obviously the player who passed the ball is charged with a turnover. My question is what happens if the ball is tipped by the player that the ball was intended for before the defender gains possession of the ball? Who is charged with a turnover in that situation, the player who made the pass or the player who tipped the ball before the defender gained possession? Is it determined by who touched the ball last or the player who last had full possession of the ball? "
1913,Table Tennis exercises by yourself and without a table?,Is it possible to improve your table tennis skills by yourself without a table as well?   If so are there exercises that one could do to improve your table tennis skills by yourself? 
1914,Points are given in tennis 15-30-40. Why 40?,Tennis scoring goes 15-30-40-game. Why 40? Why not 45? What is the meaning of the points being given in tennis as 15-30-40-game? What is the history of this scoring calculation? 
1915,What is a good way to run during the winter?,"What is a good way to run during the winter in cold countries with snow? How can you maintain your training without having to run on a treadmill, which I don't enjoy? Should I look for other shoes and clothes that are more fitted for cold weather or should I try to find other things to do for a few months?  I've heard that it is bad for you and that you will more easily get sick if you run when it's cold due to the cold air in your lungs, is that true at all? If its in any way true, how late in the autumn should you stop running outside and how early in the spring should you continue running outside again? Somewhere around 0 degrees Celcius of before that, when it's warmer? "
1916,In NCAA Basketball what does it mean to be 1 and 1?,I'm a bit unfamiliar with foul rules. Correct me if my assumption is wrong. So a team has to give a certain number of fouls up a half before they're 1 and 1?  Does that mean each point or free throw is 1 point? 
1917,How does having a pacesetter help set a record?,"Often pacesetters are used to set the correct pace to help break a record.   For cyclists there is an obvious physical advantage in running in a group, as those in the middle/back of the group have less wind resistance. Is there a similar benefit for long-distance runners?   Or is the only benefit pschyological, by not having to worry about timing yourself?  Or is there another reason(s)? "
1918,Why is casual tennis scoring 5-30-40?,"This question asks why tennis is scored 15-30-40, and I'm very satisfied with the answer.  Points are given in tennis 15-30-40. Why 40?  Some players use 5-30-40 for scoring casual games. Where does the ""5"" come from? It seems silly to just save one syllable. Might as well call the points 1-2-3. "
1919,Why try in a match after your team is guaranteed to pass the group stage,"I was thinking about Group D (standings after two matches) in the world cup this year, and as it stands now, Croatia has a big lead:             W T L  pts goal-difference Croatia   2-0-0   6        +5   Nigeria   1-0-1   3         0   Argentina 0-1-1   1        -2 Iceland   0-1-1   1        -3   The next two matches are Nigeria vs Argentina and Iceland vs Croatia  In my mind, Croatia has very little to gain from winning their match. The only team that can tie them in points is Nigeria, but in their next match, Argentina will be playing to win (since they still have a chance to take second in the group), so Nigeria probably won't get the goals to take first in the group on a tie-break based on goal difference.   In my mind, the best strategy for Croatia here is to play to avoid injuries and cards so that all of the players start the knockout phase fresh, even if that means benching the key starters and losing the match.   Is there anything that prevents Croatia from using this strategy, or is this common in the World Cup?  "
1920,Are there official rules and formats for small side soccer football without goalkeeper?,"I would like to know are there any official, possibly FIFA, formats and rules of soccer football match that could play without goalkeeper and has each team member on field more than 4 but less than 9 player  What is the dimension of the field? How the size and shape of the goal should be? How the rules differ from 11v11? Are there any special rules given for the lack of goalkeeper? "
1921,How does the Western States 100 choose the qualifying time for 100Ks?,The Western States 100 race has a qualifying cutoff time for its 100K qualifying races ([website]
1922,Probabilities of winning as a function of sets played,"In tennis, what are the probabilities of winning a player has as a function of sets played? Examples:   1-0 in a 3 set game 2-1 in a 5 set game   However, if you include psychology (such as winning the last set may give you an edge) and conditional probabilities (the best player may have a better chance of winning the second set than the first) the state is a bit more detailed. Examples:   Player A won the first set in a 3 set game AB in a 3 set game AABB in a 5 set game etc   Do you know (a subset of) these statistics? "
1923,What makes a defensive foul in basketball,I am trying to understand what a defensive foul is. What is the defender allowed to do? Can they not block the offensive player's path with their body? Looking at these videos it seems that the only thing the defensive player can do is to stand in the way of the offensive player without moving? Or can they move only away from the offensive player?  Any good videos showing what is allowed/disallowed are also appreciated. 
1924,What is the upside in allowing players to argue with referees in football?,"In football, players often argue with the referees.  What is the upside in allowing players to argue with referees in football? What are the incentives, for whoever makes the rules, to continue to allow this in the game? "
1925,"Can a football team force its defeat, e.g. via own goals?","On Thursday at 2pm GMT, the football matches for group H of the World Cup 2018 will begin. By 4 pm GMT, the fate of that group will be decided.   Let us assume that Japan comes first and Colombia comes second (not an unlikely outcome, actually), both hence qualifying for the second round. Now, at 6pm GMT, the matches of group G begin. Belgium and England are already qualified for the next round, but they play against each other in order to decide who goes first, and thus, to decide whom are they to play in the next round.   Now, under the reasonable assumption that Colombia is a better team than Japan (which is the case in terms of both Fifa ranking and world cup experience), you would expect Belgium and England would like to play Japan in the next round. Not only this, but coming second of the group will mean avoiding Brasil, Argentina, Uruguay, Portugal, and/or France in the next rounds up to the final. In the other side of the qualifications, the only big teams are Spain and Croatia. As such, there is a huge incentive for Belgium and England to come second of the group.   Now, the only certain way for a team to come second is to lose the match (they are tied in everything else, and qualifying position might depend on a Fair Play ranking, which changes during their match anyway).   This scenario is quite strange. It is not that both directly benefit (and thus put effort) in a draw, but quite the opposite: they benefit from a defeat! Thus, you could imagine both putting no effort, or playing only with substitutes, or even, if they remain in a tie, to score an own-goal in the last minute of extra-time! I would imagine that all this is perfectly legal, but is it? Can a team be investigated for this behaviour? Presumably, football rules are tailored to foster competitive behaviour, i.e. to foster a win. Perhaps there are rules against evident own-goals to induce defeat? "
1926,Why FIFA didn't prevent the potential cheating that may arise when the lasts of group matches are not played simultaneously?,"Referring to the question here, the first and second paragraph.      On Thursday at 2pm GMT, the football matches for group H of the World Cup 2018 will begin. By 4 pm GMT, the fate of that group will   be decided.      Let us assume that Japan comes first and Colombia comes second (not an   unlikely outcome, actually), both hence qualifying for the second   round. Now, at 6pm GMT, the matches of group G begin. Belgium and   England are already qualified for the next round, but they play   against each other in order to decide who goes first, and thus, to   decide whom are they to play in the next round.   The problem with this arrangement, as mentioned in the question, is that England and Belgium can be unsportsmanlike in order to receive a more favorable opponent in the next round.  I know that the teams involved in unsportsmanlike behavior can be investigated and punished, but still, why FIFA not just decided to start all four matches simultaneously? This would reduce the possibility of deliberate losing.  Another alternative solution is that FIFA can consider to let all the qualifying teams to draw the lots again after all group matches complete, so that no one can ""choose the opponent"", why this is not done? "
1927,Can a car that retired join back the race?,"Just saw this on the F1 facebook page  [website]It talks about an old austrian grand prix, where it took 3 starts to get under way. The 3rd one being almost 2 hours after the first one.  So it made me wonder, if somebody that had a minor crash on the first launch, decided to retire because the car wouldn't be ready for the 2nd start, but then, when they saw it would take a while before the race starts again repaired the car in time for the 3rd start, would they be able to?  Or is a Retired status definitive for the grand prix? "
1928,What are the lowest points scored by the top 2 seeds of a World Cup team in the group stage?,"Spain and Portugal advanced to the knockout stage of from group B of the 2018 World Cup. They scored 5 points each while Iran and Morocco earned 4 and 1 points respectively.   5 points is the fewest number of points I can recall that the top seed of a group earned to advanced to the knockout round of the World Cup. The only other time I recall this is when Sweden, England, Argentina, and Nigeria scored also 5-5-4-1 points in 2002.  Since the introduction of the current format where 4 teams in a group play round robin games with winners earning 3 points, what are the top 5 lowest point total of the top seed in the history of the world cup? Similarly what is the lowest point total of the top 2 seeds in a group? "
1929,In which match did Djokovic successfully challenge a call but give away the point?,"In which match did the following happen? (I can't for the life of me find it.)  Djokovic hit a backhand hard crosscourt from inside the service box, approximately on the left tramline. Nadal was right on the baseline, guessed correctly which way Djokovic was going and hit a trademark Rafa forehand down the line for a winner (Djokovic was nowhere near, since he was in the left service box, but the forehand went deep down the opposite tramline).  However, the ball was called out on Rafa's baseline. Djokovic challenged, only for it to be shown to be in; Rafa was suitably annoyed, given that he'd hit a clear winner. The call didn't really affect Nadal either, since Nadal basically half-volleyed it. Djokovic, very sportingly, gifts the point to Nadal, saying that indeed Nadal hit the ball for a winner.  This is the most pointless challenge I've ever seen: challenge; be right; give away point. (Maybe Djokovic instinctively challenged? then realised Nadal had won the point anyway.)  I'm pretty sure it was French Open, maybe 2012 or 2013. But I can't find it! "
1930,Why data-driven approach to soccer is slow to catch on?,"A lot of Baseball teams are using data-driven approach and computer modelling to help them better succeed in games. The most famous example being Billy Beane of Oakland Athletics (2001-2003), popularized by the film Moneyball.   My question is why soccer or football is very slow to warm up to this approach?  In an interview Billy Beane said that :     “It’s a very dynamic sport. Baseball is very stop-start and it lends   itself to measurement, but on the flip side there are a lot more   events going on during a football match than there are in a baseball   game - and anybody who is well versed in modelling, whether from a   computer science background or a mathematics background, will tell you   the more data you have, the better you are able to put the models   together.      “So it may be different and there’s certainly a correlation of an   interaction between players that may not exist in baseball – but there   are a lot of events, and the more events you have the better you   should be at predicting things.”   I've no idea what these words mean. On one moment he said that football has a lot more events, and on the other moment he said that the more data the better for data driven approach. So I guess more events should lead to more data which means that football should be amenable to data-driven approach, right?  In addition to whatever he was saying, is there any other reasons why football is slower to warm up to data-driven approach?  Edit: the question How are football players are objectively rated is related, but not necessarily a duplicate as suggested. Reason being, data-driven approach is not necessarily limited to sports where individual players can be objectively rated. In fact football is a collective sport where individual talents are less important than team dynamics. I can easily imagine that we find other team-related metrics, as opposed to individual metrics, that are more amenable to data-driven analysis.   So no, it's not a duplicate at all.  "
1931,Why did Manuel Neuer leave the goal post and come to the midfield position in group qualifiers?,"In the do or die match between Germany and South Korea in 2018 FIFA World Cup group stage, after conceding one goal, the German goalkeeper came forward to attack, leaving the goal post empty. Due to this, Korea scored an easy goal. Why did Neuer do this? Has he done anything like this in the past successfully? "
1932,How can a completed match become a walkover?,"During yesterday 2018 World Cup's match between Panama and Tunisia, a Polish-speaking sport commentator said that one of these countries (didn't hear exactly which one) had a football match with Cape Verde team which they lost and which was later ruled out as a walkover.  How can an already played match, lost by one of teams, later be declared walkover?  So far (up until yesterday) I was more than sure that a walkover can only happen when -- as name suggests -- one of the teams don't even show up to play the game.  Side question: About exactly which match Polish commentator was talking about? "
1933,"Have two bottom seeds ever faced off before in a ""World Series?""","In October 2014, the San Francisco Giants and the Kansas City Royals ""faced off"" in the baseball World Series. They were both wild cards in their respective leagues, meaning that this will be a match between two bottom seeds (after the wild card round).  A few years ago, I pointed out this almost (but didn't) happen in football, but would have happened if the New York Jets had beaten the Pittsburgh Steelers for the AFC crown, and gone on to face the Green Bay Packers.  Is this the first time that this has happened in the World Series during the wildcard era? Has this happened before in any other sport such as football that also has wildcards? "

1935,UEFA Champions League fixture with the most goals ever,"Tonight, too many goals were scored. In four games six or more goals were scored. 21 goals had been scored only in the first half of just 8 games. And there are another 8 games tomorrow.   In every Champions League fixture the games are always played in two days. I am wondering if there is a group stage fixture with more than 40 goals in a single night? If no, which is the second one in the list? And which are the best-ever scoring group stage fixtures for both nights? "

1937,NFL Play for Ineligible Player,"Has there ever been a play in the NFL that is designed for an ineligible offensive player to at some point receive the ball?  Examples from college include the fumblerooski (now banned in college too, and illegal in the NFL since the Holy Roller rule I believe) and the more recent tackle hook and lateral from Fresno St. ([website]Note that I do not mean a player who usually plays an ineligible position reporting as eligible and lining up and behaving as an eligible player for a play; I mean someone who lines up ineligibly on that play as one of the five interior linemen and then receives the ball intentionally (so no non-intentional fumbles or balls hit in the air by the defense and caught by an offensive lineman).  Plays from the AFL, AAFC, CFL, or other professional leagues are welcome if you have them, but mostly interested in the NFL. "
1938,What was format of tennis year-end championships in the past?,"I wonder how the rules and format of the year-end championship in the ATP tour and WTA tour evolved.  For example I notice that in 1985 men played knock-out tournament, whereas in 1986 the semifinalist were decided in round-robin. I see a similar change between 2002 and 2003 women tournament. The first men's masters tournament in 1970 involved only 6 players playing round-robin. In 1984-1998 women played best-of-five, while in other editions they played best-of-three.  What were the changes of the format of this competition in the past? (How did the number of contestant change? Which tournaments included round robin? In which editions only round-robin/only knock-out tournament?)    NOTE: I see that for men's this is basically answered by the Wikipedia article I am linking to. (Well, unless there were some other changes of rules which are not mentioned on Wikipedia.) I quote from the current revision of the article     Eight players are divided into two groups of four and play three round-robin matches each against the other players in their group. The two players with the best records in each group progress to the semifinals, with the winners meeting in the final to determine the champion.       The current round robin format of two groups of four players progressing to a semifinal and final, has been in place for all editions of the tournament except the following years:      1970, 1971 - Round robin with no semifinals or finals, winner decided on best performed player      1982, 1983, 1984 - 12 player knock-out tournament with no round robin. The top four seeds in the event received a bye in the first round.      1985 - 16 player knock-out tournament with no round robin   However in the current revision of the Wikipedia article about women's finals I see only this short mention about the format of the tournament:      The month, city and number of players has changed since the first edition in 1972. Since 2003 there have been eight singles players divided into two round robin groups, and four doubles teams.   It does not say how the format/number of players changed before 2003 "
1939,Can all penalties be declined in American Football?,"I saw some highlights from an NFL game the other day (I think it was Detroit's 22-21 comeback win against Atlanta) and the presenter said they won the game with a field goal.  Their first attempt at scoring the field goal was wide, however there was a flag on the field, due to an offensive foul (delay of game) and they would replay the down with a 5 yard penalty. Of course they then had another attempt at the field goal and scored it.  Now, I know it is possible (only in certain situations?) to decline a penalty in the NFL, so since it's an offensive penalty, why couldn't the Falcons decline this penalty, counting the missed field goal as a failed attempt and ending the game? "
1940,"Why do players and some parent coaches tell the pitcher ""you are only just a pitcher,you're not really a baseball player""?","I was very surprised by a comment from an assistant coach in charge of the pitchers. First night for my son in a new club, first night of trials for division 1. The group of pitchers were told ""Pitchers are no body's, all you know how to do is pitch"". Now the catchers say the same. Is there a real resentment towards pitchers? Some one has to do it. From what I have seen of this years World Series 2014 thank goodness for Madison Bumgarner. Should my son expect this as he goes further? He is in the U17's, is this normal? "
1941,sports odds explanation for NFL,"I'm looking at sports odds at for the first time and am a little confused.  I understands that if ATS (against the spread) is negative, then the home team is predicted to win. Also, SP (spread) predicts the total point value difference.  However, I'm looking at the favorites column in a spreadsheet and I see ""Home Favorite,"" ""Away Dog,"" ""Away Favorite,"" and ""Home Dog"" as options.  Doesn't ""Home Favorite"" = ""Away Dog""?   Also, what exactly is the definition of ATS vs SP? "
1942,Can you hold a tabletennis paddle with two hands?,"By ITTF regulation, is it legal to hold a paddle with two hands?   On one serve, someone managed to return by using his normal hand with the addition of his other to stabilize the paddle better. Is that legal?  In ITTF guidelines it says      2.5.5 The racket hand is the hand carrying the racket.      2.5.6 The free hand is the hand not carrying the racket; the free arm is the arm of the free hand.      2.5.7 A player strikes the ball if he or she touches it in play with his or her racket held in the hand, or with his or her racket hand below the wrist.    However it fails to say that both hands can't be the racket hand.  "
1943,Is a top prospect usually called up at the beginning or middle of the season?,"When it is known before the season starts that the team's top prospect will be called up that year, does it usually happen for Opening Day, or do they get the call later in the year?  Also, are there different statistics regarding pitchers vs. position players? "
1944,Will the ATP Year End No. 1 be awarded after the ATP World Tour Finals or the Davis Cup finals?,"Currently, in the ATP rankings, Roger Federer is, effectively, just 490 points behind Novak Djokovic with two tournaments, namely ATP Masters 1000 Paris &amp; the ATP World Tour Finals.     Federer, to become No. 1, needs to finish ahead/beat Djokovic in both the tournaments. But if it so happens that Federer falls just short of Djokovic by say 200 points, Djokovic will be awarded the Year End World No. 1. But there is a catch here.     Federer still has to play the Davis cup final later in November &amp; ATP ranking points are awarded to the players for winning Davis cup ties, the breakdown of which is here.     So if Federer wins 250 points through Davis cup, he will effectively overtake Djokovic &amp; lead the rankings by 50 points. But will he be then crowned the Year End No 1 after the Davis cup finals? Or those ranking points will be considered for next year?  "
1945,Why do female footballers play a higher number of international matches compared to a male footballer?,"I see female footballers who have played over 300 international games and several who have more than 200 caps. A sample of the top scorers in women's football:  Player, Caps   Abby Wambach, 228 Mia Hamm, 275 Christine Sinclair, 211 Kristine Lilly, 352 Birgit Prinz, 214   The corresponding record holder for men's football is Ahmed Hassan with a comparatively paltry 184. Is there a reason for this difference?  I wondered if it was because the men's football calendar is packed with league fixtures leaving very little room for international matches. But, I believe England and several other countries have professional leagues for women footballers too. So, is there some other reason for the discrepancy? "
1946,What does it mean to rebuild a team?,"I've heard a lot of people say (insert American sports team) needs a rebuild. It's usually said when a team is on a bad run or has one or two bad season, and I've only ever heard people say it regarding American sports such as ice hockey or basketball.  I would take it to mean something like getting rid of all of the players and replacing them, but that just doesn't seem feasible or like anything a team would ever do. I guessed it could also mean getting rid of all of the old players, and replacing them with kids? Or changing which players play on which lines and who plays with who, but don't coaches do that every game anyway? "
1947,Is Greyhound Racing Seasonal?,"Is greyhound racing seasonal?  For example, are there more races in the winter than the summer? "
1948,Pre intense soccer game preparation strategies,"I have an intense soccer game coming on this Sunday, it's now Monday in my time and I have around 6 days to prepare for the game. A couple of things about my current situation which I need your advice on how to best get my body ready:   I do jog and the last time I jog was 4 days ago. My last soccer game was 3 weeks ago. That means I'm not in the best condition for the game unless I start some simple training for myself now. There's no game + training from now until that day (Sunday). I'm generally fit.   Now, what I'm trying to do is to best use this 5-6 days period to improve my chance of having a good performance. What would you advice me to do? Which strategies should I use? Any good diet advice?  Thanks in advance. "
1949,Can a ball change status (fair/foul) once it hit the ground?,"In baseball, if a hit ball lands just inside the foul line (fair), but then bounces out (foul), what is it ruled as?  The flip case: if a ball lands foul, but it hits a patch of grass or whatever and bounces fair, what it is? "
1950,How do bookmakers get the lines so close on sports betting?,"How is it that a bookmaker can offer a basketball game with say a +10.5 handicap on Team A, and the game finishes 110-100 or 101-90?  The same thing seems to happen with the point total, they'll set the line at over/under 198.5 and it often finishes 100-98 or 100-99  How would you even start to calculate what the final total or point difference will be? "
1951,NFL betting odds during game?,"I have a couple basic questions about NFL betting.  1) Are betting odds set in stone before the game begins, or do they evolve with the progression of the game?  2) What are ""closing odds?""  Are closing odds made during the game, or before it?  Thanks! "
1952,"Are suspensions for red cards, yellow cards carried between junior and senior UEFA competitions?","If I understand the rules correctly, whenever a player receives red card, he is suspended for the next match. The same is true for 3 yellow cards. See, for example, here.  I would like to know what happens in the situation illustrated in the following example.  During the match in U-21 Euro qualifying play-offs Slovak midfielder Ondrej Duda was sent-off, see here or here. As of this moment, this was his last match for national team, see for example his profile on soccerway.  He was recently called up for the next fixture of the Slovak team in the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying against Macedonia. (Here is a source in Slovak language.)  These are two different competitions, but both of them are organized by UEFA. I wonder whether he should be suspended in the senior team 's game or whether the suspensions are counted separately for senior and junior events. (Or, more generally, for various competitions.)  Even if the suspensions are not considered separately, another factor here might be that the U-21 qualifying tournament is already completed.     TL;DR: If a player receives a suspension in U-21 competition, can he still play for senior's team? Is there a difference if the junior competition, where the player received suspension, is already completed?  "
1953,When can you lift your pivot foot and go for a shot?,"I was called for a travel in just a pick up game a couple months ago. I was also reading on Wikipedia information about the travel rule about the situation and it seems that there are conflicting rules.  There are 3 scenarios I need to consider.   Scenario 1:  Staggered landing, with a pivot foot, after receiving the ball for the first time.  Question:  Can you lift your pivot foot (using your other foot to jump off obviously) to try to shoot the basketball OR pass the ball? I'm aware that you cannot lift your pivot foot before ""releasing the ball to start a dribble"".   I know that if you have gathered the ball into a staggered landing, AFTER dribbling, you can go for a shot/pass while lifting your pivot foot and your non pivot foot still on the ground. But the difference here is that you have not dribbled at all after first receiving the ball.    Scenario 2:  ""True Jump Stop"" where you have received the ball on 1 foot, then jumped and landed on 2 feet. In this case   Question:  I know that you cannot lift either foot, before ""releasing the ball to start the dribble"". HOWEVER If you were to go for a shot, I'm pretty sure you could jump off both feet in this case, and go for a jump shot. BUT are you able to lift just 1 foot, before the other, the other then goes into the air then go for a shot, OR lift just 1 foot while the other is still on the ground then go for a shot?   Scenario 3:  ""True Jump Stop"" where you have already dribbled, you gather the ball on 1 foot, then jump and land on both feet simultaneously.   Question:  Similar to the question in scenario 2. Are you able go for a shot by lifting 1 foot off the ground followed by the other? Or go for a shot by lifting 1 foot, and keep the other foot ON the ground?    The confusion all arises after I read this quote on Wikipedia for FIBA traveling rules:     First, there is no paragraph 4.a of Section 72. Therefore, it is a violation if the player, after coming to a stop and establishing the pivot foot, lifts it before the other foot without a dribble.  "
1954,What are the advantages/disadvantages of the triangle formation?,"Based on limited research that I've done recently, it seems that the triangle formation is an attacking formation used primarily by midfielders to advance the ball by forming a rotating triangle pattern on the field and exploiting the many passing lanes that it can create in the defense. Is this understanding correct?  What kinds of things are important when trying to execute the triangle? (good passing, good dribbling, fast, disciplined, etc...)  What formations or techniques do coaches and players use to stop teams that rely heavily on the triangle? "
1955,How does a sport become an Olympic Sport?,How does a sport transition into the Olympics?  What are the qualifications?  Is there a process? 
1956,How is the slashing rule enforced in hockey?,"From the NHL rulebook:     61.1 Slashing - Slashing is the act of a player swinging his stick at an opponent, whether contact is made or not. Non-aggressive stick   contact to the pant or front of the shin pads, should not be penalized   as slashing. Any forceful or powerful chop with the stick on an   opponent’s body, the opponent’s stick, or on or near the opponent’s   hands that, in the judgment of the Referee, is not an attempt to play   the puck, shall be penalized as slashing.   From my interpretations of the rule above, slashing seems somewhat subjective - it depends on whether the referee feels that a player was attempting to play the puck.   Assuming that a player is playing the puck, will hockey referees ignore any contact to an opponent, even if the chop is aggressive or forceful? How much does the rule's intent to reduce injury risk affect these types of calls? "
1957,Why the limit on manager mound visits?,"I recall that Don Mattingly was forced to remove his pitcher due to two mound meetings in an inning. I've read articles that indicate that a limit was placed on manager-led mound meetings to speed up the game.  The MLB rule reference (8.06):     8.06 A professional league shall adopt the following rule pertaining to the visit of the manager or coach to the pitcher:       (a) This rule   limits the number of trips a manager or coach may make to any one   pitcher in any one inning;       (b) A second trip to the same pitcher in   the same inning will cause this pitcher's automatic removal;       (c) The   manager or coach is prohibited from making a second visit to the mound   while the same batter is at bat, but       (d) if a pinch-hitter is   substituted for this batter, the manager or coach may make a second   visit to the mound, but must remove the pitcher. A manager or coach is   considered to have concluded his visit to the mound when he leaves the   18-foot circle surrounding the pitcher's rubber.   Are there any historical reasons that caused this rule to be put in place? "
1958,Should players in the wall jump to defend a free kick?,"Sometimes all players in the wall will jump to prevent the ball being kicked over the wall. This then leaves a gap at the bottom, through which a low shot can pass, and through which Ronaldinho scored in a match for Barcelona against Werder Bremen.   What is the best option for the defending team? Jump or stand still? Does it depend on the distance from goal or the height of the players?  "
1959,"""53 has the Mic"" means what in American Football?","I frequently hear quarterbacks say something like ""53 has the mic"" when pointing out the defensive formation. Usually the player number that he points out is a linebacker.   I believe the defensive player that the quarterback points out has the microphone that connects to the defensive coordinator, but what does that signal to the rest of the offense? Is that player covering, or is there some other job that comes with ""having the mic""? "
1960,Why so many boxing organizations and their differences?,"I came across a quite impressive list of boxing organizations (link to a French Wikipedia page without its English version). Why do so many organizations exist? WBA, WBO, WBC, IBF, IBC, IBO, etc. (Choose a 3 or 4 letter acronym having a B and you have a good chance of finding one of their names).  It seems they all run in parallel, with their own title holders, but we can also see boxers being able to get belts from different organizations, like for example Jermain Taylor unifying (think it's the right term) the WBA, WBC, WBO and IBF titles.    So, how are all those organizations related? Does a boxer have to choose an organization in the list before fighting? How does all of this work? "
1961,"What does ""open divisions"" mean in a USTA tournament?","Most (adult) tournaments I've entered have divisions indicated by NTRP level - i.e. MW(3.0, 4.0) means that men and women who are rated 3.0 or 4.0 can enter. Some of them, though, are listed as MWOp.   What does ""open"" mean? Does it just mean that people of any rating can enter, but they would be matched up (at least in early rounds) with players who have similar ratings, or does it mean that it's a free-for-all, where the tournament director could match up a 2.5 player with a 5.0 player? "
1962,What is the role of the Captain on the (american) football field?,"After reading this post about soccer or football (for europeans), What is the on-field role of the captain? i was curious about this issue in american football.   What is the role of the football captain(s) besides the coin toss?   Also, how many captains are there on the football (american) team? Is there one captain per team (special teams, defense, offense)? "
1963,Forefoot landing at certain pace,"I have run several with traditional heel landings. Then I started experimenting with a more forefoot strike. In the beginning I did it all wrong and my legs was on the edge of getting a bone membran inflammation.  But I didn't give up and now I feel I have a more natural forefoot strike. I am still stribing for better technique and I wonder at what pace should a typical forefoot strike be effective?  I know that running slowly, like 10-11 kmh the forefoot strike feels a bit unnatural to me. When I run 15-16 kmh the forefoot strike comes natural to me now.  But my marathon pace is around 12 kmh, and I don't know if I should go for a forefoot strike in that kind of race? "
1964,Which Marathons to run?,"For many years, one of my major ""running"" dreams have been to run the New York Marathon - the bridges, the people and the grand background. But I recently found out that the ""qualifying time standards"" for the run has been changed, so there are really no chance for me going there...  The question is then, which Marathons I should aim at if not New York? What are the great Marathons out there that one must do if possible?  Like the almost impossible ones such as Marathon des Sables or the Antarctic Ice Marathon? Or the big city venues in London, Chicago, Berlin, or whereever? Or the beautiful ones like Jungfrau and The Great Wall?  I'm looking for recommendations for Marathons from people that have first hand experience with these.  I'm looking for scenery and routes that doesn't include too many hills (Being from Denmark - flat, flat, flat - I'm just very bad with hills :-)). I prefer the venues to be well-organized with a stable history... And nothing that requires qualifying times less than 3:30...  Until now I have just run many local runs - mainly half-Marathons - and there are many as this list shows - but now I would like to ""try"" something else.  I can find many lists with Marathons on the web... Too many really... It makes it so very difficult to choose. "
1965,Skip a media timeout in NCAA basketball?,"In NCAA basketball, there are media timeouts at the first whistle after the 16:00, 12:00, 8:00 and 4:00 minute marks of each half.  What happens if there is no whistle from the four minute mark until the half-time or final buzzer? It almost happened in this game here:  MISSED 3 PTR by Jones, Johnathon                00:09 REBOUND (OFF) by (TEAM)                         00:09 TIMEOUT MEDIA                                   00:08 GOOD!

1966,Do high ranked players need wild card to play a Challenger tournament?,I have noticed that Benoit Paire plays this week challenger tournament in Sophia Antipolis and he is listed among players who received wildcard. Paire is currently No. 40 in ATP rankings.  Does a player from top 50 need a wildcard in order to play in a challenger tournament? Are there some other restrictions which could prevent players which are high in ATP rankings from playing ATP Challenger Tour? 
1967,Why are there wildcards for players which could get direct entry into a tournament?,"I have noticed that occasionally some players enter tournament via wild card, despite the fact that they have sufficient ranking for direct entry into tournament, sometimes even to be seeded. To list a few examples:   The top seed of 2017 Acapulco Novak Djokovic. The top seed of 2017 Barcelona Open Andy Murray. The top seed and winner of 2016 Moscow Svetlana Kuznetsova. My impression is that this happens more often at challenger level, for example Martin Kližan at 2016 Poprad-Tatry or Denis Kudla at 2016 Savannah.   Why do players with high ranking actually need wild card? Is it only in cases of late entry? "
1968,Drawing knockout(single elimination) fixtures,"Okay so everyone, how can I draw a knockout fixture of matches of 24 teams? As the number of teams are even so there has to be no bye given. Also I do not require any seeding. Can someone please come with any ideas?  "
1969,Choosing a boxing weight class,"Boxers compete within weight classes that specify the range within which a boxer's body-weight may lie. But boxers (particularly those close to a weight class boundary) can presumably increase or decrease their weight to fall in at least two different classes.  My question has the following parts:   what principles do a boxer/trainer use to determine which weight class to aim for? Do boxers tend to aim to loose weight and make the class below, or beef-up to enter the higher weight class? what is the rationale behind this?  "
1970,Is the runner hit by the ball out or safe?,"Here is the situation we experienced in Little League baseball:   The bases are loaded and the batter hits the ball down the third base line.  All the base runners advance and score. But as the batter is reaching home plate, the outfielder throws the ball and it bounces off the ground and hits the batter in the leg.   They called the batter out. Why??? "
1971,How extrordinary is it to win a 400 meter race from lane 8?,"Looking back at Rio 2016, how great was Wayde van Niekerks win in the 400m sprint? Not only running the fastest time ever but doing it from lane 8? How much more extraordinary is the feat seeing as it came from such a lane? "
1972,Is there another way of keeping score for our Golf group?,"I play with the same people five days a week in a private Golf club. We play two better balls of a foursome, one in a threesome, paying Front, Back &amp; Overall. The same few people get most of the points every day, yet they post their scores faithfully every day . Obviously the GHIN System isn't working for us. Is there any other way of knowing a player potential? Is there another way of keeping score for our Golf group? "
1973,Traded right before the All Star Game?,"So let's say, for the sake of the question, that the player being traded is Clayton Kershaw.    Situation:  Kershaw is selected as the NL's starter in the All Star Game.  Couple of days before the All Star Game, the Dodgers shock the nation and trade Kershaw to the Yankees.    Question:  Does Kershaw still start for the NL?  Does he start for the AL?  Does he not start, but still play for the AL?  What happens in this situation, in terms of him and his All Star Status? "
1974,Has any player on the Edmonton Oilers roster (16-17 season) played a postseason game as an Oiler before this season?,"The Edmonton Oilers advanced the NHL playoffs this season (2016-17) for the first time since the 05-06 season when they reached the Stanley Cup Final. So given the 11 year hiatus, I'm wondering if there are any current Oilers who also played for them the last time they made the playoffs?  Or equivalently, are there any players on the Oilers roster who have played in the playoffs for the Oilers before? "
1975,Are transgender people allowed to play tennis on the WTA/ATP tour?,"Are transgender people allowed to play tennis on the WTA &amp; ATP tours as their non-original gender? I know that Renee Richards was the first one to play at a Grand Slam, about 20 years ago.   Does the rulebook accept deny entry currently for people who have changed sex? Are the rules different on ITF &amp; ATP/WTA circuit?  I know this question can be asked of any sport, but I am restricting it to tennis only. "
1976,What is the difference between illegal substitution and too many men on ice in the NHL?,"During the Montreal Canadiens vs New York Rangers game on April 16 2017, the referees called an illegal substitution on the Rangers, but strangely not too many men on ice. This happened during the second period as some players were changing shifts. How come this didn't result in a 2 minute minor? This is a reference to this incident, I wasn't able to find any other similar occurrence.   so I'm wondering what is illegal substitution and when does it happen? How does it correspond to the too many men on ice penalty? "
1977,What is a gentle reminder to a squash opponent to stop an ongoing evaluation?,"Although the question applies to many sports, I'm seeking an answer in the particular context of the rules and culture of squash. Is the answer formally specified in the competition rules of squash? Is the (worldwide) culture established firmly enough for the question to have a universal answer? In case it matters, I'm talking here about international, not US, squash.  I occasionally play against a opponent who likes to comment. This happens in many variations, but the main one is that if I make a difficult shot, they'll comment ""nice shot"", perhaps after they themselves have missed the return.  If this pat-on-the-back is made two or three times in a game, and after particularly strong play, I find that it's a nice compliment. But if the comments are made incessantly, for just about every rather-ordinary successful shot, the comments rattle me. I'm not sure if other players are capable of putting up with an ongoing evaluation. I'm not sure if a player ought to be able to handle some evaluation without being rattled. This is, after all, not chess. In chess, at least when I played semi-seriously a long time ago, a player would automatically lose a formal game if they spoke and told their opponents ""nice move"". It's understood that this will destroy the focus of one's opponent.  In squash I can never tell whether the comments are (intentionally or unintentionally) malicious. But I do know that they affect the ongoing game.  I have two questions:   Is there a formal rule in squash that prevents an opponent from making a comment at all, at least until the game is over.   More importantly:   Even though I'm particularly bothered by comments in the middle of the game, and even if I get a gut-feeling that some comments are intended to change the course of a game, I do not wish to be rude and say ""no comments until the game is over, please"". What is a civil way of telling one's opponent ""kindly keep your trap shut until we finish. You're my opponent, not my critic nor an audience member""?  "
1978,Why do pitchers walk other pitchers (in the National League) with some frequency?,"In asking this question, I am not referring to exceptional cases like Yovani Gallardo, Madison Bumgarner, or Jake Arrieta, who hit about as well as position players. But I am referring to ""most"" pitchers, whose batting averages are in the .100s, about half as high as average position players.   I read somewhere that there is a theoretical batting average below which it was right to always throw strikes because the chances of getting the person out was so high that it was worthwhile not to give him a chance to walk, and as a practical matter, there was a somewhat higher threshold below which it made sense to throw mostly strikes, thereby giving the batter a minimal chance to walk.  My best recollection is that the rule is that one should ""never"" walk a batter (incurring a sure loss) whose average was below .075 even if he all home runs, and that it made sense to never walk a batter with an average as high as .225 if he never made extra base hits.  Don't most National League pitchers fall beneath these thresholds as batters? (Or if I have stated them wrongly, the ""corrected"" ones?) So why do pitchers often throw enough balls to walk them, when they could get them out by throwing mostly strikes?  Put another way, why does practice differ from theory in this instance? "
1979,What is the most consecutive pitches thrown that increased the batters strike count?,"What is the most consecutive pitches thrown that increased the batters strike count?  That is, with no foul strikes after the 2nd Strike.{edit} actually without the batter hitting the ball at all - this is the naive idea of a strike {/edit}   I appreciate that the maximum consecutive strikes thrown by a pitcher is something like 16 in one inning, but that's not what I'm looking for {edit} since most of these were hit foul, and not the "" one two three - out"" I'm looking for. {/edit}   I'm guessing it's a low number since it would be strategically wise to throw balls that don't seriously challenge the batter if the pitcher is ""ahead.""  Follow up: has any pitcher thrown a ""Perfect"" 9 pitch, 9 strike, 3 out inning?  "
1980,Did an athlete lap the rest of the runners after an illness that left him in bed for a long time before the competition?,"I recall reading some time ago a rather inspiring and interesting story about the importance of rest while training for a sport.  This specific story was about a runner in the 50s that was training very hard for a 5K or 10K Championship, probably the European Athletic Championships. Back in those days, stated the text I read, runners would train hard without interleaving some resting days. Apparently, the benefits of rest were undiscovered, so they assumed that the more your trained, the better the results would be.  However, that specific athlete had some serious health problem about a month before the race, leading him to remain at bed for a couple of weeks. Obviously, he could not train in all this period and he was very concerned about losing all his fitness for the race.  Despite this fear, the athlete decided to go and run the race, and then it became obvious that his fitness wasn't worse but way better: not even did he win the race, but he even lapped the rest of the runners (that is, they were more than 400 m after him).  I remember reading this some years ago in a book, but cannot recall more than the details I already mentioned. Some may be even wrong (maybe it was not in the 50s and maybe it was another championship). Since I somehow assumed he as Finnish, I did some research on some long-distance runners like Paavo Nurmi, but nothing arose from that.  Is this story true? Was there such situation? "
1981,Can a player represent more than one team?,"In Champions Leage T20 2013, Kumar Sangakkara chose to play for Kandurata Maroons team, although he is the captain for Sunrisers Hyderabad. Now Kandurata Maroons is out of CLT20. Can  Sangakkara now join Sunrisers Hyderabad?? Is there any rule in cricket that permits a player to get switched over or even represent for another team as in case of Sangakkara?? "
1982,What rules determine whether a player can play for a team in the CLT20?,"Most of the current T20 leagues around the world are very new and the playing rosters are typically not settled; players change teams a lot between seasons. In addition, many players play in a lot of these leagues, often for only brief periods such as a few games at the start and end of the season only due to international commitments.  In these cases, what determines the eligibility to play for a team in the CLT20? Is there a minimum number of games or is playing just 1 game enough? What if a player was contracted to a team, but didn't actually play any games due to injury or form? Maybe there are no rules at all, and the franchise can bring any players they can managed to hire along to play the CLT20, even if they have never played for that team before? If a player played for a team in a previous season, but not the one in which the team qualified for the CLT20, can they play? "

1985,Which rider's time determines result in team time trial?,"I have read in an article about this year's UCI World Championships:     There are six riders per team, meaning a smaller size when compared to, say, nine for last July’s team time trial in Nice for the Tour de France. Also the time taken is usually on the fifth rider but for the worlds, with the smaller teams, the time will be taken on the fourth rider.   Are there some official rules about which rider's time determines team's result in team time trial? Or is it decided by organizer of each individual race? "
1986,When did the fifty-overs format for One-day international matches comes in practice?,"   In the early days of ODI cricket, the number of overs was generally 60   overs per side, and matches were also played with 40, 45 or 55 overs   per side, but now it has been uniformly fixed at 50 overs.    - Wikipedia    What are all the over formats used in ODI history? When did the 50-overs format for one-day international matches comes in practice?   Answer if possible,   How many matches were played for only 50-overs till now?   FYI, 5th ODI between Australia and England is the 3416th ODI match in Cricket history. "
1987,Why don't we have free hit in Test Cricket?,"Why free hit is not there in the Test Cricket?   In Twenty-20 matches, when a bowler bowls no ball (overstepping with front foot or back foot) then next delivery is free hit, but in the Test matches why is it not there? "
1988,Is it allowed to wear inner gloves while batting in cricket?,We can see the wicket keepers always wearing inner gloves on field.      Is it permitted for a batsman to wear inner gloves while batting in cricket? Is there any batsman wear them in international cricket history?  
1989,Are there sports in which game theory is explicitly used?,"   Game theory [interactive decision theory] is mainly used in economics, political science, and psychology, as well as logic and biology.   I believe that I know that tennis serving and football penalty shooting more-or-less stick to their game-theoretical solutions. But are there sports that explicitly use game-theoretical analysis? (Or, perhaps easier to answer, are there game theorists employed or consulted by certain teams or individual players?)  NB: I am particularly interested in play or race strategy, not in acquisition strategy. (Moneyball, besides being statistical, not game-theoretical, isn't relevant to my question.) "
1990,Who benefits from Football Association Fines,"The English Football Association, or FA, fine players and managers at all levels of the game for common infractions such as yellow &amp; red cards.  Occasionally players &amp; managers may be disciplined for major infractions such as making inflamatory remarks on twitter. These fines are usually far more substantial.  My question is - Who benefits from these fines? Do they contribute to the operating profits of the FA, or are they invested directly into grass roots sport? "

1992,What is a block in volleyball?,What exactly constitutes as a block in volleyball? Let's say if it's an overpass by the opposing team and a blocker tips it down (with two hands) but the opposing team still returns it. Is it a block? Or even if it's not an overpass and just an attack but still if a blocker prevents it from coming on their side but the other team keeps the ball alive. Is it still a block? 
1993,How bad is washing a wetsuit in a washing machine?,"Is it so bad if I wash my 5 mm wetsuit in a washing machine?  I perfectly know that it's not good. What I'd really like to know is: will it reduce my wetsuit life expectation from 10 years to 5 years (good for me), or from 10 years to just 1 year (bad for me)?  Long story: for a few months, I've been doing a terrible thing: washing my wetsuit in a washing machine and then putting it in the dryer. I've done so because I've been suggested by a person that I though was an expert.  The result? My wetsuit now is no longer as adherent as it was, and now cold water enters while diving. My bad. Lesson learned.  I'm almost sure that what damaged my wetsuit so quickly is the dryer, so I won't use it again. However, given that using a washer machine is sooo fast, comfortable, clean and hygienic, is it that bad if I continue to use it? (With cold or warm water.)  Is that bad if I use the washer machine every week? (I do not like wearing dirty clothes.)  Also: I do not have a room in my house where to put my wetsuit to dry far away from the sun (I do not want to wet the floor). Is it that bad if I put my wetsuit to dry in the sun? "
1994,How much evidence has to be there to overturn an American football play?,"I was just recently (5 minutes ago) watching an American football game. It was a quite important 4th down play to win the game, and the play was challenged. The cameras had absolutely ZERO view of the ball; however, the ruling on the field was a catch. So, with NO view of the ball whatsoever, the referee's call overturned the ruling on the field. Wouldn't this just be 'The ruling on the field stands'? Can the referee who called the completion come back and say it wasn't a catch and he called it wrong on the field?  Basically, what goes into calling a play back from a challenge/official review besides what the cameras see? "

1996,What are the charges/action against sledging in cricket?,"Sledging is used to diverse a Player's mind from his game and make him difficult to concentrate on his game which affects its performance in the game.  Sledging is used as master weapon by many international cricket teams like Australia,England and West Indies.     What are the charges specified against the sledging?   a specific time of ban,match fees amount or any other charges.     Is there any cricketing rules specified for sledging?   I know an incident between Harbhajan–Symonds incident (Monkey-Gate).In which it was considered an offence of sledging Andrew Symonds by Harbhajan Singh in which a three match ban was proposed and then lifted out because of not having a proof but he was charged under Level 2.8 offence (abuse and insult not amounting to racism) to which he pleaded guilty and was fined 50 per cent of his match fees.     In such a case What if whole team is found guilty ?   will all of them will be considered guilty and banned for playing the considered cricket matches ?     Who takes the amount of fine ?   the money taken as fine belongs to whom the player who was sledged or the team to which the player belongs or the ICC "
1997,Batting average greater than on-base percentage,"While watching a New York Mets game early this season, before one plate appearance the broadcast graphics displayed that catcher John Buck had a batting average (AVG) of .400 and an on-base percentage (OBP) of .396. Several games later I saw a similar phenomenon for Buck, whose OBP was again several points lower than his AVG. (In other words, the stats presented were very likely to be actual and not an on-screen typo.)  How is this possible? By my understanding, the two are calculated as follows:  AVG = (hits) / (at-bats)   and  OBP = (times reaching first base) / (plate appearances)   It would seem to me that the conditions by which a plate appearance does not count as an at-bat would always result in the batter reaching first.  What could have happened to cause Buck's on-base percentage to drop below his average? "

(The first might be physically impossible, but the second seems doable.) "
2000,If time expires does it still count against a down conversion rate?,"Sorry for the bad title, didn't really know how to title it.  If a team is 4-4 on 3rd down conversions, it is a 3rd down and time expires does that count against the conversion rate? Same for end of the game... 3rd down clock runs out and there is no time left in the game, does it count against the 6 out of 6 for 3rd down conversion?  Hope this makes sense "
2001,How do European players get drafted into the NBA?,"As someone who knows more about European/FIBA basketball, but very little about how the NBA works, I was wondering how players currently playing for European teams (e.g. in Spain/Greece/eastern Europe) get drafted by NBA teams. They already have professional contracts with European teams, so I'm presuming the NBA team wishing to get the player has to talk to the European club and arrange some sort of transfer fee? But is this indeed the case, then how does it fit in with the draft system?  This occurrence is seemingly becoming more and more common each year, with 19 European players in the NBA draft this year, a record as far as I know. An interesting example is Álex Abrines, who has apparently been ""drafted"" by Oklahoma City Thunder, but still plays actively for Barcelona Regal. What's going on here, and in similar situations? "
2002,"Is there such a thing as a ""small slam"" in baseball (or other sports)?","In bridge, a ""grand slam"" means taking 13 tricks (out of a possible 13). A ""small slam"" means taking 12 tricks (all but one).  In baseball, a grand slam means a four-run homer (that clears the bases). Is there such a term as ""small slam"" (or other term) for a three-run homer (other than ""three run homer"" itself)?  In tennis, a ""Grand Slam"" refers to winning all four major events (Wimbleton, plus the Australian, French and U.S. Opens)? Would a ""small slam"" refer to ""three out of four?""  How about in other sports? "
2003,Why does kicking team get a new set of downs in this occurrence?,"According to the official NFL rules about punting, [website]This apparently applies even if the member of the receiving team touched the ball by accident or was blocked into it by the kicking team.   Why does this rule exist? Why are the kickers given a new set of downs? Has this ever happened in the history of football? Is there any coach who would ever try to do this deliberately as a desperation play on a 4th-and-a-mile (or 3rd-and-a-mile)?  "
2004,NFL broadcast info---HS or college affiliation? What does that mean?,"When a professional football player introduces himself and states his college affiliation, must that player have graduated from that college or does 3 years allow for him to declare that school affiliation?

2005,What is the estimated point value of deferring after winning the coin toss?,"In American football, the winner of the coin toss can make a choice now (usually to receive the kick-off which starts the game), or can defer their choice to the second half (thus having the option to receive the kick-off in the second half).  Suppose there were two evenly matched teams, and the halftime score were 17-16. Before evaluating their chances, I would want to know (at least) one more thing.  If the 17-point team had deferred, and was now receiving the ball in the third quarter, I would consider it ahead, both on points and on the ""deferred"" reception.  But suppose this right belonged to the 16-pointer. Would the deferred reception give them the better chance of winning?   The value of this could be no more than a touchdown, and probably a lot less. It may not even be the value of a field goal.  Are there any estimates or quantifications of the deferred reception privilege, and the ""extra"" possession privilege that it confers? "
2006,What is the significance of the 20 yard line?,"I can think of two instances where this comes into play. One is if the kick-off falls behind the receiving goal line, and the runner chooses to ""down"" the ball in the endzone rather than run it out. This allows the receiving team to start at 20 yard line ""for sure"" instead of taking their chances with a running play.  The second is if the offensive team's ball carrier is tackled in his own end zone for a ""safety,"" this team has to make a free kick from its 20 yard line (instead of from the 40 yard line).  How and why was the 20 yard line chosen for these purposes? And why was the ""20"" yard line changed to the 25 yard line for both touchbacks and safeties in college football in 2012? "
2007,"How is an ""attrition"" strategy supposed to work in football?","Commenting the Alabama-Clemson game, a commentator noted that Clemson would run many ""side"" plays and try to wear down the Alabama defense. Apparently that didn't work, given the result.  How would a team wear down the other team (without similarly wearing itself down)? Does it ""fake"" several plays and run one, so several sets of defenders are exhausted on each play?  Another reason this might not work is because players are freely substitutable in football (unlike e.g. baseball, where it is once per person per game). Or is the whole idea to force the other team to use ""second-string"" (and presumably inferior) players?  I guess if one team's players were a lot bigger/stronger than the other's, they could wear down the other in trials of strength such as those occasioned by draw plays and ""off tackles"". But that didn't appear to be the case in last night's game. "
2008,What is the difference between a tennis and a racquetball ball?,"What would happen if you played tennis with a racquetball or racquetball with a tennis ball?

Would it at least be a commonly attempted on a first serve, with players opting for the usual safer second serve if they hit the net?  Or would the risk outweigh the benefits? Would players continue to serve as they do already, with a let being nothing but a lucky bonus? "

2012,Legislation on professional underage athletes,"Given that Real Madrid and Atlético de Madrid have just been punished for irregular signings of underage players (just as Barcelona was not so long ago), I was wondering what kind of restrictions there are on underage players going pro.  Especially in Europe and South America, it is not uncommon for great players to establish themselves as first-team regular starters before turning 18, or in some cases even 17. For example, Agüero started playing for Independiente at 15, and by the time he was 17, he was one of the key players of the team. See also Muniain with Athletic Bilbao, Bojan and Messi with Barcelona, Donnarumma with Milan, C. Ronaldo with Sporting, etc, all of which went pro before turning 18.  So, how do these contracts work? Is the money these players earn put in a fund and made available to them when they become of age? Can other clubs pay a transfer for them? "
2013,"How much are Cricket Umpires paid in India starting from Club level to Ranji, Duleep trophy, etc.?","EDIT: The question What is the procedure to become a Cricket Umpire? does not answer my question.

Adding to the question, also how much time does it take for one to reach Ranji level from club level? "
2014,How are tennis tournament draws determined?,"The draw in the 2016 Australian Open (mens) (womens) does not seem to follow the top-seed vs. bottom-seed format common in tournaments such as the NCAA College basketball tournament.

For the Australian Open?  Other Majors? "
2015,NFL: Can timeout be called before first opening drive snap?,"In the AFC Divisional Playoff round game between the Steelers and Broncos on Sunday January 17 2016, I noticed a hesitation longer than usual before the first snap from scrimmage on the opening drive.  The opening kickoff was downed, and there was no time lost on the clock.  With 15:00 to go in the first, Roethlisberger seemed to take some time being sure of the play call.  I noticed for the first time that the game clock was running down in this scenario.  My question is: is it legal for either team to call timeout given this scenario?  I am well aware that to do so is not the height of coaching mastery or game management.  As a follow-up question, if it is legal, has anyone ever done it? "
2016,Who counts darts scores?,When watching (steel) darts I noticed the scores are there immediately after each leg. Who counts them? Is it the referee? Is it the someone in the back watching through cameras? Is it a machine? Does the table have sensors? 
2017,"In football, what happens when a team commits an offence for which play need not be stopped, and then scores a goal immediately after?","In the Laws of the Game, there is a small—yet non empty—set of offences for which the referee must not immediately blow his whistle as he usually does for 'normal' fouls, but must instead allow play to continue, and caution the guilty player when the ball is next out of play.  Examples of such offences include swicthing places with the goalkeeper without informing the referee beforehand (Law 3.5):     If a player changes places with the goalkeeper without the referee’s permission, the referee (...) cautions both players when the ball is next out of play   or making unauthorized marks on the field of play (Law 1.2):     A player who makes unauthorised marks on the field of play must be cautioned for unsporting behaviour. If the referee notices this being done during the match, the player is cautioned when the ball next goes out of play.   These are infringements that do not naturally carry a restart with them (e.g. indirect free kick, direct free kick, dropped ball, etc.), since the Laws explicitly forbid the match officials from interrupting the game to deal with them, and only instruct the referee to issue the appropriate disciplinary sanction afterwards.  This said, let's move onto Law 10 (Law 10.1). Here we can read that:     A goal is scored when the whole of the ball passes over the goal line, between the goalposts and under the crossbar, provided that no offence has been committed by the team scoring the goal.   First of all, it's obvious that this paragraph is only referring to those offences that are committed between the restart of play that is chronologically the closest to when the goal is scored and the goal itself, otherwise a team who commits a foul in the first minute of play would be forbidden from scoring a valid goal for the whole duration of the match.  So, to make an example, if a substitute enters the field of play just seconds before his team scores a goal, said goal must be disallowed, and play restarts with a direct free kick from the position of the extra person (Law 3.9) because this is the kind of penalty that is carried by the offence of entering the pitch without the referee's permission (Law 3.7).  But what about the offences I mentioned at the beginning of my question? There's not a specific restart of play attached to them. So, what do you do if a player makes unauthorized marks on the field of play just before his team scores a goal? What if a defender changes places with the goalkeeker without telling the referee, and then the new goalkeeper handles the ball within his penalty area, and throws it with the hands in such a powerful way that it directly enters the opponents' goal? It's obvious that such goals cannot be allowed, but how should play restart?   Should the match be resumed with an indirect free kick, on the basis that play was interrupted to show a card to a player who was guilty of an offence that is not mentioned in Law 12 (Law 12.2)? Though the game was technically NOT stopped to caution the player—it was stopped because the ball entered one of the goals; the Laws forbid the referee from stopping play solely to deal with these offences, after all. And anyway, where should this free kick be taken? From inside the goal area? Should play restart with a goal kick/corner kick, on the basis that the ball crossed the goal line, but a goal was not scored (Law 16 Introduction, Law 17 Introduction)? If so, when is it a goal kick and when is it a corner kick? Should it depend on which player touched the ball last before it entered the goal, as is the case for 'normal' situations involving goal kicks/corner kicks?  "
2018,Why is a penalty not given if a goal comes right after the foul?,"In the game between Spain and Russia, in the World Cup 2018, one Russian defender (Ignashevich) tackled a Spanish player (Ramos) inside the Russian penalty area (video here or here). This was technically a foul, and thus a penalty for Spain. However, right after the tackle, the ball hit Ignashevich and entered the Russian goal. Thus, it was an own goal.   Now, in terms of timing, the foul happened before the goal. Thus, why is a penalty not given? Why give the goal to Spain, instead of giving them the chance to score, but without 100% probability of doing so? Surely, if the time difference between the foul and the own-goal had been longer, the referee would have given the penalty. But if so, isn't this just an arbitrary application of the rules?  Update (based on comment asking for more info):  Why would the foul be given before the goal awarded? Because technically, the foul happened first. You can think of the strict rule being something like ""IF foul, THEN penalty"", whereas in practice it seems more like ""IF foul AND goal AND goal-foul > epsilon, then penalty"". Thus, only if the time difference is long enough would the penalty be given. But if epsilon is small enough (so the goal happens just after the foul), then the goal is given. This seems to me arbitrary. Sure, there are technical limitations involved in the referee (e.g. when epsilon is too small, the referee has little capacity to react in time). But the current approach seems to be based on assumptions by players that, if a goal happens after a penalty foul, it will be awarded. Maybe the VAR can precisely help to reduce the arbitrariness of rules like this. "
2019,Consequences outside the game for grievous fouls in football?,"A theoretical situation brought to mind by the recent Croatia-Denmark game.  It's the world cup final. I'm a defender for Aland. Its the final minute of extra time and we look certain to go to penalties... Aland always loses in penalties. Our opponents Bland on the other hand are pretty good at them...  So I make a decision. I go up to the Bland goalkeeper and knock him out with a right hook.  I'm sent off. But I don't care. I'm not one of my team's top penalty takers anyway. Actually its better that I don't have to take one as I'm sure to sky the ball, better it would loop back to our strikers asap.  Since Bland have lost their keeper in the dying minutes they lose the penalty shoot out easily.   It is certain that I'd be remembered as a 10x worse than Maradonna level unsporting scum bag in this situation. Perhaps banned from football for life? Certain I can never visit Bland...  But... Could there be legal consequences outside the game for such a blatant foul?  Why do these not apply in deliberate fouls of the like we saw in the recent Denmark-Croatia game? "
2020,Why do multiple offensive players stand near the ball during a free kick?,"In soccer, why do multiple offensive players often stand near the ball during a direct free kick, when only one of them is going to end up taking it?

Basically game went on without any interruptions.  Which game and how long was the duration?  I am interested in country vs country matches or national level club games. 
2022,Why do footballers (and coaches) cover their mouth when speaking to each other?,"You can see this for instance when players discuss a free kick, or talk to the referee, or when talking to a colleague on the pitch. I understand the fear of being spied on by someone and communicating information to the opponent. But really? Has this ever been a thing? I mean, no one can pass such quickly passed information to anyone. For example, when two players discuss a free-kick, no one will be able to inform the goalkeeper of anything.   And also, can untrained people really read the lips of other players so easily, especially if it is in another language? Players might suspect a translator off the pitch, perhaps looking with binoculars, could help with the translation, but again, this information, if ever accurate, could be very slow to transmit, and hence become useless.  So, the real question is, why bother? Has such information ever been used against a team? This trend in covering the mouth became widespread, in my experience, around 5 years ago. Thus, for example, in most World Cups ever played, this was not a thing. Why the sudden concern? Does FIFA have anything to say about this? "
2023,Why do many tennis players crouch-then-uncrouch before receiving a serve?,"I’ve been watching quite a lot of tennis this year, and I’ve been noticing a tendency among many professional tennis players—particularly noticeable in women players, for some reason—to crouch down fairly low when waiting for their opponent to serve, and then straighten halfway back up just before the opponent actually serves.  This FTP Tennis page describes crouching down too low as a common ready-position mistake, borne out of people observing this precise crouch, but missing the player straightening back up.  For reference, here are two pictures of Novak Ðoković in the two positions in question, taken from the same page:  Crouching:   Straightening:   Given that the player usually ends up in a ready position which is almost identical to the position they were in before they crouched down, I can’t help but wonder why they do the initial low crouch at all.  Why not just go directly into the final ready position? Wouldn’t that be easier? "
2024,Queueing at Wimbledon for a Grounds Pass: When Can I Expect to Get In?,"I wish to get a grounds pass for Wimbledon. My plan was to get to the queue at about 7am. I have seen some people say that I wouldn't get in until 1pm doing so, however they are talking about show court tickets.  I only want a grounds pass, not a show court ticket. Approximately how long would I have to wait if I arrived early in the morning?  Is there a different queue for grounds passes compared with show court tickets? "
2025,"Hasn't Kasper Schmeichel broke the rules when saving Modrić's penalty during the World Cup 2018, Round of 16 match between Croatia and Denmark?","Law 14 - The Penalty Kick - 1. Procedure explicitly states that:     The defending goalkeeper must remain on the goal line, facing the   kicker, between the goalposts until the ball has been kicked.   However, from the image below, it's obvious that Schmeichel left the goal line before Modrić touched the ball.   Source: FIFA Youtube channel  Wasn't the referee supposed to caution Schmeichel and and call a retake according to Law 14 - The Penalty Kick - Offences and Sanctions?     If, before the ball is in play, [...] the goalkeeper or a team-mate   offends:         if the ball enters the goal, a goal is awarded   if the ball does not enter the goal, the kick is retaken; the goalkeeper is cautioned if responsible for the offence      With the introduction of VAR, this offence had to be immediately noticed. Why referees are so merciful to the offending team when goalkeepers don't respect the penalty procedures? This type of offence occurs quite often in the game and I don't understand why referees tolerate it. "
2026,Under what circumstances the half race passing time in a marathon qualifies for a half marathon competition?,"Few months ago, a track and field runner Carles Castillejo was involved in something quite interesting: he wanted to qualify to the IAAF World Half Marathon Championship 2018 in Valencia, Spain, to be held in March 24.  He tried to get the minim time in Barcelona on February 11 but he failed due to a flu: he ran in 1h 04:57, while he needed 1h 04:30.  Since he felt he was capable to get the time, he managed to do so in a particular way: he ran the marathon of Seville on February 25, only that running the first half marathon in a fast pace, which would count as official time. As indicated in Carles Castillejo, a por todas en el Zurich Maratón Sevilla Spanish, translation mine:     He will be the pacemaker up to the km 15 of the race. Then, he will try to make the half marathon in 1h 04 to get the classification [to the World Half Marathon Championship]. To make a valid time he must finish the race.   As explained by the IAAF on Seville's marathon report, this is what happened:     The men’s race opened at a frantic pace as the two kilometre point was reached in 5:55, ten seconds ahead of schedule. Once the organisers managed to slow the pacesetters, it was the first pacer, Spain’s Carlos Castillejo, who led the main group through 10 kilometres in 29:58. All the main favourites were tucked in behind him except for Spain’s Jesús España who opted to travel in a second group, well behind.      Castillejo, 39, led the lead group through the halfway point in 1:03:30   After that, he just managed to arrive to the end with an approximate time of 2h 23, which just did not matter.  So my question is: under which circumstances is this possible? What if the marathon was just going down for 21 km and then going back up?  Foot note: he finally could not run with his national team, due to some law interpretation problems. However, he ran the mass race just behind the professional one and managed to overtake most of the runners, as described by the IAAF in Castillejo comes out from the crowd. "
2027,Has a team ever had five all-stars from the previous season on its roster?,"Since they signed Boogie Cousins, the Golden State Warriors will have five all-stars from the previous season on their roster.  Has this happened before? If not, has a team ever had 5 all-stars on their roster from any point of a player's career other than the 2004 Lakers (Shaq, Kobe, Malone, Payton, Grant)?  "
2028,"What does the ITF rulebook consider to be ""the service motion""?","According to Rule 18b of the ITF Rulebook:     During the service motion, the server shall not... touch the baseline or the court with either foot.   What, exactly, constitutes ""the service motion""? I had always taken that to mean ""the motions leading up to, and including, when you actually hit the ball."" However, what if you step into the court as the result of some kind of continuous movement that you started prior to hitting the ball? For example, the rules permit the server to have one or both feet of the ground; if you jump to hit the serve and then ""land"" inside the court after hitting the ball, is that a foot fault?  Does hitting the ball automatically ""end"" the service motion? "
2029,All European World Cup semifinal,"With Brazil and Uruguay, the only non European teams in the quarter finals of the 2018 World Cup out of the competitions on the first day of the quarter finals, all remaining teams are European. France and Belgium are already in the semi finals matches after beating Uruguay and Brazil respectively. On the second day of the quarter finals, Russia plays Croatia, and England plays Sweden. This guarantees the last 4 teams standing to be from Europe.  Has all semi finalist of a world cup all been from Europe before? Or more generally have all semi finalist qualified from the same continent? Since all other continents get maximum of 5 seeds (and that would have be even less years ago) I'm assuming this could have only happened for European teams before. "
2030,What's the protocol when an opponent is injured and your team has posession?,"In football, what protocol should a player follow when an opponent collapses to the ground after a legitimate challenge or tackle?   Put the ball out of play so they can receive (potential) treatment? Keep posession as the referee has the authority to pause the game anyway?   The problem with fair play is deception: it is very common for football players to feign injury and minutes later be fully revived so that the need to stop is minimal. In the rare case of real injury the difference in 30 seconds of receiving treatment for a muscle or bone injury will likely have no effect. "
2031,Most extra time games played in a World Cup,"Croatia has played in the extra time of each of their first 3 knockout stage games in the 2018 World Cup. They played Denmark, Russia, and England in the round of 16, quarterfinals and the semifinals respectively.  What is the most number of games a team has played extra time in a single World Cup? Similarly what's the most number of consecutive extra time games played in a single World Cup? "
2032,Is it legal to throw an alley-oop to yourself in a real game?,"In this video, a college basketball player steals the ball, races down court, and avoids the defender by throwing a pass to himself off the backboard.  [website]In all the (disorganized) basketball games I've played in, a shot had to hit the rim before the shooter was allowed to rebound. And that looks like a shot to me.  Obviously the officials allowed it, but I couldn't find an explicit mention in the NCAA Rulebook. Is this ruled as a shot, and if so, why is it legal? I'd be interested in the answer for any level of basketball, though NCAA is the most relevant. "
2033,Why is American football called football?,"Why is American football called ""football"" even though the players play with their hands more than their feet? It seems to be very similar to rugby, and doesn't have the name ""American Rugby"". What might be the reason for it to be called ""Football"" even though it is more similar to Rugby? "
2034,Why were artificial turfs introduced in hockey?,"This wikipedia section has good details about the changes bought about in hockey after artificial turfs were introduced. This change also bought about a shift in hockey power base from Asian countries to European countries.  But my question is, why were artificial turfs introduced in the first place? Were there any significant disadvantages with natural grass and hockey? "
2035,Why does a marathon start need to be near its finish for a record to count,"In the answer to a question on the validity or otherwise of a world record, the answer quotes the rule book which says:      ""The start and finish points of a course, measured along a theoretical straight line between them, shall not be further apart than 50% of the race distance."" [i.e., 13.1 miles (21.1 km) for the ~26.2 mile (~42.2 km) marathon distance]   Why should this be so? I can understand stipulations about ascent or descent between the start and end, but why should the endpoints need to be close together? (It means that the original 26.2 mile course, from Windsor to White City in west London, wouldn't be legal.)  "
2036,How can I graduate from single to multiple pitch climbs?,"I have been sport climbing for many years, both indoors and out, but have only ever tried single pitch climbs. I would like to learn multiple pitch climbing, but have no idea how you manage the transition.  Do you get to a ledge and then belay your partner up then effectively start again on the new pitch? Or do you let your partner climb past you as the new leader?  Do you need to do anything special with regards to safety as you change from being the leader to being the belayer halfway up a wall? "
2037,Significance of ends in field games,"In most sports like football and hockey, the teams change position at half time. Are there any specific reasons to do so, other than fan support at one end? Will there be any specific advantage in one playing towards end over the other? "
2038,when was the product placement introduced in sports?,"I know product placement is a good marketing technique used in almost every sports, but   When was the product placement introduced in sports? Which was the first sport introduced product placement? Why not separate ads rather than product placement?  "
2039,What does it take to play in the NIT?,"According to this Wikipedia article, the selection process was changed in 2006. According to the article, teams are no longer required to have a .500 record and conference champions will receive an automatic bid. However, I am still unclear on if there are still any other restrictions to a team's record for them to be eligible and how the other teams are selected.   Is it still based on number of wins/win percentage? Can a team play in both the NCAA tournament and the NIT?   Also I know that, unlike the NCAA tournament, the NIT holds games at the home courts of teams instead of at predetermined regional sites. The article notes that prior to 2006 home court advantage was based (in part) on a team's expected attendance in the tournament. Is it still based on this, or the team's seed or something else? "
2040,Countering heavy top or bottom spin in table tennis?,"What options are there when your opponent serves you very heavy top spin?   Often, just a slight push forces the ball to hit the ceiling.  On the flip side, is it possible to use the same strategies if the opponent serves you very heavy bottom spin from a chop? "
2041,the net position on a table in table tennis,Are there any rules indicating how the net is placed on a table tennis? Should it touch the top? Should it touch the table? I'm not totally sure.  It always seems that we just put it in the middle of that metal holder (not sure what it's called help?) on both sides.  
2042,What is the year of the Tour de France poster,"In the movie Triplets of Belleville there appears a Tour de France poster that is hanging near the Champion's bed (a picture from the movie that I found is this one, the poster is the one with the blue-white-red map of France). Which Tour de France had that particular poster? Where can I find the image? "
2043,Why do umpires indicate whether a caught fly ball is fair or foul?,"If a batter pops up or flies out down a base line, and the fielder catching the ball is within a couple feet of the foul line, the umpire will always signal the out, and then ""fair"" or ""foul"" depending on where the ball is caught.  Why is this? Runners can tag up on either a foul or fair ball. A missed play would likely be scored an error on the fielder regardless of which side of the line the ball dropped.  I know there's a (slightly) different scoring notation for caught fair and foul balls. If the left-fielder catches the ball in fair territory it's scored (""7"" or ""F7""); in foul territory (""7F"" or ""F7F""). Is there any reason to indicate fair or foul here other than as a courtesy to the scorer to inform him that he needs to write an extra letter? "
2044,How can a 3rd college quarterback be found if two are injured?,"As colleges can't sign a new player like an NFL team can, what do they do if two or three of their starting QBs go down? Is there a rule that lets them get new players or do they have to play their position players? "
2045,Early Adoption Program for Running Shoes,"Is there any sort of early adoption program that vendors offer for running shoes? The reason I ask is that in my case, I'm running a marathon at the end of May. Saucony is releasing the Kinvara 3 just two weeks before. I'd love the upgrade to the shoes, but two weeks is not a great amount of time to break in a shoe for a Marathon (in my opinion). So, it got me thinking. I wondered if any shoe manufacturer releases shoes to a ""beta"" group earlier on so they can get feedback, reviews, etc.  Are you aware of any or are you aware of a sporting goods store (running warehouse, dicks sporting goods, etc) that offer some sort of program? "
2046,"In football, what rules handle a player changing their position with the goalkeeper?",In football it is my assumption that any players on the same team can exchange their positions without waiting for the ball to leave play or without making any explicit indication to the other team.  I would like to know how this applies to the goalkeeper:   Can any player assume the role of goalkeeper? Do they need to change clothing with the goalkeeper? Do they need to announce this change to either the referee or the opposing team? Do they need to wait for the ball to leave play?  
2047,Using a Heart-rate monitor during race,"I've read all about the benefits of using a heart-rate monitor during training to make sure you are in the correct zone for the given type of exercise, i.e. Zone 3 for regular distance training.  My question: is it useful to run with a heart-rate monitor during a race or should I just go with my feeling?  If you think it is useful, what strategy should I adopt to optimize my race?  Update: to get the context, my planned races are 10k and half-marathon. "
2048,Doubles rules in table tennis,"I curious about what the official rules are for playing doubles table tennis. It seems like every time I play, someone has a different set of rules from what I've played before.  For instance,  do the partners have to alternate returning the ball? How does serving work? ie., when do you alternate who serves, and to whom does the serve go to?  "
2049,Tactics to counter pushing,"What are the best tactics to use against a player who uses excessive pushing?  I play with a group of about 20 guys each week without a referee. Every now and then a player will come along who relies on pushing to get past opponents.  I try to play as reasonably as possible and the shoving is not bad enough that I want to push someone on their ass for doing it. So, what are the best legal tactics to prevent this kind of person from pushing past?   Should I call a foul and risk being ignored because the pushing is not extreme? Should I push back? Is there a way that I can position myself without using hands to counter this behaviour? Something more aggressive like chopping the hands?  "
2050,"LA Kings' ""That 70's line""","I was watching the Kings vs Canucks last night and the commentators kept referring to Jeff Carter's line as the ""70's line"". What is the reason behind this?

2052,Can a diver from 10 m. sustain injury hitting the pool bottom?,"An Olympic diving pool is min 5.03 m deep. A diver from 10 m enters the water in ""perfect pencil shape"" and maintains this shape in the water without ""breaking"" the dive. Can this diver sustain injury from hitting the bottom of the pool with enough speed? Have such injuries occurred?  If so, why don't they increase pool min depth? "
2053,How to Find Work In a Sports Research Room,"I have had a passion and love of history and statistics since childhood and it is a goal of mine to work in a research room. How does one do this? It does not seems as though ESPN and other networks advertise such positions. What should I do or who should I contact to make my goal a reality? I am interested in working in research rooms such as those used during the Olympics, Grand Slam tennis tournaments, and the World Cup. "
2054,Ineligible Man Down field on a Punt (NCAA v NFL),"In college football, specifically the NCAA there are many punters that use a ""Rugby Style"" kick to punt the ball.  Often the punter will run to the side of his kicking foot and then punt the ball.  This takes a little bit of time, and usually between one and all seven players that are on the line of scrimmage will run down field before the ball is kicked.  My question is:   Isn't this a penalty?  Only eligible receivers are allowed more than 5 yards down the field according to the rule in the NFL.  Is this not a rule in the NCAA?  I know you cannot be a lineman and be down the field on a pass play, as in the NFL and NCAA it is a penalty.  I know that if the punter uses a Rugby Style punt, then the roughing the punter rules do not apply because he is not protected by the normal roughing the punter/kicker rules.  Maybe this applies to the ineligible man down field penalty too, but I cannot find anything on it.    References:  A video of some punts where players are down field at the time of the punt  NFL Ineligible Downfield Kick  Rugby Punters and Roughing the Punter "
2055,What is meant by a natural hat trick in hockey?,"While reading this article on NHL.com I noticed that they mentioned several times that Jori Lehtera recorded a natural hat trick.  I assume they say natural hat trick to contrast it to another type of hat trick, but I don't know of any other types of hat tricks.  I have only ever heard them say natural hat trick when talking about hockey so I assume it is specific to hockey.  What other types of hat tricks are there in hockey, and are they that different that a distinction is required? "
2056,Techniques to return aggressive tennis serves?,"I injured my forearm when I tried to return a fast aggressive serve at about 200km/h with basic forehand grip and backswing: the hit can extremely damaging to your ulnar nerve more here (particularly if you are too slow to react). I realised in my last tournament that I can return such serves easily with basic volley grip: no topspin but the ball reflect without much effort safely on the other side. If you have basic forehand grip, you need to be very quick and it is very very exhaustive to your forearm. Currently, my goal is to learn the safest technique to play against aggressive players. Now simple question:     Techniques to return very aggressive serves?   Related questions     I. How does the volley in serve-returning compares to the basic volley near net?            I. Same footwork in the volley-returning serve as in the basic volley near the net?         II. What is the safest technique to return very aggressive serves?  "
2057,How Does the 2005 Offside Rule Amendment by FIFA Stretch the Game?,"Here are a couple of reference for the background on the topic [website]and the book ''Inverting the Pyramid'' Chapter 19.  They both talk about the 2005 FIFA amendment to the ofsside rule contributing to stretching the game.  Specifically they imply the following.   The amendment means the offside player must touch the ball of block a defender for the referee to call the offside foul. This discourages the team from playing high offside line and ""stretches the playing area from 35-40m to 55-60m""(from the book) and avoids ""goal hanging"" ""without the side-effect of legitimising the offside trap""(from the link)   I don't get that second bullet. Yes the foul is not called until the attacker goes and touched the ball, but how is that going to stop the defenders from applying the offside trap? A team would still play a high defensive line and make sure the target of the long pass is offside. All that changes now is that a foul is not called, but the attacker is still out of the play because he was offside. So why would any team be discouraged from using the offside trap? "

2059,Which players won both junior and senior IIHF World Championships?,"Jonathan Toews managed to win both the junior and senior world championships in 2007. Are there some other players which managed to win both these championships in the same year?   Is there more of them if we add those, who won golden medals in different years? (For example, Igor Larionov won WJC in 1979 and 1980 and senior championships in 1982, 1983, 1986 and 1989. Other examples of players winning both junior and senior championships include Patrice Bergeron, Scott Niedermayer and Alexander Ovechkin.) "
2060,What is an attack hit in volleyball?,"What exactly constitutes an attack hit in volleyball?  For example, if I set the ball to someone else for an attack hit, and the set goes too far and it is blocked by someone on the opposing team with their hands over my side of the net, is that legal? Would my hit have been counted an attack hit? "
2061,Have 2 NCAA basketball teams ever played each other 5 times in a season?,"Two NCAA basketball teams from the same conference could play each other 5 times in one season.  This would happen if:   They played each other in an early season tournament.  (You can see this year's Battle 4 Atlantis tournament includes Butler and Georgetown - both from the Big East conference.) They played each other twice as part of the conference's regular season schedule. They played each other in the conference tournament. They played each other in a postseason tournament like the NCAA Tournament, NIT, CBI, or CIT.   Has this ever happened?  Have two college basketball teams ever played each other 5 times in one season? "

2066,Distance between court & crowd in Basketball,I was recently watching a NBA match and what I want to know is that why is the crowd (including cameramen) so close to the end of the court? Why don't they keep an higher distant gap? I've often seen players bumping into the crowd. So why do they still maintain such a small gap? 
2067,How far out of the net can a goalie freeze the puck in the NHL?,Hockey goalies wear glove on one hand to catch the puck.

2080,Stumped Off A Wide Diamond Duck?,"If you are stumped off a wide first delivery you face is it a diamond duck? Because although you have literally faced a ball it won't be recorded as a ball faced because of the wide (as evident here, Hayden faced 3 balls in the over he was dismissed but only 2 were counted cause he was stumped off a wide).   So if you are dismissed in this manner are you out for a diamond duck or not, as you will be out for 0 runs off 0 deliveries, but you will have also faced a ball? If not, does it have a special name too? "
2081,Is there a good measure available for how badly an NFL team has been hit by injuries?,"By this point in the season all NFL teams have injury problems, but some are worse than others. Are there any available measures of the extent of each team's issues? Perhaps the total cap charge for all players who are not suiting up for a given week's game? I'd be interested in including players who are suspended (Blackmon) or otherwise unavailable (Hernandez) too.  UPDATE: @BoZiffer asked, ""Do you mean other than reviewing the weekly injury lists that teams are required to present before each game?""  Yes, I'm looking for something beyond those lists because they don't give any indication of how important a player is to the team. So it would be hard to answer the question, ""Which team has the worst injury issues?"" "

2083,What happens when a pin slides but does not fall?,"Recently, I had a spare attempt with the 7-pin. I bowled a ball that hooked sharply before it hit the 7-pin. As a result, the pin slid toward the middle of the lane, but did not fall. I have seen some occasions in which this would have counted as a spare/fallen pin, but it did not count in my case.   Would this have been considered a spare/fallen pin or an open frame/pin left standing? Generally, what happens when a pin slides but does not fall? "
2084,Would the cue ball on top of a rail still be considered legal and playable?,"In reference to the image below, the cue ball rested on top of a rail after my opponent attempted a shot.

2086,Are there some major cup competitions not using away goals rule?,"Away goals rule is often used in cups competitions and knock-out stages competition. It is applicable for two-legged ties, i.e. when the teams play one game home and one game away. If the two teams scored the same number of goals, the team which scored more goals in the away game.  As the Wikipedia article on this rule mentions, there are some variations to this rule. For example, in semifinals of Football League Cup, this rule is only applied after the extra time. (Here is link to the current revision of the Wikipedia article.)  As far as I can say, nowadays this type of tie-breaker is used quite frequently.     Are there some major completions with two-legged ties (cups or knockout phases of tournaments) where away goals rule is not used as a tie-breaker?  "
2087,How tightly should new snowboard boots fit?,"I recently bought my first pair of snowboard boots. They are Ride Riot snowboard boots, and I am not sure if I should take them back or not. I should probably mention that I have not yet worn them on the hill (once I do, I won't be able to return them).   They fit quite snugly. My toes are just millimeters from the end if I am sitting down or in my snowboard stance, but if I stand normally or walk around, my big toes hit the ends.   An immediate problem is that these boots are a men's size 13, and since these are larger sizes, it's highly unlikely that I'll find a size 13.5, so I'll probably have to jump up to a size 14. I wear a size 13 shoe, but I think I must work them in a little because according to the measurement I got at the store, my left foot is actually a size 13.5 (my right is a size 13).   So I guess what I want to know is, is it better to stick with these slightly small boots, or jump up to a size 14? For those more experienced in buying snowboard boots, do you find they get slightly larger after being worn on the hill a few times? "

2089,Why would NFL teams do a fair catch?,"I'm still wondering why would football teams do a fair catch if they could run to gain some yards. And, why would the NFL make that sort of rule? Is it because of some sort of safety reason? "
2090,Who is eligible to play in junior tennis tournaments?,"This is a quote from Wikipedia article on junior tennis (emphasis mine). I will also add a link to the current revision - in case the article changes in the future.)     Junior tennis refers to tennis games where the participants are aged 18 and under. Eligibility to compete is not based on age, but year of birth: as a result, some players must move out of juniors soon after their 18th birthday, while others can play juniors until they are nearly 19. Some players who qualify as ""junior tennis"" players also play in main adult tours, though forms signed by their parent or guardian are required for this.   Could somebody explain the rules about eligibility for junior tournaments in more detail? For example, as now is 2016, are players born in 1998 and later the ones who are allowed to compete this year in junior competitions?  It would also be nice to have some source for this. (As the Wikipedia article I linked to lacks references.) "
2091,Typical daily/weekly in-season training schedule of an NBA team,"I am interested in the typical daily and weekly training schedules of an NBA team (or any other professional sport team) during the season. I did some research, but this seems not too easy to find. I don't necessarily want to know every detail (as this is probably not something teams and coaches will reveal), but I'm very interested in some rough numbers:   How many hours of training does a basketball player in the NBA have per day/week? How much of it are individual workouts and how much is team practice? How much is athletics training compared to basketball sessions? How much tactics and video sessions do teams have? How is the training integrated into the tight 82 games schedule with two to three games every week. How high is the intensity (also compared to the off-season)? How does recovery look like? What treatments are done and when (after games, after practices, both)? How big are the differences for the above between players?  "
2092,What percentage of onside kicks have been successful in the 2015 NFL regular season?,What percentage of onside kicks have been successful in the 2015 NFL regular season?  In what percentage of onside kicks did the kicking team regain possession of the ball? 
2093,What happens when there are 2 turnovers on 1 play?,"During the last seconds of the 2015 AFC Championship (Broncos vs Patriots), the ball was intercepted by a Bronco, and while the guy was running, he accidentally fumbled the ball and the Patriots recovered.   However, the Patriots still had to do an onside kick.   My question is why? Why didn't the Patriots get 4 new downs?   I am kind of a rookie and not a fan of either team but this really bothers me. "
2094,Shouldn't they call it a fair pole?,"I didn't find a dupe on this and it's an age old topic   BUT....  Why do they call it a foul pole?  Fly ball, hits the foul pole and it's a home run.  That doesn't make any sense to me.  So my question  Have there been any initiatives in the past or currently where they may amend the name of the foul pole to a fair pole?  AND  If such an amendment were to begin, where would it begin with?  The commissioner, the owners, the Players Union? "
2095,Is the Concorde Agreement still in effect?,"In Formula 1 the Concorde Agreement set forth a division of money from TV rights all the way to how much power individual teams had along with a special component for Ferrari where they could veto initiatives and no other team could.  How much of the Concord Agreement is still in effect?  I know Ferrari still has veto power but what about TV revenue and such as well as revenue from races, etc.? "
2096,"MLB Rule Changes, what is the process?","It seems many sports have a system but it isn't always followed.  It may start with team owners and then voting to push it forward or 'commissioner' role may just implement something arbitrarily, something where it follows a convoluted path where other sports have a very rigid and set path for a rule change proposal.  How does MLB fall into the gamut of rule changes in the context of a set process?  When there is a rule change in MLB does it it follow a set process that occurs the same way every single time? "
2097,"Players at certain position are all injured, what happens?","What happens if all or the basic amount of necessary players on a NFL team are injured in the same game and cannot return to play? Do they take some other players that are able to play such necessary positions?  For instance, on the 2015-2016 roster of the New England Patriots, there are two quarterbacks, Brady and Garapollo. If both are injured is it possible that they can be replaced by Edelman, an ex-college quaterback turned wide receiver? "
2098,What's the etymology of the term Red Zone?,I know what the Red Zone is.  My interest is the etymology of the word.     I'm not sure of the first time I heard it or if they even used it when I was kid growing up in Oakland during the 70's.  Great time to be in Oakland btw.  I listened to all the games on AM and don't recall them using the term Red Zone when a team was at the 20 yard line or within it.  When did the term start being used?  Bonus:  Who started using it first? 
2099,Can a runner achieve a first down when offensive holding is called down field?,Say it's 2nd and 5 at Team A's own 25 yard line and a runner makes of gain of 10 yards to the 35 yard line. What happens if offensive holding is called down field at Team A's 35 yard line?  Offensive holding beyond the line of scrimmage is penalized from the spot of the foul. So would Team A be rewarded with the first down?  I can see two possible answers here   1st and 10 from Team A's 25 yard line (first down is awarded and loss of ten yards) 2nd and 5 from Team A's 25 yard line (first down is not awarded since 10 yard walk off put them back inside the first down markers and replay the down)   Citing NFL rules would be helpful. I've read through them and am having trouble understanding how they apply to this situation. 
2100,USAHockey registration purpose?,"So I've been just recently mastering ice skating and I'm getting pretty good at hockey from practice and I'm considering vouching for a small team to join soon.  I gave a few proposals, but was asked if I was part of the USAHockey group and I am not (didn't see a reason for it or didn't understand the purpose).  I checked the website and I am unsure what it is exactly.  Is this like a union or something? I read the benefits, but what is the purpose?  [website]  registering with USA Hockey provides all of the advantages of an unregistered league while eliminating the disadvantages.   So is it a league, group, union, all of the above, etc.? Is it a good idea to join if I intend to play hockey in minor league, or is this only for non-professional hockey? Yes, I am in the U.S.  Perhaps anyone can shed some more details on the purpose of this registration with regards to hockey, hockey players, and playing hockey professionally (in other words, for money). "
2101,Were volleys considered unsportsmanlike in tennis?,"Is it true that in the past the volley was considered an unsportsmanlike shot in tennis? If so, why was this, and when did this attitude change?  I have heard this thing during a recent tennis match, and I found this article on italian Eurosport about the 1877 Wimbledon tournament, and I am curious about it. "
2102,"Do the laws of cricket allow running on the last ball, even after winning?","Say, teamA score is 368 (369 to win), and teamB is batting at 368 (or 366). One run (or 3 runs) will make them win. The batsman hits the ball for a six, so score is 374 (or 372) which is more than the required 369. Even then the runs are counted for the team and for the batsman.  Now, on the last ball, suppose the batsman did not hit a six, but ran for a single : teamB will win. Can the batsmen continue to run until the ball is dead ?  Why will they want this ? (A) If batsman is at 98 and wants to reach a century. (B) If batsman has a career total of 9998 and wants to reach 1000 runs. (C) If the batsman has a very high record strike rate, and wants to remain at that record strike rate. (D) In the championship, this is the last quarterfinal, &amp; even winning will put teamB equal to teamC, and the better runrate at the end of the quarterfinals will enable them to move to the semifinals. (E) Many similar situations can happen.  So coming back to the question : Do the laws of cricket allow running on the last ball, even after winning ?  In most of the matches I have seen, after winning, the batsmen do not even look where the ball is and start celebrating the win. If the rules did not allow them to run more, then fine. If the rules did allow it, then has there been any game where they did run more ? "
2103,Players who have won Champions League / Copa Libertadores and World Cup in the same year,"This ESPN Stats &amp; Info twitter feed states:     10 players in World Cup history have won the Champions League and World Cup in the same year.      With Real Madrid's Raphael Varanae of France, and Luka Modric &amp; Mateo Kovavic of Croatia in the final, there is guaranteed to be an 11th.     So, who are the 10 players who have achieved this feat previously?   Also, how many and who are the players that have won Copa Libertadores and a World Cup in same year?  "
2104,Can you use an opponent for leverage in basketball?,"If an attacking player sees a defender slip for example and fall to one knee. Can the offensive player use the defenders knee as a platform to jump, like running up and jumping off the defender?  Or a similar example of the same type thing, an attacker has the ball, jumps to attack the rim, but pushes their hand down on top of an opponents head generate more height, is this a foul? "
2105,Tossing the ball,"What does it mean by tossing the ball up, when spinning the ball?  I've seen it plenty of times in Cricinfo commentary, plus in the air as well.  Still couldn't find out, what does it represent? If anyone could shed in some light on this, would be great. "
2106,Why were MLS-style tiebreakers discontinued?,"In the 1980s and 1990s the NASL and MLS used an unusual kind of penalty shoot-out to decide drawn games.  The system used was like that used in hockey: starting from 35 yards out, an attacking player was given the opportunity to dribble the ball toward the goal and had five seconds to shoot.  The goalkeeper was able to run out to prevent the shot as they would in a one-on-one in normal play.  See, for example this youtube clip.  In the MLS in this period all games had to have a winner, so the system was routinely used to decide games that were drawn at full time.  Why was this format discontinued?  Was it a technical deficiency in the format or was it a matter of adopting IFAB rules more closely (e.g. by allowing drawn games)? "
2107,Why were the Football Euro championships such small tournaments decades ago?,"I have looked a bit into the past of the Football European Championships and I noticed that decades ago, they were really, really minuscule tournaments, if you take a look at the ""Euro"" 1972 in Belgium for example, were only 4 teams were participating. Of course they were more teams in its qualifying phase but back then it seemed that the qualified teams go straight into a semi finale, whereas in Euro Championships in the more recent past, like the one of 2004, had also a qualifying phase but still a group phase and quarter-finals afterwards.  My question is: Why were the Euro championships so short back then in contrast to today? Was it just simply because there were less countries prior to the downfall of the USSR and Yugoslavia or were there political reasons for that, e.g. that the FIFA did not want to give another international football tournament other than the World Cup such a prominent role (hence a similar policy like the FIFA still has nowadays for Olympic Football)? "
2108,What if the semi-finals are not completed before the scheduled start of the final?,"In Wimbledon 2018, the first semi-final (Anderson vs Isner) of gentlemen's singles went on for 6 hours and 35 minutes on Friday, 13 Jul 2018. This caused the start of the second semi-final (Nadal vs Djokovic) to be delayed well beyond its scheduled start time. Due to the curfew at 23:00, play was suspended after the third set, and it was decided to resume the game next day (Saturday) at 13:00.  The final is scheduled to be played on Sunday. If the second semi-final match doesn't finish on Saturday (due to its final set also going on for a long time, and perhaps ""assisted"" by rains, bad light, or other interruptions), then what happens to the final?  Moreover, if the semi-final is completed on Sunday, will the final be started soon after (thus putting the exhausted winner of the just concluded semi-final at a massive disadvantage)? What are the official rules of the Wimbledon tournament regarding this situation? "
2109,How are stoppage time goals deduplicated from regulation time goals?,"In football, goals can be scored in stoppage time, say the 46th minute of the first half, and also in the 46th minute of the game in the second half.  Is there any way of differentiating / deduplicating the stoppage time and regulation time goals? Has there ever been a collision? "
2110,Changing sides in tennis,"This site says:      A player has to win six games, and at least two more than the foe, to claim a tennis match. Players switch sides after every odd game, as in the first, third and fifth games, and so on. Players also switch sides at the end of a set if they're playing an odd number of games.   So, you start, 1-0, and change sides. If the game ends 6-0, 6-2 or 6-4 (or an even number of games), you play the first game of the new set, change sides, and you are back to the previous rule.  But what if a player wins 6-1 or 6-3? You win the set, then change sides. Now, you play a new set, do you change again at 1-0 (therefore after having played just one game), or wait until the 1-1 or 2-0, therefore now changing after an even number of games in the second set? "
2111,Lowest ball possession in the final match of the World Cup,"In the final match of the World Cup 2018 against Croatia, France won having 39% of possession of the ball (34% or even 32% according to other sources). In contrast, possession of the winner of other world cups have been:   2014: 61% for Germany 2010: 55% for Spain 2006: 51% for Italy 2002: 44% for Brazil   That's pretty much all I could find online. Is 2018 the world cup where the winner had the least possession of the ball in history? "
2112,What prevents a player/team from agreeing to a long-term contract after the franchise tag deadline?,"This afternoon is the NFL franchise tag deadline. I keep hearing radio hosts talking about it as the deadline to sign a long-term deal. However, I was under the impression that once this deadline passes, the tagged player is under contract for one year, and that any player under contract with a team could agree to and sign a new contract or a contract extension with that same team at any time, 365 days a year.  So what rule prevents a tagged player from taking the one-year franchise tag tender and continuing to negotiate with their team after today for a better deal before the season starts, even if it is merely a contract extension? And when can they agree to a long-term contract: after the season, free agency next year, or some other time? Or am I being misled here, either by the terminology I'm hearing on the radio or by my own assumptions?  "
2113,Why would a team trade for then waive a player?,Why would the Atlanta Hawks trade for Carmelo Anthony to immediately put him on waivers?  Is it just to clear cap space? 
2114,Proper grip of blade for shakehand,"When holding the paddle, where should I grip the most tightly?  I've been told to hold the paddle loosely because it makes it easier to switch from various stance. Are the main pressure points around the thumb and middle finger? The thumb having the higher pressure?  "
2115,"Is ""What happens on the pitch stays on the pitch"" appropriate sporting behavior?","(I asked this question on IPS.SE however I have altered the question to get a different insight from more sport minded people)  Recently, a new friend of mine started up a 5-a-side soccer session in which a group of his friends (that I had never met) would meet up and play a game for an hour twice a week. He invited me to come along as they were short one evening about a month ago and it has been a brilliant, enjoyable few weeks playing with them. (I am the youngest player at 21, and ages range up to 40 years old)  When he asked me to play initially, I mentioned to him:     I take playing soccer very seriously and change into a different person playing, nothing I say while playing should be taken to heart and if you're okay with that I'd love to play   While I am generally easy-going although stubborn in day-to-day life, when playing football I have an innate need to win. Because of this, when playing on with or against someone that doesn't seem to be interested I will vocally (and probably borderline aggressively) tell them to come on and put some effort in while playing.  Generally this is taken quite well as just me being passionate while playing, however when a new person (approx. 34/35) joined the last session and I shouted to put some effort in he seemed to be quite stunned and taken aback that I had confronted him on it.  After each session we usually have a few drinks and chat about games etc that are on and I have made some great friends because of this, but this new guy flat out refused to speak to me after the game because he didn't want to be friends with a younger person who thinks he can boss people older than him around.  I tried to explain that:     I had no intention of bossing him around and I'm sorry he thought that   but he did not listen and has ignored me since.  I am not worried about making up with this person as I only see him for an hour or two at soccer a week.  The general consensus of the group is for a serious game but with lighthearted fun in between. Is there a way of changing a person's understanding of what I say in an interpersonal way? The rest of the group understood what I was going to be like before I played as my friend told them what I said. Is the best way to just outright say it to a new member or is there an easier/more conventional way?  My question is: is it okay to be overly passionate/borderline aggressive when on the pitch playing a team sport without it carrying over to off the pitch interactions? "
2116,What is the definition for second chance points in the NBA?,"I have been reading this, but the details still feel unclear. [website]Short question: Will any shooting miss activate the possibility for second chance points as long as the ball stays on the team? (ie both regular shot and free throw). Or wont a missed free throw activate the possibility for second chance on the teams next shot?  The link says       If a player is fouled on a shot attempt and receives free throws, any points scored are not considered second chance points.   [1] I interpret this that if a player tries to shoot, but is fouled, this will not count ass a missed shot that will activate the chance to get second chance points on an eventual free throw. Am i right? "
2117,What happens if fielder catches ball at fence but drops ball over fence?,"Here's the scenario:  Batter hits pitch, ball looks to drop just outside the fence but a fielder manages to get to the fence quickly and climb on it to attempt a catch, raising his arm to try and get the ball on the glove. Fielder's glove touches the ball but accidentally drops the ball over the fence.  What happens in this case? Is this considered a home run or is this just an automatic double? "
2118,Can a traded player play for two teams in one week?,"Suppose a player in a Thursday Night Football game catches the eye of a team playing on the Sunday or Monday of the same Week, and a trade is quickly completed in the interim.  The player is able to show up at his new team's game, would he be allowed to dress/play for that game?  Is such a quick trade even permissible under league rules? "
2119,How much is the cost for a team to be registered in the CONCACAF Champions League?,"I'm wondering how much is the cost for a team to be registered in the CONCACAF Champions League. E.g, let's say the champion club from Haiti wants to play in the first phase of the CONCACAF Champions League against Caribbean teams. Do they have to pay to play the tournament? How much? "
2120,Is there a fixed duration for celebration in football,"In this video, you'll see on multiple occasions that a team celebrated just a tiny a bit too long, the referee let the match continue while the team is celebrating and the second team took the opportunity to score.  My questions are:   is there a fixed duration for goal celebration? could the referee continue the match without telling the team to stop celebrating?  "
2121,How many players a club can sell during a single transfer period?,I wanted to know how many players a club can sell during the transfer period? Are there any rules that FIFA (or UEFA) have issued regarding this matter? 
2122,Puck going out of bounds 'directly' off faceoff,"""When the puck goes outside the playing area directly off the face- off, regardless as to which player may have last contacted the puck,  the face-off shall remain in the same spot and no penalty will be  assessed to either team for delaying the game.""  Seems fairly straightforward, but I have a question about interpretation. Does this simply mean cases where the puck is pulled out of play by one of the two centers participating in the faceoff, and the puck goes out of play without touching or deflecting off a winger or defenseman, or can the language be interpreted to include situations where the puck is drawn back by either of the centers and it immediately glances off another player on either team as a direct result of the won faceoff being drawn to them?  In other words, does ""directly"" refer to timing and include immediate subsequent deflections as a result of a faceoff, or does it only refer to the centers taking the draw and either of them propelling the puck out of play (non-deflected) off the faceoff? The added part about delay of game seems to support the non-deflected case. Is that Right? "
2123,"Is there something called an offensive error in baseball? If not, why not?","Pittsburgh Pirates just made a couple of egregious ones. Frank Cervelli doubled. John Jaso doubled, and Frank Cervelli stopped at third, instead of scoring.  With one out, on the following play, Jordy Mercer flied out Cervelli came home. But John Jaso was ""picked off"" running to third, preventing the run from scoring.  Yet I didn't see these miscues scored as error. All the errors I see are defensive errors? Why is that, is that because offensive errors are so rare? "
2124,Difference in injury rates between girls' and boys' lacrosse?,"At the middle and high school level, are there differences in rates and severity of injury, between girls' and boys' lacrosse?  If there is a difference, what would explain it, in terms of actual play? Potential factors are safety gear, rules, customs, or style, but others can be included where necessary.  I have read some newspaper articles with photographs showing boys waving sticks and hitting players.  It seems to be called ""checking."" We got a glimpse of a girls' lacrosse game and got the impression they had less protective gear and used the sticks less as weapons. "
2125,Why not get the force out at third?,"There are runners on first and second with one out. The batter hits a grounder to third, which is fielded by the pitcher. The pitcher throws to first and gets the out. The runners on first and second advance. On the next at-bat, the batter singles and two runs score.  My question is why did the pitcher throw to first instead of third? Throwing to third would have been a force out (if I'm wrong about this, then of course that answers it). Furthermore, the pitcher was right next to third base when he fielded the ball, so it seems like the safer throw. Finally, getting the out at third would have prevented at least one of the runs scoring on the next at-bat. It seems like a better play all around. But the commentators never even mentioned this possibility, and in general I almost never see force outs at third. Can someone explain to me why this is? "
2126,Why was Eliud Kipchoge's time from Nike's Breaking2 not a world record?,"This is similar to Why was the marathon World Record not 2:03:02 in 2011? but the circumstances are different.  In 2017 Nike launched an effort to run a sub-2-hour marathon, which they billed Breaking2. At the culmination of the program, Eliud Kipchoge ran 2:00:25 for 26.2 miles, more than two minutes faster than the standing world record of 2:02:57 (set by Dennis Kimetto in 2014). The time is not recorded as the world record, however. Why not? "

2128,What Is the Ted Stepien Rule?,"I was reading the Wikipedia page of the Cleveland Caveliers.   It stated that former owner Ted Stepien was famous for always trading away the cavs' first round picks. It also stated that because of this the NBA created the ""Stepien rule"".     Stepien's repeated trades of the team's first overall draft pick led to the NBA creating the ""Stepien rule"" to prevent such trades.   What does this rule mean exactly? And why does the NBA have a problem with a team trading away all their first round picks? "
2129,Why did Hapoel Be'er Sheva go through over Southampton in UEFA EL 2016-'17?,"I scrolled through some soccer leagues and I accidentally came across the following situation. It's about Hapoel Be'er Sheva and Southampton from Group K in the 2016-'17 UEFA Europa League. To start, they both got 8 point in the group stage. So now we're going to apply the tiebreaker rules:   higher number of points obtained in the group matches played among the teams in question;   The two matches between Hapoel Be'er Sheva and Southampton resulted in a 0-0 and 1-1, so in this case they each scored 2 points (because of the two draws).   superior goal difference from the group matches played among the teams in question;   The goal difference among Hapoel Be'er Sheva and Southampton is in both matches zero.   higher number of goals scored in the group matches played among the teams in question;   In these two matches, Hapoel Be'er Sheva has scored 1 goal and Southampton also has scored 1 goal.   higher number of goals scored away from home in the group matches played among the teams in question;   Again, Hapoel Be'er Sheva has scored 1 goal and Southampton also has scored 1 goal.   if, after having applied criteria 1 to 4, teams still have an equal ranking, criteria 1 to 4 are reapplied exclusively to the matches between the teams in question to determine their final rankings. If this procedure does not lead to a decision, criteria 6 to 12 apply; superior goal difference in all group matches;   The superior goal difference of Southampton is +2 and that from Hapoel Be'er Sheva is 0.   Then why did Hapoel Be'er Sheva got through over Southampton if Southampton got a higher superior goal difference at rule 6? Did I miss something? "

2131,Has any two teams in the World Series ever get there without losing a game during the postseason?,"Related: Has there been a time the 2 NBA or NHL teams in the playoffs final series got there without losing any games?  MLB Postseason Format Timeline:   Before 1969, the team with the best record from the AL and the team with the best record from the NL during the regular season played in the World Series.  Between 1969 and 1993, there was one playoff round before the World Series (AL/NLCS).  Between 1995 and 2011, there were two playoff rounds before the World Series (AL/NLDS, AL/NLCS).  Since 2012, there has been a play-in game for Wild Card teams, adding an additional game to the format for Wild Card teams.   Has any two teams in the World Series ever get there without losing a game during the postseason? "
2132,How are combat sports legal?,"Sports such as boxing, UFC, MMA, etc involve heavy fighting. If such fights happen outside of the rink, the athletes would face criminal charges. So how are these events legal? Are there deals made with law authorities? "
2133,Black Ball: Can a player win a game by first hitting an opponents ball on a free shot?,"In a game where where player 1 is on black and player 2 still has balls remaining on the table. Given the scenarios where player 2 commits a foul giving player 1 a free shot, then on that free shot player 1 first hits one of player 2's remaining balls before sinking the black on the same shot. Does player 1 win in this case? If not, what is the correct flow of play following this?   The WPA rule book states that the ""Wrong Ball First"" rule is suspended on free shots. However, does this still apply on the black given that you are essentially winning off a foul shot?  Using this version of the rule book for reference: [website]"
2134,How can a baseball player's average per pitch be much lower than his overall average on Fangraph?,"I'm trying to figure out fangraph.com's heat maps. For example, Mike Trout's Average per Pitch looks like this:   (link)Heat Map (AVG/P)    Apparently the best he hits against pitches in any given location is 0.233 this season (as of 4/28/17), but his overall average is more than a hundred points higher at 0.337. How is that possible? "
2135,Why doesn't baseball severely punish pitchers who seemingly hit batters intentionally?,"Time and time again, pitchers intentionally hit batters who show them up (or for whatever reason), yet they (the pitchers) hardly ever get seriously penalized. Further, when they are penalized, it's usually only a 4-6 game suspension (of a 100+ game season). So my question is, given how incredibly dangerous a pitcher's fastball is, why doesn't MLB punish pitchers harder for hitting the batter?  I'm aware that there are ""unwritten rules of the game"", but honestly I think that's just an incredibly terrible excuse for bad behavior. The batter is completely defenseless, and the argument can even be made that the batter can't even properly do his job as an offensive player, due to the psychological effect of thinking that he's gonna get dinged. Parallels can be drawn between this and the NBA's rule of ""allowing shooters to come down in their space"". In the NBA, you can no longer contest a shot and move into the shooter's space, because doing this prevents them from coming down safely, and also prevents them from developing a psychological block (thinking that they're going to come down on someone's foot and twist their ankle when they go up to shoot). This leads to better shooting, better offense, and more entertainment for fans.  Though we can't always determine a pitcher's intention, shouldn't a reasonably hard suspension be enough to deter throwing at batters no matter what? If a pitcher knows he's gonna get a hefty suspension regardless of his intent, I feel like he'd be much more careful in his pitch placement.  I personally just feel like it would just be better for the game of baseball to leave out the intentional hitting of batters. So why hasn't baseball worked to change this yet? Does MLB feel like this isn't an issue? Is it just too deeply rooted in the culture for this ever to change? "
2136,Why are there no left handed catchers in baseball?,"Why is it seemingly forbidden for a lefty to play catcher?  Lefties would have an advantage fielding bunts and throwing to first, as they would already be oriented towards first when getting the ball.   When throwing to second, it seems meaningless which hand to throw from.   Throwing to third would require you to turn around, but I believe that throwing to first, either on a dropped third, bunt, or pickoff attempt is more common than throwing to third.   Is there something I'm missing? "
2137,What happens when ball touches net during serving?,"I found some information on rules, but I never found a clear answer to what should be done when a served ball touches the net. Is it point for opponent, or should the serve be redone? If redone - will it be redone regardless of how many times it hit the net? "
2138,Is the sweeper role obsolete with modern formations?,"There has been mention of a role in defense of football called ""Sweeper"". Wikipedia gives the following explanation.     The sweeper or libero (Italian: free) is a more versatile type of Centre back that, as the name suggests, ""sweeps up"" the ball if the opponent manages to breach the defensive line. Their position is rather more fluid than other defenders who mark their designated opponents. The sweeper's ability to read the game is even more vital than for a Centre-back. The catenaccio system of play, used in Italian football in the 1960s, notably employed a defensive libero.   My question relates to the diagram of field positions shown below. If the sweeper is played, there will be 5 in defense. But from reading the wiki page, it seems that the sweeper's role is to read the game so that he wins the ball by tackling the opposition attackers, and also to make the forward run to start the counter attack.  In that case isn't the role of the sweeper same as the defensive midfielder (DM) now, except that DM will be in front of the defenders?   Can we say now since the sweeper's responsibility is shared now by both the defensive midfielders and the Centre backs, the sweeper's position has become obsolete?   (click for full-size image) "
2139,In which racket sports can you hit the shuttle (or ball) with the head?,"In this video, Roger Federer hits the ball with his head. I know that in tennis, it is allowed to hit the ball with the head. And AFAIK, it's also allowed in table tennis.  Can you confirm that? And are there other racket sports where hitting the ball (or shuttle) with the head is allowed? "
2140,Is it legal in racket sports to pass the racket from one hand to the other?,"Can you hit with different hands during the same   point? set? match?   Also, is racket throwing authorised? "
2141,Basketball Tip-off possession and subsequent possession,"To begin a basketball game, a tip-off is typically used to determine the first possession of the game. Then, in the second half, the team that did not start with the ball in the first half gets the first possession (or TeamA-TeamB-TeamB-TeamA format for a 4 quarter game).  For the purpose of this question let's assume a 2 half game, because it is overall simpler, but I figure the rule associated with this situation would be similar for a 4 quarter game.  What happens the player at the tip-off from one team (say Team A) hits the ball out of bounds off the tip, without it touching any other player? Does possession go to Team B? Additionally, if possession does go to Team B, does Team B additionally start with ball possession in the second half (as if Team A had won the tip-off normally and subsequently turned it over on the first possession)? "
2142,What type of individual player incentives are allowed in the NFL?,"Recently, ESPN (and others) reported that the New Orleans Saints had instituted a ""bounty"" program. This program awarded players for inflicting game-ending injuries against the opposing teams and awarded different amounts of money depending on the type of injury. These types of individual player incentives are obviously deemed illegal by the NFL.  However, there have incentives written into player contracts regularly regarding total number of team wins, playoff wins, interception totals, sack totals, total number of yards rushing/passing or touchdown totals. As recently as March of 2012, San Francisco 49ers Linebacker Ahmad Brooks signed a contract extension that included incentives for wins and sacks.     Brooks has a base salary of [tex]2.5 million that year if he does not achieve certain sack totals.      In 2014, Brooks has a base of [tex]4.95 million becoming guaranteed for injury and skill if he is on the roster on April 1. However, that guaranteed total and base salary can be reduce by up to $2.5 million based on his 2013 sack production.      Brooks can void all de-escalators in the contract if the 49ers win 12 games, he has 93.2 percent playing time that season and San Francisco plays in the conference championship game, or if he has two prior seasons of 12 sacks or more.   Is this contract legal by rules of the NFL Collective Bargaining Agreement (or just general NFL League Policy)? If so, what types of individual player incentives are allowed or disallowed? "
2143,Overtime rules in table tennis and in doubles,"In table tennis, when both players are at 10. Who serves first? Does one pick who goes first? Or does it go to the first person that reached 10?  Also, in doubles table tennis how do those rules change? "
2144,What is the actual waiver wire?,"Saw a tweet from Adam Shefter, an ESPN NFL Insider, regarding Peyton Manning being released:     Still no NFL waiver wire, so any team reaching out to Peyton Manning now would be violating the rules.   What ""official wire"" is Adam Shefter, or any team or agent, actually looking at to know whether or not a player's release is official?  An email?  A fax?  An NFL ""tweet""? "
2145,Red and black side of table tennis raquet,There's a red and a black side on a table tennis raquet.   Does the color of the side have any significance? E.g. is the black side suppose to be used for the forehand and the red side used for the back hand? 
2146,Are there drills or methods for improving reaction time in table tennis or overall?,"Reaction time is critical to many sports. My sport in particular is table tennis.   Are there drills or methods that would allow you to improve reaction time? Or is it just a basis of pure repetition in table tennis?  A lot of times I'm a bit too slow returning serves. I'd like to address and fix this problem.  I'm looking to maintain the scope of this question to specific drills related to table tennis, although I'm open to hearing general drills or methods to improve reaction time if it does work toward the end result. "
2147,What are the rules for NFL restricted free agents that have a first round tender?,"For teams with multiple first round draft picks, what are the rules defining which first round draft pick that a team would need to give up if it signs a restricted free agent (RFA) that have the first round tender? An example would be the Cleveland Browns, which have the 4th and 22nd draft picks in the first round of the 2012 draft. One writer, Bill Barnwell, noted:     If we understand the rules right, a successful bid on Wallace would   force the Browns to give up their selection — the fourth overall pick   — and not the 22nd overall pick they received from the Falcons as part   of the Julio Jones trade last year.   Does anyone have a reference/citation to the rule that Mr. Barnwell mentioned? "
2148,How do tennis players get into tournaments?,"In tennis, I know there are multiple ways to enter a tournament (if there are more, I've never heard of them):   direct entry wildcard qualifying   How does a player get in using these methods?  I'm mostly curious about how the players get chosen for direct entries and who gets to participate in qualifying.  Does this depend on tournament size? "

2150,Are all of the lines on a tennis court the same width?,"I was at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden for the BNP Paribas Open and took the following photo of center court.    The end lines appear to be thicker than the other lines (including the service line). My questions are:   Is this an optical illusion or standard for tennis courts? Growing up playing tennis, I don't remember this being the case, but my memory may be poor on this detail. If standard, is this because tennis is filmed from the ends, and the parallax would make the lines look too thin? Or is there some other reason?  "
2151,What are the main advantages of sit-on-top kayaks? What makes them so popular?,"I own a 5.18m Sea-Kayak. Obviously a sit-in type with a watertight spray skirt. It has two hatches which also close to not let water in, even if forcibly submerged.  On my trips to other countries (recently Lithuania, USA, Canada, Croatia) I am always offered sit-on-top kayaks. Sit-in type of kayaks are sometimes available but not always. Less so in purely recreational setups, such as calm, but touristy lakes. Rental shops advertise them as:   being more fun have holes to let the water out are more stable are faster   As I see it, in fact they   have holes which let water in from below (not suitable for cold weather/water) are very sensitive to wind (hard on beginners, and for extended duration) have very little ability to hold direction (and are again thus more difficult to handle for beginners) do not have storage capacity for tours   So by my observation they are not good for beginners (hard to steer, wind sensitive), they are not good for experienced people (no hatches for storage, too slow, exposed to all elements).   Accordingly they would be especially bad for rental shops because those more often than not target beginners.  What makes them special? Why do rental shops go with them? What are the advantages? "
2152,Why do we have to wait for the goal line technology to be put into practice,   Possible Duplicate:   Why is FIFA against adding instant replay to the game?       After watching England's world cup match i was eagerly waiting for FIFA to introduce the goal line technology. But it hasn't come out yet.   What are the disadvantages of using it? In all other games now days technology is very much used and has resulted in a reduction of refereeing or umpiring errors.    What has FIFA got against the use of technology in the game?  
2153,Why is the rule of match suspension in Spanish league different?,I have heard that the suspension rule in Spanish league is different from rest of the places and tournaments. In all the leagues and tournaments I have watched it is 2 yellow cards or 1 red card for suspension. Is it different in Spain? If yes Why? does FIFA agree to it? Is there any other place where there is a difference in rule? 
2154,What has triggered the evolution of 6-0 formation in volleyball?,"I have been playing volleyball since childhood. I started off with a 4-2 formation (2 defenders and 4 attackers). Then we moved on to 5-1. (i.e. 5 attackers and 1 defender) But nowadays, I have seen a few teams playing 6-0 as it gives them the advantage of having 3 attackers all the time.  What are the pros and cons of this formation? Will teams be shifting to 6-1 from 5-1, like the earlier trend of 4-2 to 5-1? "
2155,What is the logic behind re-serving in volleyball and tennis?,"I have seen plenty of times a re-serve being awarded instead of giving the point to any of the team in both volleyball and I think tennis, too.  (I'm not sure if it's still the same in tennis).  I had always felt that a re-serve was an injustice.  What is the real logic behind it? Is it a fair thing? "
2156,"How does the skate work in backwards, front crossovers?","You are going backwards, with constant crossovers done in front. See here: Hockey Powerskating / Edgework Circuit (by m2hockey). I tried to recreate that move (and I failed), I barely moved backwards.  My current theory -- let's say I glide on left, and I am doing crossover with right. So left is on external edge, I do crossover, right is on internal edge. After crossover I go from internal edge to external, and then I do crossover with left.  However in this video it looks much simpler. What do I miss? "
2157,NFL: Why do kick coverage teams always run all the way down the field,"I've noticed this frequently in the NFL. When there's a kickoff that is downed in the end zone for a touchback (or is out of the back of the endzone), the coverage team still runs all the way down the field. Sometimes the receiving team is already walking off the field as the referees take the ball to the 20 yard line and still the coverage team is running full speed and they don't stop until they reach the end zone. (At which point they have to turn around and run back to their bench). Is this a macho thing? Intimidation? Young players trying to show their dedication and hustle to the coaches? "
2158,"As a new player, what football (soccer) skills can I improve exceptionally quickly to be a better team player?","I have recently joined a soccer (football) team at work playing as a right-back.    I have very low experience in playing although I am an avid fan of watching.    With limited time to practice, What skills could I work on to improve my ability in a short space of time?  In summary - which basic football skills have the greatest payback in the shortest amount of time? "
2159,Is it possible for football teams to lose points during the game?,"If football teams are in violation of rules or something, do they get a penalty deducted from their score?  Are there any other ways to lose points?  I don't see anything about this in the Beginner's Guide to Football, but I just want to make sure.  Thanks! "
2160,Is it possible to lose points while playing table tennis?,"Can you be deducted points for conduct during a table tennis match?  Also, if you are deducted points are you allowed a negative score? "
2161,Does a fast paced NFL offense tire out the defense more than the offense?,"NFL broadcasts of Philadelphia Eagles games are full of shots of the opposing team's defense struggling to catch its breath. The announcers often discuss how Chip Kelly's fluid, no-huddle offense wears out the other team's defense due to its pace--even though the Eagle's time of possession tends to be lower than that of offenses of otherwise similar quality.  I don't understand why a no-huddle offense would wear out the defense more than the offense. If the defense can't make substitutions, then neither can the offense (right?). Announcers will sometimes mention the Eagle's training and conditioning,  but I assume that all NFL teams have rigorous training and conditioning.  So is there something structural going on here: is defense inherently more tiring than offense? Is this especially true for fast-paced offenses?  "
2162,League Wide Queryable Databases,"Are there league wide queryable databases for any type of statistics for sports leagues? Does someone run them for MLB, NFL, NHL, NBA, BPL, la Liga etc.?   Are they SQL queryable? "
2163,Why don't pro squash players wear protective goggles?,"So I was watching some youtube clips of top squash players playing and I noticed that none of them wear goggles.   Why is this? You'd think at that level, where it's so competitive and they're hitting the ball harder than ever that it would be more important to protect yourself.  Do goggles affect their performance? "
2164,How much faster/more useful is swimming under water?,"Underwater dolphin kicks are often considered ""the fastest way of swimming"".  Dave Berkoff introduced underwater swimming and won Olympic golds in 1988. Rules were changed and now only allow for 15 m underwater after start/turns.  Michael Phelps is considered a master of underwater swimming and his gold on 200 m freestyle in Beijing was, according to many, secured by his underwater kicks after the last turn.  It may appear like a simple relation. - Swim under water and gain time. But some facts make the relation complicated, I believe.  Many were impressed by Ryan Lochte swimming 50 m under water on 20.8 s at a clinic. It is fantastic but probably not very much faster than Lochte can do in regular freestyle. Swimming without breathing will also accumulate lactic acid.  Many say Michael Phelps achieved a considerable distance advantage by underwater work in one turn only (as described above). To get this advantage, the speed must be considerably higher  than Lochte had, recording 20.8/50 m.  And all swimmers do not make full use of the allowed 15 m swim under water. (Some say Phelps' large and supple feet make him more suited for underwater swim.)  So to me there are simple questions about this matter that have not been answered. Questions like:   How much faster is underwater swimming after a start/turn? Why don't all swimmers make use of the maximally allowed 15 m under water? How useful is underwater swimming for competitive swimmers?  "
2165,Net forehand with topspin to high balls: how to practise them?,I want to improve my forehand near the net. I hit ball to a wall with a specific target but the rebound is so fast that it is not really equivalent to high ball shots. How do you train forehand near the net?  Example     Topspin forehand like the Federer below near the net.        
2166,Quick free kick prevented by opponent,"I was recently playing football in a recreational league, when a teammate was fouled. The referee awarded us a direct free kick, and seeing that the opponents were choosing to argue with the referee instead of defending, I took the opportunity to take the free kick quickly.  I placed the ball in the correct position, and as I went to take it, an opponent moved and stood directly in front of the ball, making no effort to get back. I kicked the ball anyway, hoping it would go through his legs. Instead, the ball became caught between us and since it was in play, I began kicking at it trying to get it out.  The referee began yelling, asking me what I was doing, and then told me to wait for the whistle. At this point, all of their defenders were allowed to get back into position, marking all of our attackers and forming a wall in front of the ball. The referee then told me he didn't have to allow a retake, but he was ""doing me a favour"".  Was this handled correctly by the referee? As a supplementary question, if the referee is refusing to enforce the required distance correctly, what strategies can I use to avoid opponents preventing me from taking a quick free kick? "
2167,Why does the NFL enforce injury report rules?,"The NFL is investigating why quarterback Tony Romo wasn't listed on the official injury report despite his admission that he was playing with broken ribs.  In 2009, the NFL fined the Jets $125K for not disclosing a Brett Favre injury.  What injuries have to be reported? And why? This policy seems like it could pose a threat to injured players as it draws attention to players and body parts that could be targeted by opponents during game time.  What is the reasoning here? "
2168,NFL teams with back to back shutouts,"St. Louis Rams beat the Oakland Raiders in week 13 (of 2014 season) by a score of 52 to 0, and went on to beat Washington Redskins the following week 24 - 0.

2170,How does the Sidearm™ cricket ball thrower work?,"I have seen the videos where Graham Gooch is able to do easy throwdowns for batting practice - fast deliveries, slower ones, off-spinners, leg-spinners.  Can you tell me how and when the ball is released from the sidearm? Is the sidearm merely a cup holder for the ball and the ball is just flung at the batsman? (similar to a trebuchet probably?)

2172,What causes the imbalance where back points towards the side after serving?,"I am analysing the serving here where the player gets angular momentum not towards the field but to the side.      where you see back pointing towards the side, bad. In comparison Federer 1m12s gets the momentum towards the field.       where you see the back pointing towards the back of the field after serving, good.  Is the back direction after serving due to bad center of mass? How to fix it? And what is causing it with the red player?  "

2177,Computing win probabilties for NFL teams,"My fantasy team uses a playoff system that Bill Simmons suggested a few years ago. In order to study it, I'd like to run Monte Carlo simulations of last year's post-season. To do so, I need to be able to compute the win probability for a pair of teams given the site of the game. Note this is not a prediction against the spread, just the orders of one team winning. This format also means that I can't use Vegas's point spreads, money lines, etc. because I need to be able to make predictions for pairs of teams that didn't meet in real life.  I thought that it would be easy to find a suitable model online, but I haven't been able to. Here's what I've tried:   AdvancedNFLStats: In principle they supply all the needed information but I've been unable to reproduce their results. You can see a long post from me at the end of the week 7 team efficiency page that has gotten no replies. I would love to be able to get this model working. NFL Predictions uses stats from AdvancedNFLStats to run Monte Carlo paths through the post-season in some way that's slightly different from what AdvancedNFLStats does, but I can't find any info on the methodology. Simple Ranking System a.k.a. simple rating system: is focused on predicting margin of victory, not probability. More info here. The creator gives a formula for computing win probabilities here, but it's not clear to me that the same constants can still be used. Jeff Sagarin's ELO ratings: also aimed at point spreads, not probabilities   This page seemed promising at first but I didn't get anywhere following up on all the links. "

2183,"In American football, purpose of motioning the slot receiver","While watching a play with the New England Patriots you often see the z receiver or slot receiver (correct me if they aren't equivalent terms) motion towards the quarterback but then moves back to his original position?  To me as a outsider, it seemed pointless that he moved to near the center position and then back to his original spot.  Wikipedia does discuss the purpose motioning but it speaks about changing formations. If the receiver moves to his original position the formation is the same.  Also, I could see motioning to the other side would make sense to provide extra protection for a screen to a running back play.   During the presnap is there a purpose for motioning the slot receiver toward the center and back to his original position? Is it to test the defensive positions?  "

I ask if it is smooth or is it like a surface of a golf ball.  Water skis are supposed to run on water with very little friction. Is a smooth underside of the skis better than a surface with tiny dents or perhaps with low waves or what? It must have been studied which kind of surface glides with least friction on/in water. What kind of surface has the least friction? "
2187,Has the US Men's Soccer Team played a game outside of the USA or the host country?,It's become somewhat common for North or South American national soccer teams to play friendly games (or even sometimes non-friendlies) in the Untied States or Canada against another national team.  Has the US Men's National Soccer Team ever done something like this? i.e played a team in a non-tournament outside of either the USA or that team's country? 
2188,NBA / MLB ball boy interference,"In the NBA, when the ball is in one end of the court, a ball boy usually squeegees the other end. In some cases the ball boy is caught off guard by a steal or an unexpected play and in some cases almost gets in the way of players. Although I have never seen it happen (I'm sure it has), what happens if a ball boy inadvertently interferes with a player?  In the MLB, this same principle happens as well. When a player goes to the side of the field to try to catch a pop fly, sometimes they run into the ball boy. In the MLB, what happens if a ball boy inadvertently interferes with a player?  As you can see in the picture below, this ball boy is interfering with play B.J. Upton.   "

When I was buying skates, they guys in the shop adviced me to wear them, but now when I am suffering ugly lace bites I doubt the logic behind it:   the skate feel is more puffy, because of all cushioning from all sides the foot is placed higher I cannot insert anything extra in front, because there is already very little room inside skate   So maybe it is all wrong, and I should go with single pair of socks, get maximum fit from the skates, and forget about wearing anything extra because of the folk-tradition?  I am not looking for opinions, I am looking for hard reasons. "

2197,Is baking the skates equivalent of quicker breaking them in?,"Will baking give me something that (after some time) breaking in will give me as well? Or will it be completely ""new quality"" not reachable by simply skating (even for long period)?  If the latter, is baking a must just right after shopping, or one can skate, say, for a week and then bake the skate. This is safer for potential selling skates.  I have Bauer Supreme One.7 and Vapor X.70 in mind. "
2198,Why there is no ICC rankings for women's test cricket?,"ICC has been conducting test cricket matches for women since 1934. We can also see some recent test matches for women.  But, there is no official ICC rankings were provided by ICC for women's test cricket. Rankings are available only to ODIs and Twenty20I matches.  Is there any particular reason for not having rankings for women in Test matches? or Does ICC has any limitations(no. of matches/ no. of nations) to provide ranks for particular format of cricket? "

2201,Who can compete at Universiade?,"   Under which conditions are sportspeople  eligible to compete at Universiade?   Additionally, I also wonder to which extent it is common that same person represents a country at both world championships and universiade.     I have tried to Google for universiade olympic medal site:wikipedia.org to see whether I find some people who won medals at both Universiade and Olympic games. Going through the first few pages of results of that search I have noticed Javier Sotomayor and Amanda Beard.  My guess is that this is less common in the most popular (and best paid) sports such as football, ice-hockey, basketball. (I suppose that not many players would risk injury at a less prestigious event. I am also not sure about the collision of the dates with other competitions; professional teams probably would not be willing to let an important team member to leave their professional team for Universiade.) However, I do not have any data to support this guess. "
2202,Powder Problems Snowboarding,"This is a big issue that I am having when I am doing snowboarding runs on powder. Usually, when there is fresh powder from overnight or accumulation during the day, I tend to ""trip over"" and lose my balance over accumulated powder debris. What type of skills/drills can I do to make sure that this does not happen ?   I am able to do powder turns just fine in green level but when at times, It is really easy for me to pick up speed and lose control where I just trip over. When it gets to blue and black runs, I tend to really have this issue of tripping over since the snow is much deeper. While at really steep runs, I tend to do a turn (say toe turn) and while switching to my heel turn, I tend to traverse horizontally with my board and fall on my butt. Could someone provide some advice on how I can get better ?  I also tried to lean back but didnt exactly shift the bindings to the back (but could this really make that large of a difference) ?   Thanks "
2203,Is a batsman out when the ball(hit by the batsman) naturally turned back to his stumps(but ball first went out of his crease),"Is a batsman out when the ball naturally turned back to his stumps , but ball first landed out of his crease?  This happened to us when we played cricket last week , the bowler was a spinner , batsman hit the ball and it landed almost at the middle of pitch, then spinned(rotated) back and hit the stumps.  I was on the fielding side and we appealed for out! but it was denied , and explanation was :      A batsman can not be given out as the ball first landed out of his   crease.   Is there any rules like this ?   We were playing among friends(No official umpire). "
2204,How much does a back protector/vest add in additional safety?,"After seeing the news about a recent skiing accident in Germany (Two people collided with each other and afterwards with a snow cannon, both dead) I was wondering how much extra protection a back protector offers. In the report it was noted that both were wearing helmets, and none of the helmets was damaged. Therefore: How much does a back protector/vest add in additional safety? When is it worth, and when useless? "
2205,Why is the doubles match still played when the round is already won by a team in Fed Cup?,"A Fed Cup round consist of 2 national teams playing 5 matches(4 singles &amp; 1 doubles). Whoever wins 3 matches wins the round.   Why do teams still play a dead rubber doubles match when the round is already won by a team? ie. If team A wins the first 3 singles matches, thereby winning the round, they skip the 4th singles match but still play the remaining doubles match which is essentially a dead rubber. Why? "
2206,Counting random shots (foosball),"Is there a definition of foosball random shots?  Do people track them somehow for fun as a ""debt"" as part of championship ladder? "
