0,Archiving digital documents for a long term usage,"How I can be sure that we are able to read an .docx document in about 100 years?

I want them to be readable and accessible for the near future (10 years), but if it is possible, up to 100 years!   Which format would be advisable? "
1,Long-term storage of personal belongings?,"So I have a lot of stuff and a lot of space in my parent's house and and obviously, I want to move some of my stuff to them (mostly paperwork, some packaging, catalogues, etc. - typical ""hoarding"" items).  What are some practices / what should I do to ...   prevent stuff from degrading and prevent pests from spreading / catching on (moths, silverfish, ...)?   I thought about putting everything inside cardboard boxes, but this is obiously too little to keep moths etc. out. Should I put everything in vacuum bags? Is this enough? Should I put my stuff in the freezer overnight just in case to kill anything and everything? Should I put my stuff in an airtight box (plastic? metal?)? Should I fill said box with a noble gas so that no chemical reactions happen?  Any advice is greatly appreciated. Also, please move my question to another board if this is not the right board; however, I couldn't find a better fit. "
2,How to prevent or remove rust on the inside of a paint can?,"When I complete a painting project, I usually have some paint left over in the paint can that I store for later use. After much time has passed (often year(s)) I need to do some touch-ups, and when I remove the lid from the paint can there is often a bunch of rust around the mouth of the paint can, and possibly also the lid. This rust inevitably flakes off and falls into the paint.  Is there a way to prevent this rust from forming in the paint can? If not, is there a way to remove rust flakes from paint? "
3,Deodorizing a smelly dishwasher,"I recently moved into a new place with two others, and we've found our dishwasher to be unusually stinky. A day's worth of rinsed-off dishes is enough to get this really funky smell, completely unlike anything I ever experienced living alone. The other two have lived together for many years and never experienced anything like this either.  Is there something we should be putting in the dishwasher to remove the odor? We shouldn't have to run it every single day, should we? "
4,How do I stop the collars on my collared shirts from twisting?,"After every wash/dry, the collars on my collared shirts often start to twist in a weird way.

Does this event have to do with the material of the shirt? "

Thanks "
6,How to prevent NiMH batteries from leaking?,"I have a low-power device (2mA max), wherein my NiMH batteries tend to leak.  Following the advice of How do I prevent batteries from leaking?, I now have Low Self-Discharge batteries; however, they still leak when in this device.  Why can this be?   I suspected this might be due to overdischarging before being put in the charger; however, the battery that leaked today measured 1.16V when taken out, so this is not why. I have other ideas of why this can be (e.g. I have to hit the device to get the battery to pop out; maybe the reason is purely mechanical?); however, I don't want to lose a battery for every idea that turns out to be wrong.   What are other reasons NiMH batteries can leak in such a scenario?  I would like some opinions, so I can assess which of those are likely, and test the most likely ones first.  p.s., I have all sorts of battery test equipment; so if some idea of yours would require something, you can assume I have it.

9,Unlock a suitcase with a possible broken lock,"The lock of my suitcase works by having a bar through the holes of  two zipper sliders, and having a lock controlling if the bar can be moved away from the sliders.  When I unlock the lock, I first rotate the lock to give it the pin number so that the bar becomes movable, and then pull the the handle on one side of the bar so as to pull the bar away from the zipper sliders.  (In the following picture, the bar is hidden and the handle is the silver one on the left of the sliders, and I pull it to the left to move the bar away from the holes of the sliders.)  But today, after I gave the lock the pin number and when I pull the handle of the bar, I heard some clicking sound, and can't move the bar  by pulling the handle.. I guess the clicking sound meant something went wrong.    Is it possible to unlock the suitcase, so that I can retrieve the items inside? I would like to keep the zippers undamaged. Is there some way to pull the hidden handle away from the zipper sliders, so that the sliders can be released? Is the lock repairable?   If not, can the suitcase be secured in some way after unlocking? (I think I will buy a lock to lock the two zipper sliders together)   Thanks!   "

But on the plugin area, I can't seem to remove the ""yellow"" color. How can I clean this yellow area?   "
11,How to prevent creases and imprints while hanging clothing to dry to prevent ironing?,"Wet clothing has to dry. My only option to get it dry is to hang it. (no dryer)  There are a few options to do this, which both get the job done:   hang the items of clothing on the line as they are use pegs   The problem with these is that they introduce creases and/or imprints from the pegs that look awkward and make ironing the clothing necessary.  Note that for formal attire ironing can hardly be circumvented, which is perfectly fine. But I don't see the point in ironing the bulk of t-shirts that I wear every day, especially if it is mostly because of the creases introduced while drying.  Even if hanging a wet t-shirt perfectly without any creases, the line still produces a very distinguishable imprint. Sometimes that's still visible even after ironing.  At the moment, I concoct an experiment with a coat hanger. It's not an ideal one because it's made out of wood and not too thick. It's still thicker than a wire hanger though or the clothesline for that matter. I guess a plastic coat hanger with thicker shoulders would be ideal. If that means putting all t-shirts on coat hangers, so be it. That saves me from folding them.  Any ideas on that? The ideal solution would be to make ironing obsolete for these kinds of every day items of clothing like t-shirts. Is there any problem with that? Say for example, should clothing be ironed for some other reason than removing creases?  What other solutions aside from coat hangers are there? "
12,How to keep laptop on your lap and still be safe?,"I have been reading a lot of about how using laptop on one's lap is not safe for health (skin disease, fertility etc.)  I am in a situation where I need to be working from a living room sofa, and I need to use my laptop on my lap. What would be safe way to use it ? Will a lapdesk for laptops protect me from the laptop radiation ? Any other suggestions ? "
13,How to tell a technical support call center worker that I am technically inclined?,"Sometimes I just want to scream at people ""I know what I'm talking about!"". Ideally, I'd like a more polite way of saying this that won't be taken offensively, and can be said at the beginning of a call to avoid the ""have you tried turning it off and on again"" and similar portions.  I have tried many things, including:   ""I know what I'm talking about"" - is impolite, annoys them, doesn't work ""Can you skip that part? I've already done that"" - Sometimes it works, sometimes they don't believe me, sometimes they tell me they can't(‽) Purposefully dropping hints ranging from very subtle to not subtle at all ""Shibboleet"" - response is one of ""What?"", ""Huh?"", or ""Sorry?"" ""Can I speak to a technician?"" - response is either a large dollar amount per hour, ""No"", or a redirect to a supervisor ""Can I speack to a supervisor?"" - if I get a supervisor, they don't help anymore than the first person   And nothing seems to work. Either the message doesn't get across, or they don't believe me, or something. Since I've exausted all the conventional solutions, I've started looking into unconventional solutions (perhaps if I speak klingon to them?).  P.S. Is there a better name than ""technical support call center worker""? "

16,How do I remove a Daddy Long-Legs egg sac without breaking it open or killing the spiders?,"Daddy long legs (Pholcus phalangioides) are fond my bathroom. I can normally coexist with them; they don't disturb me, I don't disturb them, and they're too much of a pain to move when they're on the ceiling.  However... sometimes, one comes in bearing an egg sac.     (Image courtesy WikiMedia Commons.)  This poses a much more significant annoyance. The last time I tried moving one of these, it exploded into about three dozen spiders. I fled. That many spiders is too much for me. One or two I can coexist with. 28 like there were last time? No way in hell.   I don't want to kill any spiders, though. I'd feel worse about that than living with them while they move out into the great beyond. So, that being said...  How do I move the egg sac without:   breaking the egg sac, or harming the spiders?  "
17,Cleaning a blood stain from a silk tie,"A friend of mine recently moved to a pretty arid climate, and has been experiencing nosebleeds. While he's trying to fix that, he kinda wrecked a brand new silk tie the first day he wore it :(  Since he's new to the area, he doesn't know which dry cleaners around can be trusted with cleaning ties (apparently, if they don't know what they're doing, it can come out worse than when it started).  So, until my friend finds a cleaners he can trust, is there anything he can do with his tie? See picture, below.

18,Open closed zipper without pull tab,"Related: How do I quickly open or close a jammed zipper?:   In an emergency situation, what would be the fastest way to open a zipper, provided that the use of the pull tab is disabled, and access to the top stop and box pin are inaccessible?

19,Can I obtain that jeans color with bleach?,"I heard one can add bleach in washing machine in order to lighten the colour of a pair of jeans.

Should I add some washing powder too or just bleach?   "
20,How to repair and clean traffic cones?,"We have some short and tall traffic cones. Some of them are out of maintenance, and need to be repaired &amp; cleaned. The two big questions are:   How can I clean the traffic cones? How can I repair the traffic cone's white bands?   They look like this:    As you can see, there are three types of traffic cones, from left to right as defined 1, 2, and 3. Number 1 is dirty; number 2 is both dirty and damaged; number 3 on the right is short and repaired temporarily.    You can see the dirty cones contain oil, dust, etc. and need to be cleaned. Which product should I use without harming the plastic surface and it's colour?    To be clear, I bought a thin reflective band in order to surround the cone, but according to the geometric rules, if I use a rectangle sided band on a cone, I will face some material gaps that I don't want. Also, the problem is that bands are very expensive here in Turkey. "
21,How to stop shoes from squeaking on hard floors?,"I have a pair of pretty nice shoes that I love, except when I'm going to work!  We have hard linoleum-style flooring in most places, and carpet only in the office area where I work. When I have to go to another area, my shoes squeak very loudly.  I have tried other sources of information for this problem, but to no avail. The squeak is coming from the shoe to the ground; I tested this by taking my insoles out and walking, and the squeak was still there. My shoes are thoroughly dry, and there are no rocks or things stuck between the few lines it has on the bottom.  The warranty period has passed, and I only started recently wearing them more than once a month.  What can I do to stop the squeaking, and annoying co-workers? "
22,How to clip/clamp/clutch/pinch side of faulty old LCD monitor screen?,"  Probably due to old age, the screen of my old Sony SDM M51 monitor flickers. The Sony representative advised that inside the lower left side (hereinafter abbreviated as LS) of the monitor (as depicted in red above), parts nearing the front of the screen have loosened from parts at the back. So  the only solution is to clench, grip, or squeeze the front and back of the red area (eg by hand), which has eliminated the flickers for the past years. Alas, the detachment worsened a few days ago, to the extent that my hands hurt and the LS now needs continual compression and grasp to stop flickering.   So what can I use to resolve this problem? I tried a large binder clip which only works when my hand clings to the clip; as soon as I stop holding onto the clip, it flings itself off because the LS is too thick.    Footnote: Please advise on apter words to describe this problem (I struggle to find the perfect diction). Google effected the original image.  "
23,How to stop a trashbin from stinking,"Okay, so we have bin collection once a week. For clarity sake, this is what our bin looks like:    So basically, occasionally the bag wears out and we loosen it so that it gets thrown out when the garbage collection comes, leaving the bin empty. The bin continues to smell even when there isn't the bag (or rubbish) inside of it. It's even clean inside the bin, which ends up in me having to wash the bin out.  Are there any options to keep said bin ""smelling nice"" / ""not stinking""? I'm thinking of a more permanent solution (removing the smell), not masking the smell. Would Baking Soda be the option of choice? "
24,How to cut open a pita bread?,"I recently tried making a pita sandwich type thing, naturally it didn't go anywhere near as well as it did in the link I provided. This is mainly due to the fact I couldn't cut open or separate the pita so that I could essentially 'stuff' it.  I am using pretty standard pita bread, nothing fancy, and I haven't cooked them or heated them up or anything (my guess is that that would help with the cutting) and it really bothered me as I was looking forward to a nice pita sandwich for lunch!     Does anyone have any good techniques or hacks that makes opening a pita up much easier?   I've cut the bread in half so my desired goal is to have two half pita sandwiches but alas, no luck. Below is an image of what I am aiming for.    I have tried:   Pulling the two sides apart with my hands Pushing flat against a work surface and trying to slice open with a knife   Any new suggestions? "
25,What is the perfect microwaving time for my food?,"Ever since I started working in this company I'm taking my lunch (leftovers of the dinner last night) to the office in a microwavable container, because we have a small kitchen including a microwave. I'm sure a lot of you also do this.  I figured out that microwaving for the exact same time results in different warmth of the food. I know that a microwave heats the food up with radio waves which are extremely efficient on liquids. That's why the plastic of microwavable containers / plates don't melt / get extremely hot and only the food is being heated. Ergo soup heats up faster than rice (without sauce of course), for instance. So I know why my food doesn't get equally hot every time.  But how can I estimate the time my microwave needs to heat up my food to an eatable warmth? Of course this is depending on the power of the microwave. The one I'm using has a wattage of about 700W (if I remember the manual correctly), so maybe a scale for time &amp; wattage would be helpful (does double wattage result in half the heating-time?).  To get the hacky part into this:    Is there a special hack when it comes to the food itself?  Does mixing the dry &amp; moist parts of the food affect total microwaving time? Or does it just heat more evenly? I usually just mix after microwaving. Does it matter where I put my container in the microwave? Does the position of the food in my container affect microwaving-time?  Is there any hack (not technical) that I can use on the microwave?   I know there are some rather technical questions here, but I'm pretty sure there are some hacks you can use when microwaving. If you're not a microwave expert just ignore the technical questions and share the experience you made when it comes to microwaving as fast as possible. "

27,How to find a mosquito at night?,"Recently I'm suffering from a problem:  In the middle of the night, a mosquito just keep bzzzing in my ears, but when I move, it stops, but after a minute, it bzzzing again.  I've tried using mosquito repelling incense, it worked at first, but then after several days, the mosquito bzzz again. I tried turning on the lights in the bedroom to find, and I found the mosquito at first, but it flew too fast that it just disappear after &lt; 0.5 sec.  I also bought this one:    But it doesn't help.  I also thought of buying a Mosquito Killing Racket, but it's hard to kill the mosquito in the middle of the night using this cause I can't find it.  I've also taken a look at this post: How do I find and kill a single mosquito in the middle of the night?  Unfortunately the methods doesn't help very much.  So is there any other way to find the nasty mosquito at night? "

30,removing corrosion on the contacts of an Apple USB-to-Lightning cable,"After keeping my iPhone data/charging cable in the car for too long, I have the problem described here which is that the tiny contacts on the ""lightning"" end of the cable have become corroded, and the cable no longer works.  I'm not even sure what chemical factors are causing it to happen—moisture, perhaps?—but apparently others have reported that it happens when you leave the cable in your car (which, to save hassle, I would ideally like to do).  Wherever I've seen the issue discussed, the ""answer"" always seems to be to replace the cable.  But these cables are expensive and replacing any physical object on a regular basis is tedious. Is there any kitchen chemistry I can use to remove the corrosion?  Or to prevent it from happening in the first place?      "

Related:  Lifehacks SE: What is a good way to organise and identify keys on a keyring?

34,How to dismantle/repair a broken umbrella,"I have a doppler foldable umbrella but it broke after few years of good service. Each of its ""arms""(is this the right term in English?) has three foldable parts and the thing that broke is the third part of one of them. It seems it the metal got rusty and with time it broke. This is my best effort of a picture where it broke     I have a second older umbrella that is the same so I thought I could take this part from it. However I am having trouble dismantling the junction(don't know the right name in English). Here are two photos from both sides of it    and .  I need to remove the small metallic bit holding the two black parts. These pictures also show a different angle of where the umbrella broke.   My idea is to take apart this bit on both umbrellas and carefully cut the threads holding the fabric on both umbrellas. Then I will replace the broken part with a good one from the other umbrella and I sew the fabric back. I think I will need to use wire or something similar to fix the joint.   Does anyone have an advice on how to dismantle such junction? Do you have any other idea of how to repair my broken umbrella?  "
35,How to effectively prevent the shower curtain from snuggling?,"My shower curtain does not stay where it belongs. When I start showering I wet it and then press it to the wall, but when I put the shower head up on the shower head holder, the curtain starts flying inwards.  I figured that the hot water heats the air which then drifts outwards through the only possible way - which is near the roof of the bathroom, creating a zone with less air pressure and pulling the curtain inwards.  This is not only annoying, it also allows the splashing water to spill itself onto the floor as the curtain is moving and therefore not in the way of the water, where it should be.   Any suggestions? Has anyone solved this problem? "
36,How can I attend a contest and go to the airport on the same day?,"Note: This is my first question here; I logged in just a few seconds ago. My question is not exactly on-topic, but I don't know any other SE site appropriate for this. This site is the closest to my nature of problem. Before you go on to downvote this, stop and think. Do you happen to know just the right SE site for this question? If so, feel free to delete this note and migrate it to that site. If not, close it or find an alternate solution.  I live in Bangladesh. A nation-wide programming contest is going to be held on 24th March. The contest is vitally important for me, and I must participate.  However, my grandparents have their flight on the very same day. Me and my family have to leave them off at the airport and bid them farewell.   I don't really prioritise this over the contest, but I'm more or less forced to. I'm only 13 and can't stay at my house alone, while the rest of my family will be gone outside for hours. Also, I need an adult to take me to the contest.  Again, I really want to see my grandparents before they fly off to the US. And it'll be quite some time before they come back to Bangladesh. Even though the contest will be on next year, participating this year is very important for me for reasons not worth explaining right now.

41,Keeping raccoons out of a dumpster,"What is the best way to keep raccoons out of a dumpster?   At work we have a simple, split lid, top load dumpster like this one:    And we have a pretty large population of raccoons that seem to be pretty inventive when it comes to getting inside of it and pulling trash and food out.  The waste management company we use wont allow us to modify the dumpster. They own it and more or less rent it to us.  We've tried a few ways of ""tying"" the lid shut, but the raccoons will reach a hand between the two lids and pull out what ever they can, they also tend to chew on what ever we use to tie them down with, so strapping the lid shut doesn't work very well and the straps don't last long.  I've heard we could use cougar urine as a deterrent, but it rains fairly often where we are and handling urine on a regular basis is a little unappealing.   This should go without saying, but I'm also not looking to kill or otherwise harm the animals.  So, I'm trying to find a good way to keep the animals out, while still allowing us easy access, without modifying the rented dumpster or harming the wildlife... Any thoughts? "

45,How can I more quickly warm up the interior of my car during winter?,"In the winter, after turning on the ignition, it takes approximately 15 minutes for the vents in my car to begin blowing hot air. Before that time, the vents blow cold air even if the ""heat"" setting is turned on. Sometimes, it is okay if I wait 15 minutes, but if I'm in a hurry, this method doesn't work.  What can I do to cut this time down? For example, would it cut the time down if I did not turn on the heat until after a certain period of time? Does it matter if I drive or if the car is idle as it warms up? "

47,Plastic wrap sticking to spine of Blu-Ray disc packages,"One thing that drives me nuts about Blu-Rays is that for some reason the packaging methodology causes the outer cellophane-like wrap to stick to the spine of disc case, so when you take it off, there is a messy residue all along the spine which looks terrible, because the spine is the part you see when the case is sitting on a shelf.  To prove I am not making this up, there is a discussion thread on this exact problem in a different forum with some proposed remedies which I have found not to work very well.  My questions are:    why is this happening? how can I get the plastic residue off the spine of the case?  "
48,How can I legally identify pesky robocallers?,"I am planning to move to New Hampshire soon, and one of the great benefits of living there is that unlike most states, private citizens can prosecute misdemeanors. That means once I become a New Hampshire resident I can summon and bring to court people or organizations that are breaking the law, so long as the law is a misdemeanor and I am the aggrieved party.  So, what kind of criminal organization am I thinking about? Robocallers of course!!!  In New Hampshire, the Federal laws concerning illegally calling someone on the Do-Not-Call (DNC) list are replicated by local statute. That means the criminal penalties for illegally calling somebody on the DNC in New Hampshire are legally actionable. I think the penalty is $1500 per call or something like that.  So, my only problem is identifying the perps. Obviously if they are in Pakistan there is nothing I can do, but a lot of ""Rachel"" calls apparently originate in the US and are made by US-based organizations. Can I just subpoena the phone company to get true of the identity of the caller, or is it going to be more complicated than that?  I know I can get an answer here by just starting an action in court and I am sure the phone company's lawyer will explain everything to me, but I am hoping somebody here is an expert in call tracing and give me the lowdown on how to do criminal phone tracing ahead of time so I have a leg up on the process.

49,How to shade bubbles well on optical answer sheets,"I constantly have exams that require to shade bubbles on an optical answer sheet. Usually I will shade it with a 0.5 (2B) lead mechanical pencil. I think I shade quite hard sometimes(not sure if the pressure matters), then when I try to erase my choices on the bubble, I realise there are still some remains on it (about 50% of its previous darkness) on the bubble, and I do not know if the machine will still detect that previous bubble as filled and be unable to conclude my final option.   Is there a way to get a good way to do exams related to these? Like getting a good eraser from a certain brand or making sure my eraser can lead to a cleaner erasing job?   "

54,Straightening curled in file-folders,"Going to my workplace, I usually place file-folders in my bag (see figure 1).    However, after some time of using this file-folder, the top and top-right are both curled into the middle (see figure 2), between the front and back sheets of the file-folder.    How can I straighten the top and top-right so that it no longer curls inward?  or  How can I prevent new file-folders from curling inward when placed in my bag?  I have tried flattening it with my hands and placing it under a heavy object for a few days. This lessens the curls, but eventually returns to the curled-in state after placing it in my bag again. "
55,How to retrieve item from storm drain?,"Today I lost my keys in a storm drain [insert embarrassment emoji here]. This is not directly in the street but attached to a building.   Unfortunately, it is impossible to open the drain either from above or to get to it from the basement of the building. Fortunately, the drain does not really drain very much, so its bottom is of cement and I can perfectly see down through it. I can see my keys! They are two meters down below, mixed with rubbish.  The drain is just like any other, e.g.:    The space between bars is around 1.5 to 2 cm.    How can I recover them? Any clever idea? I got some but I would like to know what people come up to. "

57,Keep the tea bag underwater while microwaving,"When I'm in a hurry, I make tea by heating up a cup of water in the microwave for 2 or 2 minutes, then steeping a bag of tea.  The problem is, the tea bag floats, so if I leave it in the cup while microwaving it, the tea bag won't steep. Thus, I dunk it with a spoon or fork after I take the cup out of the microwave, but that means wasting 2 or 3 minutes.  How could the tea bag be kept in the water while microwaving it? Holding it with a heavy utensil won't work if that utensil is made of metal. I've tried plastic ones but those aren't heavy enough.  Is there a hack simpler than a dedicated gadget? "

63,Bike anti-theft measures,"So my bike got stolen today, after locking it with a Kryptonite chain through the frame and both wheels and a U-lock around the frame and a 5 cm diameter metal bar bent in an upside-down U so that both ends were fastened in the pavement. The exact same thing happened a year ago in a nearby location with the same locking technique. And yet I don't think I've ever known a more secure locking arrangement than this. Are there better techniques for locking? What other techniques and tricks are effective theft deterrents, short of actually breaking or disfiguring the bike?  To clarify, the upside-down U shape that I fastened the lock to was fastened in the ground. It was not possible to just walk away with the bike &amp; lock. "

The problem with the juice bottles is that pulp residues dries on the inside of the bottle. How can I clean the bottles?  I have tried CLR (calcium lime rust) remover which is basically a powerful acid and that does not work. Suggestions like ""put rice in the bottle"" and stuff like that are useless. I mean I have tried ACID ok and the stuff is not coming off. Maybe I need to try raw lye? My concern with using an alkaline chemical like lye (sodium hydroxide) is that it might dissolve the glass.  I have considered trying piranha solution, a powerful and dangerous mixture used by organic chemists to clean glassware, but it requires access to sulfuric acid and highly concentrated hydrogren peroxide which are difficult to get.

70,How to push small button with plastic cover on phone's edge easier?,"My phone (Xperia M4 Aqua) has a power button on the edge of the phone. After having a thin plastic cover, the button is required a lot of force to push it. I can cut a hole in the cover in that position, but I would like to have a non-irreservable solution.   Since I mostly use my phone with my left hand to be able to do other activities simultaneously, the button is pushed by the inner side of the index finger. Pushing it with nail is possible, but it will slow down my access to the phone, and adding a cognition workload by having to keep in mind how to push it.

75,My pants are falling off!,"I have some pairs of sweatpants and shorts that have either one side of the string outside the loop, or the whole string is out of the pants all together. This can be a major issue because I either choose to not wear them since they might/will fall down or I'll have to take the chances of my pants falling off in public if I choose to wear them. I know I could just gain enough wait to hold them up without needing the string. But there must be another way? How can I get the string back into the pants/shorts?  I've tried just with my hands of pushing the string through, when one side hasn't fallen all the way out. Which can sometimes work if there's not much more way to go. Other than that I usually just bring them to a sewer. "
76,How to separate egg yolk from whites?,"While being careful, using your fingers etc. doesn't feel like a hack, is there any complete unique way of separating egg yolk from whites?

77,Plucking a chicken without a machine,"Like my username implies, I'm a shochet (though I'm still in training), and I kill chickens.  One problem I have is getting the feathers off the chicken once they're dead. I know that I could buy or build a machine that would do that for me, but buying a machine is expensive, and building one myself would be exciting, but would take a lot of effort.  I've heard that some people dunk their chickens in hot water (which I'm told is called ""scalding""), and the feathers just fall off by themselves; however, I can't do that because it creates issues with the kashrus (kosher-ness) of the chicken.  I could also skin them (which is what I've been doing up until now), but I'd rather not because it makes them harder to cook (easier to dry out etc).  What can I do to remove feathers from a deceased chicken?  Requirements:     Less effort than manual plucking Free, or cheap Does not involve the use of hot water Leaves the skin on  "

79,Is there a way to erase pencil without a standard eraser?,"There are times when I am away from home with my sketchpad and I realize I do not have my eraser with me. Are there any quick tricks to erase pencil marks on a paper without ruining the paper, or smearing the other pencil marks?   I use a particular type of eraser known as a ""kneaded eraser"", not a generic pink pencil top eraser, or a handheld pencil eraser.    I have tried using a gently moistened corner of my shirt to try and ""clean"" the pencil mark off of the paper, but that just smudged the pencil, and ruined the paper. I have tried dried chewing gum I was done with, but that too just seemed to smudge the pencil mark. On one occasion I tried silly putty and though it worked o.k., there were still faint lines and it wasn't erased completely.  Is there something handy I could find that might help? "

82,Does freezing tights make them more durable?,"Various blog posts and articles suggest that freezing a pair of tights will make them last longer.  From a blog named Eclipsed Moon:        Put your tights in the freezer.      I thought that this was a silly old-wives tale, but it actually does   work! Putting your tights in a plastic bag and storing them in the   freezer when you aren’t using them helps keep the material firm and   less prone to ripping.      From an article on PureWow:     Good thing there’s a super-easy trick for extending the life of your   tights.      You freeze them.      Yes, it sounds crazy, but hear us out: The next time you buy a new   pair (and before you wear them), run them under water until they’re   damp. Then place them in a plastic bag and freeze overnight. Take them   out and give them a day to defrost and thaw out.      You only need to do this once — after that, you’re good to go. The   chilly temps firm and strengthen the individual fibers of your tights,   making them less susceptible to runs later on.     I'm skeptical.  My questions are:   Where is the evidence?  Are there any controlled studies confirming this phenomenon? Does the water make any difference? Is this advice for storage, one-time treatment, or both? If it is indeed effective as a one-time treatment, why don't they come pre-treated from the factory? If it works, why does it work?  "

I ride my bike to work in the morning and back home in the evening. As of right now, my biking gloves manage to keep my hands from freezing.  I'd rather avoid wearing bulky gloves which prevent me from grabbing my keys from my trousers pockets for example .   In terms of heat preservation I remembered glasses with additional layers filled with air to prevent beverages from warming up or cooling down too fast.  Could a kitchen glove under my biking glove produce a similar effect?  Are there other suggestions?  "

This ""falling"" behaviour is aggravated as time passes, since the deodorant is pushed up, making the top heavier than the bottom and thus less stable. They should be made to be stored upside down.

90,How to prevent my socks from becoming dry and rigid?,"Every socks I own quickly end up dry and rigid (2 or 3 months). I am sick to feel like I was folding paperboard after every laundry, or buy a new dozens every month or so.  I don't know what the reason is, but perhaps it's due to my sweaty feet.  These socks are 100% cotton, changed every day. The detergent is... I don't know, a regular one? (It smells quite good, ah!) To dry them, I hang them.  How could I prevent this from happening? "
91,What is the best way to recondition a whiteboard?,"Our office has installed new whiteboards over the last two years.  Many of these boards are heavily used and have already devolved to the point of being useless -- the writing on them has become all but permanent and they are heavily stained.   I've found that simply cleaning them (with a household cleaner, such as Simple Green) goes a long way toward keeping them in a usable state.  After cleaning, much of the marker (80%-ish) can be simply wiped away, but there is still a strong ""ghost effect"" remaining.  I've tried commercial white board cleaner.  It's about the same as household cleaner, but is more expensive.  I've tried both WD-40 and car wax (Turtle Wax and Rain-X), as recommended by various sites on the internet.  The car wax does not seem to offer much improvement.  The WD-40 is the better of these two solutions, but leaves the board a little greasy, and the markers tend to smear (only a bit) when wiped.     What is recommended maintenance for keeping the boards working well?  And what is the best way to recondition a damaged whiteboard?  "
92,How to listen to music in the shower?,"How can I bring my little portable Bluetooth speaker into the shower without ruining it?  To ensure it is loud enough to hear over the shower on full blast while not noise polluting too much, the speaker needs to be kept close, well within splash range. However, it isn't one of those waterproof speaker designed to handle shower environments.  Bonus points for:-   Protecting the speaker not just from direct splashes but the high humidity of steamy showers that could potentially ruin it as well; Leaving playback control buttons on the speaker accessible (by being able to press them through a transparent or perhaps even opaque layer?);  "
93,How can I dull or darken this zipper with household products?,"I just bought this bag:     See that orange zipper? It's way more orange than it looks in this photo.     This photo doesn't even do it justice. It is neon, day-glo orange. It's too orange for me, but other than that I like the bag so wish to keep it. I also just spent a bunch of money on this bag, so I don't want to go out and get the zipper replaced or buy dyes and equipment or anything like that as that will just add a greater cost.   So I need to find a way to dull or darken this color that:   Doesn't inhibit the function of the zipper Is permanent, or mostly permanent (fading over years of use is to be expected) Doesn't discolor or otherwise affect the green fabric around the zipper or the red and white fabric inside Uses only household supplies or supplies found cheaply at a hardware or grocery store   I have access to a clothes washer and dryer, but not a bathtub. Also, there are a lot of different materials to work with on the zipper: the zipper teeth are plastic, the part that attaches the teeth to the bag is some kind of canvas, and the pull and runner feel like metal.

94,How to store books in less than ideal conditions?,"It's not hard to find out how you should store books. Just Google ""how to store books"". Metal or sealed wood shelves, 50% humility, 60-75 °F, keep that constant, keep away from light, don't store in bags... But lets assume that some of these aren't obtainable. How, then, would one go about storing books.  Curerently, my climate controls aren't especially good. In the winter the temperature ranges from mid 50's to 70 °F, and in the summer, mid 60's to mid 80's. That's in an 8 hour period The land lord doesn't seem to think there is anything wrong with the HVAC and I can't install a window unit. I don't know what the humidity is, but as I type this, I am not comfortable.  My books include mass market paper backs, text books, hard covered books, collectors edition books (mostly Eston Press), trade paper back American and Japanese comics, and a handful of single issue comics. All of the American comics are of the modern sort, printed on pretty decent paper. I don't own any of the older, cheaper kind.  These are stored on cheap plastic veneered composite board constructed book shelves. These shelves are sufficiently old that I assume any solvents should have mostly dissipated. I have my more expensive books in open zip lock bags. I know that CLOSED zip locked bags are bad due to trapping humidity, and encouraging mold growth, but I also assume that an open bag should slow the rate at which humidity, and to a lesser degree temperature, changes. Even more valuable ones (anything worth more than $100) are also loosely wrapped in bubble wrap. I have a few Easton Press books still in their original manufacture's shrink wrap, which has small holes. my individual issues are bagged and boarded.  So, as for the question in this post:    What should I do to help protect these books?  Have I made any invalid assumptions? For example, are my book shelves an issue, or the zip locks?  Also, what would you guys suggest to help mitigate the potential damage caused from a the inconsistent, and occasionally warm/humid environment where I'm living (second floor)?   So much of what I've found is geared towards what is best, but ""best"" isn't always an option. Alternatively, am I already doing everything I should do under my restraints?  PS: I completely forgot that I own a dehumidifier, something which neither the land lord nor neighborhood council will complain about. That's one fewer issue. I just moved here and completely forgot about it. I'll dig it out, but humidity is probably the thing I'll have to worry about most. "

99,Reading glasses with zero correction,"At an industrial site where I work they recently instituted a policy of wearing protective lenses.  My employer gave us these cheap plastic safety glasses, but they scratch too easily, they fog up all the time, and they're generally uncomfortable.  However, prescription glasses (even those not rated for industrial protection) are permitted.  Go figure.  Someone suggested that for those who don't have prescription eyeglasses, then wearing a cheap set of drugstore reading glasses would suffice.  I still have marginally 20/20 vision--I don't need prescription lenses (yet, knock on wood!), but when I tried on the reading glasses with the least correction (+1.25 diopters, I believe), it still felt annoying.  What I'd really like is a set of cheap glasses with neutral lenses.  My question is this:  Does someone market/sell reading glasses with zero correction?  If so, where can I get some? "

108,"Free distilled (deionised) water, as a byproduct","My wife needs a CPAP machine for sleep apnea. One of the things her model does is humidify the air. To do this it evaporates about 1 cup (237 mL) of water every night.  One is strongly advised to use distilled (i.e. deionised) water as, if one uses the hard tap water, limescale quickly builds up.  Now while distilled water is not expensive (though it does add up), I am wondering if I can get it for free from one of the devices in my house.  I have noticed we have a few machines that produce a fair bit of water:   dehumidifier - My notion is since it is pulling water vapour our of the air, the fact that it is vapour means it can't have much impurities dissolved in it. Though vapour isn't a gas  so maybe it can. condensing clothes drier - After drying a load of washing it needs at least 2 cups (473 mL) of water to be drained. If all that water is being evaporated (rather than spun) out of the cloths then it should be pure. window vacuum - You use this to wipe/suck condensation off of windows. It doesn't make much water but it does make some.   Maybe other devices too, like fridges?  The water doesn't need to be perfect, and certainly doesn't need to be food grade. But I am wondering is any of my household see devices are producing distilled water? "

113,How to vacuum stairs with minimal effort?,"This is related to How to vacuum room with minimal amount of effort? but specifically aimed at vacuuming stairs.  I recently moved to a two-story house after being in single-story houses for a while.  The stairs in the new house are carpeted.  There are an assortment of small kids and pets in this house, so not vacuuming is not an option.  Right now my technique is:   Start at the top and work my way down with the regular upright vacuum by attempting to man-handle it over each stair.  This is a cumbersome procedure which gets most of the central area of each stair fairly clean, but still leaves bits in the corners. Clean out the corners with a smaller hand-held attachment vacuum.   I could just skip step 1 and use the smaller hand-held attachment vacuum to do the whole job, but I think this would take much longer.  Is there a quick, easy and effective way to vacuum carpeted stairs? "
114,Alternatives to sleep masks and black-out curtains,"Note - This is not a duplicate of How can I effectively black out my room for sleeping, cheaply and such that I can still open the curtains during the day? because I don't want to black out my room and I am specifically excluding the answers to that question.  Excluded  Blackout blinds/curtains/window-covering - I tried blackout blinds but they were unsuitable. I like to sleep with the windows open. They were affected by the wind blowing them away from the window frame. In any case I do not want to black out my whole room - just prevent light from reaching my eyes.  Elasticated sleep-mask - This is my current solution. It works but there are problems with comfort and slippage. I want to move on.  Question  What novel method can I use to prevent light from reaching my eyes whilst sleeping?  One possible answer I have thought of is to use black eye-makeup to paint my eyelids.  As a man who has never used makeup of any kind, I am reluctant to try because (a) I don't know if it will be effective in blocking light (b) I don't know how easily I would be able to remove it (c) I don't know if constant application and removal would cause skin problems (d) I'm not sure if it will be expensive.  Is my solution viable?  If not, how else can I shield just my eyes rather than wearing an uncomfortable and unreliable sleep-mask? Note that I want the room itself to remain illuminated. "
115,"Skateboard, roller blades or?","I am trying to optimize my daily commute. I usually walk slightly over a kilometer (slightly under a mile) (asphalt sidewalk) to the station I depart from and about the same distance from the station I arrive at to my destination.  There are buses, but those are a bad option due to heavy traffic. I can rent a city bicycle for my ""home - station"" segment, but not for the other segment. So I settled on bying a... ""personal transportation device""? (is there a word for it?)  There are lots of them on the market: skateboards, bikes, electric skateboards and electric bikes, roller blades, Skyrunners, waveboards and longboards, scooters... I need to pick one that is   Fast (my goal is cutting travel time, after all) Small, so that I can take it with me on a train. Moscow Metro doesn't allow bicycles, because this.   What would be my best bet? "
116,Pair of rimless prescription titanium glasses : screws fit into frame but strips. Hack to fix?,"I have a pair of rimless titanium prescription frames. I love it. I want to keep it forever - I know this isn't possible but i'd like to extend the life of the current pair I have. The specific model has been discontinued and I'm stuck with this pair so I need to hack it for longevity. I have another pair of different glasses - but as mentioned, this one is special -its successor is not a fit for me.  Currently the screw fits into the frame itself.  This is a bad design. The screw often strips, and then the arm is loose. I know its titanium, but it strips. Glue is obviously not a option - eyesight regresses and I already need to replace the lenses.  My question, considering that it is titanium, considering what the frame looks like, would it be possible to (and Im really happy to pay someone with a steady hand for this but I'm asking if its possible to) drill a hole right through where the screw is, and then attach a good looking nut on one of the sides (screw one side with nut on other side)?  The idea is to get rid of the thread in the frame that holds the screw -as this is the weak point, and if it ever does break, its simply a matter of getting a new screw and nut.  Does anyone have a better idea of how to get past the problem of the screw fitting into the frame?    "
117,Listening to music in cubicle without headphones,"I work in a cubicle environment. It's okay that we wear headphones, but after wearing them all day it can get uncomfortable.

The status quo is fine, but I'd love to have a way to modify (or get?) speakers that can be heard clearly by me at a short range (2' or closer even) without being audible to coworkers.  Any ideas on how I could make / get a speaker enclosure or something to accomplish this? "
118,Get rid of house fly problem?,"I have a problem with flies suddenly. I have been living in my house for almost 20 years and never had a problem with flies. How can I find out where they are coming from and eliminate the source?  They are almost all on the first floor, so that would seem to rule out a source in the basement or upper floors. For example, I have a cat litter box on the second floor, but there are no flies there, so I know the flies are not coming from anywhere near there.  That would seem to leave two possibilities:  (1) They are breeding outside the house and somehow finding a way in, or  (2) There is some hidden source on the first floor  I have carefully tried to seal off any crack or opening to get into the house, yet the flies are just as numerous as ever. I do see flies outside on the windows, but in small numbers, so they could either be coming from outside, or just be escapees coming from inside the house.  I have searched the grounds very carefully for animal bodies or other organic matter and found nothing.  How can I locate the source of the flies? "
119,Preventing stuff from falling off moving shelves,"I run a milk-delivery company, using vans to delivery cans and gallons of milk around my county. The milk cans (MCs) are loaded in the metal cart (C), with each level of the cart for different delivery destinations. The front view of the cart is shown.    When the van is moving around and swerving, I have a constant issue of the cans falling off. What is the best way to put straps (my current idea) across the front to prevent this from happening? Should I put them top to down, or one across each level, or criss-cross? Are there better ways to prevent this?  I chose straps, since they give the ease of removal of cans without wastage of time to open doors or such other solutions. "
120,How to make a 100% cotton shirt repel moisture?,"I bought a casual 100% cotton button-down shirt the other day from the brand ESP fashion.   I live in Bangkok, Thailand and it's crazy hot here at the moment (or any moment), so I figured a white one would probably A) not be as hot in the sun and B) not show sweat as easily as other colors.  Anyway, in the fitting room the shirt was really nice, soft and appeared to be a bit moisture-repellant. Got home, put it in the washer to get rid of possible left-over chemicals from manufacturing (it's just something I have a habit of always doing when I buy new clothes). After washing I noticed it wasn't as soft as before, so I figured they had perhaps used some softener on it (which I generally don't ever use).  The next day I put the shirt on, and my back was still a bit moist from the shower. Now the shirt immediately absorbed any moisture it came into contact with, even for just a fraction of a second! My theory that white wouldn't change color when wet got immediately debunked - it looked bad, really bad.  My theory is that the fabric was treated with something to make it a bit softer and to repel moisture, but that treatment/coating was washed away even after the first washing. So now I'm wondering if there are any products one can use to make clothes repel moisture better? Obviously, one can wax them as I have done in the past with hiking gear, but that doesn't really seem appropriate for a nice looking button-down shirt that is meant for urban use. Anything better suited for nice looking clothes? Are there any softeners or other products one can use in the washer to aid in moisture repelling? "

122,Common noise levels of reliably constant loudness,"This isn't a home improvement question, but one that applies to buying any product that makes noise or sound: how can you ask reviewers to compare the noise level of a product with some reference noise levels that are about the same across most people, places and situations?  An example to help explain my question better: I want to buy a window A/C unit. Every single one I see reviews for on Amazon has contradictory opinions across the decibel spectrum, from ""It's quiet"" to ""It's so loud I have to crank up the TV"".  Unlike with dimensions, the vast majority of people don't have a sound level meter. If they didn't have a ruler, you could ask them ""How big is it in relation to a CD"", since all CDs have the same diameter (12cm). What are some sound levels that are reliably about the same?  I've looked at this table of common decibel values, but ranges like ""50 - 65"" for normal conversation are way too imprecise, given that an increase of 10 db means a doubling of the perceived loudness and ""every increase of 3 dB represents a doubling of sound intensity, or acoustic power"". Also, the logarithmic nature of the decibel scale makes it too confusing to consider about asking random reviewers to think in any terms other than some common sound levels that are approximately the same everywhere (hence why I'm not posting this on Physics.SE).  Some ideas:   riffle-shuffling a deck of cards opening a soda can swiftly (though this is a short-duration noise and may be misleading when compare long-running appliances such as A/C units or refridgerators)   I realize that any sound will be perceived differently depending on the acoustics of the room but let's hope that reviewers can mentally map these ""reference sounds"" to the condition of the room they (and the appliance/product) are in. A soda can pop will sound much louder in a hardwood floor small room than in a larger carpeted room but when I think about that volume level, I think of it in the context of the room I'm in. "

I've tried rotating the stacks 90 degrees (so that the bottom of the fold for all of them is visible) like the following, but this only seems to work well when the stack fills up the drawer. When I've worn enough of the clothes so that it's not very full, they seem to slide and get more disheveled than I'd like them to.   source  What can I do to fix this sliding around?

134,How can I re-seal hearing aid batteries that have been accidentally unsealed?,"Zinc-air hearing aid batteries come with a sticky tab on them to prevent air contact; once this tab is removed, the battery starts draining.  The instructions warn that ""thou shalt not removeth this tab until a few minutes before thine need of battery"".  Recently, my roommate's kids discovered that the tiny metal lumps with sticky things stuck to them were a much more enjoyable toy than the nice new expensive plastic monstrosity their father just gave them; long story short, about two months worth of hearing aid batteries are now unsealed (and hidden in crevices throughout the house, but I think I found them all).  Google searching has come up with mixed results regarding simply resealing them with Scotch tape, mostly suggesting that it won't work or that it will work but not enough to bother with.  However, these seem to be in the context of re-sealing while they're in use (i.e. prolonging the life of an active battery by re-sealing it when the hearing aids are turned off, rather than for any form of long-term storage).  I threw some tape on them anyway just on principle, but no clue how much if any effect it'll actually have.  How then could one reliably re-seal hearing aid batteries for long-term (well, one or two months) storage?  Does a simple patch of Scotch tape (or re-applying the original tab) actually work, or is this a lost cause? "

137,Vinyl Above Ground Pool - can't find leak - will renting a compressor work?,"I have a 3.66m above ground vinyl pool, 1 season old, and I can't find the leak at all.  I've tried the food colour route, where one tries to trace the flow of the water by injecting small parts of blue food colour - cannot find it.  I've seen videos on youtube where the guy says one can hit on the bottom of the  pool and bits of dirt will get sucked in - then you can see the dirt and identify the leak, but the pool is on a pool cover so there is no dirt.  The pool is only 10% filled now - until I can find the leak.  Will it work if I go and rent a small compressor and press the nozzle against the outside and look inside to where the bubbles are? It's gonna cost a small amount (I'm not in the states but it's about $15), but it's less than 10% of the price of a new pool.  I will to the sidewall first - it could be in the bottom creases - but I know it's at the bottom because the pool is only 10% filled and its leaking.  The bottom will be a bit more interesting - I'll have to lift up the pool from the bottom and press against it - I'll probably have to get rid of most of the water in there now (not a lot) and when I do press it from the bottom, the water will then disperse to the sides and I'll have to try and get water on the exact spot above the nozzle again.  Will this work? Any tips? Any ideas for the bottom part (side is easy)   "

146,How to protect goods in a shipping container?,"When shipping goods, including computer hardware, books, clothes and tableware, across the globe (crossing the equator) in a container it seems natural that heat, humidity and physical impact would be the main issues. But the details are not so obvious:   What magnitude are they, for example, how high does the temperature actually go, and how many newtons of (sustained/impact) force can be expected? Are any unusual measures (other than simply stacking in cardboard boxes) necessary to protect the goods adequately? Are there any other factors which are important? For example, are containers regularly dropped from any height? Are they ever turned on their side? Do the contents have to be packed so that inspectors can get to every single thing easily? Are there pests? Etc.  "

I've also heard that the protector tends to get statically charged and literally attract particles to itself during this process.  Is there some way I could remove dust from a small room where I plan to apply this screen protector in? Could I try applying it somewhere like my garage, which I assume would have less dust floating around? Better yet, is there some way I can measure dust content in a room to help me select a suitable place to do this?  I've thought about doing this outside too.

I really like the feeling of sitting in front of a board and writing with pencil on it. [website]What are some lifehacks to help achieve this? What's the most efficient way to have lots of paper on the corkboard for writing and be able to easily replace the sheets? I thought of perhaps one efficient way would be to find long thumbtacks and stacks of white paper with hole punches on the top middle of each and just rip off a sheet everytime I'm done with one. Let's kick around some ideas for this because this seems a bit hacky and inefficient    Some details:   Willing to spend maybe max of 100$ on this, don't think should be that complex or expensive See why you can't just put a cork board hanging on the wall? No room for your legs.    Cork boards don't stand up by themselves upright. Need some way to keep board upright, stable enough to handle writing on it  Simpler and no construction/less construction required would be great    "
154,How to prevent HDMI cable from coming loose,"I currently have my laptop hooked up to an LG 22LS4D TV screen which I use for programming. The problem is, whenever the HDMI cable is moved slightly (such as when the curtains behind are opened/closed or when the lead is accidentally pulled), the cable disconnects from the TV so I do not have an input.  How would I be able to make sure my HDMI cable disconnect less often?.   Also while we are on the same topic, it is also hard to reconnect since I have to reach behind the TV and the cable/port is loose so it takes multiple attempts to connect. How would I be able to connect the cable easier? "
155,How can I light the very back of my fire?,"My fireplace is quite deep, and I always struggle to light the back of it with a normal length match - I don't like getting sooty hands, and I worry about burning myself. The longer matches are quite expensive - I'd rather not have to use them. Is there anything I can do to make this easier?  Even quite a convoluted method may work better - for example, could focusing the heat from a candle with a magnifying glass light the back? "
156,Is there any way to kill a fly without a flyswatter?,"Fact: Flies move fast. Very fast. That's why you need something that moves even faster – like a fly swatter – to kill a fly.  But what if you don't have a flyswatter handy? Then, how can you catch and kill a fly?  I have tried whacking them with so many different items, from wooden sticks (bad idea!) to paper (way too flimsy) to magazines. All the methods are too slow, or failed for other reasons. "
157,Cleaning a microwave,"What is the easiest way to clean dried/burnt-on food out of a microwave?   Cleaning out the microwave was always one of my least favorite tasks back when I worked the graveyard shift at the local diner. The graveyard shift was usually an 11pm to 7am shift, so I usually got stuck cleaning all of the kitchen's appliances after they were heavily used and abused throughout the day.  The microwave offered a special challenge, because you couldn't soak it in water or use the heavy duty chemical oven cleaners in it to loosen the dried/burnt-on food stuffs.  Manual scrubbing would work but it was painfully time consuming, and unpleasant because the microwave was mounted on the wall overhead, so scouring usually meant standing on a stool for 20-30 minutes and applying an awful lot of elbow grease.  Is there a better/easier way to clean out a heavily abused microwave oven? "

165,"How to cool an object coated in a thermosetting substance, without damaging/leaving an impression in the coating?","I've been looking for a way to cool things that are fully coated in a hot substance without damaging the coating. While reading a question about cooling chocolate covered items and how they ended up stuck to the cooling rack, because the chocolate had wrapped around the wires, I mused that placing a cooling item covered in a ""liquid when hot, solid when at room temperature"" substance (like chocolate) onto an array of pins/nails would be one of the better ways of allowing it to cool without becoming stuck/acquiring an excessive imprint from the cooling rack  Thus, I'm trying to think of some household object with a fairly low density pin-grid arrangement, large size (larger than 1 ft x 1 ft) and flat layout and I'm coming up blank.. The pin density would probably be in the order of 3 or 4 per square inch   Hairbrush - too small/not flat Sticklebricks or similar ""plastic spikes that cause the pieces to stick together"" type toys - pins are too close together Boot cleaner floor mounted brush - too small Artificial grass - too dense Pin art device - probably too dense, too small Doormat with widely spaced plastic bristles - i'm sure I've seen some that are like plastic fingers in a circular pattern, but cannot now find them   It kinda feels like something would have to be made, by hammering picture pins/tacks through a plastic chopping board, or getting a square mesh cooling rack and using a grinder to cut through an entire line of wires, and then twist the wire they remain mounted to, to turn them so they point upwards as pins  Can anyone think of an available product/material that is already a pin-like arrangement? I'm not averse to cutting pins off if it's easy enough (cutting a sticklebrick would be hard work).  I'm also not averse to a completely different solution, if there's an alternative that would work better; perhaps skewering the objects with pins and suspending them? Something far out, like a device that blows cold air through a  pipe with the aim of suspending the object in the air stream until it cools, is probably going too far.. (You know how if you blow air though a straw and then put a lightweight ball into the air stream it kinda hovers? That's a bit over-complex, though it might give a good result)  I'd prefer a solution that involves minimal modification to an existing object. Driving 200 nails through a board is just slightly more involved than I'd want to recommend to a less tool-equipped relative. Cutting a wire mesh up with an angle grinder is way beyond  "

167,How Can I Fix a Broken Pant Fly?,"My wardrobe is not aging gracefully, and I too much despise shopping for clothes to replace it. To be sure, after a long, gradual decline, it has gotten to a point where if I pull out a pair of pants, it is a great surprise to me if the zipper on my fly still functions in its original capacity. More commonly, I will pull out a pair of sad pants with two rows of teeth to form a fly, but either no zipper or a zipper only attached to one set of the teeth. Personally, I couldn't care less whether the zipper works, but I've been told that it is most uncivilized to walk around with one's fly hanging open, and that explaining, ""No, it's okay because it's broken!"" does not, in fact, make it more civilized. Thus, I would like, at least, to elegantly ensure that my pants do not have a hole where the fly once was sagging open when I am wearing them.  I consider this problem very annoying. So far I have:   If the sliding bit of the zipper stayed on one side, I've tried shoving the other side of teeth into the appropriate slot in the sliding bit, but I've never succeeded in fixing them this way. I've tried avoiding other people all day. This is a nice universal fix to all wardrobe issues, but it's sort of hard to do - and it gets tiresome to have to figure out when no one's looking before making a dash across more public space. I once tried putting the pants on backwards. This looked even worse and felt terrible. I used tape to hold the fly shut. It sort of works for a while, but eventually the tape gets unstuck. It's also kind of noticeable and I'd rather not have any conversations starting with, ""Hey dude, why's there so much duct tape on your pants?"" I managed to run a loop of little wire through the pants and through the zipper to hold the fly closed in the middle; this works the best out of anything I've tried, but the pants still look kind of strange, being held together at just one point in the middle. I thought about soldering the zipper (mostly) shut, since I don't really care whether it can open or not, however decided against it since it would leave that section of the pants stiff. (Not to mention that this is an issue I invariably wish to solve after I've left my house - in locations where one will receive strange looks if they start soldering their pants together or remove their pants to safely do so - though, perhaps with some good answers here, I can remember to fix my pants before trying to use them).   None of these solutions are particularly satisfactory to me and I feel like this has got to be a common problem. Is there a better way to repair one's fly? "
168,How can I safely sanitise my smartphone's display?,"I've recently upgraded from a keypad feature phone to a smartphone. The smartphone in question has Gorilla Glass 3 protecting the touchscreen, which I've read has an olegeophobic coating which can be damaged by using alcohol.  The question is, how do I wipe the smartphone's display clean? I have a microfiber cloth for this purpose. Is using a liquid handwash soap solution on the screen a good idea? According to some sources, the microfiber cloth itself can strip bacteria from the screen. Is this claim substantiated? Also, I'm not too keen on dishing out money on a cleaning kit, so I would like only home DIY solutions.  Furthermore, when I had a keypad phone, I used to keep it sanitary by wiping it with aftershave or with dettol. I don't think this is a good idea for a smartphone, but all feedback is appreciated :) "

170,Hacky way to keep micro USB firmly in place?,[website]I use this keyboard on the couch connected to a tablet that is held up in front of me with a tablet holding arm. I use the keyboard on my lap. Sadly the side of the USB that goes into the keyboard is a micro USB that easily gets wiggled/disconnected temporarily which in practice results in the occasional but annoying either disconnect or the cursor moving in a certain direction continuously until I disconnect and reconnect everything. Even moderately slight movements in the micro USB seem to cause.   Been trying to keep the micro USB in with no chance of jiggling with duct tape which helps slightly to decrease the occurrence of the above but still happens with decent frequency    What's a way to deal with this? Perhaps some lifehack-ee clever use of a household object or something obvious I haven't thought of?

I found that it didn't achieve a natural look. I use this foundation normally, and I tried this one.  I don't want to buy a different brand, because I don't want the expense or the getting used to. I find that the Max Factor works well for me.  I had a look at this site but the tips didn't really help me. For example, ""If you do have a few extra moments, why not just do a small swipe of eyeshadow?"", is just saying to do something that needs more time...

182,How do I stop the ends of curtain poles (finials) falling off without making a hole in them?,"We've recently moved into a rented house in which we aren't meant to make holes in the fittings.   Several of the curtains are hung on wooden poles, like these. The end curtain ring on each side is kept in position by being placed between the bracket holding up the pole and an end stop / finial. Only they aren't kept in position because the finials and the endmost curtain rings fall off whenever anyone opens the curtains in anything other than slow motion. The finials are not screwed on to the ends of the poles; they are meant to be held on by friction - only it doesn't work.   If we owned the house I would drill a hole through the side of the finial and hold the pole in place by a small screw, but as tenants we are not meant to drill holes in the landlord's fixtures.   Can anyone suggest a means of keeping the finials in place which does not mar them or the poles?  I have tried Blu-tack but it isn't very satisfactory, as the presence of a blob of Blu-tack on the side of the pole tends to make the finial go on awry, or stops it going on at all. If you roll out the Blu-tack very thin to prevent this, it shreds when you insert the pole into the finial and does not work at all. Putting the Blu-tack at the end doesn't work either, as there is a large gap between the end of the pole and the inside of the end of the finial.  Any suggestions gratefully received. "

The clothes are not entirely covered in dye, but the spots where the belt touched them have a good, strong amount of the color printed on them.  The white clothes, which were obviously hit the hardest, I will probably just bleach.  However, my colored clothes were hit as well.

190,Rising to the Challenge - Mattress on top of Roof,"I'm going to be moving across the US in a few days and am looking to transport my queen mattress (no boxspring) about 600 miles.  Nearly every single person I've spoken with has strongly advised against putting it on my roof and recommended simply renting a trailer instead (stories of mattresses transforming into sails, hurling through the air, plummeting gas mileage, incessant overhead noise, being ticketed by the police, and physical damage to the roof abound).  However, assuming I would still like to attempt transporting the mattress on my roof, what would be the best (safest) way to proceed? Should I strap it directly to my roof?

192,Preventing Bed Resonance,"This is somewhat similar to this question, but not exactly the same, because it's not about noise per se and I'm not the one causing it (yet). The floor of my apartment is very light (probably cheap) fake wood vinyl, and it's above a mostly-empty and not well insulated crawlspace, and is attached to one other apartment. And unfortunately, the way the building is set up places the two apartments' bedrooms right next to one another. So, whenever my neighbors perform some certain...oscillatory activities, I can feel the vibrations very distinctively from my bed.   What should I do to cut down on this? Would lowering my bed to the floor help? It is currently supported by six approximately 6 inch metal legs and on a box spring, on a hardwood floor (which I know is the real problem, but unfortunately I can't change that). Would it help to place the bed legs on a rug or something? What about a heavier bed-frame? It's currently resting on the thin metal rails that came with the mattress.  Also, should I assume that anything I do on my bed would be felt in the same way by the other tenants? If it's my bed that's causing the resonance effect, maybe I wouldn't need to worry about bothering them (unless they have the same kind I suppose). Or would whatever changes you recommend also cut down on this? "

Probably using cable ties. I could just wrap the whole surge protector using the cable ties. But that will probably look more sloppy and I would like to use the holes if that is what they are made for.   Is there some sort of standard fastener that makes use of the holes on the surge protector? I don't recall if the surge protector came with anything.  If it helps, I believe this is the surge protector that I have: Amazon product link "
196,A remedy for an itchy healing cut,"I cut my finger accidentally a couple days ago. Not too deep, but it was painful for a few seconds, and there was some bleeding. I debrided it with hydrogen peroxide 3% solution, and then applied a ""liquid bandage"" that dried and stopped the bleeding in less than a minute. Finally, I put a band-aid on top of it to protect the wound from being disturbed or reopened accidentally.  Тoday I removed the band-aid, and the ""liquid bandage"" easily came off itself. The wound looks good: clean, dry, no bleeding, with only slight redness around it. It feels like it is healing okay. The problem is it got very itchy a few hours ago, and it is not easy to ignore.     What would be the best (fastest and safest) way to stop the itching of a healing wound (in particular, a cut)?   Usually, when I have an itch, an over-the-counter hydrocortisone 1% cream is a very good and fast remedy. But I'm not sure if it is safe or wise to put it on an itchy healing wound. Is it? What are other ways to help? "
197,How to reduce eye strain which comes only when watching animations and cartoons?,"My eyes hurt sometimes. Though I watch a lot of videos on YouTube like educational, T.V. series, documentaries but I notice my eyes getting strained and tired only when I am watching cartoons, animations or animated educational videos, etc. I think the cartoons are always by standard much more brighter could be a reason for it(though I am myself not pretty sure about it, but I think it could be the reason, maybe the frames per second could be another explanation which is high in most cartoons and animations). I believe my eyes are strained whenever I watch too much but I feel the strain predominantly only after watching cartoons and animations. Could anybody give me an advice?  If the problem is cartoons are brighter than other things, what could be the solution? "
198,Use two 2025 batteries instead of one 2032 battery,"Intro:     2032 and 2025 are literally the dimensions of the battery. A 2032 is 20mm in diameter, 3.2mm thick, and a 2025 is slightly thinner, at 2.5mm thick. They usually both have the same voltage (3V), and assuming they fit in the case, they are interchangeable.    For my scale, I accidentally bought a pack of thin 2025 batteries instead of the thicker 2032 ones.  I couldn't get the scale to work as it was too thin. So I used 2 batteries stacked. Scale works.  Is there another way to get it to work with just one wrong thin battery? Feeding it 6V can't be good for it.  IOW: What could I use to pad the thinner battery? "

200,Transport a washing machine over stairs alone,"I may soon have to transport a washing machine to my appartment. The problem is that   I live upstairs. I may not be able to find a friend to help.   So I'm thinking whether it is practical to transport a washing machine up/down stairs alone. Obviously just carrying it is pretty much out of the question, given that a household washing machine weighs about 60 - 80 kg. I know that professional movers usually use moving straps to carry heavy loads, but I think these do not work for a single person.  The only practical option I found is to use a hand truck, and to tie the machine to the truck. Ideally I'll use a stairclimber, which has special wheels to make it easier to climb/descend stairs. However, I'm not sure whether even a stairclimber will let me transport a washing machine without help.  So:   Is it feasible to transport a washing machine alone with a stairclimber or similar? Is there any other option?  "
201,How to protect the lace holes of a shoe from the lace without an eyelet?,"Many shoes now-a-days, even the branded ones have some lace-holes without eyelets. Each time the shoe laces are tied, the lace tears into the shoe.    Eyelets are only available in bunches which are too expensive to buy for a requirement of four eyelets.    Sometimes the eyelet comes off too.      Is there any other way to protect the lace holes from getting torn? "

211,"How to boost wifi signal range without touching the antenna or router using reflectors, etc?","I have a project to boost a wireless signal but without touching the router and its antennae.  1st of all the router is above the cabinet which we can't reach.  2nd we are not allowed to touch the router which means we can't add extender or any other wires. And 3rd we were asked to boost the signal in order to reach the targets and be creative.  here's my illustration:      Plan A would cost less but the risk failing it... I think would be high.  I am planning on using aluminum card board, foils and tin cans as reflectors and to save money. so I plan to make a parabolic dish and some reflectors made up of aluminum.  Can my dish reach the targets or my reflector(s)? I don't know how analog/digital signal works but i think it would bounce in a strait line when ever it reflect.  Here's my illustration: plan A   Plan B would cost a lot but lower the risk... and unfair  and that is buying a repeater and install it at the center of the hallway.   Plan C is 50 50  and that is make an antenna that runs in battery's. but I don't know how to make one like a biquad wifi antenna.  I think using reflectors would be fun. any idea? "

213,Sources for odd items and components,"In pursuit of various diy projects, I often need materials, components or items which are not regularly carried in stores.  For example, for a small diy vacuum chamber which I would like to build, I need a 1-2 foot length of 10+"" diameter PVC pipe.  I know that I can buy 8-10 feet of such pipe at a local big box store, but I imagine that people who regularly use that product, must occasionally have to trim it to length, leaving the part I want garbage-bound.  So what material acquisition life hacks can you offer?  Where do you look for those things which can't be found in (or afforded from) standard retail stores? "
214,Managing day-to-day sound from upstairs neighbours,"TL;DR : What are some original and/or just generally effective ways to block low-frequency noise?  Not TL;DR:  This question has been asked in various forms already, such as this, but I am not looking for a physical solution (unless someone knows one I can implement easily, That would be awesome). Rather, I need solo ways to deal.  I just moved in to a basement suite fully aware it would be loud above. There is a 3 year old up there. I am super sensitive to this type of noise, and in fact is normally the only deal-breaker in turning down a place. I despise it, and it makes me SUPER anxious. I also don't like kids so this adds to the stress. But this is not about my hangups, it's about managing the noise.  I had no choice. This is the only place I could get and this is where I will be for a year. I feel like advice saying I should reconsider living here, that I should move, or I should get mental health care, etc, would be facile and not super useful. Still, all advice welcome.  I'd be great if advice could not focus on:   Modifying the ceiling or doing other physical alterations. I mentioned this already earlier (at least I think I did?) Talking to the neighbour about the issue. Since this is how it will be no pleasant discussion will change it. As all parents (I've encountered) say when confronted with their child's noise, my neighbour too uttered the ubiquitous: ""it's a kid. What can you do?"" mantra.  Also, the noise is not extra ordinary enough to really justified a ""talk.""   I'm hoping to get irregular ideas since I've already tried and thought of the regulars. I am sensitive to sound after all, and this didn't just develop over night. I've tried earplugs of various types. Foam ones work the best. Also I use a white noise app with headphones.   My latest attempt is blasting white noise while wearing earplugs - in fact a long time attempt at a solution for me. It's a poor solution though and I need to turn up the white noise so loud that even with ear plugs the loudness hurts my ears, and makes them ring for some time afterwards.  While looking for a solution I found this article article about solutions, which I was led to by this Slate article about earplugs. These are much better than the general google search solutions I've found on the issue, but still these links offer no silver bullet. And a silver bullet is, obviously, what I'm after,  Also, not sure if this is the correct forum for this question. "

216,How to prevent washing machine jumping up and down when washing quilts or blankets,I usually mix other clothes with quilts or blankets when I wash them in the washing machine. Sometimes the machine jumps up and down while rotating fast.

Example: While changing diapers, you notice that the used diaper bin is almost full. You make a mental note to replace it. You cannot make a written note, because you haven't washed your hands yet and the baby might fall off the changing table. Of course, as soon as you are done and the baby is dressed again, you have forgotten about the mental note. Repeat until the diaper bin is actually full and you have a problem.  How do I fix this?

I could measure the size of the rooms they are in, but this would be too big because they are not stacked up and packed tightly. I was thinking of dividing by 2 but this is just a guess. One thing in particular is, do I need to measure the height (from ceiling to floor) of the room?

226,What is the best way to tape a cardboard box?,"While moving recently, my wife and I had a lengthy discussion on where tape should be placed on a box in order to maximize strength while using the least amount of tape possible. Assuming we already taped the main opening of the box shut, how can we make sure the box doesn't break open with weighty items inside?  To me, it doesn't make sense to put tape perpendicular across the opening of a box, detailed below.  (Top/bottom of a closed box)  _________________ |        |        | |        |        | |        |        | | - - -  | - - -  | &lt;- Tape across here |        |        | |        |        | |________|________|   This doesn't strengthen any weak points of the box. If anything, it may only be helping the tape that is going across the box's opening stay in place.  Although the surface area actually being touched by the tape is seemingly small, it seems that putting tape along the side openings of the box would directly strengthen the weakest point of the box, detailed below.  (Top/bottom of a closed box)    Tape along the seam here         ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓      _________________     |        |        |     |        |        |     |        |        |     |        |        |     |        |        |     |        |        |     |________|________|          ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑   And along the seam here   What's the best way to tape a box closed to maximize the strength of the box relative to the amount of tape being used?

229,Tumble-drying a fitted sheet without getting other things tangled in it,"If I put a fitted sheet in the tumble dryer with other things, it will try to kidnap smaller items and twist them into one or more of its corners so that they can't come out and don't get dry. Anybody know of a way to prevent this?  What have I tried, you ask?  The only solutions I can think of are   dry the sheet separately (seems wasteful of time, energy and the credit on the smart-card we feed into the dryer) put the sheet in a mesh bag (but I've never seen big-enough mesh bags on sale, and a too-small one would just prevent it from drying) put everything else in a mesh bag (again, not a great solution:  would have to buy a lot of such bags and spend a lot of time putting things in and out). live with the fact that some things are going to come out wet, and hang them up afterwards.   So far I've been going with the last option. "
230,How to stop a serving spoon from falling into the food?,"When food is served in big pans in school, the serving spoon will sometimes fall into the food, as shown below:    What can I do to prevent this?  We could try only leaning the spoon against the long side of the pan, but that's inconvenient, and you can't expect everyone who takes food to do that. We could also get longer spoons, but I sincerely doubt that the school would lay out money for new equipment for a stupid reason like this one.  So what can I try to prevent this? "

I've tried using other utensils, but that hasn't really worked. It's also incredibly inconvenient to go to a store every time I don't have them.

235,Lifehacks to put an end to procrastination,"I just spent a couple hours on StackExchange.  Why?  Because I have some important things that need to get done, and those things are not going to be fun.  Yes, it's procrastination.  So, I thought, what better way to procrastinate than to ask a question about how to end procrastination.  I see that this LifeHacks SE specifically asks for questions ""looking for simple and practical tips to life's everyday problems that may not have an obvious solution"".  Procrastination is certainly one of life's everyday problems and it clearly does not have an obvious solution.  Sounds good.

236,How to avoid paper sticking together in a printer?,"A problem I've often had when loading paper into a printer is when two or more sheets get stuck together. This is unnoticeable when you put a big stack of paper into the printing tray, but becomes a real pain when you actually start to print. Especially if you're trying to print two-sided - two sheets come out with only one side of each printed on - but even if you're not, a sheet twice as thick as normal often causes a paper jam.  Are there any good ways to avoid this problem? Note: I'm not talking about dealing with a paper jam after the fact, but about what to do with the paper before loading it into the printer in order to make sure sheets don't stick together in the first place.  ""What have I tried?"" I searched on Google about this problem, but all the links I found (one, two, three, four, five) were about unjamming a jammed printer, rather than stopping it from jamming in the first place. So I came to the trusty life-hackers of Stack Exchange! "
237,"In ear headphones are painful to wear, increase comfort or convert to earbuds somehow?","Update: I just sucked it up and used the tiniest tip. It was never particularly comfortable but I got used to it. Used them for a couple years for running.

I use the Kinivo 240 ([website]I must have tiny ears (or tiny earholes?) so whenever I try to use a pair of ""in-ear"" (here) headphones, it is a painful experience. The silicon tips feel too big for my ear, even when using the smallest type in a set.

I recently received a very nice pair of in ear headphones (powerbeats 2 wireless  - like these) so I am wondering is there anything I can do to make wearing them more comfortable? The best solution would be one that makes them wear more like earbuds. "
238,What is the best way to re-dry already seasoned firewood,"I have purchased few cubic meters of already seasoned firewood and I have been hapilly burning them in my wood stove. They are stored in my detached, non-heated garage. Over time I realized that more smoke is coming out and they are making sizzling sound in the wood stove but there is no visible bubling on the sides.  I am thinking that moisture from my car (Often it is parked in the garage too even though it is wet) evaporates and gets absorbed by the firewood. This is my theory in terms of why firewood has degraded. Can it be true? Would it affect the moisture content that much? What can I do to lower the moisture content? I have let some stay in the house overnight but not much has changed. "
239,Bedtime remote tied to wrist to mute/shut down computer,"I like to listen to audio from long youtube videos or youtube playlists before bedtime.   I'd like a remote tied to my wrist that I could use to turn off the laptop, decrease the volume, and mute without me having to move  Alot of remotes seem to be for powerpoint presentation and don't have a secure way to tie a loop around them and connect to your wrist   Could you help me kick around some ideas for this?   Right now, I put a keyboard on a table near my desk which is alright but I'd prefer not to move my body and just push a button as I get very close to falling asleep. Getting up to push the mute button and the windows button/arrow keys/enter required for turning off the computer tends to wake me up  I use a windows 8.1 laptop "

241,Creating a stylus holder that attaches to tablet via full sized USB,This is basically what I want for my windows tablet to hold my wacom stylus:   [website]My tablet is maybe 2-3 mm thicker than the height of a USB port so the above pic won't do- its base is too fat and I'd prefer attachment via USB rather than adhesion.   Has someone already made something like this? What would be the easiest way to achieve my idea for someone who has no rubber/metal or 3d printing materials and can't build anything on his own?   Anyway to jerryrig what I want to make with some common household items and perhaps some kind of strong adhesive? I don't want to use the average sized flashdrive- its too long and sticks out of the tablet too much. Are there any USB flashdrives that go parallel to the side of the tablet instead of perpendicular?   This below may work as a platform to hold the pen loop/pen claw but I don't know where to find a secure pen loop or attach it [website]This is my stylus: It's fatter than a pencil but maybe slightly thinner than some pens [website]

Ideally, is there something edible to throw in the mix, that would prevent powders from adhering to the blades or the blender in the first place? Some sort of oil perhaps?  Since I use the blender several times a day, I'd rather not run a dishwasher cycle. "
244,How to open a bottle that won't open,"So sometimes when I leave bottles of sauce in the pantry too long, the lid seems to ""stick"" to the bottle and won't allow me to open it. How can I open the bottle when it doesn't want to open?

245,How to clean a water tank,"I've a plastic water storage tank as such with a small lid (12""/30cm in diameter).

Thanks. "
246,Grey water reuse into back of toilet?,"If I remember correctly, adding water to the back of the toilet storage tank will cause the level in the toilet to rise(after the next flush).    I have a dehumidifier now, and am wondering about pouring the water it collects into my toilet's storage tank.  Not only would it save on water usage, but would reduce the stress on my septic tank.  The amount of water it collects is probably worth a couple flushes a day.  Admittedly it's pretty minor, but I can locate the dehumidifier near the bathroom and it becomes no more difficult to empty it into the toilet than it is to empty it directly into a drain.  I can either manually pour it into the tank, or setup a drain hose to automatically empty into the reservoir.   What will happen if I overfill the reservoir, either by pouring too much into it or via an automatic drain hose that might pump too much water? Can I adjust the bulb in the toilet in such a way that it fills the reservoir significantly less, so that it uses less water after a flush, since I will be replacing some of that with grey water?  Or is it not possible to make such an adjustment without screwing up the normal operation of the toilet?   Note there are two concerns to overfilling:   Could the reservoir overflow and flood out of the top of the reservoir and onto the floor? (with a continuous drain hose from humidifier) Could the reservoir fill to a point where it does not overflow, but on the next flush it overflows the toilet?  Sometimes my toilet clogs but it doesn't overflow as long as you only flush it once and clear the clog before flushing again.  I want to be sure the reservoirs are designed such that it's impossible to fill them to a point where the next flush would overflow the toilet.   I think one of the vertical pipes in the toilet is open on top to allow overflow to drain out.  Will this prevent both of the potential scenarios?  Note, this information would be useful to others who might want to create a DIY grey water reuse scenario that is similar to the continuous drain scenario.  Perhaps having the drain from a second story sink feed into the reservoir of the first story toilet. "
247,Preventing smoke entering apartment when windows are opened?,"I live in an apartment building, on the second floor. Now that it is nice outside, I have noticed a very frustrating problem - when windows are open, I frequently smell cigarette smoke in our apartment.   Looking at the patio of the downstairs neighbor below makes it clear where this is coming from.   This smell bothers my allergies fairly significantly, ignoring any health effects.  The apartment has very poor circulation of air so in the summer, leaving the windows open is desirable. The windows face west, so it becomes very warm in the afternoon sun without cooling.  It would be absolutely wonderful to find a way to avoid having to shut them all summer. The door faces into the building, but there is a window in the common space so I could pull air through our apartment on days wind blows that way. Some of the options which I have thought about:   Try to find out which apartment they are and talk with them (not sure what I'd say though - there aren't really good places to smoke nearby) Running the AC all summer (this would be expensive.. and feel lame when it's only 75°F (23.8°C) outside) Trying to run the furnace fan to circulate air out somehow(?) Talk with property manager (this is a bad idea I think...)   Are there other options I'm missing here? "
248,How can I package 3 large boxes together into one shipment?,"I have 3 boxes that I need to return to Amazon, and they only gave me 1 label, but the items came individually in their own 24"" x 30"" x 6"" boxes, and I don't have a box that can fit them all. Because they're all identically sized, and I had a fancy-schmancy machine, I could strap them according to UPS guidelines. The local UPS store doesn't have (or won't admit to having) a strapper.  My ideas have been to use a bunch of paper from paper bags along with a bunch of tape to basically make a form-fitting ""bag""...but that might get shredded pretty quickly. I could also manually strap them with some wire (soldered together), but the guy at the UPS store might give me some grief about my homebrew strapping.

250,How do I know if my phone's jack slot is broken and not my headphones?,"Initials: First of all, sorry if this question has been asked at the wrong place. This is a general consumer electronics question, but there's no such site yet. And I'm pretty sure these are wrong places as well:   Super User Electrical Engineering   My problem is similar to this one: How do I get lint out of a headphone jack?  My problem: I have a Lumia 640 XL device, a little bit more than 1 years old. I use it with a Sennheiser Urbanite headphone on a daily basis.    One day I noticed, that my music stopped suddenly. Even if I resumed it in the player (Spotify), the music wouldn't start again. After a few trials and moving the headphone cable a little bit, it worked again. But during walking, it stopped very often. It still happens almost every day, even if I barely move the cable or anything. It's like the phone loses the connection with the headphones.  When the music does come back somehow, it's like it's on for a few seconds ""muted"" (I see in the music player that it's playing), then all of a sudden I can hear it again.  Investigation:   It's not because of Spotify, since the problem happens in Youtube as well The headphone works flawlessly with another phone, notebook, tablet, etc., even if I try to move and ""break"" the cable a little bit The phone works with another earphone flawlessly, even if I try to move its cable like with the headphone I tried to clean the headphone jack both with a toothpick like tool and with compressed air. Some stuff came out, I'd say it's clean now.   Questions:   How do I make sure, that my headphone / phone is broken, and not the other one? How can it happen, that both of them function properly with an other tool, but not if I use them together, and they were fine for a year?   There are indeed some marks   "

261,How to destroy personal information on courier package containers?,"We have discussed ways to destroy documents without a shredder, but how can I easily destroy the personal information contained on packages I receive through couriers (like shipping bags, Amazon boxes, etc)?  These packages are often labeled with personal information like billing and shipping address, phone numbers, and sometimes even email addresses. The labels stuck on these boxes and bags are hard to remove, and cutting them with scissors is usually too difficult.

They are men shoes that one usually wears in the office. They have about 1cm thick sole made of some sort of solid rubber thing (not sure of what it is sorry) which got thin and worn out at the front mostly and at the heel a bit. They were also worn out at the bottom outside so I have got them repaired (they glued a new sole at the bottom and reconstructed the heel). At that time I could not do that myself. After that the surface inside became even more uneven.  Complained to the guys and they tried to fix it by applying a thin piece of leathet on top of the uneven surface which did not really fix it Tried some soft insoles but did not work well.

274,Earbud wiring setup to avoid yanking laptop / tablet when fall asleep,"I listen to audio before bed. I'm going to use a earplugs/earbud hybrid like this to listen to audio: [website]But if I move in the night, I would jerk the wires of the earbud and this might knock a laptop off a desk. This means that the device must be on the floor, preferably underneath something like a table or positioned in a place further away so I don't step on the device by accident when I wake up.   This leaves the problem of me accidentally yanking out the wire and then the audio wakes up some my apartment neighbors. And also the problem of interacting with the device when browsing (if the device further away from the floor next to the bed, then it will be hard to interact with because it will. If I put the device under a table, it will be hard to interact with as well   Can you help me kick around some ideas for this to make this work in terms of what device to use, where to place it, and how to route the earbud wires? I imagine I will be using a long earbud cord extender. Getting this to work would be a huge gamechanger for me  Some more details     I'm ruling out bluetooth headsets because eventually they disconnect and make a buzzing noise in the middle of the night. Also the act of physically taking off the headset wakes me up a bit when I'm close to falling asleep. That leaves wired earbuds. The device will probably have to be a full windows device with ethernet or USB 3.0 because my wifi is finnicky and my ethernet is great.   "

278,How to not lose an oversized ring?,"My girlfriend's fingers are becoming slightly thinner with time. Her ring is now a bit too big for her finger. She tried to switch from one finger to another. The two thumbs are too big (and it would look kinda ugly on the thumb) and the 8 other fingers are too small. The ring cannot be easily resized down further more due to its design and as it is not a very fancy ring, we don't feel like paying too much (or even anything!) to make the necessary modifications. Its value is sentimental.  How can we make sure the ring doesn't get lost?  We thought about an elastic to make sure it doesn't move but it is ugly. We thought about adding stuff in the interior of the ring to resize the internal part of the ring but couldn't find something that worked fine. Do you have a trick? "

I know that they should be somewhere around my house or garage, because last night I returned home driving. I always try to leave them on my desk, but couldn't find them there.  I searched like crazy in the morning, but with no success (was stressed out and running late). What alternatives do I have to effectively search and find my lost keys?  I already plan to search everywhere again with calm mindset, and try to recall where they could be, but I wonder if there is a more effective or efficient way of doing it, as I am short on ideas (taking advantage of the fact that they are metallic/electronic, perhaps).   What do you suggest?  Note: I also thoroughly checked inside my car (luckily the window was halfway down to open it), but no success again. "
284,How do I separate multiple 5-gallon buckets efficiently?,"Related to How do I separate 2 drinking glasses that are stuck?, but also quite different. Sometimes I have some plastic five gallon buckets stacked up (usually 2 or 3, sometimes 4) for storage, and they slowly sink together. I might not need them for years. Then when I do need them, I can get them apart, but at some expense:   If I poke a nail-hole in the bottom of one, it will release the vacuum, and the bucket will come away. Not good if you intend to use the bucket for liquids, like I usually do. I can get the air compressor, plug it in, wait for it to pump up, find a hose and fittings, put them on, jam the end between the buckets, and blast in some air. They pop apart nicely. However, the air pump isn't always in working order, and sometimes I have this problem in places where the folks don't have a compressor. Holding the buckets between your knees firmly, and twisting the top one. Doesn't work on tight buckets. You can do this for 1/2 hour sometimes to no avail. Same with the method of rolling the buckets, squashing them a little, rolling them, squashing them again, etc. It works unless the buckets are real tight. Getting a narrow steel rod and jamming it between the buckets to let in some air. It works also, but I avoid it as it deforms the buckets.   I'm not sure if there are any conventional methods, because this isn't really supposed to happen. Now you know my problem, and the methods I've tried, and why they weren't satisfactory. What is an efficient way to get multiple five gallon buckets un-stuck that doesn't involve taking a long time (20 mins or longer is a long time), and doesn't involve deforming/defacing the buckets? "

287,Keep from Wearing Holes in the Toes of My Dress Socks,"Ok, so I've searched, and searched, but I'm not getting a satisfactory answer to how I can keep from wearing holes in the toes of my dress socks.  Some say to keep your toenails trimmed, others say they do, and they still get holes.   Some say that your shoes make the difference.  What does the lifehacks community say?  I have found these Kevlar socks, which, if they really work, might not be a bad (lifetime) investment.  Is there anything that I can do to keep my dress socks from getting holes in the toes?  @Shoket suggested I add these details from our comments below: The reason I'm asking this question now, is because I recently cleaned house, threw out a bunch of old socks with holes, and bought 8 pairs of new socks, which started getting holes within a month.

My current technique is to give each envelope a quick shake to drop the contents to the left side, then use scissors to cut about 1 mm off the right side. Then I reach in and pull out whatever is inside. It takes a bit of time to do a stack of envelopes, leaves an annoying pile of little slices, and there is a chance that a tiny piece of the contents will be cut if the contents fail to shift when I shake.  Is there a better way? "

291,Continuous vinegar disinfecting of dehumidifier water basin,"Being a very lazy person, I get tired of vinegar spraying the inside of my dehumidifier's water basin every week.  It's a highly compact machine, and the water basin is has an odd shape, with all sorts of hinged doohickeys at the top (which is the opening), so it takes a bit of dexterity to ensure that I coat all of the interior, deep down to the bottom.  After spraying liberally, I let the basin marinate in the vinegar for about 20 minutes before rinsing it out, then wiping down the outside.  Since the bottom has complex contours, I jiggle the basin every few minutes to ensure a fresh layer of vinegar on the surfaces that are not at the lowest point.  It's not exactly a hands-off process.  One way to avoid the need for this might be to simply pour a few table spoons of vinegar into the basin whenever I empty it out (daily), and leave the vinegar in there while the dehumidier operates.  It will mix with the condensed water extracted from the air, and be in constant contact with the bottom of the basin.  The top of the basin, which doesn't touch liquid water (but might be exposed to high humidity air due to the water in the basin) doesn't get contacted with vinegar with the exception of one of the side walls during the emptying of the basin.  Has anyone ever tried this?  Does it actually make it unnecessary to do the weekly disinfecting?  Would the constant exposure to vinegar harm the plastic?  Would the lack of exposure to vinegar of the top part of the basin (including the complex doohickeys) be at risk of developing grime, mildew, or mold?  Does it make the home smell like vinegar all the time?  Would that be bad for one's lungs?    I also wonder whether it would be just the smell of vinegar in the air, whether the vapour in the air would actually be acidic.  If so, then in the long term, constant exposure could harm all things exposed to the air, e.g., books, plastics, fabrics, HEPA filters, etc.  Just wondering about the overall wisdom of indulging my laziness....

292,How can I better protect my laptop in my backpack?,"I recently purchased a new laptop. This one is an investment as I intend to use it for consulting and moonlighting. I take my laptop with me commuting to and from work, as I've got opportunity during the commute to bring it out and do work. Since this laptop is an investment I want to do the best I can to protect it from damage. I put my laptop into my backpack, in the compartment built into the backpack for laptops. However, to be honest with myself, the backpack I've got is just the garden variety that you get at Sam's Club. It's a Swiss Gear backpack I got 4 or 5 years back. Yesterday I took a close look at the compartment for laptops and found that it really isn't well padded. The public buses and trains that I take to commute normally jostle a lot. Clearly the best thing to do would be to purchase a better backpack with proper padding. But, at least at the moment that exceeds my budget. Especially when I look at some of the brands out there where a really good backpack with good padding for laptops is around $200.  So, I'm wondering if there something I can put into my current backpack's laptop compartment which will give it good protection from the bumps I normally experience in my commute? I've thought of maybe using old clothes or a towel, but wonder if that would just leave lint that could go into the air vents of the laptop. What other material might I consider? "

301,How to keep an inclined driveway clear of snow?,"If a driveway has a fairly steep (~15 degrees?) incline, is there a good hack to use that incline to help keep it less snowed-in during heavy snowfalls - say, 1 foot at least?  I considered using cardboard from large boxes on the driveway, but it's too big to be realistically covered; and if the snow is wet, the cardboard becomes soggy and at best, rips up when trying to move cardboard+snow; at worst, freezes to driveway itself.  Salting is the obvious first approach, and the incline clearly helps as the melted snowwater flows downhill; but for a large snowfall it is clearly nowhere near enough to make even a small improvement.

314,How to maximize total apple/pear volume in a space limited bag?,"My grocery store frequently has a special on pears and apples where you fill the bag for a set price and I'm never quite sure how well I've done maximizing the contents.  My restrictions and (limited) sense of etiquette:   I prefer apples to pears, so I wouldn't want a solution of more than 1/3 pears. I also get bored with one fruit, so I don't want 0 pears. I also refuse to harm any fruit in the process (i.e. no apple sauce.) The bag is 2 sheets of 30x30cm plastic when laid flat. Apples are 4-6cm ~spheres, while a pear might be 4x6cm. I have no measuring instruments in the shop, no willingness to replace fruit already in the bag, or take an excessive amount of time, etc.   Given these restrictions, my question is how do I maximize the total volume filled and minimize the air gaps assuming these varying sphere and pear shapes?  Do I start with smaller or larger apples first, do I start with pears first? Are same size or mixed size/shaped objects easier to use to fill a space? Etc.  More about the bag:  It has plastic handles at the top which need to be closed together making a rough sphere. It is prone to ripping, particularly where the handles connect, so stretching is not practical. The bottom corners are pushed up inside about 2 cm and welded in the side welds, making it slightly more spherical when full. The offer claims that it can hold at least 3 Kg.   "

I use a similar electric trimmer to the one the OP posted in the following question: What to do if your shaver broke halfway through shaving? I also already follow the rules mentioned in the top-answer of the above question.  I don't have a beard, and I don't shave close. That's why I used the term facial hair. I have a certain facial hair style I want to accomplish every time I trim my facial hair again.    So I actually have two questions:   How do I trim my facial hair symmetrically? How do I achieve the same facial hair style every time I trim?   To trim symmetrically I just use my good eye and move my head from left to right and trim here and there, until I find it symmetrically.  If my last trimming-session isn't that long ago, I can still see where the hair is shorter; I see the trimming-lines and try to follow them again. But if I trimmed a long time ago, I can't recognize where I trimmed last time.  I thought about something like a template. But what would that be made of and where could it be fixed?  I hope I'm not the only one bothered by this. "

329,Career lifestyle - feel tired every afternoon,"Background:  I recently started my career as a professional. I have the luxury of working ""flextime"", meaning I can start and finish when I want, as long as I work my 7 - 8 hour days. Virtually all of my work is at my desk on the computer.  The travel time to work is about 45mins, and I enjoy having more free time in the afternoons, so I choose to work from 7:30 to around 3:30 - 3:45.  However, when I get home at around 4:30, most days, I feel extremely tired / lethargic. I'll often ""slump-out"" for up to an hour, essentially loosing my extra free time, and then feeling sluggish for the rest of the evening.  I always get 8 hours of sleep, but still struggle to ""grind out"" the entire day. I don't drink coffee, mainly because I just never got into it and I don't particularly like it.  Some of my friends are tradesmen who wake up at like 5:30 and still manage to last until 10 o'clock at night - I don't know how they do it!!  I eat plenty of food and drink plenty of water throughout the day. I'll have a small meal at 9:00 and another when I finish work at 3:30. These are on top of lunch and a few snacks as well.  Due to my regular water intake, every hour or so, I go for a walk to a distant bathroom to stretch my legs out.    Questions:  Is this lifestyle routine something that I will get used to as I get older?  What strategies can I employ to feel less tired in the afternoon?  I really don't want to start work later because I don't like getting home late(er). "

But I think my question is still diferent in the solution being asked for, as a) I am well aware of what causes the charging up and b) for me it would also work, if instead of reducing the shock I could prevent charging up in the first place.  So I have a new pair of shoes. Since I wear them, I get very easily electrical charged. Especially if walking on carpetfloors. I was hoping this will get less, after the shoes start being worn a little, but it didn't stop yet for 3 weeks. After having had a walk of like 50 meters on the hallways at work, I get almost assured a shock, when ever I have to touch a doorhandle. What is quite often the case, and the shocks I am getting are sometimes as painful, that it is even when touching metal with my arm through clothes very unpleasant. Not to mention how much it sometimes hurt at the finger tips...  So are there any modifications I could do to the shoes1 or myself to prevent charging up?  And if not so, is there any item, I could use to discharge myself in a comfortable way in a work setting? Even the walk to the Watercooler requires me to touch 3 different doorhandles leaving alone the water cooler it self having metal buttons... And it feels unhandy for me having my carkeys with me every time I have to go somewhere as I usually lock them away while at work. But if there was an item being more handy for this setting, that would work too.    1rubber sole with some synthetic threading forming the shoes cover. "
331,Projector buzzing noise,"I have a mid-sized projector (Optoma HD142X). After about a year, and perhaps because of the recent warmer temperatures and therefore more internal fan use, the unit makes an irregular and intermittent whirring/buzzing noise. Projectors get quite hot and have a big fan. I wonder if it might be the fan, for example a lack of lubrication or build-up of dust. I read the user manual and online forums at the manufacturer, and didn't gain much insight other than a recommendation to send it to the factory for service.   How might I determine the problem at home?  Are there any fixes I could try without opening the case and voiding the warranty? For example, would compressed air help?    There's very little tool access through the exhaust port. Thanks for any ideas. "

336,How to make a ball pen work on difficult paper?,"Sometimes, I have trouble writing with a ball pen, when the paper is ""dirty"". The pen just stops working, and I have to unblock the ball by writing on another piece of paper that does not cause any trouble before being able to use the pen again on the original paper. This is annoying.  I am actually not sure what the ""dirt"" is (dust, slightly humid or oily paper...?). But I am sure many other people have experienced the same problem: it's definitely a problem of the paper, not the pen; it usually happens on notebook paper rather than paper for printers, and not on all pages on a same notebook.  How can I write on such paper with my usual ball pen without having to switch every few seconds to the secondary paper?  (And bonus question: What is wrong with the paper?) "
337,How to reattach headphone cables that have separated,"Many headphones have two plastic-sheathed cables, one attached to the bottom of each speaker.  The two cables meet in a plastic joint a few centimetres below the speakers, and then continue as a connected double cable until they terminate in a jack.  (See picture below)    The problem with this design is that the connection between the double-cable sheaths is pretty fragile.  It's not uncommon for the two cables to become separated after the joint.  (Both cables are still sheathed; they're just no longer attached to each other.)  You end up with a pair of very long single cables, which are prone to tangling.  Once a double cable has separated, or started to separate, is there any good way of reattaching it?  I could tape them back together, but that would adversely affect the cable's flexibility.  Is there some kind of glue I could use that won't make the cable too stiff?  Or would it be possible to non-destructively heat up the cables so that the plastic sheaths fuse back together? "

348,Water Softener salt and Dehumidification,"I have a Water Softener which uses tablet salt so I have plenty of salt available. I have a problem with my loft (attic) in that it is constantly very damp. I've noticed that salt seems to be able to draw moisture from the surrounding air, spontaneously forming a salt-solution.  I'm wondering if I can rig-up a device a bit like one of those low-tech (Chemical) dehumidifiers:   where the resulting salt solution is captured in a vessel and I can then empty the solution into the softener - getting 2 functions from one bag of salt. The softener actually requires brine to regenerate the resin-bed so it relies upon steeping the salt tablets in a controlled amount of water and it then sucks that up during the regeneration.  1) Will this work?  2) Can anyone see any potential problems?  3) Any suggestions for building the device?

362,How can I soundproof my room (or part of it) so I can sing without annoying my roommates?,"I'm looking for an inexpensive way to soundproof my bedroom or possibly just a part of it (with a sound resistant shelter).  Removing all the sound is impractical, but I'd like to suppress it to the point where it might sound like it's coming from outside rather than next door.  I have some music studio equipment in my room which I use to record myself singing.  The equipment is too bulky and awkward to move to a different location for recording.  I know that sound travels easily in the house we share, especially through the air vents.  When my roommates next door speak at normal levels I can hear every word they say.  I'm currently renting so permanent modifications to the room are out of the question.  I would prefer the final solution to not be too expensive.  I don't have many tools but I might consider buying a few for this project.  My current idea to solve this problem is to construct a sort of shelter made with PVC pipe and moving blankets which I can set up and take down as needed.  Is there a better solution?  Should I consider anything in particular with this potential solution, such as different materials or a certain shape for my shelter? "

365,How to disinfect inside of shower and water tap outside your home so you don't get sick?,"I know this probably sounds hypochondriac, but seriously - I learned that some people do shower enemas i.e. taking off the shower head, insert the hose in their anus, and run water. THAT IS SO GROSS if they decide to do that with a shower that other people will use later, e.g. at hotels.  If the worst thing you can catch from using the water source contaminated by these people's various bodily fluids + solids is 1 day of vomiting and diarrhea, it would not be that big of a deal, but can you catch more serious diseases like hepatitis or parasites?

366,Best method of getting a wine label off a wine bottle?,"In the ""old days"" wine labels used to soak off in warm water, presumably because they used plain paper and a water-based glue.  Nowadays 99.34% of labels are of the self-adhesive variety, laser-cut with embossings, metallic and plastic finishings and coatings and seemed to be designed to military specifications NOT to be removed.   I am a home-brewer and need a supply of clean re-usable wine bottles, and removing these modern labels is a chore.  I have tried the following but I may have missed some good ideas:   soaking in water... this sometimes sort of works - it seems to depend on the quality of the paper versus the power of the glue.  Fails often on coated labels. Resort to scraping with a potato peeler. If that fails bin it.  ~ 5% chance of success VERY carefully pick up a corner and peel it off by hand. When it rips, try a different corner. Again this depends on the paper quality vs glue and seems to critically depend on the angle of peel. Good approach for coated labels. Often you can succeed in doing this on the front label then fail totally on the 2 back labels which have an entirely different constituency. ~ 5% chance again Lighter fluid.  from an old trick in removing floppy disk labels - tiddle lighter fluid liberally over the entire surface of the label (only works on non-coated labels) so that it soaks thru the paper into the backing glue. I use my fingers to spread it. Wait until it just appears to have dried - then peel as for 2.  If it rips - you can try repeating the whole process. Often leaves gluey residue.  Use a paper towel and more lighter fluid to remove it, and polish it off.  ~ 70% chance. heat bottle in slow oven oven at ~100C. use gloves and try and peel label with other hand. Some skill/risk required  ~ 40% chance   Ok what methods have I missed? and what are the estimated chances of success?  P.S. you will need to successfully remove labels to try the bottle-chopping hack What is the best method for cutting the top off a wine bottle? "
367,"How to ""recharge"" sodium acetate hand warmer without a stove?","I have a pretty standard hand warmer with the metal discs in them to activate them - I did some research and found out that they are Sodium Acetate hand warmers and the disc is used to 'freeze' the liquid making it heat up.    I used this on the way to work as I was getting a little chilly and now that I am at work I want to 'recharge' it, i.e. make it back into liquid form, and the instructions given for doing this is to put the pack in a pan filled with boiling water and then allow it to simmer for 10 minutes and it should be returned to it's original state. However, as mentioned, I am at work and unfortunately we do not have a stove for me to keep a pan simmering for 10 minutes but I do have a microwave and a kettle and other standard kitchen utensils. So my question is, is there a lifehack / way to 'recharge' / reset a sodium acetate hand warmer without having a stove to keep water simmering for 10 minutes? But instead just using standard utensils or a kettle or a microwave?  Note: It does say on the pack not to microwave or put it in a kettle but if there are any lifehacks contrary to these warnings, I am not afraid to be a bit of a 'Daring Dan' and break the rules because sometimes I just want the world to descend into anarchy.

I also tried some ""energy smart"" fan heaters, but by using 1-2kW of power it looks like my kettle is doing a better job by using the same amount of power and at least by boiling the water.

372,How to make sure I can't be heard by neighbours (without asking them)?,"I live in an apartment that share walls with the apartments of a few neighbours, with whom I'm generally not chatty. I like to listen to music (without earphones) and more importantly sing in the shower, but I don't want to disturb them. How can I determine if I am being too loud without having to constantly run next door to ask ""can you hear me now?"" In other words, how can I make sure I'm not being heard by my neighbours?  Details:   I want to do my stuff as loudly as possible while still making sure that my neighbours can't hear me (in order not to bother them and maintain my privacy). When singing or listeing to music, I always close the windows and doors of the room I'm in (and they are in good condition). I never do these loud activities in a room that directly shares walls with a neighbour's apartment. I am not only concerned with neighbours on the sides, but also the ones above and below my apartment too.     Note about edits: This question was heavily edited several times (sorry!) and is very different from when I first worded it. Thanks @RobertCartaino for brilliantly helping me figure out what really was my own question. The answer by @ZeissIkon was posted before all those edits (thank you very much for answering, I'm happy that you received some upvotes).  At first, I thought that my problem was to determine what is the ""loudness threshold"" of my apartment, i.e., the limit beyond which my neighbours could hear me; knowing that, I could make sure that I always stayed below that limit. Yes, determining that would certainly work for me, but I realized now that this would be an example of the XY problem. In fact, what I need is any clever way to make sure I'm not heard, not necessarily this complicated one that I was thinking of. "

Now, the odor is almost gone when the heat is off.  However, every time I turn on the heat, the smoke odor will come back. The company I hired says the odor comes from my neighbor. They tell me that, because there is smoke smell in my neighbor's house (which is true) and our ventilation systems are connected (which I am not sure), the odor will be sucked into the vents and then get into my house when I turn on the heat.  But my furnace is a closet in my living room, and my neighbor's heat is NOT on when I turn on my heat. That's why I'm not sure if the ventilation systems are connected.  So I wonder if there is a way to tell if my ventilation system is connected to my neighbor's.  Also, if it's connected, how to fix it? If it's not connected, what could be the cause of the odor when the heat is on?  Thank you very much! "

376,How to keep shirts white?,"Over time (and the course of many washing cycles), my white shirts all turn gray. How should I treat these shirts to maintain their crisp white appearance?  I have read How to make a yellowish white shirt become perfectly white again and How to clean blood from white clothes which both seem to recommend bleach / hydrogen peroxide - should I run every load of white shirts with bleach?  I am not combining the white shirts with other colored items.   "
377,Open a bottle without bending the cap,"Given a bottle that has a non-twist metallic cap (e.g. on a beer bottle), is there a way to remove the cap and end up with it not being bent?  Could it be removed without being bent? Or is there a way to remove it with minimal distortion such that it can be bent back to the way it was before being removed?  I am looking to collect bottle caps for a project. However, my beers of choice do not have twist caps, which results in a lot of mutilated (unusable) bottle caps.  Switching beers is not an option. "
378,At what part of the toilet should I aim to reduce the pee splashing?,"The question has been closed under the claim that is opinion-based. Please read my comment below explaining why I think it should be reopened.    While peeing stand up I wonder where should I aim to minimize the amount of little drops splash out. Some alternatives:      In the middle of the water (F5)? Near the border (G5)? To one side: Near the water (H5)? Far from the water (I5)? Should the angle of the stream with the surface should be orthogonal (F3) or the more tangent the better (F9)?    Also where should I stand. Maybe just the normal/in front is not the optimal place.  Possible causes  The male urine stream breaks up about 15 cm outside the urethra exit. The Plateau-Rayleight inestability forms the droplets before impact. The angle of attack, the distance (velocity of the stream) and the type of impact surface are some of the key elements that will determine the type, direction and amount of splashes. Droplets create a large cavity in the water (due to its surface tension), which then collapses, cause the splashback (similar physics for poop (AKA Kiss of Poseidon)).  Notes about possible solutions  There are some research. Splashlab was widely covered by media. Based on their research and video:   ""When pee hits the porcelain at a 90 degree angle, the splashback is terrible"" ""Narrowing the angle really helps"" ""best practice"" means standing slightly to one side, and aiming downwards at a low angle of impact.   Also:   Of course the best option is to pee sitting down (although in Germany they'll call you sitzpinkler; silly sexism IMO). Reducing surface tension with a shield of paper over the water. Using a surfectant like soap or solvent wouldn't be enough. Other options   Future toilet with hydrophobic coating. Urinal splash screen/buffer: Based on this patent and this tests 3D designers could uploaded their ideas to Thingiverse, there are none!  Some people say you should aim to the back (E1 E2?)     Is related to ""How can I prevent pee from flying off-target?"" but is not the same. I also don't want to put paper on the water before peeing (even if that helps). I'm not interested about sound issues.  Seems like a task for Mythbusters. "
379,Fasten silicone glasses holder to arm of the glasses,"I’ve bought a second glasses holder in the hope it won’t keep slipping off the arms. This is an ineffective product design. It is really annoying as I am in the middle of renovating a house. Every half hour I find the glasses are dangling by one arm, and I have to reattach the so called holder.   There must some way I can modify these silicone bands so they attach to the arm and resist moving more than they do. The small spring simply slides back.    Perhaps a dab of silicone? Crimp the spring? I must not look unsightly. "
380,How to prevent cables getting intertwined,"I have a problem that hopefully one of you wizards could address. When I pack up my work laptop at work everyday I pack the laptop first, then the power cable, then the mouse (with a cable). I do not roll up the cables properly (maybe I should).   For some reason when I come back in the morning and unpack, the power cable and the mouse cable are seemingly interwoven, in an ungodly fashion.    Does anyone know if there is some cosmic law that defines this process? Are there any hacks in preventing this occurrence?  "
381,How does belt fit around roller,I dissembled a printer/scanner for parts.  This is a belt and roller and I think it was used for the scanner.  I can not figure out how the belt fits on the roller?  The belt is a continuous piece and the pin for the roller will not come out unless it is forced out.  Can someone solved the mystery of how to mount the belt?   
382,How can I fix a broken wire?,"I bought an electronic device that consists of a controller attached to a larger main unit by wire.  The wire cannot be detached from either end.  Unfortunately the wire is coming apart on the end attached to the controller, as you can see in this photo.    I asked the seller for an exchange, but they really don't want to exchange it and are offering me money instead to keep it.  Is there any way to fix this wire?  I have looked around and there are various suggestions for broken wires/cords:   Heat shrink sleeve/tube.  That will only work for a wire that is completely cut.  I wouldn't be able to get the sleeve/tube over the wire in this case. Electrical tape Liquid electrical tape Electrical glue/putty such as Sugru Liquid or moldable plastic such as Bondic or InstaMorph   I think the main difficulty with this is that the wire is coming apart right at that trapezoidal cylinder-shaped flexy thing (does anyone know what that's called?) on the controller.  Electrical tape would have to cover both that and the wire and I'm skeptical it'd be a strong hold.  Not sure liquid electrical tape or putty would work either. "
383,Something to keep the fizz of cola bottle,I am looking for some trick or gazzette to keep a bigger bottle of coke longer so that it doesn't lose all the fizz everytime it's opened again! Something which could keep the CO2 longer so that a bigger bottle could be used longer?  Anything we have? 
384,Removing Liquified Plastic Layer Residue From Notched Metal Surface,"I use old electric hob (as shown in the picture) for preparing my food, which takes a while to heat up and then takes even more time to cool down after use. Today I made a grave rookie mistake - as the hob was cooling down, I thought it would be a good idea to put my plastic cup of water on it, in order to warm it up. One minute later I recognized that the plastic began to liquify due to heat still being there, apparently...  Now, the second biggest mistake probably was my reaction, as I hurried to scrape the remains of hot plastic with a knife, which removed 99% of it, but a small visible layer of it still remains. It probably was not an issue, if the metal surface was smooth - but it's actually composed of many little notches, which makes it somewhat difficult to reach and clean them.  Therefore my question is - how do I remove that plastic layer lurking on top of the notched metal surface? Will heating itself be enough for it to slowly evaporate, or is there some other 'smart' way to react with this plastic?    "
385,What's the best way to avoid slippery (frozen) outdoor stairs,"My outdoor stairway has been very slippery this winter. I've regularly removed most of the snow and ice, but the last thin (and almost invisible) layer of ice covering the stone steps has been difficult to remove, making it at times dangerous for some of my guests...   I've been wondering what would be best to avoid my guests slipping on this thin layer of ice: sand (gravel), salt or sawdust. I haven't used sand because I considered it unpleasant to bring in ""dirt"" with the shoes, and I'm not so fond of using salt because I think it might not be so pleasant for my cat (but that might not be correct?), and sawdust is something I never even considered, before reading about it in the newspaper the other day. It said sawdust is efficient, and durable, but is it ""dirty""?  Does anyone have a rational (and convincing) reason for why one single of these alternatives should be chosen before the others?  "
386,How to prevent a generator from making lots of noise?,"My parents put a freezer in my bedroom, and it's freezering away all day and all night, 24/7, and it's driving me to the brink of insanity.  Is there anything I can do to 'mask' the noise of the freezer? It's kind of like a generator but a little bit louder (loud enough to be noticeable). It's just this horrible monotone noise that goes on all the time in my room, I hate it. What can I do to mask the noise of the freezer?  Or for a more general question, how do you mask the noise a generator makes?  Thanks! "
387,How to weigh a small item without a scale?,"I need to weigh a small item.  Let's assume that it's up to 20 pounds (~9 kg).  A tabletop scale would make this really easy,  &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;,  but unfortunately none is available.  Given other household items, is there a way to do a quick measurement faster than running out to a store and buying a new scale?    First ideas:   My first thought's to place the item in a small bucket, put it in a sink/tub, then measure the approximation water displacement to back-calculate the weight.  But that'd seem to waste a lot of water. Basically the same as (1), but using two cups or bottles of different sizes instead of a bucket and tub/sink.  Could extend this to handle high-volume items by balancing the item to be weighed in the center container to use it as a plunger, but would still seem to need an outer container that has sufficient volume for heavier items. Maybe using something like floss to do some sort of pulley-based system against a known weight?  "
388,How can I make sure that I wake up in the morning?,"I've had trouble waking up on command for basically my entire life. I just graduated with my bachelor's in December, and I started grad school in January. The only job I've ever had before was in the evening, and it's never a problem for me to be awake then.  The thing is, I can already tell that attendance is basically mandatory for me from now on. I won't be able to get mostly A's in graduate level classes despite missing 8am classes ~weekly like I could in undergrad. The other morning, I woke up at 8:10 asleep on top of my phone/alarm clock. I was lucky that I woke up at all, I had slept until 9am and missed my first class the day before.  This is beginning to really stress me out, because I need to go to the lectures every day so I can do consistently well on exams. I have never had perfect attendance in a class that met before 10am in my life.   What are some steps I can take to make sure I wake up in the morning? I need to fix this problem now or I won't be able to continue on the path to get what I want out of life. How do you guys manage it? "
389,How to open oysters safe without oyster knife & glove?,"I've done some research but I noticed there are some ways to open an oyster.

391,Using electricity at night,"In Germany I get offers for reduced electricity rates from 22:00 to 6:00 for private households. The reduced rate is about 20% less than the normal rate.  We're a family of 4 persons, 2 adults and 2 children at the age of 5 or less.  Children go to bed at 20:00, my wife latest 23:00 and I between 23:00 and 24:00. We get up between 5:30 and 6:15, depending on how many of us decided to take a shower in the morning.  As you can see, it shouldn't be a problem to turn something on at 22:00, even something that needs manual interaction, and turn it off in the morning around 6:00 or a bit later.  What kind of electric devices in private households are most suitable to operate during night so that I can save electricity expenses? Or is this offer just scam and not really suitable for personal use?   I can hardly think of any device I could operate during night, but possibly I just don't own suitable devices.   A washing machine (~2 hours run time) might be ok, but then the clothes lie there for another 6 hours until they get hung - not the best choice... With an energy class A+ washing machine I could move 220khW (~70 €) to the night shift, saving ~14 €, which is not really that much. "

393,How to make my bony shoulder comfortable for resting head on?,"I am not underweight, but I am tall and skinny. I have basically zero fat on my shoulder, and so my clavicle and acromion poke through, making a very uncomfortable resting place for a head.    My best solution so far would be to carry a little shoulder pad around in my pocket, and nonchalantly slip it under my shirt whenever necessary, but that seems a little tacky.  Is there a certain way I can hold my arm to minimize discomfort for the rester?   Perhaps I can exercise or eat in a certain way to build fat/muscle on my shoulder? "
394,"How to remove ""wet dog"" smell from washed dishes?","Quite often my dishes after washing have a rather unpleasant smell that I can only compare to the smell of a wet dog. For a longer while I thought it's just me, until I Googled ""wet dog smell dishwasher"" and realized that this is actually a pretty common complaint. At the same time, there are tons of different possible causes listed online (a common one having to do with egg residue on dishes), but nothing more credible than a bunch of forum posts of people having the same problem. Also, like some other people, I noticed that the smell intensifies if the dishes are left to dry with the window open. I used a dishwasher, but others noticed the problem also appears when hand washing the dishes.  Now that I know that I'm not alone, I wanted to ask here if this phenomenon has some proper ""scientific"" explanation? Does it pose any health risks? Only then, based on that explanation, I would love to see some solutions. "
395,How I prevent my computer from collecting dust?,"Every time I open the casing (tower type) of my computer, I can see a lot of dust inside. The dust is often all over the blades of the fans.  As we all know, it is not a good practice to cover the vents. So is there a hack to prevent this and control the dust?  My thoughts:   Are there any chemicals which can attract dust? (As same as silica gel absorbs vapor)  Are there any dust resistant computed which can be applied on the surfaces that are exposed to dust?  "
396,Remove staples from a hard board,"I prepare some religious decorations using hardboard in each may of the year. When the festivals are over, I dissemble the decorations and reassemble on next year. I use staples to assemble it. Is there an easy way to remove staples from hardboard?  What I have tried so far?  I have tried a staple remover like this one.  But it was not 100% successful. When I try that machine to straight out the two folded ends, It does not straight both the ends. Sometimes it straight a the left side or the right side. Then it will be hard to pull the staple pin from the other side. It is annoying. Since I have to deal with lots of decorations in festival times I have to remove about 1000 staples when dissembling. So, if there a efficient way to do this, it will be great. "
397,How do I avoid paint crusting around the top of the paint can?,"Whenever I paint from a can, I end up with paint around the edges of the can from where I've removed excess paint prior to brushing. The second time I open the can, this old paint tends to break off and pollutes the paint with bits and sprinkles all over the floor.  How can I paint in a way that avoids this? In the past I've tried decanting into a paint kettle, but this still involves messing up one part of the can edge. I suppose I could try and wipe that clean, but it seems like a hassle.

398,Safeguard tennis trainers against worn heels,"I play a lot of hardcourt tennis.  I'm getting through one pair of (K-swiss) trainers every six months or less, because the lining on the inside of the heel wears out.  It's unusual. Usually the sole is the first to go. For these shoes however the sole is surprisingly resilient.  It's frustrating, because it's an expensive shoe, it takes weeks to wear in and become comfortable, and apart from this the shoe is in  excellent condition and could last -- who knows -- maybe a couple of years?   There isn't much choice for hardcourt tennis shoe, and it's been hard work finding one that fits my foot, so when I do replace them it will be with the same model.  Is there some hack that will let me extend the lifetime for the next pair I buy?  Obviously some piece of material, but I can't think of a good choice or a good way to attach it.  I don't think I can sew through a trainer. "

I have medium-length hair on top, short on the sides.   Then usually a few days after that, my hair is perfect. It's still a bit smooth and silky, but it's also ""firm"", with strands and bangs going here and there, and I can style it just by running my hands through it and pushing it in the direction I want.   Then a few days after that, my hair will go completely dead. Lifeless. Dry. Frizzy. So I'll shampoo and condition, and we are back to where we started.  Question: How do I maintain the texture my hair has in the middle stage described above?   I don't use products but if it can't be done without, which ones should I use? "

406,How to comfortably fold socks so that the design of the sock would be outside?,"I want to fold the socks so that I will be able to see their outer design and organize them nicely in the drawer.  What I'm looking for:   That they will be ""connected"" (not only rolled for example). That the socks will be in the correct way (not flipped). I less care about efficiency in size because it's for the drawer and not traveling. I do want it to be comfortable and relatively fast, and not something that would take a lot of time, like this thing.   The best method I found so far is this one, from this YouTube video:    It works fine, but only for thin socks. And it's not that fast.  Any more methods I haven't discovered yet? I don't mind using different methods for different socks types 🙂  Thanks! "

408,Fuse / patch two papers side-by-side without noticeable seam?,"Today I got a raffle ticket which is used for  our seminar party last night. The ticket was torn in half by scissor so that one half is in the rolling bucket and the other half is the guests' hands. The ticket itself is made from a soft, thin white paper.    What I want to do is: Recreate this ""complete"" raffle ticket as if it was never been cut in half, in other words, is there any way to ""fuse"" two piece of paper(of same type) side by side so that it forms one big piece? The dashed line between the two piece is intact in this case so that the fusing part does not involve any pictures to worry. Obviously tape should not be used in this case and using glue could end up messy. If I crudely put them together firmly a noticeable seam can be seen.    Actually I find this a very hard thing to do (some people think cutting a paper is irreversible, thus impossible). Maybe someone with professional knowledge or with paper making theories can tell me that is there a way to achieve a flawless result? "

We lost track of it after a few minutes, and it may have flown outside. How can we be sure?    We closed the door it came in to keep other critters out. We searched the whole apartment including each window and a vase of cut flowers. We have not heard or seen it for about 45 minutes. Do bumblebees stay ""grounded"" for that long during daytime hours, or do they only land for a minute or two and then keep flying? If they pause for a only couple minutes then I'll be confident it's gone because I haven't seen it, but if they stay still for long periods of time then it's possible it may still be lurking and I just haven't found it yet.

418,How to Keep Phone Cool in Car,"In the summer, with the sun beating down on my phone while I drive, my android phone tends to overheat.  I stumbled upon an ad hoc solution -- I had a piece of paper double folded to be 4.25"" by 5.5"" and stuffed in in-between the cables coming out the bottom of my phone and one of my car's vents, which redirected air flow over my phone.  But it's precarious -- I have trouble keeping the paper in the right position. It seems like there should be a simple device to clip onto my car vent to redirect part of the flow up toward my phone -- I know that they make such a device for the vents in my home.

Is there any easy way that I can have the microwave always have power, but the fridge only have power when the microwave is NOT running (i.e. heating something)?   I have seen ""energy saving"" power strips that power stuff down unless when a device is on, but I need the opposite of those - any ideas that I can hack together?   P.S. #1 I am not really concerned about the fridge losing power suddenly or being unable to cool the stuff inside it for a few minutes while the microwave is running.  P.S. #2: I am looking for an automated way, I don't want to have to use a switch or something that requires manual intervention "
424,How to prevent accidentally pressing the power button on a computer?,"I have a PC with an Antec 902 computer case and the power button is on top, and is pressed accidentally when in slight contact with hands or legs. I know you can configure the action of the power button via software, but then it depends on the OS installed (if there is any) and it won't help for accidental powering on (especially problematic when there is no monitor connected).   How would you physically protect the power button to avoid accidental power-on/power-off surprises? And at the same time to be usable when really needed as I don't want to disconnect it permanently?

425,How should I store super glue to prevent it from drying out?,"It seems like every time I open a tube of super/Krazy/cyanoacrylate glue, I get one use out of it, and the next time I go to use it months later, the nozzle is clogged with dry glue (or worse, the entire tube has hardened.  I put it back into its sealed canister, but it doesn't seem to matter.  What's the best way to store super glue to increase its longevity in the tube?  Does it matter if I store the tube nozzle down, nozzle up, or nozzle sideways?  Should I let it sit with the pin in or not? (I assume not, or at least not all the way in; otherwise if the glue dries up around the pin, the pin won't be long enough to puncture the dried glue around it.) Should I glue something to the tip of the tube to try to seal it? "

427,How can I maximize my refrigerator space when storing so many foods?,"Are there any lifehacks where I can maximized the space or capacity of my refrigerator so it can store foods? This question specifically points to the body part of the refrigerator and it focuses on foods only, not drinks and beverages or any other items that we can fit in the refrigerator. Most of my foods are used / leftover viands.  I have a small compact size refrigerator and I can't fit every food that I want to store in it. In my estimation I can store goods (composed mainly of foods etc. vegetables, meats, fish, fruits) that is good enough for 2 - 3 weeks, I am living alone and I eat normally (breakfast, snack, lunch, snack and dinner). So my goal is to make it at least good enough for a month or more.  So far here are the things that I've tried already:   I didn't buy much food - Obviously by buying small quantities of food you can avoid wasting them, but this doesn't answer my problem of maximizing the storage capacity, it's more on avoiding waste of food. I search for foods that I can store outside the refrigerator - This helps me a lot like removing garlic, onion, most of the fruits like banana, orange, watermelon and other foods that seems to be okay even if they are not inside the fridge. And I they are the first that I consume.   Any tips, techniques, ways to maximized the space in a compact size refrigerator so I can store more goods, preferably more foods to make it at least long enough for a month assuming that I am alone, and eating moderately?

But for security and privacy reasons I will always tear it with my hands, one by one. It tends to get tiring with the monotonous work. So I bought a paper shredder recently, which allows maximum of 9 pieces of paper each time.  However this does not solve my problem as the paper shredder is very noisy and very often get stucked in the machine even with only 5 pieces paper inserted.

434,What is the most appropriate type of water bottle for home use?,"When at home I use a bottle to drink water from instead of a glass. For some time - actually, several yaers - I used glass bottles, since:   they can be reused many more times without involving any serious health risk from chemical substances bleeding into the contained water, due to their re-usability, they are not so harmful to the environment, leading to a lower personal carbon footprint, they - at least this is what I have found out in these years - keep water cool for longer time during hot days, when compared to plastic bottles,  they are easier to clean and also do not get that permanent smell as easy as plastic bottles.   However, there were some things that made me reconsider my choice the last months and use plastic bottles as:   my glass bottles used to get a permanent smell, after some time, that, even after cleaning with vinegar - something I mostly use to clean my water bottles; also suggested in the first answer of this question - was perceivable, they also got something like a black rust around the mouthpiece and, more specifically, around the place where the cap of the bottle was placed which was removed by scrathing it with a knife or something similar, they were pretty heavy for water bottles, as I tend to use 1-2 lt bottles.   All the above, especially the health risks I might take made me reconsider and start using plastic bottles. However, there are several drawbacks in using such bottles, as:   they are not that sustainable, so I'm oblidged to buy new bottles quite often which leads in more consuming of plastic, which increases the harm I'm causing to the environment, use of plastic bottles poses also several health risks, especially those mentiond in the second answer of this question, cleaning them has not provided many results, since they easily get a smell and, moreover, even a day after having them, thoroughly cleaned, they are way more vulnerable to exposure to sunlight than glass bottles.   Bearing al these - and whatever may occur - in mind, which of these two types of bottles is the most appropriate for home use? Additionally, are there any other types of water-bottles more suitable for home use and, if there are, how do they relate with the abovementioned issues (eco-friendly, low-to-zero health-risks, easy cleaning, long-lasting etc)? Any scientific results are also welcome!  Thanks in beforehand for your time! :) "

Thinking about this, I came to the conclusion, that    I simply need to create folders for each segment of my life I can use links (virtual folders) if stuff is related to multiple segments.   But now the question is: What are the segments? Are there standard segments?  Do you know segmentation systems in use (i.e. in museums, sciences, libraries, universites, etc.) that could be used?    One first idea was to use roles that I have in live:  The Employee The Business Owner The Son The Father The Husband The Car Owner The House Owener The Investor The ...  Some of them can be pulled together (The Son, Father, Husband --> The Family Guy)  But where to put health, medical, sport, fitness related stuff.

438,public bathroom soap dispenser : wet hands first and press or dry hands first and press,"I've received looks of un-approving stares when performing either of the following actions. I'm trying to determine which is proper.  After having used the facilities (ie going #1 or #2) in a public bathroom, walking up to the sink; what is the proper hand washing etiquette?   To have dry hands and hit the soap dispenser with one hand, the water with another, and proceed to wash?  Or turn on the water, wet your hands, proceed to touch the soap dispenser (with a wet hand) and proceed to wash hands.  To me there are issues with both procedures.   First example, dry hands on the dispenser provides the possibility of leaving some of your ""business"" on the soap dispenser handle. Granted, the next person touching it will be washing their hands also...knowing how most people behave regarding germs, seems like it's not the right thing to do.  Second example, having wet hands and touching the soap dispenser handle, leaves behind a wet dispenser handle for the next user who may by chance be a dry hand soap dispenser person. Again it doesn't seem polite leaving behind a wet dispenser handle for the next person to touch, regardless that the person will be washing their hands anyway. "

440,How to physically secure my laptop in my office desk?,"I work in an open plan area. We have ""hot desks"" (first come first serve). I use a laptop and don't want to carry it with me all the time. How can I leave it in the desk, making sure it is not possible (under reasonable circumstances) to steal it?  One option is to get a drawer with a lock. That's what I am currently asking for. Yet, I am curious of other ways. Any experience about this?  UPDATE on company.  We are a small and fairly new company, nothing like a big firm with strict and clear IT procedures and practices. No rules on locking or so. My employer own the PC since it paid for it, but we can also use it for our private purposes at home. In the end, it is understood that if users leave the company, they will pay off the laptop (if still fine) for a few hundred dollars, which is in any way much cheaper, given that the laptops are quite nice. So it's kind of ""its a company laptop but well, kind of mine in the end"". Don't expect too much in terms of rules or enforcement. "

After a couple of minutes, she does her business right by the back door. :-(  What I think that we need is some kind of sensor that detects her presence by the door and rings a remote alarm, so we can let her out before it's too late.  Is anything like this available as an off-the-shelf consumer product? The alarm should preferably be wireless and with a range of at least 20 feet.  What should I search for? All I can find are expensive burglar alarms.  I am comfortable with building a suitable circuit from the ground up. But I would rather not do that, as we need an immediate solution for this dog's changed behavior.  "

444,How can I replace my carry-on's single wheels with double wheels?,"My grandparents bought this Samsonite 55/20 spinner carry-on 10 years ago.  They don't know the model name; the receipt merely states '99023476-SAMSONITE-N1'.  The warranty expired, but money isn't the issue, as they're willing to pay for bigger sturdier twin wheels.   (Source for pictures: Left, Right).  The carry-on can't be rolled effortlessly; my grandparents must drag it tiresomely; its teeny wheels don't rotate smoothly.   They haven't overloaded it; airlines have always weighted it under 10 lbs.      A cart with bigger wheels is easier to push because its greater-diameter wheels work like bigger levers, multiplying the pulling or pushing force and making it easier to turn the wheels around their axles—in exactly the same way that a long spanner makes it easier to loosen a nut.     But  EVEX (Samsonite's authorized repair corporation) and Samsonite refused to fasten them, alleging that the carry-on can't fit each double-wheel part,  regardless of how much they can pay.    So how can my grandparents fasten the twin wheels themselves? If they oughtn't, what kind of trustworthy professional in Toronto, Canada can help them?  "
445,What can be used ( instead of / for ) a plastic straw?,"A lot of beverages are difficult to drink without a straw such as smoothies and drinks with crushed ice to name two. If you're confined to a bed, that's another accessibility issue.  Plastic straws have joined single-use packaging as pollution and are about to be banned if they haven't been already.  Paper straws fall apart but are re-cyclable 100%. I recently overheard someone complaining that they've gone through six straws with one cocktail (leisurely sipped I assume).  Metal straws are a problem for a couple of reasons: portability - Who wants to carry them around? Where do I put it after I've used it? Cleaning it/them between drinks depends on where you are. Cleaning them causes more pollution and energy use - soap, hot water, Q-tips, brushes, more?.  I've been thinking about this… for minutes. I haven't come up with anything. What can be used (instead of/for) a drinking straw? Can there be no better alternatives? "
446,Inhaling less chalk dust while erasing blackboard during teaching,"While erasing stuff written using a chalk on a blackboard, with a duster, it is commonly observed that a lot of chalkdust is released in to the air, some part of which is inhaled (largely) by the teacher, and sometimes, also the first/second row students. This can be a problem, since even if we discount the case of bad allergies from chalk-dust, this inhalation can cause coughing etc. which one would ideally want to avoid.  What is the best hack to ensure you inhale as little of chalk-dust as possible during this process?  (Of course, this problem does not apply to the relatively swankier marker-whiteboard version of the same, but that's not what this question is about.)    Here are a few hacks I seem to think off, but none of these is of the creative variety that one would ideally want as an ingenious solution to the problem:   Switch to a classroom with a marker-whiteboard arrangement. (Least creative resort, this isn't what I'm asking about here. This changes the condition of the question.) Adopt ""non-dust"" chalk. (Doable, but still not the creative answer I'm anticipating.) Turn up earlier than the class timings, and wipe the blackboard with a wet cloth, which would reduce the amount of chalk dust inherently existing on the board, even without you having written something. (This is doable, e.g. for the first class of the day. But when multiple classes cascade, i.e. one after another during the day, this is time-costly option, and hence, not very efficient.) Go outside the classroom, and bump the duster on a flat surface, which would eliminate most of the dust it has procured from earlier, and hence, you are working with a lesser amount of chalkdust. Tie a handkerchief on your nose and mouth while erasing it, to reduce the amount inhaled. (Perhaps the worst option, I mean, seriously ...!!!)   Is there any simpler strategy (i.e. lifehack) around this problem? "
447,How should I keep track of money lent?,"Does anyone have a system for keeping track of when someone owes you a small amount of money? It comes up when you split something with someone, but only one of you pays and the other doesn't have cash. For example, I split a pitcher of beer with my friend and he didn't have the cash to pay me back right away.  I'm thinking of keeping a Google spreadsheet on my phone. Additionally, I'm thinking of setting a maximum I could be owed at any time, for example [tex]5 and someone else asks if they could have $2 for parking, I'd say no. What do others think?  Of course there's been times I lend a person money and realize I'm not getting it back (either because they moved away or I now know they're unreliable). I'm thinking there should be an element of time to my formula. "

Cockroaches always hailed in my house but they hardly bothered; two or three could be found under the sink or at the attic. But they have multiplied at a mammoth rate recently! Huge numbers of nymphs roam on the table at the verandah at night; things went worst when today I saw many nymphs floating on the drinking water I stored in a pan. Even they don't spare the fridge!! I kept my chipps &amp; cakes at the fridge but was at the blues when I saw cockroaches already enjoying the snacks!! I have used pesticide(spray); yes it killed many but was only temporarily successful. On the 5th or 6th day, I could again see cockroaches. And recently(day before yesterday), I again sprayed on the table at verandah &amp; at the morning I saw many nymphs dead but yesterday I saw with disgust they were resurrected again:( I am very dubious of the effectiveness on the spray; moreover I don't want to use such things as I have a pet dog; he always licks his paw &amp;  pesticide might stick on his paw; he has his drinking-water outside &amp; though I cover it before spraying, it still gets contaminated. I don't want my dog to get die in the course of removing cockroaches. So, is there any ""natural trick"" or any means that permanently help me get rid of these cockroaches unlike spray &amp; also not harm my dog??   Edit: I can't afford for professional experts; after all there is no such thing or  such service at our state. I'm living in a small state of India.    "

462,How to clean dried blood and bone from the car grill,"Sometimes I find dried blood and even bone in the grill of my car. Regular car soap does not remove the blood, especially if it has stained the chrome. Bits of bone also get stuck between metal and plastic body panels, which if not carefully removed could damage the finish, leaving bare metal exposed and possibly rust.  For removing the blood, I have tried high quality car soap, but the best solution that I have found is hartmanns solution. However, this is very difficult to acquire. Are there any other good solutions?  For removing bone from between body panels without damaging the finish, the best solution that I have found is to use a disposable plastic spoon as the spoon will not damage the finish. However, one cannot apply much force to the delicate disposable spoon, so I need something sturdier. For removing bone from the grill and radiator, a spray of water from the reverse side sometimes works. Might I damage the motor by spraying water with the hood open? "

466,Jury-rig a walker for outdoor activity that might involve reaching,"TL;DR:  I want to aide my mobility-limited father in modifying his walker, so it still provides some stabilty and support even when he momentarily removes his hands from it.  Backstory  My father is 85 years old.  He has had three different spinal fusions, a rotator cuff repair, and other surgeries to alleviate arthritis. Each surgery has eased pain at the expense of range of motion.  He can walk short distances un-aided, as long as it is over firm level terrain.  For any longer distance, or any variation, he needs a walker. He normally has the walker around, even when moving about his house, just for safety. At the store, he generally uses a scooter, but can get by just using a shopping cart as a substitute walker.  His walker looks very similar to this one, but with rubber pads in front of the wheels that engage when any downward pressure is applied.    His ability to bend over is also reduced.  He pre-ties his shoes and uses a long-handled shoe horn to get them on and off.  He uses a grabber like this one for other reaching tasks.    Desired Outcome  The other day in an email, my father asked my help in brainstorming ways to give his walker a bit of a ""Tim Taylor Treatment"" and make it possible for him to do some activities he enjoys in the outdoors a little more.  One example is pruning bushes- to grab a branch with one hand, and lob it with shears with the other hand.  Another example is Geocaching, where a small tube might be hanging within a tree and need to be unscrewed or un-buckled, the log within signed, then returned.  Each of these things requires taking both hands off the walker.  Even though he won't be moving his feet while doing so, because he has to reach out slightly, he is concerned about maintaining balance, and wants to still have a little support from the walker.  My father has engineering background and we both have done plenty of tinkering with stuff before now.  He has notions of ropes and straps tied between his belt or suspenders and the frame of the walker.  I'm not sure this will work, and haven't had any ideas of my own so far.  The question(s)  Has anyone successfully modified a walker to do what I am describing and give my father what he desires?  What suggestions do others have for doing this?

467,How to fix zipper-pulls on back pack? Is there an effective substitute that's easy to come by?,"I've had my backpack for 8 years so I guess it should come as no surprise that my zipper-pulls are finally falling apart.

468,How to COMPLETELY peel off a sticky price tag or label on a book or item without the gunky residue?,"Sometimes I wonder if the stores realize that the price tags and labels (the sticky, gluey kind) they put on books and other items are such a hassle for their consumers and can often damage book coverings (etc)? Or maybe they just don't care.   Anyway -- I have many books with icky stickers on them (which lessens the visual quality of them) and I intend to take them off, but from past experiences, I know that many times I can't get the entire sticker off and it leaves lots of gunky residue behind that is hard to take off. Is there a better way to do it? I know that scrubbing it with water is good... But when it's a book cover -- that's not the best approach because you ruin the cover.

469,System for splitting costs on shared items and household goods with roommates,"I have recently moved into a large house that is shared with several other people. Usually, there are 6-8 people living here at any given time (plus a family in the basement suite but it's separate). I would like to establish an agreement with my roommates relating to shared expenses, mainly for cleaning supplies. Any advice on how to divide the responsibility? Problems I've had in the past are ""I don't use the kitchen often"" or ""I have my own toilet paper"" etc.  The people are a variety of ages. Some are in school and have a tight budget.  The fairest system I've heard of is - whenever something shared or for the household is needed anyone buys it, puts the receipt in the jar with their name on it, and at the end of each month the cost for the receipts in the jar are divided up evenly and the purchaser is reimbursed.  I thought about one person being responsible for everything each month but I don't think this works as it wouldn't be accommodating if someone new moves in.  Any other suggestions? Specific things I would like to share the cost of are   paper towels for the kitchen dish soap dishwasher soap toilet paper for the bathroom hand soap for bathroom and kitchen laundry soap   I really think this would be beneficial as it doesn't make sense for each person to have their own soap crowded around the kitchen sink.

474,Increasing mouse/mousepad stopping power?,"Despite already having a supposedly pretty good mousepad (a QcK) and a decent gaming mouse specifically for precision, it still slips sometimes by about a pixel when I click (not everyone needs pixel-precision in their daily work, but I do). I'm not sure if it's due to the mousepad not having enough stopping power, if the mouse feet are too worn, or even if the sensor is picking up noise, but I'm wondering if there's any way to increase a mouse's stopping power/static friction without necessarily increasing its kinetic friction (e.g. pouring viscous sludge over my mousepad isn't the right way to go). DIY mouse weights? Something to put on the feet? "
475,"Storing herbs, spices, coffee and tea in my Florida van? Temperature inside insulated bag inside insulated freezer","I live in South Florida where the summer sun has no mercy. I drive a new van and I've taken steps to keep the inside cooler during the day. I live in the van for weeks at a time and need to store things in the van. I rarely hang out inside the van from 11am to 3pm unless it's parked in the shade or unless the AC is turned on. At night I have a very large and powerful vent fan and have no issues sleeping in the van even in July and August. However, my goal and concern here is with keeping some items in the van when parked in the sun. I can't afford to run my freezer every day. Items include dry good and things like Herbal supplements, Teas, instant coffee and Olive oil. These are not things that are generally very sensitive to some warmth and humidity ... but I want to see what I can do to offer them a safe storage in my van. Here's what I've done so far:   Install a large aluminum and glass solar panel on my roof, this the space directly above the place i store these things and blocks the sun.  Open large vent opening under the solar panel where heat escapes. Install reflective mirror vinyl where the solar panel does not cover.  Install reflective insulation a 1/2 inch below the roof metal Install a sealed plywood ceiling  Placing said items in an insulated bag Placing the insulated bag in a highly insulated and sealed Freezer (that is usually off)   These updates make a huge difference, but still the inside of a metal van who's exterior can get so hot you can fry an egg so it's not like the cabinets inside my insulated, air conditioned Cinder Block and Wood house were it's always below 80F.  So I am wondering...  I need to test and confirm this with a thermostat, but any idea how hot it might get inside that insulated bag/freezer in a van set up as described parked in the Florida sun? Does it sound like these items are going to go bad or worse be dangerous for consumption if stored as describe ... I mean, tea and herbs are dry leaves and roots ... what if the temp inside the bag is 90 F degrees? Is it even possible it could be 90F inside that bag? "

477,How to make a sticky mess (a permanently sticky material like sap)?,"I have some items I want to add rustic handles to by wrapping them in rope. Imagine a frying pan or feather duster. The items are slippery enough that the rope may loosen or even come off. I would like to coat everything in an adhesive gunk that causes the rope to grip better, without actually gluing it. (Typical glue may not adhere, plus I'd like the chance to remove the handle.)  Sap would be ideal, but I don't have time to go to the forest and hunt for it. 3M 72 spray is supposed to be permanently tacky but its not available in my local stores. I noticed cooking oil forms a sticky mess, so my current thought is to carefully boil some oil and paint that on with the help of rubbing alcohol. Will this work? Should I use a partially drying oil like canola or a more stable oil like olive oil?  Possible solutions:   Wrap the item with 3M 300 LSE double sided adhesive. This works, even on exotic plastics like Delrin. Dip the item in spoiled shellac. For example, blonde (bleached) shellac which has been left in the sun/heat for a long time. However, I'm not sure shellac will grip plastics. Sap, dissolved in a solvent like rubbing alcohol, mineral spirits, or orange oil. Chewing gum, boiled to make it soft and sanitary. Latex exercise band, wrapped around then glued to itself with a dab of super glue. Wrap the item with a tack cloth before adding rope. Even tack cloth adds no grip.   How it should look:    "
478,How can I prevent a receipt from fading?,I have seen a question here about how to restore a receipt that has faded.  What I want to know is how to prevent receipts from fading in the first place.  I have some receipts from a recent vacation that I want to keep as souvenirs.  I was thinking of putting them in a PVC-free and acid-free protective page (such as this) in a binder along with other documents/pamphlets I collected.  What else can I do to prevent them from fading? 
479,How can I know the people following me just use multiple cars but not a GPS tracker?,"Dealing with a very toxic situation, I am listened/spied on by my neighbor and his friend and they follow me as soon as I leave my home, be it on foot or by car.  Is there a trick I can use to determine if they are just using multiple cars to follow me (doing it professionally like cops maybe) or if they have planted a GPS tracker, either permanently inside the car or just stuck underneath it?  I bought a RF detector like this one but this has been ineffective for various reasons:   It is catching background RF noise. I am driving alone, so I can't sweep the car while driving. The tracker could send location either every 5 minutes or only on demand (via SMS). So this solution is not working.   I have caught them following me 3 times (by luck maybe), but I just wonder if they are trying to make me believe they follow me by car to make me stop looking inside the car for the tracker, if there is one.  I know for sure that I have been followed because if I rent a hotel room I spend the night awake because they prevent me from sleeping by renting the room next door and making small noises loud enough to awake me. So this costs me 50€ every time for nothing.  Or if they dare to show their faces in front of me. "
480,Physical Text To Digital Text,"Let me first prefix this question with, I have no idea which StackExchange site would be most appropriate for this question, but I thought LifeHacks might work...  In 1998 my Mom's side of the family had a big family reunion (my great grandmother had ten kids so it really was a big gathering). One of my distant Uncles wrote a sort of book on our families history for this reunion and my Mom gave me the book to read. I couldn't believe how big it is and how much research went into the book. I would like to figure out a way to get the whole book on a website I'm going to make where I can then share it with everyone in our family and ultimately preserve the history for longer than this flimsy book can.  In the hope that I don't have to type word for word this entire 300 page book is there a way where I can just scan the pages and get them in digital text? Obviously I could just take pictures and make the website using the pictures but I feel like it would be more beneficial to have it as actual text because then it might show up on Google searches better when someone searches a family members name or something like that. Also, if someone in the family ever does maybe a research project on our family they'd be able to copy some of the text and reference it more easily.  So does anyone know the best way I can get this old family book into digital text?     "
481,Need help identifying a substance,"A couple years ago I bought a universal windshield mount that will hold a cell phone or GPS that used a suction cup to stick to the windshield. On the suction cup was a clear gel substance that has the consistency of hair mousse, thick and tacky. As it never dries out, the suction cup only rarely looses the seal. Compared to similar devices I have used I would estimate this goo keeps a seal several times longer then an untreated suction cup; it is a great suction cup hack.  What is this stuff, the goo?

486,How to stop a commercially manufactured garment’s dye from bleeding out?,"So, I have an odd dilemma with two pieces of clothing I own:   Vintage 1982 dark green 100% cotton Atari promotional Centipede t-shirt. Modern 2018 dark blue 100% cotton denim button down shirt from Uniqlo.   While both of these items were made decades apart, they both share an amazingly annoying attribute: They both bleed their dyed color like crazy.  I can’t wear the Atari t-shirt anymore (too small) but I would like to wash it and make sure the dye doesn’t bleed out anymore. The denim Uniqlo shirt seems like a selvedge material, and even the white buttons on it show signs of the dye bleeding out.  If I simply soak either of these items in a sink in warm to hot water without any detergent, I can pull them out as little as 15 minutes later and the water is dyed. Deep enough it almost seems as if a frozen ice op was dropped in the water. Washing in a washing machine doesn’t seem to help.  What can I do to stop the dye from bleeding out like this? I have read articles like this one and this one online but I seem to get more confused than anything else. I’m not too worried about garments fading as much as I am worried about dyes leeching out. I simply want to stop the bleeding!  Should these 100% cotton items be soaked in salty water? Or vinegar? Or something else?  I mention that these were commercially dyed (by the manufacturer) because some commercial products for after-market dyeing exist to prevent those items from bleeding. But I doubt they would help in the case of items that are commercially dyed on a factory level. "
487,How to protect micro switches?,"The power button on my smartphone (Samsung Galaxy Note) stopped responding after carelessly using the phone outside on many rainy days. It would not come back so over time I got used to alternative tricks to turn on/off the display as well as the device as a whole.  After a year or so of using these workarounds, I noticed a few days ago that the button miraculously started working again. I would like to restart using it normally but I'm afraid it might now be in some fragile state I could easily break for good.  Is there a simple and safe way of cleaning the button (with its contacts inaccessible within the phone) and protecting it for the future? Like letting a small drop of engine oil through the hole around it? Obviously I don't want to break my phone by pouring something conductive into it but I don't want to accidentally cover the contact areas with some insulating film either. Just something that would remove the remaining bits of rust if there are any. "

Like any shochet, I use a chalaf (חלף), which is a dedicated shechitah knife.    Among the rules of shechitah knives is that the knife has to be uniformly sharp, and without nicks, along its entire length. This presents a problem, when I need to take my knife from one place to another. I can't really put it in my knapsack without it getting damaged, and if I'm travelling by subway I can't exactly hold it in my hand, especially not post-9/11.  How can I transport my knife safely, without wrecking it?

495,How do I prevent/fix holes in the front pockets of my jeans?,"If you have already seen my other question regarding clothing you may think I look like a bum. But I actually don't and I also don't care what you're thinking.  The problem is that I get a hole in the front pocket of my fairly new jeans. The fabric wears off on the inside of the pocket, the one touching my thigh, until there's a hole. This doesn't bother me to much, because I'm always carrying my wallet and my keys in that pocket (the keys are on the outer side, so the wallet prevents the keys from getting tangled in the hole/worn off fabric but it still rather seldom happens). But when it happens it's really annoying! I'm trying to unlock a door and start to pull on my keychain (picture below), which is connected to the belt loop of the jeans with a carabineer, but the keys are tangled in the hole/worn off fabric and I need to reach into the pocket and untangle the keys.    It only happened with that pocket (the left one - if that really matters) and I'm guessing because of the sharp edges of the keys - I actually don't want to change the habit of carrying my wallet and keys in the left, and my cellphone in the right pocket. But if it's the only solution I'll have to.  With one pair of jeans, I've already tried to replace the whole pocket with an old kitchen cloth. It seemed to work, but washing once already resulted in a hole at the bottom of the pocket, where the seam is.  My jeans really are not that old and I don't have holes in other parts of the jeans, so I don't want to throw them away, just because there's a hole in the pocket.  So my questions are:   Is there a reason for these holes, which I didn't mention? Is there any way to prevent worn off fabric in jeans pockets (make fabric stronger/""protect"" sharp edges of keys)? How do I properly replace/fix a jeans pocket which has a hole in it?  "
496,Killing ants: Why cut vinegar / rubbing alcohol with water / dish soap?,"I've browsed far and wide for home remedies for an indoor ant problem. Whenever vinegar or rubbing alcohol are mentioned, the instructions always say to cut them with water and sometimes dish soap. Can anyone explain the purpose of that?  Why not spray the straight 100% vinegar/alcohol?  P.S. Context: This is a rented 1-bedroom apartment on the 9th floor of a highrise, so many outdoor ideas are not applicable.  I suspect that many ideas about modifying the unit or blocking outdoor entry don't apply.  P.P.S. More web searching reveals that vinegar repels ants, but doesn't hurt them.  I find this odd, as straight uncut vinegar is acidic.  I'm wondering about the veracity of the claim that vinegar is not harmful to ants.  Would someone with expert knowledge be able to sine some light on this?  P.P.P.S. Disturbing observation today: Undiluted vinegar doesn't even seem to repel my ants.  I sprayed some droplets on the counter top so that I can prepare food with some peace of mind.  Lo and behold, ants were traipsing about the droplets.  Isn't evolution a marvel? "

498,New-bought cushion not washable?,"So I've just returned home and bought this cushion. Really really soft, bright colours, I just love it. However, I noticed this label that says:     Do Not Wash. Do Not Bleach. Line Dry. Do Not Iron. Do Not Dry Clean.   When I read Do Not Wash, I thought that I could dryclean the thing. However, in the end, it also says Do Not Dry Clean. Then how am I supposed to clean this thing? On further reading, I noticed a little note from the distributor (Miniso) writing:     Brand: MINISO; Product name: cushion; Bar code: something; Material:   exterior: 95% polyester, 5% elastane; Insides: 100% polyester.   Caution: do not soak and do not brush. Do not bleach. Wash gently with   hands. Avoid direct sunlight.   So some questions from an oblivious new cushion customer here:   It says do not wash, but it also says wash gently with hands. Well, I need to wash it eventually, so I assume we're gonna do it with hands. How do I wash things 'gently'? It also says line dry and I looked the term up. It means to literally dry the thing on a clothing line, thus direct sunlight! But it tells me to avoid direct sunlight. What? What should I do?   Could a cushion expert help me with this? The two notes are different. The first one is stitched to the cushion with the label MARVEL, the second one is sticked to a sort of distributor label sign.  For reference, the pillow is extremely similar to this one here: link to Amazon. "

502,Upgrade jackets to be water- and wind- proof,"I have two winter jackets, for different lowest temperatures (i.e. one thicker and one thinner). For a while they were both fine, until I had the experiences to go through rain or through stronger wind (not both at the same time, yet). Regardless of the advertisement and labels, they are not at all proof.  Because I would not continue the business buying jackets, hoping that one day I will find one suitable, I want to ""fix"" the current ones.  My plan would be the following:   thoroughly clean the jackets; properly dry the jackets, avoiding accumulation of dust or some other debris; apply a good layer of liquid ""solidifiable"" something; good soaking / impregnation of the outer layer of fabric is mandatory, I assume; wait for the ""something"" to properly cure; be happy wearing the jackets.   From my point of view, the ""something"" to be applied on the jackets must have the following properties:   must stick to the material of the jackets (I have no idea what they are made of); must remain flexible at very low temperatures; I already encountered temperatures of -25C, so flexibility at -30C or lower is desired; must not become sticky / fluid at higher temperatures; even if I do not wear them in the summer, the temperature in the wardrobe may go well about 25, not to speak about transportation, in case of a relocation, when temperatures in the trunk of the car (or wherever) may go in excess of 40C; must not crack over time; i.e. must keep the proofing capabilities; must not peel as a result of using, or as a result of machine washing; ideally, if it cracks it can be repaired; others; which?!   I have in mind the following solutions:   some specialized spray; however, I think that they are not a long term solution, but more of a hack while in the middle of the trip; diluted silicone;   However, with diluted silicone I worry about:   will it meet the criteria above? including the flexibility; which variety of silicone it better suited? fresh silicone does not (usually) stick to cured silicone;     So the bottom line questions would be:   Which substance should I use? Is my planned technique good enough? Is there anything better than I planned?     Note:  I had several jackets in the past claiming that they will keep me dry in case of sweating. I always sweated inside those jackets and soaked in my own water a lot, the entire technology seeming to be mostly snake oil - so I do not care about claims of destroying non-working technologies. "

Even though I might only be gone for a few minutes, if the timing hits just right, it can happen that my table has been cleared because the staff thought I was finished eating and was not planning to return. (One could also imagine having to take an emergency phone call, and going outside to do it so as not to annoy other diners.)  Generally, I am mostly finished eating by the time that the urge hits me, so it definitely looks like I have abandoned the remaining food on my plate&mdash;but I haven't! I plan to return and finish, just as soon as I take care of this emergency business.  The consequences of this happening include losing the uneaten food that remained on my plate (which seems like a waste to me, both financially and otherwise) and causing the restaurant staff to think that I've skipped the check (left without paying the bill). This results in awkwardness all the way around.  When you're dining with others, this is simple. They know your intention to return, so they can just tell someone who shows up and tries to clear the table. But when you're dining by yourself, the table looks abandoned, and there's no one to convey your intent.  What can I do to indicate to the restaurant staff (e.g., a busser responsible for cleaning tables) that I have only temporarily left, and that I plan to return and finish my food? How can I convey that I am still eating?  I've thought about leaving some personal effects on the table to indicate my plan to come back. Obviously this isn't foolproof&mdash;the restaurant staff could assume that I just forgot my personal effects&mdash;but a bigger problem is that someone else could steal them. For example, I could leave my phone, but there's a good chance that it won't be there when I return. I have tried leaving my credit card to convey both that I plan to return and that I haven't skipped out on the check, but that isn't ideal either, as someone could easily pick up my credit card and walk off with it while no one is watching.  Anyone have other suggestions on how to indicate this simply yet effectively? "
