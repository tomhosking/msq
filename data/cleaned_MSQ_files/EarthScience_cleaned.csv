0,"Is there a special name for along-course elevation profiles of rivers, and where you can you find them?","Was discussing the terrain and rivers of Europe today with my father and it became apparent that a graph of the elevation versus course of a river would offer interesting insight, including a quick summary into the elevation of various cities of interest along the course, and some loose feel for the possible speed of the river in various spots.  I did find one image fitting the general theme of what I was looking for regarding the upper Mississippi River at an Army Corp of Engineer's website:    But I didn't have any subsequent luck in Googling the terms used there, nor on any additional terms, for rivers like the Rhine and Danube.  Are these along-course cross-sections made enough that there's a name for them?  And if so, is there any resource where such images can readily be found for major rivers worldwide? "
1,Global Land and Sea Surface Temperature Data,We are a spin-off from TU Munich and currently working on equipping a  CubeSat with a thermal imager.  The imager should be able to acquire thermal/ir images with resolution of about 200m/px. In the future we see a high potential for building a constellation of such satellites to enable a 10min temporal resolution over all surface temperature data on the globe.  Do you use any data beside those publicly available from NASA and ESA? Which ones? What may be some uses of such high temporal resolution surface temperature data? 
2,Sulfate reduction,"I read a document in which the authors stated ""Sulfate and sulfide ( bisulfide and dihydrogen sulfide) both exist within a system just in varying proportions, and aqueous speciation is dependent on Eh/pH. If one side of the equation changes, the other will transform to balance it out"".  The system they are referring to is an engineered wetland, with low amounts of labile carbon but was amended with gypsum and therefore has high sulfate concentrations.  The authors have stated that in deeper zones of the wetland (5-10m), where it is fully saturated, and where oxygen penetration is minimal, aqueous bisulfide would be the main form of sulfur that exists. However, they have provided no evidence, and the carbon that exists in that zone is highly recalcitrant (meaning it is not readily degradable by sulfate reducing bacteria). So how can they say that the main form of sulfur is sulfide in this zone if the sulfate reduction process is not occurring, or very limited, due to low amounts of labile carbon? Even if it is not reacting with metals to form precipitates.   Isn't it common for sulfate to be main form of S even in anaerobic zones? The sulfate reduction process sure is usually carbon limited in high sulfate systems (e.g. marine sediments and even salt lakes). As far as I know, the Eh/pH tell you about the stability of the species, but it does not ""magically"" transform the sulfate to sulfide.  Thanks "
3,"Relationship between pressure, temperature and density in meterology","I have been learning meteorology a bit on my own, and one thing that never gets answered clearly is the relationship of pressure, temperature, and density.  When I looked it up, the density of air at various temperatures varies quite a bit - if I recall, from something like 1.1 to 1.5 kg/m3.    My confusion comes from trying to understand weather formation.  A typical text says that, for instance, heating of the earth leads to thermals that rise due to their higher temperature and lower density, leading altitude increasing and to temperature dropping at the dry adiabatic lapse rate, then the moist adiabatic lapse rate, etc.  But it is always done using ""parcel"" arguments.  From basic thermodynamics, heating could lead to a combination of temperature increase, pressure increase, and physical expansion (if there is no fixed container).    Specifically, the ideal gas law gives:  [tex] or [tex] (ignoring the constant of R) or [tex]where [tex] equals density.  Am I wrong to assume that the simplifying assumption is that, to a first order approximation, the density can't really change much about an area since a parcel of air could expand, but the whole atmosphere locally can't (since the 'parcels' all abut)?  In other words, ground heating causes temperature to rise, and thus presumably pressure, but to a negligible degree decreases density?    This would seem to imply higher pressure from heating actually leads to a net kinematic effect of driving the column of air upwards (as molecular pressure against the ground increases), where it can expand against lower pressure air above due to the fact pressure falls quickly with altitude - but there really isn't expansion or a decrease in density near the surface itself.  The typical ""parcel lifted by a helicopter"" argument fails to explain how it really all holds together and actually happens, since there is no 'container' for the gas in reality.  Another way to see this is in this example.  Suppose I have a hot tub in Antarctica in winter (I have one in Idaho in winter which is close enough).  The ambient temperature may be -30C or about 240K, and when I open the cover there is water at about 30C or 300K.  I can see thermals climb; the air, perhaps, is heated to 270K (being generous).  But the new air that gets sucked in and heated over the surface to 270K and then rises would immediately seem to be at higher pressure than ambient air since [tex] I could even believe the kinematically more energetic air could cause an expanding 'plume' radially a bit as it rises, since the higher P and T slightly pushes out on less energetic ambient air.  But that just means [tex] is slighlty reduced to take into account the expanded volume of the plume; [tex] has dropped slightly, but nowhere near how fast it will drop if it gains altitude and has truly lower pressure about it.  In reality, it seems:   locally the (synoptic) pressure is close to fixed - and varies only a few percent globally at sea level; the gradient of pressure change is in the [tex] direction; local heating increases T and thus P, except to the degree that increased P allows it to form an expanding plume (which is a few percent, so second order); Really, the more energetic (kinetic) molecules have no where to go but up, what is really causing any updraft.    "
4,"What are typical ranges of rainfall drop sizes, speeds, and areal or volume densities?","I'd like to look into the possibility of using a Raspberry Pi and the PiCam module to detect rain, and to try to make some measurements of droplet size and rate. This could be done using an LED flash or a (modified/pulsed) laser pointer equipped with a fan-out element, synchronizing the flash/pulse with the Pi camera's electronic shutter for a ""freeze frame"" effect, followed by some Python image analysis (e.g. PIL).  This is for fun, and not meant to be a quantitative rain gauge necessarily.  In order to better estimate the challenge, I'd like to get some feel for the distribution of sizes, speeds, and either areal rates (drops per sec per square meter) or number densities (drops per cubic meter). I can convert between various units and histograms, but I don't know where to find a good survey to understand over what ranges these can vary.  See also Will long-term viewing of a sunny sky hurt the Pi Camera? for pics of a cool Pi sky camera by @ThomasJacquin as described here.  Edit: per this comment I should point out my Raspberry Pi will be within a few meters of the Earth's surface, where I can keep an eye on it. "
5,Why does Earth have two kinds of crusts?,"Why does Earth have two clearly differentiated kinds of crusts, namely continental and oceanic? How did they differentiate initially and why don't they get mixed up over time?  "
6,Conversion of body wave magnitude to moment magnitude,"I have been tasked with homogenizing a catalog of events obtained from the USGS website, however, the data is a mix of different type of magnitude measures. How do I convert the different type of magnitude to moment magnitude and what do they depend on? Is it a pure empirical relationship? "
7,What is Boomy McBoomFace?,"The EarthSky article Great Pacific Garbage Patch now 3 times size of France links both to the newly published article in Scientific Reports Evidence that the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is rapidly accumulating plastic and to the YouTube video of one of the authors Boyan Slat - The New Picture of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (2018), which discusses both data collection and analysis, and the possibility and scope of potential cleanup efforts of a huge patch of garbage within the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre.  Near the end of the video, after 07:00 is shown a very large structure being welded. It's been humorously named Boomy McBoomFace in reference to the RRS Sir David Attenborough story and the UAV Boaty McBoatface.  Is this boom part of a subsequent garbage collection experiment, or a cleanup prototype, or something else?    Click the screen shots below for full size display:      "
8,What would happen to the Subtropical Ridge/Horse latitudes and Polar front if the Earth was rotating 5% faster?,Would they move towards the Equator/Poles? Stay in the same place?  What about if the Earth was rotating 10% slower?  Is there a rotation speed for Earth which will lead to 4 wind belts instead of 3 ? 
9,How did CO₂ originate on Earth before there was life?,"To start life there has to be [tex].  [tex]  [tex]  So to start this cycle, life needs [tex]. Where did the [tex] came from?   [tex]  Volcanoes erupt [tex] in the Atmosphere.  Is this the answer? "
10,How is ground water mapped?,"This is probably a very easy question to answer but how are the USGS maps showing ground water locations mapped? Is it a guy going around taking core samples? Or is it done using satellites and aircraft?   Also related, how quickly do these flows change? Is taking measurements once a year fast enough or does it need to be updated daily?  "
11,The difference of vertical advection and convection process for chemistry species,"In atmospheric, the change of mixing ration [tex] of a chemical species [tex] is determined by:           [tex]   The first term represent the [tex] change due to horizontal and vertical advection.          The fifith term on the right hand represent the [tex] due to the vertical convection.      I have read about this question ""What exactly is the difference between advection and convection?"".          The answer told, which I quoted:        Advection is the movement of some material dissolved or suspended in the  fluid.   Convection is the movement of a fluid, typically in response to heat.   But when we are just talking about the chemical species. They are not in fluid form. So,how dos the convection process mean?         Update:  The equation was from a phD dissertatio Climate and Air Pollution Modeling in South America focus on Megacities. Links here        "
12,Climate in subequatorial regions,Recently my prof asked a question:     Why in subequatorial regions do we have six months of rainy season and six months dry season?   How do wet and dry seasons 'form'? I can't find the answer anywhere on the net. Can anyone help with the answer? 
13,What does a negative value for the inclusive graphic standard deviation mean?,"I'm calculating the inclusive graphic standard deviation for sediment from a cumulative frequency graph, with this formula:    But when I plug in the numbers, I get a negative value, because my ranges at 5, 16, 84 and 95 span the 0φ boundary. What does this mean? Does this mean it is very well sorted, or have I made a calculation error?  My data:   "
14,Why isn't the date of final stratospheric warming and polar vortex breakup regared as the official end of winter?,"Let me try to clarify what I'm really asking:   Imagine that, for whatever reason, the meteorologists and Earth scientists decide to revisit the definitions of the seasons---to define them from scratch based on the current best science (kind of like what the astronomers were forced to do as far as the definition of a planet). Based on our current best science, would it make sense to identify the winter/spring boundary as the date of final stratospheric warming? Or are there other considerations that are arguably more important---that arguably make more scientific sense as winter/spring demarcators?  My question is not about the history of the concept of the seasons, or about linguistics. I of course realize that the concept of final warming has been discovered only relatively recently, while the concept of the seasons has been around for millennia. I'm asking about scientific definitions here, which can and do change as science advances (e.g. Pluto used to be classified as a planet, and now it's not).   (Not that it matters for my question, but: if the science started saying that this is the new definition, the media would start reporting it, and eventually even the public at large would become aware of it. Speaking of which---and yes, sorry, this is off topic---but does anyone have any guesses as to why don't the major media outlets report on the date of the polar vortex breakup, regardless of the definition of the seasons? After all, the public is now quite aware of the polar vortex, given it has been blamed for so many cold spells recently.)  Background  According to the Wikipedia article 'Sudden stratospheric warming',     The radiative cycle in the stratosphere means that during winter the   mean flow is westerly and during summer it is easterly (westward). A   final warming occurs on this transition, so that the polar vortex   winds change direction for the warming, however do not change back   until the following winter. This is because the stratosphere has   entered the summer easterly phase. It is final because another warming   cannot occur over the summer, so it is the final warming of the   current winter.   Similarly, a NASA-affiliated source says that     The final warming is the last stratospheric warming of the season.   After this warming, the stratosphere never recovers to its previous   state and the vortex breaks up and dissipates. The final warming often   occurs in March or April. Sometimes the stratosphere never recovers   from what would otherwise be a mid-winter major warming in January or   February, and that warming becomes the final warming.   As far as I understand it, once the polar vortex breaks up, one cannot have sudden large temperature dips (like we are having in the northeastern part of the US this weekend of April 2-3, 2016). Thus it would seem that the date of final warming is a good candidate for the official date of the end of ""meteorological winter"".  However, NOAA defines seasons according to calendar months (see here). Meanwhile, the Swedes define the start of spring as ""when the average daytime temperature exceeds zero degrees Celsius on seven consecutive days"" (see here).  So: purely on the basis of current best science, would it make sense to define the end of winter as the date of the final warming?   Yes, one could not know that it happened until some time after it happened, but my understanding is that this lag is on the order of days, not weeks.  Yes, such a definition would have the consequence that some years, meteorological winter would end in January. But, so what? Some winters do seem to end in January... while the present one lasts into April.  Yes, one cannot define the demarcation between the spring and summer or summer and fall using the polar vortex as a reference. But, so what? There is no reason why each demarcation couldn't be a separate story. Even the fall/winter boundary need not necessarily be defined as the date of the formation of the polar vortex.  (And while we're at it--and I know this is off topic, but still---why don't the media report the date of the breakup of the polar vortex? It seems it would be of interest to people, given the notoriety the concept has received especially the last couple of winters... In fact, is the date reported anywhere?) "
15,Can ultrasounds be used to map the density of large underground regions?,"This question arose from a related one at Physics.SE, along with my own personal quest to better understand mineralogical prospecting.  I want to know if some kind of ultrasound machine can determine the density of rock, soil, or mountains. Could it see everything within range? For example, could it see a region of high density and a region of low density behind it? Or would one block the other? What would the range be?  And how accurate would it be (in density readings and exact location readings)? More accurate than a gravimetric map?  I'm asking because I want to know if ultrasounds can be used for mineralogic prospecting (exploring for ores that can be mined). It seems like it would be a lot easier to use ultrasounds than to dig a lot of exploratory shafts. "

17,Why is fluid pressure in a fractured rock reservoir only dependent on hydrostatic pressure?,Why does lithostatic pressure not play a role? (or does it?) 
18,What is Stock or Overflow Pit? Is it a terminology in geography? What is the correct word for it?,I have an excel file that I have to make the join with another table that has a column listed of different kind of feature types. This was done by someone else who did GPS'ed and spell that word and handed it out to me to do the spatial join with a point layer.  What does Stock or Overflow Pit? Is it related to geography or geomorphology term? Is there another word that is similar to it? I tried to Google it but with no luck. I looked it up on the image on the google to find it and still have no luck. Would someone out there helped me what they are or what does it look like?  Edit: This was post in the GIS StackExchange and it's not approiate to post it since it is not related to GIS. [website]
19,How to determine constant $C$ in $p(x) = Cx^{-D}$?,"Given a distribution obeying the power-law (fractal) relation, such as the cumulative distribution function [tex], if [tex] is given, how does one find the constant [tex] from a given data set?  For example, given this table:    [Source: C. Li et al. / Geomorphology 130 (2011)]  how does one determine how the values for [tex] were obtained? It appears that they used the method of least squares fitting to obtain the values for [tex], but I don't seem to understand where the values for [tex] are coming from. Any help would be appreciated. "
20,What are the conditions for an ionosphere to form?,"I already asked this on Astronomy SE but did not receive any answer so far:  What are the prerequisites for an ionosphere to form? For example, can a planet without any atmosphere have an ionosphere? What about a planet that is very far from its sun, is there a point where the solar wind is too weak to create an ionosphere?   In one sentence, what are the conditions for an ionosphere to form on a given planet? "
21,"Structural geology, regarding cross section of two outcrops with similar characteristic but very distinct dip","I found an outcrop of sandstone interbedded with claystone which strike/dip is N 195 E/42. Then, around 4 km at the south of previous outcrop, i found another outcrop with similar characteristic, but the strike/dip is N 132 E/79. The question is what should I do to make a cross section? should I connect the bed layer, considering their similar characteristic, or make a new layer, considering the distinct strike/dip? (could it be angular discontinuity?) "
22,Cooling effect by evaporation,Why exactly does water cool down by evaporation? What happens in this process?  How much does it cool down? What's the formula to describe this process? 
23,Locate people by Oxygen/Carbon Dioxide levels,"I've been challenged to think of some really out-of-the-box ways to locate people, and I had one. I'm 90% sure this isn't reasonably possible (probably only in laboratory settings), but I couldn't find a real answer to this question, so now I'm genuinely curious.  It is possible to locate people's location by fluctuations in the Oxygen/Carbon Dioxide levels in the area (from people breathing)?  I realize this is a really general question, and would depend on a ton of factors (size of the area, number of people, proximity of people to an appropriate sensor, etc). I'm really just looking for a general answer, but in case it helps, I'm referring to a general case of detecting people in outdoor settings (it would be part of a sensor suite that is outdoors and just trying to count/locate people in the general area).  Even just a link to a technical paper that explains human impact on immediate area [tex] levels would be great - I've come up completely empty looking, everything I find just refers to global warming/overall environment/over thousands of years. Nothing for immediate impact, if there is any.  Edit: This was marked as off-topic? Seriously? This is 100% earth science. "
24,"What do continents ""lay"" on?","It's a simple question.. What do continents ""lay"" on? Do they float on water? or are they huge bodies that ""emerge"" from the sea floor/bed? are they connected to the bottom of the oceans?  Hope the question is clear. Don't be afraid to be thorough and scientific in your answer, I'll appreciate it and do everything to understand it.  "
25,No sedimentation without water?,"I just found a video on sedimentary rock formation, and to my surprise, it stated that this only could occur in water! I always thought that any layer of matter, if buried deep underneath more matter, could form a sediment and become new rock. Am I completely wrong, or was the video simply not covering all bases?  I did Google it and check Wikipedia, but with my limited knowledge of the field, the results were inconclusive. "
26,Shouldn't India Get an Uplift Too?,"For the past 50 million years, India has been crashing into mainland Asia, creating the Himalayan range and uplifting Tibet, north of the mountains, to a current average height of 4500 meters above sea level.  But why is Tibet the one getting an uplift? Why isn't India, instead? "
27,Importance of meteorite impact craters in geology?,What is the economic importance of large meteorite impact craters with a diameter over 100 m? Can they form diamonds or produce other economic deposits?  
28,"What does the term spreading the risk mean, with regard to natural disasters?","What does the phrase ""spreading the risk"" mean with regards to risk assessment of natural hazards/disasters?   I came across the phrase in the World Economic Forum document, A vision for managing natural disaster risk. A quote from the document:     There are various options for risk management – avoidance, reduction,   transfer or retention. Risk transfer is the underlying tenet for insurance   markets, passing a liability onto another party (spreading the risk). Risk pooling is vital to the recovery of individuals, firms and economies following a natural disaster.   More specifically, what does the phrase mean with regards to insurance and aid, to reduce vulnerability to a disaster/hazard event? "
29,Is climate chaotic?,"The atmosphere is a highly dynamical system, and exhibits many chaotical features.  An operational weather forecasting model tries to model an initial value problem, in fact one of the most famous examples of a chaotic system.  Climate however, is the statistics of the behaviour of the atmosphere over a long period of time.  It is not an initial value problem; it is a boundary value problem.  Whereas small changes in initial values can imply large changes in behaviour over time, can there be any similar behaviour in climate?  For example, we force a climate model with prescribed atmospheric constituents, coastlines, orbital characteristics, etc.  Can a small change in any of those boundary values lead to a climate exbiting a different state?  Or, similarly, can, in the context of natural variability only, the climate suddenly switch to a very different state? "
30,What methods exist for remote profiling of oceanic columns?,"Remote sounding of the atmosphere is a well-established method used extensively used extensively for operational weather forecasting and scientific research.  Active or passive instruments carried on satellites (or aircraft) can measure profiles of temperature, pressure, trace gases, and particulate matter.  Is anything similar possible for a ship sailing on the ocean?  What methods exist, in theory and in practice, to remotely sense a profile of temperature, density, salinity, etc., from the ocean floor to the ship?  Or can such profiles only be obtained in-situ? "
31,What determines how fast clouds move?,"Do cirrus clouds in the upper troposphere move faster than cumulus and stratus clouds in the lower atmosphere?  What about clouds associated with extratropical systems, compared with clouds in the tropics? "
32,Why are weather kites no longer used (much) operationally?,"Figure 1.12 from the IPCC AR5 WG1 report (reproduced below) illustrates the different instruments that have been used for weather forecasting.  Most of the methods have been in continuous use since their inception, except one: kites were used, but later disbanded.  Why is this so?  This Monash university article from 1999 makes the point that they are superseded by radiosondes and aircraft.  However, atmospheric measurements on aircraft are very expensive and mainly used for research as opposed to operational weather forecasting; and, unlike weather kites, they do not (normally) fly in the boundary layer¹.  Radiosondes are only launched once or twice per 24 hours per location.  Passive (operational) space-borne measurements have a lower vertical resolution, in particular near the boundary layer.  I imagine that kites should provide a low-cost, high-resolution (both temporally and vertically) profile of the boundary layer.  Why is it they are not really used operationally anymore?    Figure 1.12 | Development of capabilities of observations. Top: Changes in the mix and increasing diversity of observations over time create challenges for a consistent climate record (adapted from Brönnimann et al., 2008).

Flying in a full-sized jet 20 metre above the ocean surface is an interesting experience! "
33,How have levels of outgoing longwave and incoming shortwave radiation changed over the last 20-30 years?,"So as we know, climate change is associated with increased radiation flux into the Earth. In other words, the sum of (incoming shortwave radiation) - (outgoing longwave radiation) [which I will call net flux] is greater than 0.  I'm just curious though - how have all of these fluxes changed over the last 20 years? Has net flux been constantly positive over the last 20-30 years? Is it changed by El Niño? Have we seen any changes in the flux associated with the recent ""slowdown"" in global warming? "
34,Can we predict which annular modes existed during the time of Pangaea?,"Some examples of annular modes include ENSO, NAM, and SAM.   I think one of the major mysteries of them is how they formed to begin with.  I'm just curious - do we have any idea of whether or not these annular modes existed in paleoclimates, particularly around the time of Pangaea? Do we have the computational power to predict them? "
35,How do Rossby Waves in the ocean form?,"So on land, I believe that one factor in their formation is due to inhomogeneities in surface heating between land and ocean (and also inhomogeneities in surface heating due to terrain effects like the Rocky Mountains).  But what about in the ocean, where we don't see such inhomogeneities? How is the formation and movement of Rossby Waves in ocean different from that of land? "
36,Are certain isobar temperatures higher in mountainous regions?,"So we know that the air temperature at higher elevations is lower. But is the air temperature at a certain isobar over, say Vail, Colorado, higher than the air temperature of the same isobar over, say, New York City?  And more importantly, do these differences in air temperature along the same isobar affect the large-scale atmospheric circulation? "
37,How does the pole-to-equator temperature gradient scale with height contours?,"Are the pole-to-equator temperature gradients lower at higher heights than at lower heights (like 850 mb/500 mb)?  If so, why is it the case? Especially given that the zonal circulation tends to be much higher at higher heights, so one could expect there to be less meridional heat transport.  (Bonus question: how is it different in other planetary atmospheres?) "
38,How do I explain why the Tibetan plateau is colder than lowlands at similar latitudes?,"A common layman explanation for why does it get colder to higher elevations (considering only the troposphere here) qualitatively boils down to The Sun heats the Earth's surface and the Earth's surface heats the atmosphere.  I remember that, every time I heard or read this explanation as a child, I thought: then why is the Tibetan plateau still colder than lowlands at the same latitude?  After all, the solar energy reaching the surface in Tibet is no less.  Clearly there is more to it.  Considering a remark from a quantum physics lecturer that you only really understand something after you've taught the subject twice, I'm phrasing my question as such: How does one explain, in layman terms, why the Tibetan plateau is colder than lowlands at similar latitudes? "
39,How do weather models work?,"We use different weather models all the time, such as the ECMWF and the GFS. These models are simply amazing to me.  How do these models work? I know they have to take in various data points - what are these, and how does the model use it? Also, how do they come up with a forecast or a map of what will happen in the future? "
40,How will cloud feedback effects on the climate change as the result of global warming?,"So global warming will increase the tropospheric temperatures, which, in turn, would make the clouds higher than they otherwise would be.  And higher clouds (especially cirrus clouds) tend to trap in more long-wave radiation. It's the low clouds (like marine stratus) that reflect away incoming shortwave radiation while not trapping in more long-wave radiation.  So my question is this: would global warming increase these feedback effects due to increasing the cloud heights? (and perhaps decreasing the amount of marine stratus clouds?) If status clouds gave way to cumulus clouds, what would be their net effects on Earth's radiative budget? "
41,Do large-scale modes of variability (like NAM/SAM/ENSO) exist in the ocean?,"Large-scale patterns of climate variability can be explained at this Annular Modes Website.  If so, have they been characterized by EOF analysis in the same way that the annular modes in the atmosphere have been characterized? Where would be able to find this? "
42,How will climate change affect the 3D distribution of lapse rate in the atmosphere?,"The lapse rate is the rate at which temperature decreases with height. By ""3D"" distribution, I mean distribution across all latitudes, longitudes, and heights.  Would climate change change the lapse rate more in the poles than the tropics? Would increased humidity be the main reason, or could there be other causes as well?  "
43,How can I calculate the average latitudinal temperature anomaly between a city and all other locations along the city's latitude?,"E.g. How could I calculate the average temperature anomaly between, say, Boulder, CO and all other locations along the 40N parallel?  What about Boulder, CO, and all other locations along 40N at Boulder's altitude?  What datasets would I need, and what resolution would they have? What would be the advantages/disadvantages of these datasets? "
44,How much carbon is sequestered out of the atmosphere through marine snow?,Marine snow in the deep ocean is a continuous shower of mostly organic detritus falling from the upper layers of the water column.  How much carbon is sequestered in this process? How does it compare with the amount of carbon sequestered through plants?  I'm also curious: what percent of this carbon sequestration comes from plankton and what percent from fish? Do seabirds reduce this carbon sequestration? What about marine mammals? 
45,Why is Europe warmer than North America at similar latitudes?,"Traditionally it has thought to be the Gulf Stream. But other researchers, like Richard Seager and Tapio Schneider, propose different arguments as to why.  How much of a role does the Gulf Stream really play? Who is right? (or are they all at least partially right?) "
46,Similarities between grand circulation solvers and mantle convection solvers,"My impression is that both ocean grand circulation models (e.g. MITgcm), and Mantle Convection models (e.g. CitcomS), both use Navier-Stoke's as the governing equation. What are the other major similarities between these two types of models?  Should there be more shared between these two modeling communities since they both rely on fluid dynamics?  Edit: For those wondering why this might be important: You can use mantle convection to calculate dynamic topography, and then couple it with heatflow models to predict sea level rise. Of course, you also need to couple that with glacial melting dynamics and GCMs. See Muller et al., 2008 for more information. I know there are a few geodynamicsts now working on this problem in general, but no substantial work has been published . (May 2015)  "
47,How will climate change affect the entropy budget of the atmosphere?,"The entropy per unit mass of moist air can be defined as  [tex]  And in statistical equilibrium, the entropy budget takes this following form  [tex]  These are all explained in this paper.  Irreversible entropy is produced from irreversible phase changes, the diffusion of water vapor, and the frictional dissipation of falling water vapor. Entropy can reduce the amount of work available to accelerate convective updrafts and downdrafts.  I'm just wondering - how will the amount of entropy in the atmosphere change as a result of climate change? Seeing that global warming tends to decrease the pole-to-equator gradient (resulting in a more homogeneous temperature distribution), I wonder if it might increase? "
48,What are the impacts of sublimation on an annual mountain snowpack?,"Massive amounts of freshwater rests atop the world's mountains in the form of ice, snow, permafrost, and glaciers.  Many areas of the world rely upon the melting of snow and ice to recharge their rivers and reservoirs.  But not all of that ice and snow actually melts. Some percentage of a snowpack will phase change directly into water vapor (sublimation).    How much potential mountain run off is lost to sublimation anually?  How can we measure this loss?  What sort of insight do researchers have on the impacts of sublimation on the local microclimate?  "
49,How do we measure (or empirically calculate) the amount of entropy in the atmosphere and oceans?,"Here's a paper on the entropy budget1, where moist entropy is defined in equation (8) as     $$ s = (1-q_t)(C_{pd} \ln T - R_d \ln p_d) + q_t C_l \ln T + \frac{q_v L_v}{T} - q_v R_v \ln \mathcal{H}  $$      In this expression, [tex] is the speciﬁc humidity for water vapor, [tex] is the speciﬁc heat at constant pressure of dry air, [tex] is the speciﬁc heat of liquid water, [tex] is the temperature of moist air, [tex] and [tex] are the gas constants of dry air and water vapor, [tex] is the partial pressure of dry air, [tex] is the relative humidity, [tex] is the water vapor pressure, and [tex] is the saturation vapor pressure.   I'm just curious: is entropy directly measured, or indirectly measured from other sources? If we measured it, what would be the spatial-temporal resolution of such a measurement?    1 Pauluis, Olivier, and Isaac M. Held.

50,How does one measure what causes earthquakes?,"I know that they occur when energy that was previously stored is released in seismic waves. But how is the energy stored in the earth in the first place, and what can trigger the release of such energy?  Put another way, the above preconditions for earthquakes can be brought about by natural phenomena such as fault lines in the earth, and also by man-made phenomena such as mining. What are the ways to measure/estimate the ""potential"" energy of a fault line, and the likely resulting earthquake, and what are the ways to measure/estimate the energy released by mining or other human activities, and how large an earthquake is likely to result? "
51,Why does every tsunami travel differently?,"Tsunamis are quite interesting, as they only happen after a large displacement of water.  Usually, the waves travel quite weirdly. Sometimes there are waves which bounce off of land and go back to sea. Sometimes they go straight to land and don't bother any other pieces of land around them.  So why does this happen?  Why do some tsunamis go straight to land while others are spread out?  And why others take various pathways toward land or the open sea? "

53,Why don't cold fronts and other steep-gradient weather effects just dissipate?,Why don't cold fronts and other steep-gradient weather effects just dissipate? Why do they last so long? Why doesn't the heat dissipate toward the cooler region? 
54,"What do weather forecasters mean when they say ""50% chance of rain""?","What do weather forecasters mean when they say ""50% chance of rain""?  Even more confusing: weather report often says something like ""30% chance of rain. >10mm"", then the next day ""70% chance of rain &lt;1mm"". How should I deal with this information, for example, if I'm planning a picnic? "
55,How deep could the surface of the Earth's crust get?,"In theory, how deep can a natural formation on the surface of the Earth's crust be? What are the limits to this depth? "
56,Can mining trigger earthquakes?,"Are earthquakes more common in mining regions than they would otherwise be? e.g. is the frequency of earthquakes in those regions different when mining is occurring than when it is not?  I am interested in earthquakes generally, but also particularly interested in earthquakes strong enough to have damaging impacts (to life and infrastructure). "
57,How long does it take for the ocean conveyor to circulate?,"What is the period of the thermohaline circulation in the ocean? Obviously, individual particles may take longer or shorter, but what is the average for a small water parcel to do a full loop and end up back in the same place? "
58,What periods of the fossil record are most lacking in specimens?,"What parts of the fossil record are most lacking in specimens? That is, if you were to trace the evolution of a modern mammal (humans, for example) from abiogenesis to now, which periods are the most lacking in fossils? Where are the biggest gaps in our evolutionary history. "
59,Does a green or yellow sky actually indicate a tornado?,"It seems to be a fairly widely held belief that if the sky is green or yellow, a tornado may be developing/approaching. But is there any truth to it? Could the color of the sky actually be associated with the hail that usually accompanies a tornado? "
60,What causes the Earth to have magnetic poles?,"A compass can tell me the directions of the Earth's North and South poles?  What is it about the Earth that produces this ""polarity"" such that a compass can pick it up?  The first thing that jumped into my head was the Earth's rotation, but if that is the explanation, why have I heard from people that the Earth's polarity can switch every million years or so?   "
61,How does geothermal heating work?,I have heard that geothermal heating is a way of generating energy from the temperature difference between the inner layers of the Earth and the Earth's crust.  How is it possible to extract this energy?  Must one be near a tectonic plate boundary to gain access to this temperature gradient? 
62,How much Uranium is there in the Earth's Crust?,"Are there any estimates of the amount of Uranium there is in Earth's Crust?   From what I know, it's supposed that there are large amounts of Uranium in Earth's Core, the decay of which is responsible for the core maintaining its high temperature. Mining the core is hardly imaginable, while the resources in Crust are more accessible available for mining: so how much is in the Crust, and at what levels of concentration? (which affects the viability of accessing it). "
63,"Is there a standard definition of the term ""mountain""?","Is there any standard internationally recognizable definition of the term ""mountain""?   If international texts describe some terrain as mountains, do they use some international definition of the term, or do they use the local definitions?  For example, in Poland geographers usually agree that terrain is called mountains when its peaks are at least 600 meters above sea level. This makes, for example, the Świętokrzyskie Mountains 'mountains', although only a single peak is above 600m. But there are other definitions that are bases on the geological structure of the terrain, not on the height.  Germans, from what I know, use a definition based on 'Reliefenergie', so the relative height difference for every square kilometer, independent of the absolute height.  What criteria are usually used to call a terrain 'mountains' in international community? For example, what would we use on this site? "
64,What is the origin of the Montmartre mountain in Paris?,"I have always wondered what is the origin of Montmartre mountain in Paris. What surprises me is that the whole area seems quite flat, and yet there's a very steep hill in the middle. How has that happen? Is it an instance of some common geological phenomenon? "
65,Which are the biggest methodological differences between the archaeological and geological approaches to stratigraphy?,"Stratigraphy, or study of rock or soil layers (strata), was originally introduced as a branch of geology. However, it is often applied in other disciplines, especially in archaeology and paleonthology. As an archaeologist (though not a field archaeologist), all I learnt about stratigraphy was taught from archaeological perspective. So I'm curious how the approach of other disciplines to stratigraphy differs from the archaeological. I'm especially interrested in geology - because it is the main and original discipline for stratigraphy, and because the geological time is very different from the archaeological time.  I know the basic principles such as law of superposition and principle of original horizontality are common. On the other hand, the time (hundreds or thousands of years x millions of years before present), materials on which stratigraphy is studied (sediments often created by human culture x rocks) and dating methods differ.  But how do these differences affect the ""theoretical"" methodology? That it is usually not possible to dig 100 million old strata with a spade is natural, but how about interpretation?  Is geological stratigraphy visualized with Harris matrix or something very similar too? Are there any special principles that usually apply only on very old strata? Or is geological stratigraphy simpler, so some archaeological stratigraphy rules don't apply? Is there any distinctions between various stratigraphic units (layers and cuts, or other distinctions)? If yes, which categories are usually distinguished? "
66,Identification request: Is this a meteorite with a shock vein? NW Montana,"This rock was found in an area covered with approximately 200' of glacial till. The vein in the rock is partially oxidized. The rock is heavy; it shows some barely visible sparkle on its surface; the vesicles are all circular; and it is about 4"" x 4"". There is a bit of drozy (and also some lichen) in a few of the vesicles, and most of the pale green on its surface appears to be crystalized--perhaps it is olivine or remnants of fusion crust?? Any insights would be appreciated.  Location: found 3.5 miles south of the British Columbia border and 3 miles southwest of the northwest corner of Glacier National Park, Montana.  Elevation: 4300'  Surface rock: This was found on the surface, although it might have been dug up from approx. 1 foot below the surface from previous grading  Similarity to other rocks: I have lived at this local for 7 years and in this area for 20 years and I do not recall ever seeing something similar. The vesicles are unique and most hard rocks are rounded due to glacial wear. Most of the rocks I have seen in this area are glacier-worn rocks (like river rocks), mudstones, fractured limestone, some vulcanic/lava rock (15 miles south of this location).  Hardness: does not scratch with a coin but does with a knife = 5  "

68,Is it possible to create ice in poles?,Is it possible that human can built under the poles a controlled system to create again artificial icebergs? In order keep tight the melting ice and reduce the sea level? Can this system impact the quality of life and climate? 
69,What is the largest earthquake attributable solely to volcanic activity,"I was recently and for the first time caught in an earthquake. This being my first time, I freaked out and had no idea whether the building was going to collapse or not. I was later told that this earthquake was nothing to worry about because it was due to the volcanic activity of a nearby volcano (4.9 on the Richter, 1km depth). It caused minor damages near to the volcano, but nothing measurable in our location about 30 km away.  This got me thinking - if volcanic activity is less dangerous than plate activity (because it's closer to the surface, perhaps?), is there some upper limit to the scale of such earthquakes? I suppose that earthquakes and volcanic activity are correlated in some way, but I'm not considering the volcanic activity due to plate movement, rather the ""normal"" activity of active volcanos.  Or rather:  What is the largest magnitude measured of an earthquake attributable solely to volcanic activity? "
70,How quickly do landslides occur?,"When a landslide occurs, how long does the ordeal typically last?   Obviously the answer is that they vary a lot, however, I'm talking about some specific examples such as the one in Sierra Leone in 2017, or even the landslides in the Philippines going on right now. How quickly did these (or anything similar) landslides move, or how long does it take for them to occur from start to finish? "
71,What was the highest temperature ever recorded on the surface of Earth?,"The article entitled ""54 Celsius degrees in Iran, the highest temperature ever recorded?"" says 56,6 Celsius may be the highest temperature ever recorded, in Death Valley, California, and it also mentions that Iran's heat index peaked at 61,2 Celsius in the event the story was about.  I ask this question because several cities in my province in Argentina are registering heat indexes of over 60 Celsius, with a maximum in the center of Santa Fe city of 65,7° Celsius.   So what was the highest temperature ever recorded on the surface of the Earth? "
72,how to calculate the average moisture flux over a period of time,"I wanna calculate the average moisture flux over a period of time. For example the average moisture flux over an entire summer. I don't have a meteorological background. I have a conceptual confusion about the average moisture flux:  In case, a site has a moisture flux toward due north with a magnitude of 50 on the first day. It has a moisture flux toward due south with a magnitude of 50 on the second day. Thus, the average moisture flux over these two days is zero? Is it a correct understanding? Could you guys give me some useful hints or info? "

75,Is this a gold ore? I found it in a California creek next to a mountainside,"I found this rock while hiking in a creek. It has some bits of white quartz, sheen and some brownish coloring. Does anyone know what it could be? Is there any possibility that it might be gold ore?  It is heavy for its size and does not have any magnetic properties.    "
76,Sink holes in drainage area,"I live in Florida (aka the land of sink holes).  Due to the flat nature of my area, it is common place for housing developments (and any developments really) to dig large drainage areas to give water a place to go other than the newly constructed buildings.  In the case of my neighborhood that means that a large depression was dug to drain water from the land where all the surrounding houses were built.  The drainage area is roughly square, probably 50 meters by 50 meters in size, and about 4-5 feet deep (I'm pretty sure this is a common practice, even in less-flat areas).  In our case houses are built surrounding it in a big ""block"", and my house backs up to it.  It's covered in grass and well maintained, so I take my kids back there to run around semi-regularly.  We bought our house about 6 months ago, and about 3 months ago a large sink hole opened up in this drainage area.  Large in this case means that it is probably 2 meters deep at the deepest point and has an overall diameter of about 5 meters.  It's on the other side of the drainage area so it isn't right next to my house, but it's certainly not far.  We also recently found a second (and much smaller) hole - approximately 20 centimeters in diameter and 20 centimeters deep.  This small one is much closer to my back yard.  Of course I'm definitely interested in this sink hole as it pertains to my house (aka does this imply that this area may be prone to sink holes), but I'm also curious about these things generally.  To keep it to a simple question, I'm wondering if this is a sink hole that opened up like all other sink holes in Florida - aka a collapsed underground hole/cave that just happened to miss all the surrounding houses?  Or is it possible that this is a local affect, aka something about these drainage areas can lead to sink hole formation, implying no immediate concern to the surrounding houses?  I realize this is probably not an answerable question for my specific sink hole, but I thought people here might have some insight into whether or not drainage areas might cause their own sink holes.  In case it isn't clear, this drainage area has no drain point itself.  During heavy rain, water flows into the drainage area and then slowly evaporates or percolates into the ground.  In case it matters, when it does rain, water typically collects on the opposite side of the drainage area than the side which contains the sink hole. I.e. the sinkhole is on the ""high"" side of the drainage area (although the elevation difference probably isn't more than a dozen centimeters). "
77,Measuring Transect Length on Sea Floor,"I was wondering if anybody had any insight or thoughts on a technological bottleneck we are facing in data collection.   Basically, we have vessels (single operator) dig the substrate for collection purposes in water depths generally shallower then 35' (maximum of 35' but average about 15') via bullrake (large clam rake with a telescopic handle). The digger stands aboard a vessel with the rake and is drifting along by current/wind, thus completing a ""transect"" after a period of time based on how quickly the vessel is drifting. Transects typically range from 5-50m in length. Currently we are measuring the length of the transect (which is define as the point at which the rake first begins digging along the bottom until the point digging ceases on the bottom) via GPS fixes at the start and end of each transect.  At it's best, this induces inherent inaccuracy in transect length relying on GPS (although GPS accuracy is at least recorded at each fix). I was wondering if anybody here could think of a solution to record transect length more reliably or a workaround to equate transect length more accurately? Is there a piece of equipment which could be affixed to the rake to measure its distance traveled?  Proper solutions must be able to be operated by a single person while aboard a vessel and be straightforward and quick enough to rival (preferably beat out right) the time it takes to allow for a proper GPS fix and manual recording of coordinates.  "
78,How is it possible to use up the water in a region?,"The Dead Sea, rivers in California and the Aral Sea  are said to be shrinking due to water usage, e.g. for agriculture. Yet the water must go somewhere.   After the fields are irrigated,  the water either soaks into the ground or evaporates. In the first case, the groundwater is replenished. In the second case, the water ends up as rain, presumably within a few hundred kilometers  of the evaporation point. Either way, the water  gets back in circulation.  So what is happening here? How can water be ""used up""? "
79,What is the accepted measure for Wind Coherency (Strength and Direction),"I have wind data from a Met station (Speed and Direction), and I'm looking for a way to characterize a strong coherent wind.   AKA - Wind that averages 12 m/s out of the East for 2 days would have a different (higher) value than a 12 m/s wind that comes from multiple directions for 2 days. Is there an accepted method for this? If so, how is it calculated?  "
80,Southern Hemisphere: What is the most Northern latitude where the sun can be seen for more than 24 hours?,"Is there a location, in the southern hemisphere, where I could pitch a tent that I would be able to see the sun at any time of day for, say, more than a week?  How far north could I go and still be able to see the sun for two days or more? "
81,Erosion without weathering?,"In one of my Geography books, the following sentence is written:  Though weathering aids erosion, it is not a pre-condition for erosion to take place.  How can I justify this? Almost all the forms of erosion that I know happens on weathered rocks. Do we have any examples of erosion without weathering? As weathering means to strip off or to uncover, and erosion means to transfer.  So far I came up with one example: Blast eruption of volcano makes small stones and pebbles, which could be carried by waves, rivers etc. "
82,Weather conditions to create significant glacier growth,"I am fascinated at the rapid growth of Glacier Bay Glacier from 1600 to 1750, along with its rapid retreat from 1750 to 1900. I am interested in the local weather conditions during these times. What are the likely variations in the local temperatures and precipitation during these periods. How much colder was the average local temperature to create no retreat during the summer peak heat during the growth period.  I'm guessing the glacier grew for 8 months of the year, it was growing &amp; moving seaward at a rate of 5-6 meters a day for a 100 years. How different and noticeably different would the climate have felt by citizen of near by Juneau if living during the rapid growth period of 1650. Was it harsh winter conditions almost year round, or ? How much did the average day time high change from what it is today. Can an average year round change in temperature of .5C or 2.5 or 4.5 degrees cause this huge change in glacier behaviour. What was going on with global climate at this time to cause this amazing growth during the maunder minimum? Why the temperature change during this period? "
83,What happens if it rains above the boiling point of water?,"The freezing point of water is 32°F. If it rains at a temperature lower than that, it will snow. However, let's say we dig a deep hole not filled with water that goes like 10,000 feet below sea level. The pressure will be greater there, but if the temperature is high enough to cause the rain to boil, what happens to the rain? Does it just evaporate before hitting the ground? "
84,What is this spaceship-shaped cloud?,"This tweet from the European Space Agency (ESA)'s Spanish account show a striking photo of a round, flat, ""space-ship-shaped"" cloud in an otherwise completely clear sky.

85,Computation of absolute precipitation forecast from precipitation anomaly forecast in NOAA CFSv2,"I am currently trying to use absolute precipitation forecasts for medium term range (3wk-2mth). As no models of NOAA have absolute precipitation on this timerange, my idea was to compute those forecasts by adding the forecasted anomaly to the long term average. However, I was not able to find the long term average.   Is this approach right? Where can I find a grib or DODS resource with the long term averages?  "
86,"What kind of temperature unit is ""cK""?","An article about ocean temperature history/modeling has this plot:    Where the units are given as cK.  cK does not seem to be a standard temperature unit and Google searches return millions of results that don't seem relevant.  While it might be ""fun"" if the temperatures shown were Kelvin, centi-Kelvins, or even Celsius, that seems unlikely as we are all still alive.  So, what is cK as shown on the graphic, and how do you convert the temperatures shown to degrees Celsius?  If the axis is really some delta temperature, what is the zero point? "

89,The DRASTIC groundwater vulnerability model and it's relevance today,"I am reading a groundwater pollution vulnerability study by Mark Angle of the Ohio Dpet. of Natural Resources (ODNR) for my county. The model used to assess the groundwater vulnerability for the county is called DRASTIC. The model was developed by the National Water Well Association for the EPA. I am simply curious as to whether or not the DRASTIC model is still a widely used tool in the world of hydrogeology?   Further, the study says that the model is designed to be accurate for map-able units of 100 acres or greater in size. Could DRASTIC be improved upon to model areas on a per 50 acre basis or less? Is there even any reason to? "
90,Numerical weather forecasting - resources for a programmer?,"There is a community wiki question over at A good book or source for climate science and meteorology basics? that talks about meteorology basics.  Building on that, but with a slightly different focus, are there ""standard texts"" for a computer programmer (with engineering background - I get maths, but don't know which math I need to apply) to help understand numerical weather forecasting? If that is too broad, I'm mainly interested in mesoscale and microscale applications.  I've tried building and running some of the forecast models (e.g. WRF) but I'm uncomfortable looking at numbers coming out without understanding at least some of the process. "
91,When will the Final Ice Age happen?,"As the Sun's luminosity slowly rises, the Earth's surface temperature will climb. Will Earth ever be too warm to have any more glacial periods? If so, when will that be?  Edit: The existing answer misunderstood the question. I'd like some boundary conditions, e.g. ""when the sun's luminosity is 10% higher and the Earth becomes a 'moist greenhouse'"" and ""when the Sun turns Earth into a cinder"". Those conditions would imply that the last Ice Age will happen 1-4 billion years from now. A better estimate would be awesome. Unless there's something I'm missing, with Stefan-Boltzmann and some reasonable assumptions (e.g. linear increase in luminosity) it should be possible to get a back-of-the-envelope calculation for this. "
92,What is the area with the largest velocity vertical shear in the ocean?,"While there are areas with really strong tidal currents in the ocean, these currents tend to be primarily barotropic. My question relates to the largest vertical difference in velocity and it is likely to be baroclinic in nature. What is the location with the largest shear? What is the magnitude of that shear? "
93,Why does Earth have abundant oxygen in the atmosphere?,"Because of photosynthesis, obviously.  But then it's not actually that obvious after all, because photosynthesis is mostly balanced by respiration.   We can summarise the processes of photosynthesis and respiration like this: $$\begin{align} \ce{CO2 + H2O + h\nu} &amp; \rightarrow \ce{O2 + CH2O(biomass)} \\ \ce{O2 + CH2O(biomass)} &amp; \rightarrow \ce{CO2 + H2O} \end{align} $$ If these two reactions were always balanced then the concentration of [tex] would never have changed. If I understand correctly, there are abiotic processes that deplete [tex] to form iron oxides, and so in order for there to be persistent [tex] in the Earth's atmosphere, the biosphere as a whole must continually produce an excess of it. In order for this to happen, there must be some processes that consume biomass at a non-neglible rate without removing a corresponding amount of [tex] from the atmosphere.  My question is, what are the processes primarily responsible for this? Is it just due to the burial of unoxidised organic matter (to form coal, oil, etc.), or is there more to it than that?  If they are different processes, I'm interested both in what caused the excess of oxygen during the ""great oxidation"" event, and what maintains the excess of oxygen on the modern Earth. "
94,Why do tropical cyclones around Australia have erratic paths?,According to the Australia Bureau of Meterology:     Research has shown that cyclones in the Australian region exhibit more   erratic paths than cyclones in other parts of the world. A tropical   cyclone can last for a few days or up to two or three weeks. Movement   in any direction is possible including sharp turns and even loops.     Why do they change directions so radically?  Does this occur in other parts of the world or are North American hurricanes the anomaly in their typically smooth tracks? 
95,Minimum sea-level pressure and maximum wind speed intensity relationship in Hurricane Katrina (2005),"Hurricane Katrina was one of the deadliest and most destructive hurricane to hit the US. After looking into the minimum sea-level pressure (MSLP) and maximum wind speed (MWS) intensity data from NOAA's HURDAT database, I am confused with the pattern or whether there actually is one.  For Katrina specifically, is there a pattern in the relationship between MSLP and MWS intensity? What role does a low or high air pressure system play in the velocity vector of the hurricane? "
96,Is a San Andreas volcano possible?,"This question is, in part, inspired from the 1997 Hollywood movie Volcano, where a fictional volcano erupted out of the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles.   The San Andreas Fault is a transform fault plate boundary (see image below):    Image from the USGS Glossary entry for transform faults, with a definition:     A transform fault is a special variety of strike-slip fault that accommodates relative horizontal slip between other tectonic elements, such as oceanic crustal plates.   A specific type of transform fault is a 'leaky transform fault', which according to a source used on its Wikipedia page describes the tectonic movement at this type of faulting as being:     In addition to the regular strike-slip motion observed at transform boundaries, an oblique extensional component is present, resulting in motion of the plates that is not parallel to the plate boundary.   Illustrated below:    Is there any evidence that oblique tectonic movement occurs along the San Andreas Fault?  Hence, is a San Andreas volcano possible? "
97,About meddies: what are they? How do they form? How are they maintained?,"A ""meddy"" is usually described as a Mediterranean Water eddy. While many meddies have been observed in recent years, I would want to know what are the common characteristics of such features (temperature, salinity, depth, lifespan)? What are the conditions that cause the formation of meddies? How are they preserved for so long as they may last for about 2 years and cover distances up to one thousand kilometers? "
98,What causes these banded clouds?,"A set of banded clouds can be seen in MODIS imagery during several days in January and February over the Gulf of Maine. They tend to occur with very cold winds from the NW following storms.   There are several similar examples: 17 January and 6, 20 and 24 February  What causes these features? Why are they of that size? "
99,What causes the entrainment of atmospheric gases towards a volcanic ash/tephra plume?,"I understand that volcanic ash plumes can only rise to great heights (e.g. 50km) with the help of some other processes, as the velocity of the material ejected isn't great enough to send it high into the atmosphere.   I don't understand how exactly these processes take place. I think that cooler, atmospheric gases are entrained towards the hotter, denser volcanic plume, then become heated and incorporated into the ash plume, causing it to become buoyant and to expand.   What causes the cool, atmospheric gas to move towards the plume? Is it due to the temperature differences between the plume and the atmosphere, or some kind of pressure difference?  "
100,How important is Sahara dust for the Amazon?,"A recent article by Yu et al. estimated that 28 million tons of dust from the Sahara fall to the surface over the Amazon basin per year out of the 132 million tons that remain in the air when the dust reaches South America. The deposited dust is rich in phosphorus and contributes 22,000 tons of P per year, which is about the same amount lost from rain and flooding. The question is: how important is this phosphorus to the biological production of the Amazon basin? Also, considering Yu et al. reported very large interannual variability, do we expect to see any variability in the production at annual to decadal scales?   "
101,Change in earth mass since the time of the dinosaurs,"Is there a significant difference in the mass of the Earth between now and the time of the dinosaurs (250 - 75 million years ago)? I was just wondering if the force of gravity on dinosaurs would have been significantly less when they were around.  I gather, but may be wrong, that the mass of earth at present increases by around 108kg/day. All else being equal, one would expect the earth to have gained a mass, since 75 million years ago, of:  [tex]   The current mass of Earth according to Wikipedia is 5.97224kg, so if my math is correct, the change since the time the dinosaurs went extinct would be less than 0.1%.  Is my math correct here? If it is, would the change in the mass of the Earth over this period of time have had any noticeable effect on weight from its gravity? "
102,Predicting school closures with historical weather prediction data?,"I'm interested in predicting when the local schools will be closed due to snow and other winter weather. I have a list of school closure dates and a rough sense of the criteria used to determine the closing of schools including, temperature, wind, precipitation, and their interactions.  Using a statistical technique (classical, Bayesian, or machine learning), I'd like to use both the actual weather the day before (t-1) and the predicted weather for the the day (t) to predict the county's decision.   I want to use the predicted weather at t and not the actual because that's the information known to the deciders when they have to make their decisions. For the actual, realized weather for t-1, I was planning on using the NOAA API. But I'm at a loss on where to find weather prediction data. While I could do what @MarkRovetta suggests in the question on Statistical weather prediction and roll my own prediction model, that is harder than using a database and my lousy prediction model won't compare with the National Weather Service predictions available to the country officials. At best that will act like noise that will reduce the quality of my predictions. My primary question is therefore what sources are available for local weather predictions at various lags to the realized weather?   Additionally, are there tables of the predictive quality of forecasts at various time horizons? If, for example, the daily weather was predicted with 99% accuracy by 4 am that day, maybe there isn't an important difference between the predictions and the realized values.  "
103,Why is seawater saline?,"Why is seawater saline and not fresh? Could it be saturated with anything else, like, say, dissolved metal? "
104,Why are most minerals so rare?,"There are 4,660 known minerals, so why are most of them so rare?   Is it to do with the structure of minerals? "
105,Is a controlled fractional crystallization process feasible on the Moon?,"I am looking for a way to separate metal oxides on the Moon. Please bear with me - it's for an ultra-hard science fiction project. Processes typical on Earth are not effective there. Heat is cheap on the Moon, there is strong constant sun that is easily concentrated. Heat also dissipates slowly thanks to the vacuum, and reflective insulation can be used to slow heat loss much more.   So, I wondered if a form of controlled fractional crystallization could be used to get pure olivine from a molten melt of rock, and then the olivine could be split into forsterite and fayalite the same way. The forsterite might make decent clear glass, or if not, the fayalite can be processed with hydrogen to get iron, water, and silica, and the silica can be used to make glass. It might be necessary to apply centrifugal force to get the crystals to separate in the Moon's low gravity. If the technique works, it would seem the same process could be used to isolate other metal oxides through other paths.  Hydrogen and carbon atoms are present on the level of around 100 ppm. Am I correct in thinking that mineral separation would occur this way and could be controlled to get good purity? I know there are engineering issues, but in terms of the geochemistry, is it correct that crystallization and settling would occur in this way?  (Note: I heavily edited this after my continued searching on the topic finally got me to 'fractional crystallization', and then I came across a few things that made me rethink the whole thing.) "
106,Adiabatic lapse rate,"I'm having trouble with the difference between saturated and unsaturated adiabatic lapse rates.  I know the unsaturated adiabatic lapse rate is approximately 5.4°F/1000ft (9.8 °C/1000 metre), in which a ""dry"" parcel of air cools at that rate. The unsaturated adiabatic lapse rate depends on what?  Why is the unsaturated adiabatic lapse rate lower than the saturated? From searching, I found that the unsaturated adiabatic lapse rate is lower because the air parcel releases its latent heat, which causes the air parcel to cool more slowly, but I don't seem to get it. When a ""dry"" parcel of air is cooling adiabatically, are we assuming 0% moisture? "
107,Did climate cool down when underground hydrocarbons stocks formed?,"As far as I understand, the dominant theory of modern climate change says that recent warming is mainly caused by the massive burning of hydrocarbons that used to be stored in solid form mostly underground as petroleum, coal, etc.  This suggests that the reverse process should contribute to a cooling of the climate (or to a slowed down warming if other processes are at play at the same time).   In particular, a cooling should have occurred throughout the period when the stocks of underground hydrocarbons were formed by the ""pilling"" of organic remains.  My questions:   Is this roughly what climate theory would predict or am I omitting some things? Was such an effect observed during the formation of the underground stocks of hydrocarbons? Can this reasoning be extended to say that a world where no solid hydrocarbons are burnt and the concentration of atmospheric hydrocarbons keeps falling (as it is captured by organism and transformed into solid hydrocarbons) would experience a continuous (if slow) cooling? Or are there some non-linearities by which the stock of solid hydrocarbons would ""max out"" or the effect of removing carbon from the atmosphere fade away?  "
108,Persistence time of ozone,"Ozone is formed in the upper atmosphere by ultraviolet light, and broken down by ultraviolet, spontaneous reactions and artificial pollutants among other things.  Suppose there were no artificial pollutants, and the sun was magically replaced with a giant heat lamp that put out no ultraviolet but kept the current temperature, how long would it take for the ozone to decay of its own accord or by reacting with natural pollutants?  The accepted answer for the other question is three days. That's wildly inconsistent with everything else I've heard said about ozone depletion taking years to recover. Maybe that's because the other question asks about ozone released near sea level, and I'm asking about ozone in the stratosphere? "
109,How to design an experiment to quantify back radiation from atmospheric carbon dioxide?,"Based on our current knowledge of CO[tex] and current instrumental techniques, how big would a laboratory sample of air with 400ppm of CO[tex] need to be in order to quantify the back radiation from CO[tex]?   I am envisioning a large container with many cubic metres of gas, probably thermally isolated longitudinally and with a radiative IR input at one end (A) plus measuring apparatus at the other end (B) and some distributed thermistors throughout. We know the thermal input at A, measure the thermal output at the B and measure the trapped thermal energy via the thermistors.   I would like to get a result with something like +/- 1% accuracy. Would this be possible? Assume I have a budget of at least $10,000,000. "
110,"Is the ocean guaranteed to warm in a warming climate, regardless of whether it absorbs LW radiation?","More specifically, I've seen some discussion of this article:  [website]which claims that the observed ocean warming is explained by the ocean skin absorbing long-wavelength radiation. What I am asking is: is this mechanism necessary for ocean warming to occur? My naive understanding was that our increasing the magnitude of the greenhouse effect meant that there was less radiation escapting to space, and therefore the average temperature of the entire ocean+earth+atmosphere system will increase until it reaches a new equilibrium, where outgoing radiation again equals incoming. Is this correct? And if it is, does it not imply that the ocean must also get warmer, simply because it is a thermally coupled part of the entire warming system? I had someone tell me that the a warming atmosphere could not warm the ocean beyond an infinitesimal amount, because the atmosphere has a much lower heat capacity. But it seems to me that the constraint on the final equibilibrium temperature means that all components must warm, no matter how inefficient the means of energy transfer between them - as long as there is some means for energy transfer, increasing the overall temperature must increase each of the components. Am I right, or have I misunderstood? "
111,What is the difference between GFS analysis and GFS forecast data?,"gfsanl_3_20151201_0000_006 means that the analysis was made at 0000 UTC and is valid at 0600 UTC, doesn't it? But for how long, 3 hours? And what is the difference to gfs_4_20151201_0000_006, which is listed under GFS forecast? I cannot figure out the difference between those two. "
112,How large can local surface CO2 concentration vary due to natural processes?,"I'd like to have a rough idea of how large local surface CO2 concentration vary due to natural processes.  For example, a purely hypothetical experiment:  If I set up some CO2 monitors in a wide variety of locations around the globe (e.g. mid-ocean, jungle, desert, plains, tundra, mountaintop, beach...), say at 2 meters off the ground, and took some measures to avoid close proximity to substantial anthropogenic CO2 sources (industrial, transportation, population, farms) and fires or episodic geological sources (e.g. volcanos or magma pockets under lakes per @jamesqf), roughly speaking what might the variation look like?   A starting guess might be that they'd all be nearly featureless, around 400ppm, with only say +/- 10 or 20 ppm daily and yearly oscillations. Of course there is a whole lot of important science within those variations, but for the purposes of this question, I'd call those variations small.  Would my detector in a forest or jungle see higher peaks, or deeper troughs than one in a desert, or mid-ocean? What might the biggest excursions be? Might it ever reach down to 300 or up to 500 ppm due to natural processes?  The reason I'm asking is that while I tried to so some searches, it is very popular to show data from urban and suburban locations, where peaks of 500 or 600 ppm or even higher are seen that are attributed to wind direction and concentrated man-made sources, and that variation is not what I'm after. Here is just one example (48 hours and yearly) but there are many much larger studies published with sensors in urban areas. "
113,ppmV versus μmol/mol for atmospheric CO2 - how to convert?,"For a uniform mixture of ideal gases, I think that the concentration of a gas reported in parts per million by volume (ppmV) and micro-moles per mole (μmol/mol) would be the same.  When I see atmospheric CO2 discussed, I have seen both units used, depending on the source. See for example, the comments under this answer.  Since multi-atomic gases like N2, O2, H2O and CO2 are not ideal gases (even monatomic gases are not absolutely ideal) I would guess that for realistic atmospheric samples at different altitudes and times, the CO2 concentrations expressed in ppmV and μmol/mol would not be numerically identical. Further, due to the variations in concentrations of the other constituents they wouldn't even be strictly proportional.  Is there a handy, approximate conversion constant, or function, that is more accurate than unity? Is there a  nearly-exact one? "
114,Which physical parameters can we actually measure to confirm the existence of the Greenhouse Effect (GHE)?,"The theory of a GHE in a planetary atmosphere is rather well known. Many claim it is no longer a theory but actually proven as a fact.  However I have been reading a lot of things Richard Feynman said about science and have decided to apply some of them to the GHE. I am going to start from an assumption this is something new I have just come across and after listening to the explanations ask: ""How do we know it is like that, what can we measure or test to confirm it?""  Now Richard Feynman had a very useful piece of lab equipment which he used quite a lot. I've got one of them too, albeit a version with a lower spec and with a rusty outer casing that shows its age. However I have tested it recently and it is up to spec and passes its boot up self-test. You might have a higher spec one.  So please apply your brain to this:  Planetary Atmosphere Thought Experiment.  You have 2 identical planets, same mass, same rotational speed, same orbit around a sun. They have gaseous atmospheres of identical heat capacity and of the same height. The orbits are perfectly circular and regular. The planets have reached a thermal equilibrium. The ONLY difference between the 2 planets is that one has greenhouse gases in its atmosphere and the other does not.  What differences would the GHE make to the conditions on the 2 planets?  Well fairly obviously if there is a GHE on one its surface temperature will be higher. We will call the planet with the GHE planet G, and the one without planet N.  G will have a higher surface temperature. Now suppose we are looking from outside, from space, at G and N. Will they look different to any measuring apparatus? We know the solar input to each is the same (orbits are the same) so, as we know G and N are in thermal equilibrium it MUST be the case that quantity of radiation leaving the planets is the same. So if we measure it like we do for any celestial body we will measure the same ""effective temperature"" looking at G and N.  G and N will have the same effective temperature. The surface of planet G will be hotter than N. The height of the atmospheres is the same so the temperature gradient in the atmosphere will be higher on G. Its lapse rate is higher. For any given height in the atmosphere the temperature of the atmosphere on G is higher at that height, than the temperature on N.  So G has a higher surface temperature and the temperature of its atmosphere is higher. Yet, as both planets are radiating into space at the same rate their measured effective temperatures are identical.  This then leads to my main question; What physical parameter can we measure if given ONE planet, without any knowledge of what the conditions are on the other, in order to determine whether we have been given planet G or N?  EDIT 22/4/17. I am adding this edit as the answers attempted so far have all really been an explanation of the details of how the GHE works on Earth and the specifics of CO2. I would like the question properly addressed as it is in connection with the thought experiment proposed. The answer I am looking for will likely be given in general terms, applicable to the GHE from any greenhouse gas or a combination of 2 or more and also be one generally applicable to any planet you might find anywhere. Multiple parameters may be measured. You do have access to the planet's surface or any chosen point in the atmosphere. To clarify the gaseous atmospher may be any combination of gases or a single gas, the specific heat capacity of the atmosphere is the same on each planet, the height of the atmospheres is defined as the height of the troposphere so the tropospheres are the same height. Layers of atmosphere above the troposphere can vary between the 2 planets as I believe there is no claim or evidence that the presence or absence of a greenhouse gas in these upper layers is significant (if you have knowledge otherwise please state it).  EDIT 26/4/17 . This edit follows the question being put ""on hold"" as being too broad. The actual question posed is quite specific and narrow and is also  brief and to the point. It is the ""What physical parameter(s) can we measure ?"" type of question. That is not broad at all, it is specific and it follows the format of what Richard Feynman suggests. The answer is expected to be in the form of ""We would measure X"" or ""We would measure X and Y"" or ""We would measure X, Y and Z"". Obviously the answer could be expanded via something like ""We would measure X and if it is below n then that shows..."". So based on a simple and specific questions, and the expected simple answers, the claim of those who put this on hold for being too broad looks erroneous and I suggest they revise their view as it does not accord with a logical examination of the situation as I have explained.

115,Why Do Carbon Dioxide Levels Vary Seasonally?,"I was reading this article today, and I saw this chart of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels for the past year:    The chart shows a decline in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels from roughly June-October, a cycle that appears to be consistent across many years:   Why does this cycle occur? It looks like the period of decline coincides with the season of greatest plant growth in the northern hemisphere. Or is it that energy demand rises so much during the northern-hemisphere winter that the CO2 levels for the entire atmosphere are quickly changed? "
116,To what degree do large lakes influence precipitation levels compared to the ocean?,"I was wondering what percentage of precipitation could be estimated to have been contributed by large lakes such as the Great Lakes or Lake Baikal in the immediate vicinity of said lakes (say, within 50-100 miles of the lake)?  And generally speaking, what overall percentage of precipitation can be attributed to oceans as opposed to all other sources combined (lakes, rivers, etc)? "
117,Experimental testing to falsify the theory of the greenhouse gas effect,Irrespective of how accepted any scientific theory happens to be it is often worth thinking about a possible experiment to test said theory and perhaps falsify it. If we wanted to do this for the theory of the greenhouse gas effect what areas are worth considering when designing such an experiment? Would we limit ourselves to just the radiative heat response of CO2 or are their wider issues we need to incorporate into the experiment?  This question is NOT a duplicate as it relates to the generality of greenhouse gases and specifically asks IF we should limit ourselves to the radiative response of CO2. Therefore one possible avenue of answering could be to consider the wider issues of water vapour and methane and such an answer would be clearly outside the scope of the CO2 specific question which has been postulated as the duplicate.  
118,Why is March colder than September in Northern Hemisphere?,"Forgive my ignorance of the subject but I was always wondered about the exact reason of this phenomenon.  Vernal equinox happens around March 20, whereas autumnal equinox happens around September 22, so wherever you are in Northern Hemisphere, the length of the day, and consequently the amount of solar energy that reaches the place should be almost the same.   However the average temperatures differ widely, for example Toronto has average temperatures of 2°C to 6°C on March 20th, and 14°C to 19°C on September 22nd. So around 12°C difference [link].  So obviously there is some sort of temperature inertia, as temperatures seem to experience a delay in responding to changes in day length.  What is the main reason for it? Is it effect of sea ice or snow-covered land albedo? Energy stored in oceans? Energy absorbed by melting snow and ice? "
119,How to interpret hourly precipitation forecast?,"How should I interpret the hourly precipitation forecasts?   Most of the time, when there is rain in the forecast, the maximum Probability of Precipitation (PoP) in the hourly forecast is about the same as the daily PoP.   My problem is that the hourly PoP forecast usually has several hours at that maximum probability.  If I naively add the odds of getting wet for each hour, I always get a total probability that is much higher than the daily PoP value.  For example, take an hypothetical day where the daily forecast has a 50% PoP.  For the same day, the hourly forecast has 4 hours with a 50% PoP for each hour.  If I compute the chance that I get rain in at least one of the 4 hours, I get 93% PoP (15 out of 16).  How can I reconcile the total daily PoP calculated from the hourly forecast with the actual daily PoP? "
120,What impact on climate did 2011 earthquake and tsunami have?,"The 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami was one of the biggest in modern history; the earthquake even moved Earth's axis for a very small, but measurable bit.

So did it influence weather in any way that could be seen as ""impact on climate""? If yes, how? "

122,"How to determine if this fault is normal, sinistral?","Studying for an exam tomorrow and stumped on this question (parts d and e).     The region show in Map 2 consists of a series of sedimentary strata   that have been tilted and then eroded, producing an unconformity. Lava   flows covered the unconformity, and the region underwent further   tilting and then faulting before erosion transformed the region in to   a plain.  Using the data provided by Map 2 determine       a. amount of net slip       b. rake of net slip on the fault plan       c. plunge and trend of net slip       d. relative movement along the fault e. type of fault     The original answer for d &amp; e was that the eastern block moved NW relative to the western block, and it was a sinistral reverse fault.  Can't remember why I chose reverse and not normal.  Lab TA appears to be saying not sinistral, just 'normal'.  So my questions are, how would you determine that it's a normal fault and not reverse?  Why not sinistral?  I can't see an indication of how the foot wall (western block) has moved relative to the hanging wall.  I know the TA is the person to ask but it's an online course and answers were slow to come at the best of times. "
123,Has a reduction in car use ever had an effect on the ozone layer?,"Has there ever been an incident in the U.S. where because of high gas prices people have driven their cars a lot less than usual for, say, many months, and after appropriate measurements it was determined that the ozone layer had less observable properties that might be considered 'damage'? If so, would it show if everyone switched to electric cars or some ‘gas alternative’ this could slowly 'repair' our atmosphere? "

126,How would weather change on a tidally-locked terrestrial planet?,"On Earth, weather is very much affected by the Earth's rotation around its axis and around the Sun. Even locations that are almost on the equator do have strong annual variations in precipitation and other characteristics. On the other hand, on a tidally-locked planet (TLP), there are no cycles. The star is still on one place on the sky. From the point of view of the global circulation models, which are most often used for studies of the climate of TLP, this is an ideal steady state.  My question is: What weather changes and cycles should one expect on tidally-locked planets, where no astronomical cycle acts as external forcing? Would the weather in a particular location change at all? "

128,Cell Size of Salt Pan Tessellations,"Salt Pans (such as in Badwater Basin of Death Valley, California) often show a tessellation pattern which forms presumably due to contraction of the deposited salt crust forming irregular cracks towards which the salt crust bends upwards and creates ridges. The cells of this tessellation have a characteristic size of 1-2 meters. I wonder whether a simple model exists which can explain the size of the cells, i.e. why they are 1-2m in size as opposed to 5cm or 10m.  If someone has researched this in the past, I would be interested in some references. Otherwise, some ideas or speculations are appreciated. Some related questions: would the cell size change with a different salt (Badwater Basin is covered predominantly by NaCl)? Does the composition of the underlying soil or rock matter? Does it rather depend on the diurnal temperature time-course characteristic of the place?  "
129,Why Earth's magnetic poles are (and were) in their positions?,"This is a sort of a follow-up question to What causes the Earth to have magnetic poles?  The Earth has magnetic fields, and according to dynamo theory I roughly understand why. If the Earth's rotation influences the Earth's magnetic field, it also seems natural that the poles will be orthogonal to the plane of rotation.  But I still don't understand few things:   Why are the magnetic poles positioned near, but not exactly at, the geographic poles? Why do they drift over time? Why does the Earth's magnetic field sometimes change polarity? Are the changes in polarity based on some cycle? Can they be predicted?  "
130,What temperature do small meteorites have on impact,"A question which has haunted me for years. What temperature do small meteorites (which don't evaporate on impact) have if you find them immediately after they hit the surface. I understand that the outer parts are heated by atmospheric friction, but what about the inside? Can the inside keep its low temperature that it inherits from space?  There are some stories on the internet about meteorites that were so cold, that the moisture of the air froze on the surface of the meteorite. Can this really happen?  Subquestion:   Are there numerical simulations that can prove this?   Some of the rumours are summed up here: ""Frosty"" meteorite (Wikipedia). "
131,How deep was the Vredefort Crater when it happened?,"The Vredefort Crater is one of the biggest known impact craters on earth.

Is there a general relationship between the diameter of a meteorite crater and it's initial depth? "
132,What supports the Rockies?,"What supports the Rocky Mountains in North America? Or put another way, Why are they there? and Why are they still there?  It might be tempting to think of compression, especially in an east-west direction. However at the south end, New Mexico is experiencing east-west extension (grabens including Rio Grande Rift Valley, plus associated volcanism).  Hot spot and/or mantle plume uplift doesn't appear to explain them either. Yes there's the Yellowstone Hotspot under NW Wyoming. Regardless of whether this is really caused by a mantle plume or not, the related volcanism does not correlate with the mountains. "
133,How does remote sensing of ocean currents work?,"I am aware that techniques exist for measuring surface currents using HF radar, either from land-based installations or from space.

134,What are the ramifications to life on Earth when the Earth's magnetic poles switch?,This question is related to this question about the cause of the Earth's magnetic field switching polarity.

136,Is the Yellowstone National Park unique for its geysers?,"The Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming is unique for its large number of ""thermal occurrences, of which there are some 30 geysers. This, in turn, appears to be the result of the presence of large quantities of molten rock, and the thinness of the earth's crust there, compared to the other spots on the earth.  To the best of my knowledge, there is no other (known) place on earth where so much thermal power is contained in a relatively small area. Is this in fact the case? If so, what made Yellowstone, Wyoming so unique in this regard? "
137,What causes bottom water to rise?,"The water close to the deep ocean floor is called bottom water.  It may be located in deep valleys or trenches.  I understand that water flowing to the Arctic will sink there, because it's saltier and therefore heavier than the surrounding water.  But once it sinks to the bottom, for example, inside trenches, what causes it to ever leave?  As far as I know, there aren't any significant sources of heat down at the ocean floor, like there are at the bottom of the atmosphere, but we still seem to have a highly dynamic system.  What causes this bottom water to mix again?   Figure obtained from University of Washington page "
138,What factors determine the height of the turbopause?,"The turbopause separates (by definition) the homosphere from the heterosphere.  What factors cause the turbopause to be where it is?  Is it affected by mesopheric composition, solar irradiance, global atmospheric change, and other factors that may change significantly?  Or is it mostly determined by density in the absolute sense, and therefore relatively constant? "
139,Are Argo probe data used for numerical weather prediction (NWP)?,"Argo probes broadcast surface measurements (among other things) on the worlds oceans, far away from traditional surface observations.  Yin et al. (2010) study the assimilation of these measurements in an ocean model, but according to an unsourced remark on Wikipedia:     When a float transmits a profile it is quickly converted to a format that can be inserted on the GTS (Global Telecommunications System). The GTS is operated by the World Meteorological Organisation, or WMO, specifically for the purpose of sharing data needed for weather forecasting. Thus all nations who are members of the WMO receive all Argo profiles within a few hours of the acquisition of the profile..   The ocean model by Yin et al. (2010) is not a weather forecasting model.  Are there any operational agencies that actually use Argo probe data for numerical weather prediction?  Are there any publications on the impact this has had on forecast skill? "
140,Why were no interferometers launched on weather satellites between the '69-'72 IRIS-D and the 2002-onward AIRS?,"As early as the late 1960s / early 1970s, Nimbus-3 carried Iris-B and Nimbus-4 carried Iris-D, both infrared spectroradiometers with a moderate spectral resolution.  Subsequently, I believe it was not until AIRS flew on EOS-Aqua (launch 2002), and subsequently IASI on EPS and CrIS on SNPP and on JPSS, that spectrometers were flown on (semi-)operational weather satellites.  Why is this so?  Were IRIS-B and IRIS-D considered unsuccessful, prohibitively expensive, or did agencies simply prioritise on other things?  EDIT 2019-03-20: There was actually one other hyperspectral interferometer: The Spectrometer Interferometer was flown on several Meteor satellites.  The instrument was built by the Academy of Sciences of German Democratic Republic (GDR), in collaboration with the former Soviet Hydrometeorological Service (HYDROMET) and the former Meteorological Service of GDR (Spänkuch 1980) and flew in the late 1970s / early 1980s.

141,"Can overshooting tops enter the stratosphere, or will they rather push the tropopause upward?","Convective overshooting tops  reach above the normally horizontal flat layer of the convective system, a layer that should coincide with the tropopause.  If we have such an overshooting top, does this mean we actually have the cloud reaching into the stratosphere, or does it mean that the convective system locally pushes the tropopause upward, while the convection is still limited to the (temporarily extended) troposphere?  Both alternatives are given as unsourced answers to this identical Yahoo! Answers question, so I would like to see a referenced answer that specifically addresses the distinction between ""air parcel reaches stratosphere"" or ""air parcel pushes tropopause upward"".

In a chat discussion, it was brought to my attention that a diamond can burn (which makes total sense because it's pure carbon) after I got a notification in orange in the topbar of SE.  Anyway my question is why can something so durable be able to burn? I would imagine that there would be a relationship between flammability and durability, especially since metal cannot burn.* Is it just a coincidence that most people think hard == inflammable? Why can diamond burn?  *It can burn when oxidized IIRC. "

144,How can I estimate a 2 m temperature from / in an atmospheric model?,"Numerical models of the atmosphere usually have their first atmospheric grid level well above 2 m, but the temperature at 2 m above ground level is something one often wants to calculate with such a model.  These models have some surface scheme to calculate temperatures at / in the ground and solve (approximated) Navier–Stokes equations on the atmospheric grid. Heat fluxes between these model components are usually parameterized with the help of Monin–Obukhov similarity theory. Hence, a diagnostic calculation of the 2 m temperature is needed.  What needs to be done to get a reasonable 2 m temperature? Is a simple use of a diagnostic formula using surface layer similarity again enough? What could be done based on data, assuming many simulations and observations are available? "
145,"If a ship on its way to Germany from Norway sank, where will the survivors likely end up?","a) what are the chances, taking into account influencing factors like ocean currents, that these survivors will end up on English shores?  b) what are the chances, again taking into account all influencing factors, that these survivors will end up anywhere near Africa's rainforest/jungle region?

146,How can we have groundwater depletion when the Earth is 78% covered with oceans?,"Why does depletion of underground water levels happening, if the Earth is covered by nearly 78% water, and there is also water in rivers and lakes?   How can we still lack groundwater? "
147,What (if anything) can be learned from accurately recording tilt motion during seismic events?,"The Rotational Motions in Seismology (ROMY) instrument is a giant laser gyroscope used to generate extremely precise 3D rotation measurements of planet Earth. However at the end of the video below they mention that ""seismologists want to..."" use small laser gyros to measure seismic tilt motion as part of earthquake monitoring.  Is there a lot of interest in this? Have compelling questions been identified that could be address by adding tilt motion to translational motion monitoring, or is it a case of nobody's looked, there might be something interesting there, better find out?  [website]"
148,How are data from tiltmeters used to monitor volcanic activity?,"I've just learned in this answer that tiltmeters (which I assume measure changes in tilt) are used near active volcanos. (Saw a mention in item 4. here also.)  What kind of geological (volcanological?) information can be learned from tilt data? Can it also offer predictive benefits, trigger evacuation warnings? "
149,Why does the loss of water from a felsic magma encourage crystallisation?,"Felsic magmas crystallise in the crust, unlike mafic magmas which tend to make it to the Earth's surface, for the following reasons:   They are more viscous than mafic magmas and therefore it is mechanically harder to ascend, They are colder, so crystallise earlier, so travel less distance, They are more hydrous than mafic magmas and the loss of water encourages crystallisation .   My question is, why does losing water encourage felsic magma to crystallise in the crust? Is it something to do with water being a network modifier? "
150,"Why is ""at least a small tilt"" between rotation and magnetic axis required by models of magnetic field formation?","I saw something I don't understand in the Gizmodo article Cassini's First Grand Finale Images Are Stunning—But What Are We Really Looking At?. In a quote of Caltech Professor of Planetary Science Andrew P. Ingersoll, it is suggested that a it necessary for there to be at least a small tilt between a planet's rotation axis and magnetic axis.     Ingersoll mentioned the final Grand Finale observation he was looking forward to most at the very end of our conversation, which could solve an ongoing mystery of the planet’s formation. Saturn’s magnetic field has a very unusual property in that it’s “axisymmetric”—it has no tilt. That’s weird, because the math behind planetary magnetic fields requires a bit of tilt.      “How does a planet generate a magnetic field? The off-axis tilt is sort of part of that whole theory and if there’s no tilt at all, well, it will be interesting,” he said with a chuckle.   Is there a way to understand why a tilt is required in current theories of planetary magnetic fields? "
151,Why doesn't the 71% water of the earth dry or evaporate?,"Perhaps a simple question, we know 71% of the earth's surface contains water as oceans. If Earth's age is 4.543 billion years, then I guess it should be decreased with drying or should have been dried so far. Why doesn't it dry or decrease?  If we put some water in sunlight, it evaporates. The oceans are the chief source of rain, but lakes and rivers also contribute to it. The sun's heat evaporates the water.  So I wonder why doesn't the 71% water coverage not evaporate, decreasing until gone? Why is it still 71% after billions of years? Does water keep coming from somewhere? Or, does moving water not evaporate? Why is it still here? "
152,What causes a change in composition from basanite to nephelinite?,"Can the change in composition from basanite to nephelinite (i.e. increasing alkalis with decreasing SiO2) be explained in terms of fractional crystallisation, or only by a decreasing degree of partial melting? If the latter, does the silica content decrease because it is compatible and therefore isn't enriched in the melt? "
153,Has there ever been a study done on the effect of steam/thermal pollution on climate,"Most people are well aware of the idea of greenhouse warming. Carbon dioxide receives particular attention, do to the uncertainty of sources, sinks, and inert properties. However, combustion, which produces carbon dioxide, also produces water vapor, another greenhouse gas. I am aware of the paper on contrails, but generalizing that idea beyond contrails. Given that water vapor is a greenhouse gas, and assuming the produced quantities are comparable to the quantities of carbon dioxide produced, has there been a study using climate models, with only water vapor emissions inventories, as compared to only carbon dioxide emissions inventories?  A second aspect to this is thermal aspects of anthropogenic steam. Because steam is produced with a temperature higher than the environment, how much of an impact does the mixing of this steam have on the climate, particularly the microclimate? "
154,What is the minimum area needed to create a functional weather system?,"Beyond creating a closed ecological system - that focuses on providing a balanced homeostatic environment - what is the smallest area that could create actual weather events?  If we wanted to engineer a rain fall through simulating the environmental conditions, would the structure need to be the size of a planet and its atmosphere? Can it be achieved in a structure the size of a continent... a state... a sports stadium?   What methods could be used to estimate the minimum size; volume of air, altitude, barometric pressure areas, etc.?  I am trying to understand how to identify a theoretical lower limit of recreating a functional weather system. Not just a simulation of the conditions on a micro scale. "
155,What does the degree and order of Spherical Harmonics mean?,I've been reading up about Gravitational Models and Spherical Harmonics.  Where I first read about them is in this scholarly article on Autonomous navigation with Gravity Gradients. It talks about Gravity Models being of order x and degree y.  What does order and degree mean in this circumstance? Is it something to do with the Lagrangian Polynomials used in the models?  Another example is found here which states that EGM2008 is complete to spherical harmonic degree and order 2159 
156,measuring fracture length and width using PKN and KGD models for hydraulic fracturing?,"I am trying to understand PKN and KGD models for hydraulic fracturing. I am wondering why equations for fracture width and length does not include 'breakdown pressure' (pressure at which fracture initiates? The formula for fracture length for KGD is [tex] where G, Q, [tex], [tex] and t are shear modulus, injection rate, viscosity, fracture height and time respectivily. Why there is not a threshold value, after which fracture initiates in this formula? "
157,What happens to the earth after volcanism/tectonics slows?,"If we move far enough into the future that the core begins to solidify to the point that volcanism and tectonics are non-existent, what does the surface of the planet begin to look like?  Does the planet eventually become fully covered in water due to erosion? "
158,Why is the part of the earth tilted towards the sun warmer? Which factors matter more?,"The part of the earth tilted towards the sun is warmer. For example, in the Northern hemisphere, the earth is tilted towards the sun in the months around June and tilted away from it in the months around December.    This has the effect of increasing the exposure of the earth to the sun for the latitudes tilted towards the sun.  Also, the more tropical the latitude, the more energy is received per unit area.   These two ideas are illustrated by the figure below:    There are other effects, too...   If the sun's energy must pass through more atmosphere, there is greater opportunity for it to scatter into space before reaching the earth When the sun strikes the earth, if it strikes it obliquely there is greater chance for the light to be reflected rather than absorbed. Finally, whether the sun strikes water or land or ice has an effect, because each has a different degree of absorption and reflectivity.    In total there seem to be 5 different major factors in how much energy is absorbed by the earth from the sun.  My question is what is the relative importance of each of these factors? Is there a set of equations or measurements that describe the total energy received by the sun in terms of these 5 different factors? "
159,How to interpret seismic interferometry data?,Here is a screenshot of coseismic interferometry measurements of the 2015 Nepal earthquake. What does it mean?  The star is the epicenter of the earthquake. The screenshot was taken from the UNOSAT live crisis map.     
160,Result of deterioration of vegetation,"I had this question in my previous exam, it says:     Deterioration of vegetation resulted by overgrazing results in......      1.desert encroachment.      2.change in climate.   I had to choose 1 or 2 and I chose 2, why? Because my textbook says:     Overgrazing results in deterioration of natural flora, which is always accompanied by deterioration of soil and local climate.   But my answer was wrong, and I was confused which one to choose because both of them seem as correct answers. What I understand from my  text book is that deterioration of vegetation has a direct effect i.e. change in climate and an indirect effect i.e. desert encroachment. So, why was my answer wrong? "
161,Modified blackbody model of earth. What is wrong with it?,"I have made a modified blackbody model that predict earth temperature distribution with high accuracy. It doesn´t include mass or gases. It is based on the initial thought that all energy above surface is solar heat, and heat transfer must apply to the system. Just some simple modification to the perfect blackbody surprisingly enough gave very accurate results.   I answered a question with these equations, but a moderator deleted it for unknown reasons. It is only numbers, and no speculation, so I really can´t understand why.   The greenhouse effect uses The Stefan-Boltzmann equation to add fluxes, stacking them, and that is not allowed in thermal physics. It is a balance equation and should only be used for ""net"" transfer.   I show why it is wrong to use an average value of solar irradiation over the whole surface area, it is because intensity is instantaneous. You cannot use average, because that means that the sun would only be ~5C. Or -18C depending on what solar average you use. Solar heat is about 105Celsius at TOA, that makes a big difference. I show how surface temperature and atmosphere temperature distribution is connected to the solar constant all the way.   It is not shown here, but the model also show direct and total irradiation at zenith, with accuracy. Anyway, since it was deleted without explanation, I get the feeling of censorship, since it falsifies the greenhouse effect. Now I ask you. What is wrong with it?:   I use Stefan-Boltzmann equation and temperature. Solar heat is absorbed according to the geometric difference between the blackbody and earth, two volumes with shells.  [tex].  And since only half the surface area is irradiated,   [tex]  or 286.7 Kelvin. The effective temperature is found by heat transfer to the surface and inverse square law,  [tex], or 256 Kelvin.  Tropopause temperature:  [tex]   or 222 Kelvin. As you can see, heat dominates everything, and just modifying the blackbody to observed differences, absorption in depth of a volume + irradiation of only half the surface, gives a accurate distribution of temperature.  The numbers are, from my POV, unquestionable. Such a good fit falsifies the greenhouse immediately, especially since no experiments show the effect where cold gas can increase the intensity of the heat source heating it, which the theory claims. So, what are your opinions? "
162,Elevation of a point on Earth,What purpose is served by taking sea level as the reference point for finding the height of any point on Earth when we all know that measuring the sea level is a very complex task and it differs from place to place and also keeps on changing? Why can't we just take Earth's centre as the reference point for finding the height of any location? 
163,Above average global temperature in March 2016,"The question arose when I heard from friends across many countries that March has never been so hot. I myself felt the same in my city (Bangalore, India). Then I tried searching on internet, and I found a link on NASA, which says March 2016 was indeed hot.   I was wondering if experts can explain this rise in temperature? Is it due to higher [tex] levels due to human activity, or is it natural? Is it the start of unnatural global warming? "
164,What is the earliest sedimentation we know of?,"Did large-scale sedimentation occur in any great amount during or soon after the Hadean/Archean period? Or did it only start later, because of the intense geological activity? "
165,Continentality/Oceanity,Is there a specific temperature range that is considered to be the change from Continentality to Oceanity? Would this temperature change with latitude?   Would be nice if someone could point me to some literature on the subject.   Thank you! 
166,Can the dew point temperature be more than drybulb temperature?,"I am extracting data from WRF model output for a specific area. The area I am extracting data for is 5000m above mean sea level. When plotting on a graph, I found that the dew point temperature is higher than the dry bulb temperature.    Is it possible that the dew point can go higher than the dry bulb? If yes, what is the inference of this phenomenon? Or can I simply assume that WRF could not calculate temperature values properly for this hill station? "
167,Why does computation cost increase 24 times when the spatial resolution doubles?,"In a Chinese book, I read about the relationship between the numerical model spatial resolution and the computation cost.         It states: when the spatial resolution of model is finer, the result will be preciser. But to achieve a fine grid resolution, the computation cost will increase. For example, when the grid resolution in a 3-D model framework halves (e.g. from 10 km to 5 km), the computation cost will increase by a factor 24.     Why is this? How can I determine the increase of computation costs when the spatial grid resolution changes?  Update  The model here is a 3-d numerical model for weather forcasting like WRF, MM5, etc.    Update 2  Here is an schematic representation of the impact of model resolution on the calculation of chemical oxidants  "
168,Modelling sea levels with gravitational parameters,"Are there any publicly available programs or source code for modelling global (or local) changes in sea level which include parameters for gravitational tidal effects?  I have a physics background, and recently I started playing with large-scale fluid dynamics as a side project. The oceans and their boundary conditions are incredibly complicated, and I've gotten pretty far out of my depth at this point. I don't have the time or motivation to completely invent the wheel on this, so ideally, I'm looking for a program that would allow me to vary lots of parameters - including the tidal potential of the moon - and output topographical data for sea levels at different locations in the ocean or along the coast. However, I'd be happy with just an open source program that I could modify with additional parameters.  I'm looking into this question predominantly from a hobbyist's ""toy model"" perspective. In particular, I'm curious about how oceanic tides would change with tidal forces, say, 100x greater than the moon's or with an almost tidally locked moon (e.g. six months between moonrise and moonset). How much land would be flooded with each high-tide and how much reclaimed with each low-tide? If anyone has an answer to that question, I'd be interested in hearing it as well. "
169,Maximum temperature possible on earth on a day,"What is maximum temperature that can we have on earth on a single day?  I assume that after a certain limit, radiation and convection would start working strongly to have equilibrium of surroundings.  According to thermodynamics principles how high temp in theory can go before equalization process restrict any further increase?  Highest I found till now was 58 ℃ in Libya.  This is theoretical question lets say an Air mass stays over an area and sun radiation is also highest how hot it can get "
170,vehicular pollution,Is there any way to convert the vehicular emissions from cars during journey to oxygen or safer gases to eliminate/decrease vehicular pollution?  My question is keeping in mind most populated and polluted countries where majority of people can't afford for/not willing to buy H2-run cars nor get rid of existing fuel cars nor interested in using bicycles.  In simple terms: Is there a possibility for real time  emission converter? Do they already exist or is there any research in this area? Any kind of help is appreciated.  Thank you  EDIT: re-posted at Sustainablity &amp; Engineering 
171,Are AO-GCMs sensitive enough to take large lakes into account?,"Of course atmospheric-ocean-coupled global climate models are, by their nature, very strong on ocean-atmosphere interaction, but what about large lakes? Lake Victoria in East Africa, the N American Great Lakes, and Lake Nasser, and maybe some others are of comparable size to the average grid cell size of the AO-GCM. Hence wind, humidity and evaporation should affect adjacent grid cells. Is this taken into account? "
172,When GCMs are calibrated do they use 'corrected rainfall' input?,"Part of calibrating Global Climatic Models involves 'hindcasts' or 'history matching' against historic climate records, including rainfall. Such rainfall records are all in error because almost all raingauges incur at least a 7% aerodynamic under-catch. Conventionally this is not 'corrected' but for model calibration they should be corrected. So are GCM using corrected or uncorrected rainfall inputs? If yes, how are the rainfall records corrected - just multiplying by 1.07, or some other way? If no, why not? This is important because, worldwide, the GCM outputs are being used for forward projections of water resources (even though that is not what GCMs are designed to support).    "
173,The geology of local landscapes and small scale features,"I'm learning geology to understand the processes behind the formation of my local landscape.   I understand the processes behind big features, such as mountains. But I'm struggling to understand the processes behind small local features, such as hills.  I live in Reading, Berkshire, South-East England, with a typical landscape of rolling of grassy hills and clay strata. Similar to this image below.    What geological processes would be responsible for the formation of this landscape?    Additional Information  Strata:   I dug a hole in my garden and found there is a thin layer of soil, then a large amount of clay with a variety of rocks and pebbles.     Features:   The main features are a landscape of rolling-hills and grassy plains.   Question  What geologic processes are responsible for the formation of these low-hills and clay strata?   Were the hills once mountains, now eroded?  "
174,Rate of underground formation of carbon-14 by neutron capture,"Carbon-14 constantly forms in the atmosphere due to neutron capture by nitrogen-14 and subsequent emission of a proton. Other less frequent mechanisms involving neutron capture by carbon-13 or oxygen isotopes also exist, as well as radium decay, as the link explains.    My question is: given an old (compared to the half-life of [tex], more than 100 million years old let's say), sample of coal with for example 2% nitrogen and 80% carbon, how much carbon-14 would be present due to the neutron flux underground?  Obviously this is going to be at least 1000 times less than in modern plant materials. But what order of magnitude would be expected?  In case it helps, I'll add these references:   Background neutron flux determination at a depth of 3200 mwe underground Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research A 357 (1995), p 524-534.

175,What type of rock is this and how did it form?,"I'm looking for some help identifying this rock. I'm also interested in finding out how it is likely to have formed.     I found it on a black sand beach in Vik, southern Iceland, not far from the basalt column formations. I assumed it was basalt too or at least volcanic, but I have no experience so would love to find out more.   It weighs around 115g so feels fairly heavy for it's size. It's fairly smooth on the surface. What is the white material and also what is the light brown material likely to be? How do these three types of material come together to form this stone? If I could cut it in two, what's it likely to look like inside?  Sorry if these questions are basic, I'm a complete novice and any answers would be much appreciated.  "
176,Can human activity affect volcanoes?,"As part of a course on Natural Disasters, I have a group presentation in which we focus on a specific natural disaster. One of the questions we have to address is how human activity may have affected the geographic area and/or the disaster. The topic for our group is volcanoes, with a specific focus on the Mount St. Helens eruption in 1980. So my question is — is this possible?  The closest I can think of is human-induced seismic activity, due to fracking or wastewater injection, for example. However, I do not know if this could conceivably also affect in any way nearby volcanism. I also don't think there are or have been any oil-related activities around Mount St. Helens, but I really don't know for sure. So, is this possible? "
177,Why do forecast areas on weather.gov appear as twisted squares?,"I get my weather forecasts from good ol' NOAA's weather.gov site. On the detailed site weather pages, there's a map that shows the forecast area as a green square (for Boston at least, the square is about 1.5 miles on a side). You can click on nearby areas to change the presented forecast to that new location.  Here's the question: why is the square shown as the forecast area not oriented north/south/east/west? For some reason, near the US East Coast it's twisted clockwise, and on the West Coast it's twisted counter-clockwise. I assume it's something about the easy representation of weather information in a GIS system, but that's only a guess.  Here are some examples, from East to West. First, Boston:    Second Indianapolis:    Third, Denver:    Fourth, San Francisco:    Note that, if you go even further west to Hawaii, the pattern breaks, and the square is perfectly north/south/east/west:    So, any ideas? "
178,What does it take to make a diamond?,"I have constantly been told through my K-12 Education that diamonds are a product of carbon, time, pressure, and temperature. If this is true, what is stopping someone from building a high-pressure, high-temperature system and dumping graphite in and making millions of diamonds?  It seems my exact strategy is listed here: [website]Update: I watched the BBC special on synthetic diamonds ([website]"
179,Reason for rotting smell after first rain of the season?,"Last day we had first rain after 3-4 months of hot&amp;dry weather, and within 3-4 minutes a rotting smell came from nowhere. Due this smell I had running nose for a day. What might be the reason for this bad smell? Did anyone heard of this kind of problem? (or is this just some local issue related to sewage, or some animal dead body which was dry came in contact with water)  I am not referring to Petrichor, which is fresh earthly smell. And I am in India.    I hope this is on-topic here "
180,"If we assume the mega impact hypothesis for the formation of Moon, where on Earth is the impact point?",Given that Pangaea had C-shape can we assume that the point of impact was in the center of this C-shape? In modern world it would be under Tibet?     Or should we assume the oldest shape of the supercontinent was circular so that the impact point was somewhere in North America? 
181,Looking for evidence against some points raised in Ivar Giaever's speech on climate change,"I just listened to Ivar Giaever's speech on the climate change, and he raised following points which seem significant to me:   Temperature differences y/y are very small compared to natural variation during the year, and the trend we see could be statistical illusion, especially that the scientists who developed the method were looking to demonstrate exactly that sort of trend. The correlation between CO2 emissions and measured temperature changes is not perfect.    Can anyone provide evidence to mute those points? "
182,Why there are no sharp corners in nature?,"I have read some articles explaining why rounded corners are more aesthetically pleasing, like this one and it all makes perfect sense but my question is:  Why does nature not have sharp corners? What is the law or set of laws that governs this behavior?  "
183,Is it possible that a reduction in vegetation is a cause of global warming?,"A lot of people seem to believe that the entire cause of global warming is that humans are emitting lots of carbon dioxide. However, according to a source I found online (I accept it may not be entirely trustworthy) roughly 46% of trees on the planet have been destroyed since the dawn of the human race, we cut down 15 billion trees every year! Another source I found says that 16 trees absorb the amount of CO2 the average active person emits every day (an active person emits roughly 1kg of CO2 every day). This means we have destroyed enough trees that we no longer can support 937.5 million people! It also means that those trees are no longer taking in 937.5 million kg of CO2 . Here's a line chart showing deforestation from 1800 to 2010. The deforestation rate has gone up.    Credits to the appropriate  authors.  Clearly, the global temperature of the Earth has gone up because of carbon dioxide, however the carbon dioxide has gone up because we are destroying plantlife. So, my question is: ""When talking about global warming, why does nobody talk about plantlife? Wouldn't plantlife have a more immediate effect on getting rid of carbon dioxide than limiting how much carbon dioxide we emit?"". "
184,Why doesn't the earth become superheated?,"One day I was sitting in an Atlanta traffic jam wondering about all the engine exhaust heat warming the localised environment. Later that night, things will have cooled down. Where did the heat go?  On a global scale, I understand our sun heats the earth via radiation, not conduction as  the intervening vacuum of space cannot transfer heat. So if the sun has been beaming gazillions of watts of energy into the earth over the last few billion years, and energy is conserved and the earth does not radiate out daily a material proportion of the radiation it has absorbed, where has all that energy gone? "
185,What are the major contributors to the amount of infra-red emitted by the earth?,"From the answers from an earlier question, I learned that most of the solar radiation gained by the earth system (atmosphere, surface, and inner mass) is re-radiated back into space in the form of infra-red. This balance of incoming solar radiation and outgoing infra-red radiation depends on the earth system's infra-red radiation 'equation' - that is, how it takes 'in' the various forms of solar radiation and converts them into infra-red. At least, that's the best I can make out of this article Earth's Energy Budget and this accompanying chart.    My question is what are the principal components of this 'equation'? I imagine the percentage of water in the atmosphere and on the surface of the earth, the mean absorptive ability of the non-water surfaces of the earth, and, what is most mysterious to me, what is the 'factor' of infra-red production by different surface materials. I imagine this is all highly technical and finely detailed in large elaborate models, but are there 'big levers' that represent most of the infra-red radiative effect? Where I am 'headed with' this, of course, is if there is a practical way to increase this radiation back to space that can make a positive difference on global warming (ie net positive radiation into space after accounting for increased greenhouse gases back radiation)? And I imagine there is not, given we are not trying that. "
186,Epicenter of earthquake at sea - is it a point on ocean surface or sea bed?,"When an earthquakes' focus is below the sea bed, is the epicenter given as a point on the oceans' surface at mean sea level, or as a point on the sea bed?  There is some ambiguity in the term 'earths surface' here that is causing confusion in the English Language Learners sister site, which I'm hoping the experts here can clear up.  I'm using the definition of epicenter found here.  Is the epicenter always directly above the hypocenter? "
187,Is porphyritic texture always indicative of a 2 stage cooling process?,Is porphyritic texture always indicative of a 2 stage cooling process? Can't the phenocrysts and groundmass be formed at the same time depending upon the chemical constituents forming the rock? The groundmass being made up of constituents least in proportion and the phenocrysts being made up of the constituent in greatest proportion?  
188,Circular rain cloud observed in rain radar,"This circular rain pattern was observed in Sydney’s rain radar today. It remained for the entire loop, wiggling around a bit but mostly staying in the same place.  The fact that it’s centred around the radar made me suspect it is some kind of artifact. Is that the case? Or this this real? If it’s real, why would it look like that?   "
189,Do Tectonic Plates Merge?,"I had a question concerning the nature of continental plates.  When looking at the Eurasian Plate today, for the most part, there is one solid fragment of the Earth's crust. However, having had a look at maps detailing prehistoric Earth, this isn't always the case. Throughout the entire Phanerozoic Eon, Eurasia has been a collection of different landmasses gradually merging together. Baltica, Kazakhstania, all the various regions of East and South-East Asia. Yet, today, only India and Arabia are still situated upon separate plates. All others no longer possess any divisions between them.  Why is this the case? I was under the assumption that it was only oceanic plates that submerge into the mantle due their density. I though that when continental plates collide, neither continent submerges, forming mountains. Shouldn't there still be distinct tectonic plates?  Any answers would be greatly appreciated. "
190,Does wind chill work in deserts?,"Wind chill works by removing the layer of heated air around your body. However in a hot area, say a desert, wouldn't the air around be hotter than your body or at least much closer to it than cold air? In that case, how much would wind chill actually affect your temperature loss? "
191,What place on Earth is closest to the Sun?,"What is the location on Earth that is closest to the Sun?  I've seen this question asked many times, and answered in varied and contradictory ways:   The most common answer is “the summit of Chimborazo volcano in Ecuador”. This volcano is the point on Earth's surface that is furthest from the center of Earth, and that is then equated to being the closest to the Sun. This is very commonly spoken of around the Chimborazo volcano area and among the people involved with tourism there (here is an example of this answer) Others argue that it is Cayambe volcano in Ecuador, it being the highest point along the equatorial line (answer example). Others say Mount Everest in Nepal/China because it is the highest point on Earth (example). And others argue it is Sairecabur volcano in Chile/Bolivia, because it is the highest point at the latitude which is closest to the Sun on January 5th, when the perihelion happens (i.e. the point in Earth's orbit that is closest to the sun) (example). A fifth answer, with the same logic as the previous, is Licancabur volcano in Chile/Bolivia, which quite as close to the latitude of the perihelion but is significantly higher than Sairecabur.   What is the correct answer and why?  What place on Earth is closest to the Sun? "
192,Is the effect of Earths position relative to sun large or small compared to CO2 level in climate change?,"A recent answer by Camilo Rada for ""What place on Earth is closest to the Sun?"" inspires this question. He makes clear that significant changes in the wander of the earth through its orbit results in striking effects on how close the closest distance is between these two bodies.  In the same thread others point out the height of solar flares relative the the baseline surface of the boiling hydrogen ball are likely even larger effects.  It is intuitive to me that the distance to the main producer of heat on the Earth SHOULD be a much larger effect than concentration of a gas in our atmosphere.  Is this a reasonable intuition?  So my questions has four parts:  1) Generally, do the big dog scientists modeling for climate change in the next 100 years take these apparently very large effects into account in their models and how big of an effect is this compared to CO2 ppm levels?  It would be nice to have an answer in some sort of statistical level of confidence.  2) Another way to consider this is how big of an effect is this variable compared to the expected CAUSES of CO2 ppm levels: combustion on earth of various kinds, respiration and farting of living species, chemical processes, etc  3) Can the sun's energy level, solar flare activity be modeled and used to predict, in the absence of CO2 ppm level changes, the temperature on earth in the future 5 years.?  4) As Mr. Rada points out in the referenced thread is this distance changed on such a limited timeline as to make it NOT as relevant or a lot smaller effect than it first seems? "
193,What is the difference between subvolcanic rocks and plutonic rocks?,"I'm studying Plutonic (Intrusive) rocks and I really don't understand the difference between Plutonic Rocks that form in Sills and Dikes from the so called  subvolcanic rocks, also known as a hypabyssal rocks. Aren't they the same? Why? "
194,Why is there so much more silicon than carbon in the Earth's crust?,"Some arguments I've seen about the viability of silicon-based life involve the relative abundance of silicon vs carbon. In the universe as a whole, there's a lot more carbon than silicon around. Yet, on Earth, silicon is far more common. So how did this happen? This question partially answers why there seems to be a lot of silicon in the Earth's crust, but it doesn't explain where all the carbon went.  So where did it go? "
195,"What causes frozen ""shooting water"" spikes from ice covered water in the winter?","I have seen things like this appear once or twice on cold winter mornings, a frozen spike of water from an ice-covered container or very small body of water (puddle).  I found the photo below at Mel Bartels and BBAstroDesigns  and the caption reads:     An ice spike in a bird bath following a cold snap December 2014   What could be happening here? How might the two structures form like this, both tilted against gravity?  update: Comments indicate that Wikipedia's article Ice spike gives an explanation based on the growth of a tube as the freezing process extends from top-down into the liquid, pushing remaining liquid out a hole and growing vertically from a central opening in the tube.  However, I can't see how this makes a spike with such a large angle with respect to vertical. It really looks to my untrained eye like this is a frozen jet, but that's not so likely as water is not so compressible.   "
196,Were there any polar vortexes in 2018?,Were there any polar vortexes in 2018? On what dates?   I want to see what the weather looked like on those dates: [website]Yes I know. You would think that I could just google it and it would be the first thing on the page. But no.  
197,"How could have this rock formed? - Penny inside rock, mostly iron","I was walking along a beach (in Southern California) and found this rock on the ground, and there were none like it on the beach. It is composed of mostly rusted iron, and a magnet will stick to most places on it, but it sticks to place around the penny the strongest. There are other rocks in it too, including one that appears to be quartz. There is a penny (you can see part of it right below the ""dent"" or ""crater"" in the rock) and a hook (not shown, made of iron or steel) in it as seen in the picture. How could've this rock formed so recently (last century, the penny seems to be a new one and I can make out ""states"" from ""United States of America"" on it)? How was it formed and how could've a penny got in there?   "
198,Is pollution a contributing factor to freezing rain?,"I have been to different places with nearly the same freezing temperatures, around -2°C, but only at some specific places I repetitively experienced freezing rain. One common factor at these places was relatively more air pollution. Could it be that pollution is a contributing factor that causes freezing rain to occur?  If not, what are the main factors that cause freezing rain, and the regions on Earth that often experience them, especially in Europe? "

200,how can a complete novice find ore?,"I live near Sydney, Australia and I really like the idea of sourcing my own ore from the wilderness. I want to give my kids a really hands on education into how primitive industries actually kicked off.  Is there some source of public information explaining exactly where you would find surface deposits of ore? Is this going to be achievable for a lay person?  Edit: I'm thinking of copper ore, for example, which can be smelted into pea sized droplets relatively easily using a makeshift clay furnace with bellows. I didn't specify exactly which ore because I realise that ore is regional. I realise that it is unlawful to steal materials out of the environment, but I'm assuming that the likelihood of being prosecuted for conducting a small scale science experiment for your kids is relatively low. taking a couple buckets of gravel is not going to cause an environmental disaster. If the land is privately owned then it may be a matter of simply asking the landowner for permission. "
201,Movements of the tectonic plates - collison between Indian Plate & Eurasian Plate,"I am a high school student, my question is about the collision between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. When this happens what happens to the area of the Asian continent. Does it increase or decrease? Also, south Asia gets Monsoon rains, is this an effect of this collision? "
202,"Why do loose, soft soils amplify earthquake vibrations rather than dampening them?","Areas where the buildings are built on top of a deep layer of loose sediments are widely recognised as being more prone to earthquake damage (all else being equal) than areas where the bedrock is shallow and building foundations can easily be dug down to it, because the loose sediment cover amplifies the vibrations from earthquakes, increasing the amount of damage they cause.  Why is this?  Intuitively, one would expect that, since the vibrations from an earthquake originate in the bedrock or deeper, buildings bolted directly to bedrock would be the worst-affected, and having a thick sediment layer would dampen the vibrations considerably.  So why do soft sediments amplify earthquake vibrations, when one would expect the opposite effect? "
203,What does this reference velocity refer to? (Atmosphere-Ocean Momentum Exchange),"  The above image is taken from ""Atmosphere–Ocean Momentum Exchange in General Circulation Models"", John A.T.Bye 1999. It represents the inertial coupling concept between the atmosphere and ocean.  It is a concept which helps to model momentum transfer between the atmosphere and ocean, taking into account gravity waves on the surface of the ocean. This diagram is used to help illustrate the formulation of shear stress vectors for both the atmosphere and ocean.  The only problem I have is I do not know what is meant by reference velocity? Supposedly this velocity is shared between both mediums, atmosphere and ocean.  What could this refer to?  Any help at all would be appreciated.  Thanks! "
204,What kind of light blue stone is this?,"My son found this stone on the beach on the island Crete. It was a one of its kind, no other visible stone on the beach was the same. We asked the locals, but they did not know this stone.  It's about 15 cm long and weighs 1,3 kg. It's not very hard or soft. I think it is a litle harder than marble: I can scratch it with a knife, but just barely, a coin can not scratch it.  Is it marble? Where does it originate from?     "
205,What is an 'obstacle vista diagram'?,"Currently I do some research about SODAR and at this paper, the author wrote (p. 1502f):     A site should be relatively clear of obstacles that could act as   potential fixed-echo reflectors. If that is not possible, then it is   therefore important to construct an obstacle vista diagram prior to   sodar installation  which  identifies  the  direction  and  height    of potential reflectors in relation to the sodar (Baxter, 1994, 1996).   This diagram can be used after some data have been collected to assess   whether or not reflections are of concern at some sodar height ranges.   Unfortunately, I can't find any access to the referenced literature and google wasn't helpful either. So, what is an obstacle vista diagram and how to construct it? "

208,What controls how quickly groundwater gets recharged from rainfall?,"This is a follow up question to an earlier question I asked about how groundwater gets mapped. I have read that our groundwater is getting exhausted as people drill to deeper depths and lift prehistoric water, water that got trapped and stored before humans walked the Earth. The same articles also talk about the millions of years it takes to refill those reservoirs, and then extoll about how we need to use less water.   My question is this: What controls how quickly they refill with rainwater? Could these reservoirs be refilled faster if an outside pump refilled them using rainwater? What are the energy economics on doing this for a place like Nebraska or Bangladesh? "
209,Nonlinear Stokes equations for glacier modeling,"What is the difference between   [tex]  and  [tex]  from the physical point of view, in the glacier modeling context?  Does it make sense to model a glacier with the first one?  To explain the notation, [tex] and [tex] denote the velocity and pressure fields, respectively; [tex] denotes a velocity-dependent viscosity coefficient (for example, Glen's power flow law). The gradient of [tex] is  [tex]  and [tex] denotes the transpose matrix of [tex]. (If [tex] has 3 variables its gradient is analogous to the 2-variable case). Frequently, [tex] is [tex], where [tex] is the gravitational acceleration constant and [tex] the ice density. [tex] denotes the identity matrix and [tex] the divergence of a matrix is the divergence by rows, for example,  [tex]  This way, we may rewrote (1) and (2), respectively, as follows:  [tex]  and  [tex] "

211,Can I use diamonds as fossil fuel?,"Aside from cultural implications (correct me if I'm wrong but artificial diamonds are not so hard to obtain, right?) diamonds are pure carbon and are more unstable than graphite. So, why not use diamonds as fuel?  My approach: steel melts at 1500°C at least (and there are better steel that melt at higher temperatures). It is pretty high compared with diamond combustion temperature that is just 800°C and once you get to that point combustion will generate enough energy to burn diamond itself. So you can burn it in a steel piston.  Ok, I admit 800°C is pretty high compared with paper and wood (233–400°C) but it is a clean combustion (you obtain only CO2, assuming a constant oxygen input). From this point of view hydrogen is the only competitor but it rise to 500°C, that is not little.  So, what is the practical limitation in the use of diamonds as fossil fuel? "
212,Seismic migration concepts,"In Dr Hua-Wei Zhou's book Practical Seismic Data Analysis (2014), he includes and explains figures from previous classic works (i.e. Schneider, 1971) in order to describe migration from a fundamental level. On pages 212–213, the following figures (and questions) are shown below:      Question 1  For Figure 14, he says that ""in the case of a constant velocity model, the equal-traveltime contour will be a hyperbolic surface centered over the image point"" - my question is this: why is it a hyperbola and not a semi-circle? In John Claerbot's Imaging the Earth's Interior, he claims that the equation of a wave front a given constant time results in a semi-circle and not a hyperbola.  Question 2  In Figure 13, he also says that ""in the case of a constant velocity model, the equal traveltime contour will be an elliptical surface with the source and receiver as the two foci"" - again, my question is this: why is this an elliptical surface in this particular scenario? Why not a semi-circle? "
213,How to tell if fog is made out of water droplets or ice crystals?,"I understand that clouds can be made out of water droplets and/or ice crystals. And that fog is nothing else than low-lying clouds.  However, I've experienced fog in a wide ranges of temperatures. I like mountaineering and you often get fog high in the mountains. I've been lucky enough to visit the high mountains of Antarctica and I've also experienced fog there at very low temperatures.  This answer (in the comments) and the fog wikipedia article mention that ice fog happens only at extremely low temperatures (-35 or -40 C). But I think I've experienced fog at those temperatures too. Some times, with the right light I've seen the air filled with tiny crystals, but I wouldn't call that fog, because it is very thin.  Then, as far as I can tell, all thick fogs feel and look the same. No matter if they are made out of ice crystals or water droplets. Is that right? Or is there a way to differentiate between ice/water fogs?  Or maybe contrary to what I think, I've never experienced frozen fog. But: would I notice the difference if I were to ever experience it? How would they feel/look different?  Finally, if somebody also knows why water droplets can stay liquid in clouds down to -30°C, it would be great to learn about that too. "
214,How old are Chile's fjords?,"Do we have any knowledge about the age of Chile's fjords, more specifically, those found near the Northern Patagonian Ice Field?  Is it reasonable to conclude that they were formed in Quaternary given the fact that there exist glaciers there at this point in time? "

216,Could an earthquake create a design in a sand pendulum?,Is it possible for an earthquake to generate such a design in a sand pendulum during an earthquake? I saw an article online describing the story of a shop owner finding one of his pendulums had created this image during an earthquake.   I researched seismographs and they all seem to be in a linear fashion. Obviously a pendulum is not a scientific seismograph which raises the question: is this possible?   I could not find any research debunking this concept nor confirming. All the articles I read were different news groups reiterating the same story.

219,What kind of lava tube feature is Cleopatra's Grave?,"Cleopatra's Grave is a natural feature inside (warning: PDF) Catacombs Cave in Lava Beds National Monument near Modoc, California.   Source: LookBeforeYouLive  My apologies, as this image is somehow in really bad color, like all the other images from that blog post. (I should really be grateful they got images at all, as this low image quality video provides some idea of the difficulty of reaching the location, which requires crawling through at least eight feet of one-foot-high passage and lots of three-foot-high passage, and the ceiling directly above it is about two feet high, so I can't complain about the quality!)  I saw it with my own eyes. Cleopatra's grave is an oblong feature on the floor of Catacombs Cave (lava tube) about three feet long and two feet wide and rimmed by apparently normal cave floor that raises up about an inch or so above the surrounding floor. Cleopatra's grave is composed of rock of a light grey color as opposed to the dark grey and slightly brown-tinged floor around it. It looks very smooth (I didn't touch it because of its historic paint) and it exhibits circular fractures running two complete rings around its outer edge. It is trivially identified by the rather recent red paint serving to mark the locations of the historic yellow paint applied by J.D. Howard himself calling it by name.  The surface has no visible crystals, and if I didn't know it was natural I'd have thought on seeing it that somebody had mixed up some really fine grout (think cement) and poured it. Furthermore, the surface exhibits no specular reflection and almost perfectly uniform matte reflection.  But what is it? Some kind of lava upwelling? A rafted block of unusual shape? Something else?  This is a locally-well-known feature that I'm hoping somebody here actually knows the answer to. But there is simply not another way of getting at it -- there's no way I'm going to test its hardness or otherwise risk damage to so much as the paint on it. "
220,Did temperature for the US state of Illinois reach an all-time record low 1/31/2019?,"The State Climatologist Office for Illinois says the all time low temperature of Illinois was -36 °F, with a report of -37 °F in 2009 being disqualified.

222,Crystallography: The shape of axial divergent profiles,"I don't know if crystallography related topics go into this stack exchange, so sorry if that's wrong here.  My question concerns the characteristic shape of axial divergent powder patterns. According to Dinnerbier and Billinge, Powder Diffraction Theory and Practice, RSC Publishing, 2008 can an axially divergent reflection be decomposed into various positions:    Here φ1 marks the most divergent part of the incoming X-rays. What I can't find however is how this shape is related to the divergence itself. So why does it look like this 'fin' with a strong fronting-effect once the beam diverges? My idea would be the following. As the diffraction on the sample creates a scattering-cone where the circular base holds the information on the intensity we will only see some part of it, a conic section where the cone itersects with the detector slit. So the overall and still arbitrary intensity (y-axis, not area under the curve) should be the arc segment the slit actually detects. But if I move the detector slit (that is orthogonal to the cone's direction) parallel to this direction, so I intersect at a point closer or further away from the scattered sample I should expect the overall intensity in this arc segment to be smaller once it is further away as the same intensity should be spread over a larger circular path and therefore a segment has comparably lower intensity the further it is away from the source. That is at least how I would imagine it to happen. So if some parts of the incoming beam scatter further away from the scattering center, so axial divergence happens the cone should travel a longer distance compared to the central part of the incoming X-rays (focus point). So if it intersects with the detector the main non-divergent part of the beam will have a smaller cone and higher intensity density than the divergent one. If both have a rather similar conic intersection (leaving curvature for a second) it should have a relatively lower intensity for the more divergent part of the beam.  Is that reasoning somewhat logical or am I completely wrong here? "
223,How much further can weather forecasting models go before the limits of Chaos Theory set in?,"Refer to a report here that mentions the huge advancement in weather forecasting models since the 1980s:     How much better? “A modern five-day forecast is as accurate as a   one-day forecast was in 1980,” says a new paper, published last week   in the journal Science. “Useful forecasts now reach nine to 10 days   into the future.”   But weather forecasting cannot be indefinitely accurate, one fundamental limitation is Chaos Theory:     Chaos: When the present determines the future, but the approximate   present does not approximately determine the future. (Wikipedia)   I used to think some ten or twenty years ago that the accuracy level of 3 day weather forecasts was due to Chaos Theory, but apparently it wasn't.   Are there studies where weather forecasting models are subjected to sensitivities of initial conditions, investigating how Chaos Theory puts an upper limit on the accuracies of such models? Also, based on current models, how much further can weather forecasting models go before the limits of Chaos Theory set in?  "
224,How much could Earth's temperature increase by the time we run out of oil reserves?,"According to this article How long will world's oil reserves last?:     At the current rate of extraction oil reserves will last 53 years.   And according to this another article, Global temperature - NASA, global temperature increased about a Celsius degree in 80 years.  I suppose we can't directly extrapolate the years because I assume oil's consumption is higher now than before, but is it possible to estimate how much Earth's temperature could increase by the time we run out of oil reserves? Wouldn't it be about a degree or something like happened in the previous 80 years? Is that a problem to really be worried about? "
225,Would oceans regenerate if removed?,"On Earth, there is enough Hydrogen and Oxygen to make 13,88 million km[tex] of water (calculation below). However, oceans contain only a tenth of that.  Clearly, most of the hydrogen must be stored in other chemical compounds different to water. Or, as water deep within Earth's interior: some studies suggest the water on Earth's interior could contain three times as much as the water near the surface.  On the other hand there are many chemical reactions, like the well known photosynthesis and respiration, that can transform water into other compounds and vice versa.  We often think that there is a fixed amount of liquid water on Earth (plus or minus what is being recycled in the atmosphere). But it seems to me that the processes above could change the water amount significantly over geological timescales.  So my question could be stated as follows: over geological timescales, what determines the amount of liquid water on Earth?  Here are two examples of the processes I'm thinking about:   Reservoir transfers: If water from a well is removed, the ground water reservoir around it will slowly re-fill the well. Would the same happen with Earth's oceans if removed? Would water from the deep Earth's interior partially re-fill the oceans through volcanic eruptions? Chemical balance: For a chemical reaction that can go both ways, if the reactants and products are in equilibrium and I remove the product compounds, more of them will be generated until a new equilibrium is reached. Would the same happen if I remove the water from Earth's surface? Will Hydrogen and Oxygen from rocks and air combine to partially replenish the oceans?   (This question was inspired by How much water is the atmosphere losing to space?)    Calculation of the maximum possible water on Earth  The maximum amount of water you can have on Earth is limited by the available hydrogen. Now, for each gram of bulk Earth there are 260 [tex] of hydrogen and plenty of Oxygen.  Given that the Earth's mass is [tex], and 260 [tex] correspond to Hydrogen, that would total [tex] g of Hydrogen, that at a molar mass of 1.007 g/mol, corresponds to [tex] mol, enough to make [tex] mol of water (as two atoms of hydrogen are required in a molecule of water). And since water has a molecular mass of 18.0152 g/mol, such an amount of water would weigh [tex] grams. Finally, assuming a density of 1 [tex] we get a total of [tex] [tex] or [tex]; that corresponds to 10.01 times the amount of water near Earth's surface (including oceans, lakes, rivers, ground water, etc.) and that is estimated to add up to 1,386,000,000 [tex]. "
226,A rough picture about the ground-level ammonia (NH3),"Ammonia is the only alkaline gas in the atmosphere. It is one of the key features to control the acidity of aerosols and the formation of ammonium salts.   In the environment of [tex]-rich and [tex]-poor, the formation pathway of the secondary aerosol would be distinct.          For example, if [tex] is redundant after the combination with [tex], they would continue to react with [tex] to form [tex]. However, if in the [tex]-poor environment, [tex] would react with the crustal material and thus form nitrate in the coarse mode.         In this way, the concentration levels of [tex] affect the chemical composition, size distribution of atmospheric aerosols.      However, the ground-level monitoring of [tex] is still limited in China with several published ones in limited spots.   Therefore, I want to learn that:      Is there any method to estimate NH3 concentration by other species?      Is there any dataset (e.g. remote sensing, measurements) offering the distribution of [tex] concentration?  "

228,How to calculate residence time for an element in a reservoir?,"The residence time for an element in a reservoir can be calculated by the reservoir size at steady state divided by the inflow or outflow rate. Given the following diagram, I need to calculate the mean residence times for nitrogen in the following stocks:   Atmosphere Fixed Nitrogen on Land     But I am confused by this question, what exactly is its steady state? what exactly is the reservoir size and what it the inflow and outflow?  Thank you  EDIT: Problem-solved with the help of Camilo Rada. The way you calculate residence time is by using the formula:  [tex]  In the example I looked at the box in the diagram for atmosphere's content of residence, being [tex] units, that will serve as our total reservoir size, then we can either choose the outgoing or incoming flow (as an approximation as the reservoir is not in steady state), I chose the outgoing, so we add them together: [tex] units per year. Now plug that into the formula:  [tex]  It would be the same process for each box. "

231,How vertically deep do lava conduits go?,"I'll preface this with the truth and hope it doesn't disqualify the question but rather give context: after reading Journey to the Center of the Earth by Jules Verne, I am amazed at the prospect of venturing into volcanic conduits to explore the interior of the Earth. How deep do lava conduits go, why don't they go deeper, and what kinds of formations or environments exist at their terminus?  I am not new to Earth science but am pretty new to in-depth geology (pun intended) and volcanology. From what I can tell, the type of lava cave which goes the deepest is referred to as a lava tube. Apparently these tubes can be fairly long (e.g. a tube from Mauna Loa goes 50km before terminating[?] at the ocean!) but not very deep (Wikipedia on lava tubes lists a mere 15m!) Why do these tubes not go far deeper?  The deepest conduit from surface to inner Earth is apparently the Kola Superdeep Borehole which terminates at ~12km deep upon reaching higher-than-expected temperatures. I think of magma - liquefied hot rock erupting out of volcanoes - as coming from even deeper than that depth. Therefore, why doesn't lava tubes or other volcanic conduit continue to such deep depths? Do they, but it is too difficult to explore? Do they during eruptions, but soon after cool and fill with solidified rock or eventually collapse and thereby fill with rock?  As noted I'm new but interested to the subject, so any info to help me understand the processes and environment involved in this interface between inner Earth and the surface would be much appreciated.

234,Feedback loops between soil chemistry and plant growth,"Would the dynamic between soil nitrogen and plant growth be a positive or negative feedback loop  I think it is a negative feedback loop because as soil nitrogen increases then plant growth increases, and as plant growth increases, soil nitrogen decreases, is this correct? Therefore, since [tex], it's a negative feedback loop.  Also, what about the feedback loop between temperature and soil organic matter? As temperature increases so does soil organic matter, as soil organic matter increases so does the release of CO2 thus causing more warming. A positive feedback loop.  Is this reasoning correct? "

236,"How does ice-penetrating radar ""see"" through kilometers of ice without being absorbed?","The BBC News article Isolated lakes found beneath Canadian ice sheet links to the open access Science Advances article Discovery of a hypersaline subglacial lake complex beneath Devon Ice Cap, Canadian Arctic.  The discovery is based on radar ""soundings"" of the Devon Ice Cap in Nunavut, Canada.  An earlier question What is likely to have happened with these newly discovered antarctic volcanos below the ice? shows sub-surface radar measurements of antarctic ice, in this case to a depth of 1.5 kilometers, and therefore with a total path length of 3 kilometers in ice.  The water molecule is strongly polar and interacts with microwave radiation by absorbing and thermalizing it. This effect is obvious in microwave ovens. Microwave ovens can be used to ""defrost"" frozen food even a few centimeters thick, using reduced power and longer time. This is necessary because frozen water molecules have a lower absorption than those in unfrozen areas, but they are still quite absorbing.  Radar measurements travel through kilometers in ice round trip, substantially larger than the thickness of a slab of frozen peas.  How is ice-penetrating radar able to work through such long path lengths of ice? Is there a special frequency thats used, or other tricks allowing for extremely weak reflections after bulk attenuation to be detected and measured? "
237,Help understanding radar data in subglacial lake complex beneath Devon Ice Cap,"The BBC News article Isolated lakes found beneath Canadian ice sheet links to the open access Science Advances article Discovery of a hypersaline subglacial lake complex beneath Devon Ice Cap, Canadian Arctic.  The discovery is based on radar ""soundings"" of the Devon Ice Cap in Nunavut, Canada.  I'm having trouble understanding the nature of the evidence for liquid water as stated in the article. I understand that there will be a relatively strong reflection at an interface where the dielectric constant changes, and that this is expressed in dB in some of the plots, but I don't understand the blue ""blobs"" or the axis label Spec. content shown.  I've cropped some of the plots and rearranged them below to help highlight the ""blue blobs"" below.   Also it looks like the potential lakes are associated with dips in the underlying bedrock contour, but I can't tell if the lakes are sitting on top of the bedrock, or at an intermediate elevation above it with ice both above and below them, and I don't understand at all what the axis label Hydrolic head (m) in other plots means. And why does the top surface of the ice look relatively flat in the radar images, but rise and fall hundreds of meters in the ice surface and bed plots? Did the plane fly at a fixed distance with respect to the top ice surface rather than a fixed elevation?    below: Figure 1 from here.   "
238,"What is the percentage of the global water cycle (evaporation, precipitation) that occurs over the ocean?","Most of the water cycle studies focus on the processes and changes occurring over land with little emphasis on the ocean.

And how hard is the wall (can we go through it)?  "
244,Why do tropical cyclones not tear themselves apart?,"A tropical cyclone is the generic term for a hurricane, typhoon, or tropical storm.  Tropical cyclones derive their energy from evaporation of water at the ocean surface which ultimately recondenses when it cools to the saturation point.  The rotation of a tropical cyclone is caused by the Coriolis effect.    What is unclear to me is: Why do these massive bodies of warm, moist air clump together over thousands of kilometers?  What physical process causes them to be drawn in towards the center of the storm?   *image taken from the Wikipedia article on tropical cyclones "
245,What are some of the strongest theories against the existence of mantle plumes?,"Among the people I interact with in the geodynamics community, it seems that almost all of us are in full support of the mantle plume theory.

246,Sea Level in Paleogeographic Maps,"Most paleogeographic maps available (C. R. Scotese or R. Blakey maps for instance) show not only the shape of the continents during the concerned period but also the level of the seas and oceans (i. e. the coastlines, the epicontinental seas, etc.).    Since Haq et al. 1987, there has been quite a few reconstructions of the global relative sea level changes for parts of the Phanerozoic. But going from such global curves to actual maps showing the approximative coastlines and epicontinental seas does require a fair amount of extra information such as paleobathymetry of the oceans and paleoaltimetry of the continents to name the more obvious.     So my question is: do we have such informations on a global scale? Or are the sea level representation on such maps just a shot in the dark? "
247,Are there situations where the groundwater table doesn't follow the morphology of the surface?,"In most or all geological site reports I read, the groundwater table (of the uppermost groundwater layer) always followed the morphology of the surface.

248,Biogenic origin of authigenic zeolites,"Bohrmann et al. 1989 advanced the idea that the silicate phase from some clinoptilolites come from the diagenetic degradation of biogenic opal (from radiolarians in that case but presumably also other siliceous microfossils).    If this hypothesis is still regarded as valid, is clinoptilolite the only kind of authigenic zeolite that can be traced to biogenic opal?  Has any work been done in that domain since this paper?

250,"Is the Grand Canyon the ""greatest"" canyon in the world?","The Grand Canyon is nearly 446 km (300 miles) long, 29 km (18 miles) wide, and over 1,8 km (1 mile) deep. To the best of my knowledge, there is no other canyon of comparable size in the world.  Is this in fact the case? If no, which canyons are larger? If yes, what made the Grand Canyon so much larger than others? What is, perhaps, a ""fusion"" of several other, smaller canyons linked by the Colorado River? Were the rock formations surrounding the Grand Canyon in some ways more ""continuous"" than others in the world? Were there at one time other canyons of comparable size elsewhere in the world that somehow got broken up into smaller entities? "

252,Placement of crustal thickness estimation from 1D inversion of surface wave dispersion curves,"Seismic surface waves present a characteristic dispersion behavior in which different frequencies travel at different speeds. This characteristic dispersion curve depends on the shear and compressional wave velocity structure of the crust and upper mantle. These physical parameters can be estimated using some inversion method that can be 1D, 2D, or even 3D. 1D inversions are very common for their relative simplicity and speed. However, the dispersion is usually measured between two stations.   So my question is, where do we ""place"" the resulting 1D estimated model? Is it the average of the crust between the stations (I did the math for this once long ago and it seems that it is not, but I'm not sure)? Or is there no way to place the estimate at a single point?

I've seen many plots that focus on specific heights on the 500 mb surface to gauge forecast accuracy, but that is all I'm familiar with.   How is model skill and forecast correctness measured?  Is it an overall global skill, or are various skills in specific regions of the globe also evaluated?  Are these validation results freely available on the internet? "

257,Correlating the Caledonian and Appalachian Orogenies,"The Caledonian mountains and Appalachian mountains are recognised to be the roots of the same Palaeozoic orogenic belt. This has since been split in two with the opening of the Atlantic.  On the European side, two orogenies are recognised: the Caledonian and Variscan (or Hercynian). On the American side the Appalachians are also recognised to be made up of multiple orogenies, eg. the Taconic and Allegheny.  A parallel could be drawn with the present day Tethyan Belt - especially the Mediterranean length. Here we don't see one big mountain building episode but many as each sub-continent or large island is accreted onto Europe. Similarly, Pangaea was not formed in one big orogeny but multiple as sub-continents such as Avalonia were accreted on to what is now North America.  Can each orogenic episode on the European side be correlated with an orogenic episode on the North American side? I.e. having two names for the same orogeny?  Are correlations possible at a finer scale? For example the Caledonides in Scotland are marked by some very prominent ancient faults (Great Glen, Moine, and Highland Boundary Faults). The Appalachians also have some large fault systems. Can any of these be correlated across the Atlantic? Can specific sedimentary sequences be correlated? (I realise that big picture sequences in the late Palaeozoic are broadly similar, e.g. Permian Aeolian Sandstones, Carboniferous Deltaics &amp; Coal, etc) "

259,What Happens When India Stops Hitting Asia,"For the past 50 million years, India has been colliding with mainland Asia, creating the Himalayan mountain range.  It's not an issue of if the Himalayas would stop rising, but when.  Articles of the past months have said that the range would stop rising in the best guess of 20 million years, not because of gravity, but because of how the mantle influences the movements of the landmasses.  But what the articles never say is what would happen when the Himalayas stop rising in the distant future.  How would the topography of Asia be affected?  How would Tibet react? "
260,How is known that the Earth core is solid?,"As I know, the Earth core is solid. This is known, because it conducts also transverse waves, while liquids conduct only longitudinal waves.  But, how was it found? The inner core is in the outer core, which is liquid. Thus, it is inpermeable for the transverse waves.  So, any transverse wave originating in the crust, shouldn't be able to reach the core and vice versa.  How could it been measured? "
261,What divides Hydrological Unit Code areas of the same level?,"I'm trying to better understand the Hydrological Unit Code (HUC) system of the United States. I understand the basic hierarchy of it (HUC4, 6, 8, 12) and watersheds/drainage areas. Here's what I want to clarify:  A group of HUC8s can be within a single HUC6, because each HUC8 ultimately drains to the pour point of their parent HUC6. What separates one HUC8 from another HUC8 downstream of it, both within the same parent Hydrologic Unit? I suspect the answer isn't the natural drainage area, because the downstream HUC8 would contain the upstream HUC8 in its natural drainage area - that's based on me thinking that as you shift the discharge point you're examining further downstream, the drainage area you're examining increases.  The most concise, relevant explanation I've come across is from the USEPA's EnviroAtlas Data Fact Sheet on the subject:     A   watershed  is    defined  as  the   geographic  a   rea  within  the    boundary   of   a   drainage   divide.   Watershed   boundaries    follow  the  highest  ridgeline  around  the  stream    drainage    area;    the  bottom    of  the  watershed  or  the  pour  point  is  the   lowest point of the land    area    where water flows out of the    watershed.   Hydrologic   unit   boundaries   do   not   always    surround    a    complete    watershed    but    may    delineate    truncated portions of a larger watershed   —   for example, the    mid-stem   of   a   larger   stream   or   river   along   with   the    tributaries   in  that  area.    Hydrologic  units  are    generally    synonymous   with   watersheds   when   their   boundaries    include  all  the  source  area  contributing  surface  water  to   a    single   defined   outlet   point.   This   distinction   between    watersheds and HUCs is important in the context of water    resources   data   analysis   and   water   quality   monitoring,    because  the  area  contributing  to  the  downstream  outlet    point in a single HUC may extend beyond its boundaries in    an  upstream  direction  to  include  a  number  of  other  sub-basin HUCs.   This still does not clarify exactly what separates one HUCx from another HUCx downstream of it, both within the same parent HUC? "
262,How to determine associated USGS stream gauges with a watershed HUC?,"USGS stream gauges have an associated drainage area, but the associated hydrologic unit listed by USGS is often different than the actual drainage area. How can one determine what hydrologic unit corresponds exactly with the drainage area of a stream gauge, and where applicable, vice versa (...what stream gauge corresponds exactly with a hydrologic unit that is a watershed)? I expect that this cannot be done for all HUC levels, but that it should be doable for certain HUC levels which are almost always actual drainage basins (e.g. HUC12s are almost always true watersheds with an average area of 40 square miles, so won't some of those line up with USGS gages of similar sized basins?)    To demonstrate the problem: let's say I'm trying to examine the properties of a watershed - a HUC12 - and want to see stream gauge data for it. To find stream gauge data, I'd go to the USGS Water Resources site and hone in on the area of the watershed of interest - the issue is that many gauges have a Hydrologic Unit 8 listed on the gauge's Summary Information page that is different from the drainage area listed on that same page and from the watershed delineation one would get if starting with a DEM and the gauge's coordinates in GIS. That brings me back to my question in bold above - any guidance or clarification on finding paired USGS stream gauges and HUC's that are drainage areas (since not all hydrologic units represent actual watersheds that can be gauged)?

264,How does the interaction between Subtropical Westerly Jet Stream and Himalayas causes subsidence of air?,"While reading the topic ""Monsoon"" in Aguado's Understanding Weather and Climate, I read this line      During winters... Air flows down the southern slope of the Himalayan   Mountains due to more rapid cooling over land than over   the Indian Ocean. This flow is enhanced by a portion of the   jet stream flowing along the southern flank of the mountain   range. Interactions between the jet stream and mountains   cause convergence in the upper troposphere, which leads to   sinking air that gets forced southward.   It is talking about the Subtropical Westerly Jet Stream's southern branch flowing along the southern Himalayas, but how does it cause convergence in upper troposphere? And how the convergence in upper troposphere leads to sinking of air?  In the same topic, after few lines, while explaining the situation in summer season it is mentioned that      The situation changes abruptly during late spring or early   summer....Aloft is   an easterly jet stream, with often divergent motion promoting   uplift.   Why this Easterly jet stream has divergent motion, how it differs from the SubTropical Westerly Jet Stream in this characteristic? And again the same question, how does divergent motion in upper troposphere cause uplift?   Since I couldn't find anything useful related to Jet Streams and convergence/divergence it would be helpful if someone could provide exact mechanism.  "
265,Why is WRF most often configured at 3:1 nesting ratio?,"In WRF application, nested domain has always been used for weather/air quality modeling for the place of interest in a better resolution.

271,NCEP reanalysis model levels,"ECMWF Model Levels  The above link describes the coefficients used to define the ECMWF model levels in pressure in order to compute geopotential height. Is there a similar data for NCEP reanalysis model or is the data already on pressure levels in which case the above step is not required ? To be precise I am looking for the identical data for the T62 NCEP reanalysis data(2.5 x 2.5). The NCEP reanalysis model uses the sigma vertical coordinate. The same question can be rephrased in the following manner  1) What are the values of the sigma levels and where can they be downloaded? For e.g. if the sigma level is 0.995 and the surface pressure is 1000 hPa then the pressure at the sigma level 0.995 is 995 hPa.  2) Are the sigma levels of the NCEP reanalysis model comparable to the a and b coefficients of the ECMWF model ?  UPDATE  The hybrid vertical coordinate of UCAR Community Atmosphere Model(CAM 3.0) describes a similar equation to that of ECMWF and has explicit coefficients A and B as shown below  [tex]  where p is pressure, [tex] is surface pressure, [tex] is a specified constant reference pressure and A and B are coefficients that specify the coordinate being used and are defined only at the discrete model levels.   GOAL - I have code that uses ECMWF data as input to run a few calculations. I am looking to run the same code using NCEP renanalysis model data.

273,Waves on sandy beach separating differently-sized rocks?,"I recently went to a beach, and I noticed that the sand seemed to have a few distinct regions.  I'm wondering what would cause this, and how it works.  One region is the part of the beach which is kept wet by the waves, but is far enough away that most waves don't seem to reach all the way to the end of it.  This part consisted of small-grained, ""soft"" sand.  This region is followed by a region with a lot of small rocks (mostly the size of, say, someone's smallest toe).  This region was located a bit past (i.e.: further into the water) the lowest point the water tended to reach.  This size of the grains of sand of this region blends smoothly into the previous region, so they get progressively larger as you walk further out to the water.  The last region is another one of fine-grain sand, and it also had ripples in it (I'm assuming that this is just because of the waves, because I noticed that the waves picked up sand from the peaks of the ripples and pulled it back out to sea).  The first two distinct regions seem to be the result of some type of sorting mechanism induced by the wave.  If so, how does this work?  And why was there a second region of fine-grain sand after the coarse-grain region? "

This equation is very much similar to diffusion equation used normally to model groundwater flow in confined aquifer as defined below.[tex] where [tex] is thickness and [tex] is storativity of confined aqufier.  When I googled about Boussinest equation, it is noway similar to what I have presented above. My question is is 'linearized form of Boussinesq equation similar to diffusion equation in this case?

277,Timeline of Himalayas/Tibetan plateau formation,"Note: edited based on helpful comments.  In Walking with Cavemen, Robert Winston claims an African rainforest existed 8 mya, but by 4 mya it was gone. He attributes this to newly Himalayas-triggered Indian monsoons, which prevented rainfall from reaching Africa. However, it's my understanding that India collided with the rest of Asia circa 50 mya. So why did the monsoons take so long?  Multiple comments have noted that Winston should have credited the monsoons to the Tibetan plateau. Either way my assumption is that, until the mountains had been pushed up far enough, they didn't threaten the forest's rain supply. On a linear approximation, by 8 mya the Himalayas' mean height would be approximately 85% of its present value, which bounds the ""critical value"" of the altitude as a percentage of its current one. A similar calculation applies for the Tibetan case.  Why did the motion of India lead to a multi-stage mountain formation? How did the timing of these effects influence Africa? "

285,How does the estaurine turbidity maximum vary depending on the type of estuary?,"An estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) is the area of an estuary that has maximum values in suspended particles in the water column. My questions are   What are the main characteristics of the ETM? How does the ETM affect biological organisms? How do the characteristics of the ETM vary depending on the type of estuary (salt-wedged, well-mixed, partially mixed)?  "
286,Why is the temperature between the earth core and surface not distributed linearly?,"So I read somewhere that the inner core temperature of Earth might be as high as 7000 °C.  Depending on the composition of the different layers towards the surface, the temperature should decline until the surface temperature of the air, at about average 14 °C, is reached.  This does however not seem to be the case as the temperature at first gets colder if one starts digging?  How can this be explained?  And please excuse any naivety on my behalf as I´m no scientist. "
287,What are the different hardness scales?,"In school, I was acquainted with the Moh's hardness scale.  I wondered how malleability factors into this scale and was surprised to find there are many different hardness scales:  the Rockwell scale, the Leeb scale, the Vickers, the Meyer, and I'm sure others.  What are all the different hardness scales?  And, which ones are used in Earth Science? "
288,Are there measurements or calculations that suggest atmospheric ice plates would be horizontal to within 0.1 degrees?,"This question describes a recently released explanation for flashes of light seen at the sub-solar point above Earth from the DSCOVR satellite, which is located in a special orbit between the Earth and Sun at a distance of about 1.5 million kilometers from the Earth.   I won't reproduce the full question here. I'm asking about the discussion in the following paper about flat ice plates of order 100 microns in size at about 5,000 to 8,000 meters in altitude in thin clouds over land. Specifically the idea that areas that are tens of kilometers wide could contain plates that are all coplanar - parallel to the local Earth's surface and more importantly to each other, to within about 0.1 degrees.  While here is part of the discussion section of the paper, further explanation of the geometry of the satellite and Sun are in the linked question.  The discussion section of the very recent, on-line-available Terrestrial glint seen from deep space: oriented ice crystals detected from the Lagrangian point Alexander Marshak, Tamás Várnai and Alexander Kostinski, doi: 10.1002/2017GL073248 contains the following text:     Based on in-situ measurements of cirrus clouds, [Korolev et al., 2000; McFarquhar et al., 2002], tiny hexagonal platelets of ice, floating in air in nearly perfect horizontal alignment, are likely responsible for the glints observed by EPIC over land.  Because the EPIC instrument has a field of view of 0.62 degrees (see, [website]Question: Is this collective horizontal alignment a known effect at even 1 degree, much less 0.1 degrees? Has this ever been measured to be true over such large areas, or even calculated?   Although the result is preliminary and the discussion short, the authors suggest that this uniform horizontal alignment would not be an unusual occurrence at all. For example, later in the discussion:     Out of total 4106 images collected, 336 contain land-glint for the blue channel, which was chosen because it has the highest spatial resolution (to reduce the amount of data transmitted from DSCOVR, for all other channels four pixels are averaged onboard the spacecraft). Can one interpret this ratio 336/4106 = 8.2%? To exclude images with ocean at the location of possible glint, we divide the 8.2% by the land fraction in EPIC tropical band (1/4), yielding 32.8%. Hence, roughly one in three images with land in the center contains a glint from an ice cloud. This matches the fraction of Earth covered by ice clouds in tropics which is also about a third [King et al., 2013]. This agreement suggests that terrestrial glints seen from deep space supply efficient means of detecting cloud ice, reflecting at least a factor of 5-6 stronger that surrounding pixels and may substantially increase cloud albedo [Takano and Liou, 1989], relative to diffuse reflectance from randomly oriented ice particles. This is significant as cirrus clouds, composed mostly of aspherical particles, cover over 30% of the Earth surface and play a major role in the radiation budget [Stephens et al., 1990].    I'm interested if there are there any explanations for why this might happen. I know there is a phenomenon called a ""Sun pillar"" that involves reflection off of such ice plates in the atmosphere, and I don't quite understand how the pillar is tall vertically but not wide laterally, but that is perhaps a different question. However, it may none-the-less involve the same kind of ice plate. So I've added this image of ""Sun pillar crystals"" to help with the discussion. In the explanation for the bright spots seen from DSCOVR, the light is at normal incidence to the planes of the crystals instead of oblique incidence shown here.    above: ""Sun pillar crystals"" From here. The present question involves reflection at normal incidence, not oblique incidence shown here. "
289,"When calculating flood recurrence intervals, do you use annual instantaneous peak flows?","I would like to calculate the bankfull flow for a certain point on a river.  The recurrence interval of bankfull flow varies for different rivers, but is typically always found to be between 1 and 2 years.    Let's imagine I decide to set the recurrence interval at 1.67 years, which gives me an exceedance probability of approximately 60% ([tex]).    Supposing I have a stream gage at the point I am interested in estimating bankfull flow for, and I recorded hourly discharge values for 20 years, which set of values should I use to calculate the recurrence interval? Should I determine the value associated with this exceedance probability using all hourly flows, the daily mean flows, the annual high flows (what the USGS calls instantaneous peak flows), or some other subset of values? "
290,Did Jupiter really make Earth (in)habitable?,"A new study by Batygyin and Laughlin suggest that a Jupiter migration toward the inner region of the Solar System during the early stages of system formation cleared the habitable region (Goldilocks zone) around the Sun from early planets that too large and with atmospheres too dense to support life. As they put it:     Jupiter migrates inward from a > 5 astronomical units (AU) to a ≈ 1.5 AU before reversing direction, can explain the low overall mass of the Solar System’s terrestrial planets.   They propose this scenario to explain the differences between the Solar System and other planetary systems in which large planets are found in the proximity of the starts.  Among the many questions I have: How is it physically possible for such a migration to occur? Is there a way to verify the migration hypothesis with observations? How different would have been the hypothetical planets in the area currently occupied by Earth? If such a migration toward the Sun started, what prevented Jupiter from continuing inward and collapsing with the Sun? Is it possible for such a migration to occur again? "
291,Why does Australia have extensive uranium ore deposits?,"According to the World Nuclear Energy page about Australia's uranium deposits, the continent's     known uranium resources are the world's largest – 31% of the world total.    Of which     In 2013 Australia produced 7488 tonnes of U3O8. It is the   world's third-ranking producer, behind Kazakhstan and Canada.    The deposits are found across the Australian continent, within different geological regions of different ages (e.g. most of the deposits in the eastern part of the continent are considerably younger than those in the west).  The main known deposits are shown in the map below, by Geoscience Australia:    Why does Australia have extensive uranium ore deposits?  Related to this question is the recent question Did an impact crater influence the formation of uranium deposits in South Australia, and related questions and answers, Why is there Uranium in Earth's Crust? and How much Uranium is there in the Earth's Crust? - this question is specific to the relatively high abundance of uranium occurring in the Australian landmass.

292,Why do greenhouse gases affect ocean temperature so much?,"As I understand it, greenhouse gases absorb infrared radiation from the sun.  Much of that radiation would otherwise continue and be absorbed on the planet surface in the ocean or on land.  If CO2 increases are causing the oceans to warm, does that happen mainly by convection?  It's counter intuitive to me to think about air convection having that much effect on ocean temperatures.  Why wouldn't greenhouse gases' soaking up of infrared instead cool the oceans, that would otherwise be warmed by the radiation? "
293,Thermohaline Circulation in the Oceans,"I'm slightly confused by how thermohaline circulation works in the Earth's oceans. Is it different  for surface water as opposed to deep water? I thought that warm water from the equator is transported to the poles, cools down, and then returns to lower latitudes. Is my thinking incorrect? Isn't water denser near the equator because of higher salinity? How does this impact the ocean circulation?   Thanks! "

295,Is there anywhere on Earth *without* a rain shadow where we would otherwise expect one?,"My understanding of rain shadows is that they occur in a region where year-round wind direction is the same (or nearly so), and there's a mountain range close by, such that the mountains block moisture from the lee side. This would imply a desert on the lee side.  Is there anywhere on Earth where the above two conditions are met, yet no rain shadow is produced? If so, what are the complex reasons for it?  The only thing I can think of is maybe there's a lake or big river on the other side of the mountain, serving as a source of moisture for the atmosphere as it evaporates and thus allowing rain. But are there other reasons? It would also be helpful if anyone could explain more details of the rain shadow, like how tall do mountains need to be before the shadow takes effect, and how and why deserts still experience a huge thunderstorm every 1 to 3 years. "
296,A faster way to measure the rock magnetic S-ratio?,"The S-ratio is commonly used in rock magnetic and enviromagnetic studies to quantify the relative abundances of minerals with high and low remanent coercivities. As most frequently defined (e.g. by Evans and Heller, 2003), it is calculated as −IRM−300mT / SIRM, where SIRM is the saturation remanence magnetization, and IRM−300mT is the remaining magnetization after applying a 300mT reverse field to a saturated sample. In my experience, the usual procedure for determining the S-ratio on a discrete sample is:   Apply a saturating field with a pulse magnetizer (or, at least, apply the strongest field possible with the equipment). Measure the saturation magnetization in a magnetometer. Apply the 300mT reverse field with the pulse magnetizer. Measure the new magnetization in the magnetometer.   On a large set of samples, things can be made quicker by working in batches and using an automated sample handling system, but it's still necessary to make two trips to the pulse magnetizer and two trips to the magnetometer. It struck me recently that, with a cryomagnetometer capable of measuring all three axes of magnetization simultaneously, a faster and more convenient procedure should be possible:   Apply the saturating field along (say) the x axis of the sample. Apply the 300mT field along an orthogonal axis -- the y axis, say. Measure the total magnetization vector in a 3-axis magnetometer. Calculate the SIRM as the sum of the magnetizations along the x and y axes, and IRM−300mT as the magnetization along the y axis.   In fact, a similar (but far more involved) technique is already commonly applied: the triaxial IRM and thermal demagnetization protocol of Lowrie (1990), which involves applying decreasing IRMs along three orthogonal axes. In Lowrie's technique, however, there is no mention of calculating the SIRM as the sum of the orthogonal components.  Is anyone already using this technique? Are there any obvious pitfalls I've missed? I am tempted to try it the next time I need to determine an S-ratio, after a pilot study to confirm that the SIRMs are additive in the way I assume.

297,Using sodium chloride load as a point source pollutant variable in SWAT model?,"I'm currently working with the Soil &amp; Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). My task is to model the loading of sodium chloride into streams.     One approach I would like to take is to use the point source rechour.dat file command. The file can contain several variables regarding pollutant load. For example:   ORGPHR is the organic P loading kg/hr, NO3HR is NO3 loading kg/hr, DISOXHR is O2 loading kg/hr, etc...      But interestingly enough there is no NaCl loading variable!   Am I able to customize a new variable explicitly NaCl, or will I have to use CMTl1HR which is a heavy metal loading kg/hr?  I was also thinking I could customize a soil type with high salinity.   To you hydrologists out there: what are my options? "
298,What would the equilibrium temperature be at the poles in a world without seasonality?,"Inspired by: How does Antarctica stay frozen?  If the Earth was in a fixed solstice state - northern winter and southern summer (e.g. the axis obliquity rotated with the Earth's orbit), what  would the equilibrium temperature be at each pole? Assume daily cycle and convection and so on operate as usual, just that it's permanent midnight in the Arctic, and permanent midday in the Antarctic.  Bonus questions: Would the equilibrium temperatures be significantly different if it was northern summer and southern winter (e.g. would land masses and orography have much effect, relative to the solar imbalance)?

So what happened to the water -- was it recycled to ecosystem?  Secondary question: because of the severe drought, California has imposed restrictions on water usage by agriculture. I'm wondering if most of this water ends up as ground water or if it vaporizes up into the atmosphere and blows with the winds... or there's no telling really where it goes? "

301,Can the process of subduction flatten the shape of a subducting plate relative to the plate it's going under?,"There's something I’m still not quite getting about why island arcs are arcs. In the examples I’ve seen, the subducting plate is compared to a knife slicing across the surface of an orange - but it makes sense for the slice of the orange to be an arc, because the knife is a flat plane while the orange is a sphere.  [website]Subducting plates, on the other hand, are parts of a spheroid ""slicing into"" another part of the same spheroid. I’m assuming that because subducting plates are part of the Earth’s crust, they must also be curved, unlike the knife.   So it seems that if the knife is creating an arc because it's flat relative to the shape of the orange, something must flatten the subducting plate so that it's flatter relative to the plate it subducts under. Does the compressing force of the upper plate on the subducting plate flatten it relative to the shape of the upper plate? "
302,Required temperature difference between land and sea for sea breeze,What is the required temperature difference between the sea and the land in order to create a sea breeze?

303,Why is the skyline hazy on the Greek islands?,"I've recently been to Crete, Santorini and am currently on Ios. I've noticed that there is a hazy-ness when I look out on the sea: there's no definitive line where sky meets sea, they just blur together. I feel like I'm in the Truman Show or Stephen King's Dome.   The sky is so hazy that when the sun sets the last I see is the sun just disappearing into the haze instead of ""dropping"" below the horizon like I am used to seeing on Lake Superior.   Is this phenomenon due to a high amount water molecules (it's April) in the air, that are too think for the sun to penetrate through as it sets? Or is it something else?  "
304,WRF I/O: Can any variable be output into the wrfout file-stream?,"This question is related to the WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) Model  I read somewhere that a variable one wants to output, needs to be defined as state variable in the Registry like this (defines the variable QFX, which already is in the output file)  state    real  QFX              ij      misc        1         -      rh       ""QFX""                   ""UPWARD MOISTURE FLUX AT THE SURFACE""          ""kg m-2 s-1""         where ""h"" in ""rh"" stands for ""history"", i.e. the output in the wrfout_d01_.... NETCDF standard output history files.  Can I add any variable as state variable?  For example EETA (transpiration), which is defined in the module_sf_ruclsm. (at the physics layer). Gill WRF I/O states ""Local variables inside of physics packages are not controlled by the Registry"". So do I need to initialize EETA to the variables in module_surface_driver.F?

307,How sustainable is timber housing?,"Recently I watch a video on which they made a pretty impressively large building complex for housing out of timber. And they were saying that timber is sustainable compared to concrete and such.  From the outset this seems pretty straight forward, trees grow back so long you don't do anything terrible to the ground the grow on (like salt it or build a shopping mall), and concretes components (ie. the stones and calcium oxide. the water does evaporate) does not. However thinking a little harder I know that plants need phosphorous to grow, and currently there is a shortage of of phosphorous. If we are using tress to build our skyscrapers, wouldn't they be locking away our supply of phosphorous for our food and the world's ecosystem? Therefore, is using timber really that sustainable?  that all said it'll probably be better than concrete and steel, and nothing probably perfectly sustainable. "
308,Godfrey's island rule (stream function in multiply connected domains),"In this paper, the authors detail the methods to calculate the stream function [tex] from velocity data in the case of the global ocean (i.e., multiply connected domains).  The general idea is to use velocity to calculate the vorticity [tex] and, with that, calculate the stream function by solving the Poisson equation: [tex] The difficulty of the problem is to specify the boundary conditions. As we do not want a flow across the boundary, we require [tex] on all the coastlines, with the value of [tex] being a constant to be determined for each different coastline (i.e., each island/continent).  To do this one can use the so-called Godfrey's islands rule that follows from requiring that the circulation around each island should be constant. At the end of the day, one should solve a system of equations that relate the [tex] and the derivatives of [tex] normal to the coastlines (eq. 19 in the paper):  [tex]  BUT  Shouldn't the normal derivative be zero in order to have no-flow?  If yes, probably not, but if yes, this would imply that all the [tex] would be zero and one could avoid to solve the system altogether...  What am I missing?    Side questions:  1- How can one calculate the normal derivative with numerical data when the coastline is ""segmented"" and the normal vector not well defined? For example in this case:     ____ __|xxxx|___ xxxxxxxxxxx   2- Does anyone know of a freely-available code for solving this problem? I am currently struggling with the normal derivatives... "
309,Winter in the Northern Hemisphere in July? Can anyone explain it?,"The July 2007 issue of the National Geographic Magazine dedicates several pages to ""Climate Change"" and ""Global Warming"".  The author explains in detail the Earth's movements and how they provoke great climate shifts.  ""Wobble"" is one of the four movements listed and is described as follows:        ""Earth slowly wobbles like a top as it spins on its axis, which shifts back and forth about every 20,000 years. The result: About 11,000 years from now, winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere will be in July.      Although I know exactly what a top is, and how it spins, I find it hard to understand how wobbling is expected to bring about that forecast.   Can anyone explain more didatically how such a shift is expected to happen? How the wobble movement is doing it? Is such an astronomic phenomenon accepted by scientists unquestionably? If winter is expected to be in July 11,000 years from now and such a shift is under way right now, does it mean that winter in the NH is slowly moving towards July and that, perhaps, 5,000 years from now winter solstice will be in March?    Thank you. "

312,Help identify glowing stone with scarab carving,"I found almost no information from searching Google, Someone mentioned it might be Fluorite. I simply don't know where else to look for an answer and so I am asking you.  When I was a child, my parents traveled with me to Egypt and there, they bought me a little scarab beetle carved of some stone, about 5 cm long, 2 cm width and height. The stone is whitish and translucent and glows green in the dark (for some time). I only remember that it might (just a speculation) have been in Luxor in an Alabaster workshop. But, according to online sources, Alabaster is not supposed to glow in dark, so what is it then? Can you please tell me?

313,Why does the Earth have six atmospheric bands?,I know that the earth has atmospheric banding like the gas giants.  What I want to know is why six in specific? What physical processes or equations determine the number of atmospheric bands on a planet with an atmosphere?  Also I'm not sure if the intertropical convergence zone counts as a 'band'. If it does the same question holds for why we have seven bands.  NOTES:  This is a follow up to  [website]And has been reposted due to comment request from here  [website]

316,"Haean, South Korea: is it of volcanic or meteor impact origin?","This is a layman's question. While looking for something I read in the news today, I stumbled upon the Haean region in South Korea (38°17'15.96""N, 128° 7'57.18""E) in Google Earth.  To me it looks either like a caldera or like a meteor impact site. Does anyone know from available facts whether one or the other is true? Wikipedia doesn't say anything about it. Is there any way to tell from the geometric features alone, or does it require taking soil samples from the site?  Interestingly there are some more crater-like features in South Korea (e.g.  37°49'5.12""N, 127° 3'12.53""E, almost perfect circular shape). Can this be considered a result of the proximity of the pacific ring of fire, or is it just too far away? "
317,"Before the Great Oxygenation Event, where was the oxygen?","Today, the oxygen in the atmosphere is about 1018 kg. The estimated carbon biomass of the earth is about 4×1015. Less than 0.5%.  Estimated fossil fuels are around 5 times as much as existing carbon biomass. If these estimates are appropriate, then probably before the oxygen was released it was not locked up in carbon compounds.  Oxygen could have been extracted from inorganic stuff and cycled through the biomass.   Which reduced minerals were left behind? Not silicates and carbonates. Little magnetite crystals?   Maybe there was more SiO4 before (things like olivine), and living things tended to produce silicates with less oxygen (things like kaolin)? There isn't a whole lot of silica dissolved in seawater at any one time, but there's a whole lot of silica available and it could add up eventually. Silicates with more oxygen weathered away, and silicates with less oxygen were deposited?  Maybe there's so much free oxygen today because some H2 got produced, and it rose right out of the atmosphere and got swept away. So there's less water and more oxygen than there used to be.  Maybe the biomass estimates, and the fossil fuel estimates, don't actually tell us about the carbon, and there is lots of reduced carbon elsewhere.  I'm speculating, does anybody have good answers? "
318,Are there any flights that fly east both from origin to destination and from destination to origin?,"Flying east is faster so I expect that if the destination are on opposite points or closer, that the flights between them always be to the east.

319,What is meant by intraplate volcanism?,"I am having massive confusion on whether intraplate volcanism refers to volcanism occurring at plate boundaries or away from plate boundaries (such as formation of ocean island basalts), or perhaps both?  Also, are mid-oceanic ridges related to intraplate volcanism? "
320,Is there an approximate rate for water temperature by depth that could be modeled simply?,"I know that there are a couple of questions covering latitude and longitude for water temperature, but overall I'm more interested in the rate of temperature change by depth.  Thought Process: Baseline geothermal gradient is defined as the rate of increasing temperature with respect to increasing depth in the Earth's interior, and approximated at about 25–30 °C/km (72-87 °F/mi) of depth near the surface in most of the world. That's maybe, what, approx. 1°F/75 ft, barring circumstance and variables unknown.  Question: Is there a similar approximate rate by which the temperatures of various depths of water can be estimated, allowing for the same acknowledgement that it's an approximation without context? Or are thermoclines so varied that such an estimated rate cannot be generalized? "
321,How much oil was consumed worldwide since it was started to use massively in the mid 19th century?,"According to this article from 2015 How much oil is left on Earth  1.5 trillion barrels of crude oil reserves were left in the world by end 2015  But how much oil was already consumed worldwide since it was started to use massively in the mid 19th century?

322,Which percentage of $\text{CO}_2$ emissions are human made emissions?,"I was watching a science/myth Youtube channel (science mixed with a lot of speculative/fantasy content) with 2M+ followers and the Youtuber said volcano made emissions were higher than human made emissions. Now, I thought this was wrong and apparently some figures I saw in articles showed this was wrong, but then, I found this article  Skeptical - Human CO2 smaller than natural emissions     Although our output of 29 gigatons of CO2 is tiny compared to the 750   gigatons moving through the carbon cycle each year, it adds up because   the land and ocean cannot absorb all of the extra CO2.   So this article seems to be stating than in general natural emissions (not only volcano emissions) are indeed higher than human made emissions but human made emission are really bad anyway because they can't be absorbed and break the natural balance.   So now I really don't know if they are higher or lower. Then my question is , which percentage of CO2 emissions are human made emissions? and how volcano only natural emissions compare with human made emissions? "
323,How to determine (lost) surface (km²) of a country when both population and population density have changed?,"I am not sure if the question suits in this stack board, but I give it a try.  Let's assume there is a country with a population of 327 million people and a surface of 9.6 million km², resulting in 34 inhabitants per km².   Now, let's say we have a fictive war scenario, in which the country loses and has to give up land to the victors. The population sunk to 100 million people and 10 inhabitants per km² (still assuming that surface was given to victors, thus the country now has a smaller surface!!). How would I calculate the new surface with these two (now changed) variables or would I need more data?  My question now is:   Is it still possible to determine the new surface of the country when both population and population density changed?   I tried many ways to accomplish that, but I really have no idea how to approach it. Maybe it's possible with a system of linear equations? I have no idea. "

326,How to control output precision when running WRF?,"I am very new in this area and wondering if anyone can answer my following questions:  I am running WRF (4.0.3, ideal) to study rounding and truncation. I use the NCL (6.5.0) print command to access variable values in the WRF output file.   I have noticed that some variables have greater precision than others. Is there a way to change the level of precision for individual variables? I have been using em_b_wave and ideal.exe to initialize the WRF model. The values and variables in the output file are the same no matter how many MPI tasks I use. Why? Is WRF output exactly the same when using a single MPI task vs. using more than one MPI task? I assume there might be slight differences in rounding and truncation when using different number of processors. And at the end, I am not sure if the way that I am reading the values and variables from the output files which are binary are correct or not. I am using some NCL scripts now, but have no idea if that is the right way to read the binary output files ...   I would appreciate any help.  Thank you, Sara  "
327,Where can I find a list of snow fall recording stations in my zip code?,"Where can I find the locations on snow fall recording stations in a particular United States county or zip code? Is there a way that I can find an hour by hour recent history of snow fall? Hour by hour for the last 7 days would be interesting but even the last 24 hours would be very helpful. I need to to know where and when to dispatch crews to remove snow from office and apartment buildings, often in the middle of the night when I don't have eyes on the ground.  I may have to resort to installing web cams so I can personally review the conditions remotely.  The lake level stations are so accurate and easily accessible, I thought they might have sometime for precipitation as well.  I would prefer reports in inches of precipitation rather than inches of snow, but either would work. I find the former to be more accurate for my needs. It's the amount of water that needs to me moved that matters, no matter if it is densely packed or loosely packed.  "
328,What would be a reasonable set of thresholds for flood severity classes?,"When working with extreme hydro-meteorological events, flood in particular, it is common procedure to classify each event by its return period/recurrence interval. This probabilistic measure has the quality to provide a standard and homogeneous measure of the different events that eventually happened in diverse geographical areas, given their relative frequency. So, a 100-year flood is a potentially devastating event both for a flood prone area, and for an area where flood events are extremely rare.  My problem is now how to set a reasonable threshold to group events characterized by a ""similar"" return period. For instance, let's assume I want to set three classes: mild, middle, and severe flood events, what would be a reasonable return period cut? Is there any similar procedure for structural engineering/water infrastructure design? It would be lovely if you could also provide some references justifying your choice. "
329,Why are pyroclastic flows ground-bound?,"This bugged me for a while:  Pyroclastic flows are fast (up to 700 km/h (430 mph) according to Wikipedia) and typically roll down the slopes of a volcano. E.g. here [website]Also according to Wikipedia, and other sources, they are hot, up to 1000 degrees Celsius, and consist of gasses.  This makes me wonder, why do those hot gasses not ascend up into the atmosphere? This is what hot air does, so there must be something very special about theses gasses.  Now, I know that C02 and CO are heavier than air, but at 1000 degrees? "
330,Signatures of acid rain at KT boundary,"I read in Walter Alvarez' book T. Rex and the Crater of Doom that the Earth's collision with the large meteor leading to the K-T extinction catalyzed the reaction of atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen molecules to form nitric oxide, which in turn formed highly corrosive nitric acid when combined with water. In addition the impact is thought to have volatilized huge amounts of sulfur contained in anhydrite, which in turn formed sulfuric acid.  This question refers to a thickness of  [tex] for the section where iridium could be detected in the K-T boundary, suggesting that the resolution may be too low to note the effects of acid rain following the collision.   Is there evidence in the geological record of the formation of these acid species thought to be associated with the collision, say from deposits and/or effects of the ensuing acid rain? "

333,What influences tide-height the most? Can I guess the height by looking on a globe?,"I hope that the question title is resonably clear: What are the most significant factors which influence the tide height? I'm aware of the following couple of them:   Sun-Earth-Moon relative position (higher tide when co-linear) Size of the land/peninsula/island (higher for larger lands I suppose?) Shape of the surrounding seafloor (Hawaii has low tide partly because it has no shelf)   However, I'm really curious as which are the most important amongst them? Or is it even possible to guess the tide height if I know the Lunar phase and I have a good globe with sea depth? "
334,Horizon letter for bedrock,"What is the official letter for the bedrock soil horizon? I know that the letters to represent the A, B, and C horizons are widespread, but the fourth layer (bedrock) is referred to with different names. Some call it the D-Horizon, some the R-Horizon, and some just say bedrock. Is there any standard or official term, and if so, what is it? "
335,Why does a subduction zone produce a serpentinization diapir rather than volcanism?,"The classic Troodos Ophiolite in Cyprus has been uplifted by a 'serpentinization event'. Upper mantle (peridotite) has been serpentinized creating a buoyant diapir. This has uplifted the ocean crust sufficiently for it to be thrust over continental crust (underlying continental crust has been inferred from gravitational surveys).  The last sentence of the abstract of ""Tertiary uplift history of the Troodos massif, Cyprus"", AHF Robertson says:     The dominant driving force may have involved the liberation of water   from a subduction zone dipping northward beneath Cyprus.   This makes sense - serpentinization is the alteration process of olivine -> serpentine in the presence of water. And, as we know, subduction slabs release fluids (primarily water) into the overlying mantle wedge.  These fluids usually promote partial melting leading to andesite arc volcanism. However, Cyprus has this big serpentinite diapir instead of volcanism. Why?  What causes the fluids from the subducting slab to occasionally result in serpentinization of the mantle wedge instead of partial melting? "
336,How does a meandering river form?,"I read this explanation about rivers:  ""As the river erodes laterally, to the right side then the left side, it forms large bends, and then horseshoe-like loops called meanders""   Why does the river erode laterally to the right side then the left side? Surely it would erode both sides at the same time and therefore the river would go in a straight line.   Could someone please explain more clearly how these meanders in rivers form? "

The problem here is that the uranium in the phosphate rock produces 226Ra (among other radionuclides) during its decay, and since 226Ra is an ""Alkalin Earth Metal"" (it's on the 2nd column of the periodic table), it can form radium sulphate and mimic calcium, leading to radioactive gypsum.  The point here is, why is the phosphate rock enrichened in uranium that can produce radium? Is there a trend for phosphate and uranium to accumulate together, and if so, what is the geochemical reason??  I have already found out that:     Sedimentary rock phosphates contain much higher concentrations of   potentially hazardous elements (As, Cd, Cr,Pb, Se and U)than   igneous rock phosphates. (1)      Phosphate rock varies considerably in content of U, Ra, and Th, depending   on the geographical area from which it was mined.

341,Why does aragonite form in one case and an acetate in another?,"If I add acetic acid to limestone, I can get calcium acetate crystals to grow but if I add acetic acid to dolomite, supposedly I can grow aragonite which is a form of calcium carbonate.   Why would I get crystals of an acetate in one instance and a carbonate in the other? And, what happens to the acetate ion and the magnesium when forming aragonite?  I know that aragonite can form instead of calcite because of something called ""magnesium poisoning"" but I still do not understand how any carbonate is formed when dolomite is immersed in acetic acid.

344,Deciphering NCDC data,"I need US monthly climate data for the years 1992-2012. It would be great to get down to a county level, but by state would be just fine. Every site that I go to inevitably kicks me to the NCDC, but I cannot make sense of their data.   For example: the .csv sample data for  GHCN Monthly Summaries  lists EMXT (extreme maximum temperature) for each month of 2010 in Petersburg, ND. July had an EMXT of 317. I've been through the documentation, but I can't figure out what that number is supposed to mean. I know it wasn't 317F or C in ND at any point. Did they add all the temps up? Was it around 10C every day of July 2010? But why would you do that? The .PDF data looks like actual temperatures, but I need a lot of data: .CSV is ideal; .PDF is really not useable for the amount of data I am going to manipulate.   What am I missing? Or is there another way to get this data?  "
345,Does within-canopy wind direction correlate with wind above the planetary bounday layer?,"Wind above the planetary boundary layer (PBL) tends to be fairly smooth and constant over short periods of time. Below the planetary boundary layer, the smoothness is broken by eddies caused by friction with the land surface. Below the canopy, wind is presumably even more turbulent, and much slower on average. I'm interested to know how the over-all effect of those eddies changes wind direction within the canopy.  How much do eddies between the PBL and the ground disperse wind direction? Is wind direction below the canopy still correlated with the wind direction above the PBL? And does wind speed follow a similar pattern? "
346,Climate on an Earth without an Axial Tilt,"The Premise  The Earth rotates on its own axis, which is tilted by about 23 degrees. I am imagining a situation where such an axial tilt does not exist.   From general reading, it appears the largest impact of removing an axial tilt would be on seasonal change, in the sense that there wouldn't be any changes whatsoever. Every latitudinal belt would have its own set season all year round, with some minimal changes depending on the earth's distance from the sun in its usual orbit (ranging basically from 91.4 million miles in January compared to 91.5 million miles in July - which is less than 1%).  The Question  What would be the implication on rain cycles if the Earth had no Axial Tilt? It appears to me that rain carrying clouds move to the dictates of wind blowing to an area with a different air pressure. If our planet had no axial tilt, the Equator would get extremely hot all year round, causing water to evaporate and move north or south towards cooler areas - at least that's my understanding.   What parts of earth would receive the most rainfall if such a change were to occur? "
347,Climate zone classification using the Holdridge method,"I have to classify the climate zones for Western Ghats using the Holdridge method. The classifiers are temperature, rainfall, elevation.

349,Why do we recycle paper?,"Recycling metal and some plastics makes complete sense to me. Why bury something in a landfill that you'll have to find and dig up more of later. What I don't get is why we recycle paper products, especially those created with plant matter.  My understanding is that the fossil fuels we use for energy were generated during the Carboniferous period by burying carbon rich plant matter in anoxic swamps. If we are causing climate change by reversing this effect, dumping tons of carbon back into the carbon cycle... why recycle paper, or other products created, necessarily, by pulling carbon from the atmosphere?   Wouldn't a more beneficial method of disposing of such waste be to find a method of isolating them from the effects of weathering and keeping the carbon they contain locked up as long as possible? "
350,Can zircons be analysed by the (U+Th)/He after being ablated for analysis of U-Pb?,"I have zircons that have been mounted in a resin block. They have been polished to approximately half way through the zircons (as is convention) and they have been ablated to attain the U-Pb or Pb-Pb ages. I am unfamiliar with the intricacies of the (U+Th)/He method. Can these zircons still be analysed for (U+Th)/He? Or would the ablation affect the results? Furthermore, would the zircons need to be extracted from the resin blocks? If so, what would be the best method of extraction? "

354,What keeps water from sinking into earth?,"I remember reading somewhere that there's evidence of water on Mars but it all sank into the Martian soil. So what prevents that happening on earth?  Some people say it's because the crust is not permeable to water, but that must be nonsense because of volcanic actions and earthquakes, there certainly will be cracks that allow water to flow through. So the only thing that prevents the water from sinking in is the temperature, right? "

357,Rain without clouds?,"Is it possible to have rain without visible clouds?  As far as I know, clouds are liquid water and eventually the liquid water in them falls down, producing rain. Therefore one would expect clouds before rain.  But is it theoretically possible to have rain when there aren't any visible clouds? Maybe if the concentration of liquid water in the air isn't too high it is possible. "

Shade the area of the land surface that lies above the coal seam.  How exactly do I work out how to draw the strike lines? The strike and dip is 115/10. What calculation do I use? Also, would the land surface above the coal seam be all the land to the north of it?  "
361,How does MSLP change with elevation? trying to interpolate MSLP,"My understanding of MSLP is that it is a normalized value for pressure at some location as if that location altitude was zero.  ""Thus, MSLP is not a function of elevation""  However, after inspecting few cases, I am beginning to question the previous statement.  Below is a screenshot from windy.tv for MSLP over the Himalayas from ECMWF with a high resolution of 9km:  [website]Two main characteristics are obvious:  1- MSLP changes steeply between two adjacent points just due to the difference in elevation.  2- MSLP over mountains seems to be a strong function of temperature (since it varies a lot over night and morning)  1) Are these two previous statement correct?  2) Can I normalize MSLP in terms of elevation?  To get more insight at what I am trying to figure out: I am trying to interpolate observational MSLP data; however, since MSLP is very high on mountains I am getting wrong results around those points. In other words my algorithm would assume that a large area around the station that is on top of a mountain has an MSLP of 1020 while in fact, just as you move away few kilometers MSLP changes very quickly to 1010 because of the elevation drop, so how can I fix that?  Important note:  Theses ""anomalies"" in MSLP can only be seen with high resolution models for example they can be seen in ECMWF and not in GFS  [website]"
362,Do volcanos really create fertile soil?,"I'm developing an ecology for a portion of my world that's geologically active and I remembered hearing that volcanic ash in soil makes it more fertile to agriculture.   After extensive googling I've found surprisingly little information about the subject, and nothing convincing.

If it is true, or partly true, what is the chemical process at work, and under what conditions is it the most effective? "
363,What causes this white coloration of the ground in Gilf-Kebir?,"It seems, these white blotches are reflective enough that they caused oversaturation of a spot of image taken from a satellite at the L1 lagrangian point (click to open at max resolution, the purple spot is squat in the middle of the picture).      Clear quartz crystals has been found nearby ( link ), but could it be this? Can quartz so clear and reflective appear in such abundance? Or is it some other cause?  (I thought it might be frost, which shows up on the desert in the mornings, but the photo taken from L1 places the point at peak of the summer with the Sun precisely in zenith above it; I doubt any frozen water could withstand that. Also, Wikimapia has some photos taken nearby with what looks like frost, but the daytime is obviously different). "

I need average flux values for every 3-hour.  Thanks for your inputs.  "
365,"If rocks are stones, what type of rock are gallstones?","From Wikipedia:     Rock or stone is a natural substance, a solid aggregate of one or more minerals or mineraloids. For example, granite, a common rock, is a combination of the minerals quartz, feldspar, and biotite. The Earth's outer solid layer, the lithosphere, is made of rock.   From Wikipedia page about gallstones:     A gallstone is a stone formed within the gallbladder out of bile components   So if rocks are stones, what type of rock are gallstones?   Igneous rock is formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. Sedimentary rocks are types of rock that are formed by the deposition and subsequent cementation of that material at the Earth's surface and within bodies of water.  Metamorphic rocks arise from the transformation of existing rock types, in a process called metamorphism   Gallstones don't fit into any of these categories so what type of rock is it? "
366,"Are there gases from the Earth useful to generate electricity besides ""natural gas""?","Natural gas:     ...is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane, but commonly including varying amounts of other higher alkanes, and sometimes a small percentage of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide, or helium.   I saw the graphic below in the BBC News article Trump climate: Challenges loom after Obama policies scrapped. It lists natural gas as the source of about 33% of the US electricity generation in 2015, but also lists ""Other gases"" as the source of less than 1%. Presumably it is a meaningful fraction of that 1% or else the BBC would not have included it. While the source of the data is listed as the US Energy Information Agency, the graphic itself was prepared by the BBC if I understand correctly.  Are thee other gases available from the Earth that could account for this fraction of 1%? I don't mean gases that are produced during an industrial refinement process, but perhaps gases that were simply separated. Just for example could it be natural propane? The same Wikipedia article mentions heavier hydrocarbons, but I don't understand if these are already present in the Earth and just being separated, or if they are produced primarily as reaction products.   EDIT: Based on comments, a substantially different source of gas that was chemically similar to natural gas would still be of interest. So just for example, methane from a bog should count in this case, since it does not involve many of the geological processes involved in the production of fossil fuels (e.g. the same timescales or temperatures).   "
367,"Photo of sprites in a clear dark sky, how is this possible?","    above x2: Photos by David Finlay, from here.  The BBC news article Rare 'sprites' photographed beside Southern Lights shows photographs by the Australian photographer David Finlay. They are remarkably clear and distinct, and set against a clear night sky filled with stars. (The two fuzzy blue blobs are the large and small Magellanic Clouds - dwarf galaxies in the local group.)  I had thought that sprites were challenging to photograph not only because they are dim and rare requiring a special low-light cooled-CCD camera and luck, but that one had to be almost directly above a thunderstorm. This is a view of an almost completely clear sky, from the ground with a normal camera.  Are the clouds and light in the distance at the bottom of the first image the source of these sprites? There is really that much difference in altitude between the sprite and the associated thunderstorm? "
368,Can we extrapolate wind speed data to higher altitudes?,"I have some data (GRIB layers) about wind components u and v, which I would like to use to estimate wind magnitude and direction.

If yes, how? which other variables should I consider that can bias this calculation?  Thanks a lot! "
369,Can ice caps reform if they disappear?,"Excuse my ignorance. I'm under the impression that there are various types of ice at the poles, but I don't know the difference or the significance of each type, so, in terms of whatever is actually melting in these areas as a result of climate change, is it possible that it could come back if greenhouse gas emissions were eliminated or something like that? Basically, I'm assuming that the ice caps are necessary in order to maintain the habitability of the planet for humans, so is there some sort of threshold of melting that would essentially count as a point of no return or is there always the possibility of seeing the ice caps return to safe levels? "
370,How are scatterometer observations standardised before being fed into reanalysis models?,"This very basic question occurred to me during a talk on reanalysis data sets. Often we know the observations produced by a particular instrument, say rain radar, are biased from one year to the next because of changes in how the instrument has been calibrated, or because methodologies for processing the raw data it produces have changed.   How is this dealt with in long reanalysis data sets like ERA-Interim? Are the observational data sets made as consistent as possible before being fed into the reanalyses model, or are biases somehow smoothed out through complex data-assimilation methods or something along those lines?      EDIT: To provide a specific example, how are scatterometer data sets incorporated into ERA-Interim when we know there are biases between them (for example Wu and Chen (2015))?   "
371,Are there datasets like the global land-ocean temperature index for land surface temperature only?,"I have no background in climate science, but I've become interested in explanations of the so-called ""global warming hiatus"" from 1998-2013. One explanation that people seem to think is convincing comes from Karl et al who, if I understand correctly, say that the apparent hiatus could actually be an artifact of changes the way we calculate sea-surface temperature -- specifically that during that period we moved from primarily boat-based temperature measurements to primarily buoy and Argo float measurements. Since boat measurements are systematically a bit warmer than buoy measurements, the gradual switchover looks like a slight cooling trend when in fact it's just a difference in measurement technique.  I wanted to assess this argument for myself as well as I could, so I thought, if Karl et al are correct, then we shouldn't see evidence of hiatus in land-based datasets then, right? So I went in search of a dataset like NASA's global land-ocean temperature index but constrained to land only. I have found some very granular LST datasets (like this), but I don't think I've got the expertise I'd need to turn them into a yearly global timeseries (e.g. should I just take a straight mean of all the datapoints? Should I be weighing by landmass or seasonality, etc?).  So my question is, does a high-level aggregated yearly mean LST dataset exist? If not, why not? And at a higher level, does my approach to investigating the Karl et al work make sense, and if so has someone who knows what they're doing already done it? "

377,"What is the ""global mean surface temperature change estimate"" an estimate of?","NASA publishes what it calls an ""estimate"" of the Earth's global mean surface temperature. Digging through papers I've been able to find some documentation of how these numbers are computed, but I have had a frustratingly hard time answering what seems to me a much more basic question: what is this ""estimate"" an estimate of? That is, what is the abstract conceptual quantity that we'd really like to know, if we could? Without that, I don't understand how we can evaluate how well, for instance, the methods they use to blend together data sources of different resolutions and reliabilities, since the definition wouldn't have any stronger ""correctness"" criterion than just ""this is how we put these numbers together"".  It seems to me that the conceptual quantity they're trying to measure is, for a given year:   Imagine gridding up the earth into equal-area grids and putting a thermometer in each one. For each thermometer, imagine taking the limit of the average reading as number of readings increases for a one-year timespan from midnight on Jan 1 to just before midnight on Dec 31 of the given year Now take the limit of the average of all those single-thermometer limits for every thermometer in your grid, as the size of the grid squares decreases.   But this is really just a guess as to what they're after -- I have skimmed over several papers on this subject and I haven't been able to find any discussion of this at all. Is this just something basic that climate researchers know that I'm missing? "
378,"When sea level rises, does the increased ocean area cause the earth to cool down somewhat?","When the sea level rises, more of the planet's area is watery and less of it is land.

The key bit of data we're after is the distance from elevation to either key saddle  or sea level to get a very rough outline of shape.  I'm not sure if such data exists or we would have to derive it from some topography database?  Would anyone have any ideas on how we might go about getting said data or access to free topographic data that we may be able to somehow match in?  I've attached the below artwork that inspired this project - while we wouldn't necessarily look to get all the shape types here, it would be nice to have some different natural shapes.

381,Rayleigh waves generation,"Good day,  I do not fully understand the physical mechanism of formation of Rayleigh waves at the free surface. While their derivation is quite clear and obey free-boundary conditions, it is not clear their physical mechanism.  Could you please correct me in my discussion. Incident P-wave can transform to reflected P and SV waves. When the angle of incidence of P wave reaches 2nd critical angle, both outgoing P and SV waves propagate along the surface forming Rayleigh wave. So, P-wave by itself can form Rayleigh wave. At the same time, incident SV wave can transform to reflected P and SV waves. When the angle of incidence of SV wave (again) reaches second critical angle - both outgoing P and SV waves propagate along the surface forming Rayleigh wave.  Can then Rayleigh wave be formed by interference of both incident P and SV waves on the free surface or Rayleigh waves are formed only separately by incident P or SV waves? Does it mean that right under the epicenter Rayleigh waves cannot form but at some distance from it in order to reach second critical angles?  Thank you "

387,How CO$_2$ warming effect stays overnight?,"Water vapor looses it energy at night (no sun, no UV) and this is deposited as dew.  Change of state requires a massive energy change, in general.  Is the greenhouse effect of CO[tex] not lost when it gets dark and there is no UV entering the Earth? If not how is the energy stored in the atmosphere by CO[tex]? None of the research I can find, even from the 1950's or 1960's, has addressed this.  I am a doubter, but I do see that CO[tex] has the ability to warm. Just can't see how this is maintained overnight since there are about 12 hours of darkness daily.  This seems to be the case with water vapor loosing energy daily or it would be 150 degrees (or more) in the South (USA) by July. I am a chemist with a strong thermodynamics background. Thanks. "

390,Cattle really contributing to Global warming?,"Let me be straight up. I'm a physicist, I've no doubt about climate change and the part we play in it.  I had been reading about cattle being one of the alleged main causes of climate change.  I get that they make methane, and we have a LOT of them, So I ran some numbers:  Roughly 93 million cattle in the United states in 2017 (some sources claim lower, but I'm going with the higher one).   Prior to humans killing the Buffalo off, there were approximately 50-100 million of them across the united states.  A quick Wiki search, estimates that buffalo (bison) produce significantly more methane than domestic cattle (though I don't know for sure that this is true).  These numbers seem to match up pretty well insofar as they're greenhouse gas contributions, so now I'm wondering if the argument is viable?  I know there were other herds around the world too, so I just found myself rather curious. Has anyone run the numbers thoroughly?    On the flip side, I could see the sheer number of humans being an issue, I'll try and run that later. "
391,What is the CO2 concentration by altitude and why?,Here is a measurement of CO2 concentration by altitude measured by aircraft:(from Pulsed airborne lidar measurements of atmospheric CO2 column absorption)    Is this the usual vertical structure of CO2?

394,DC component: Seismic inversion,"Multiple papers (for example, Limitations on impedance inversion of band-limited reflection data Gosh[2000]) and textbooks covering seismic inversion mention a necessary component of any seismic inversion: the DC (or zero frequency) component. For lack of a better question, what does a ""zero frequency"" component look like? Also, why is this considered a necessary component of any complete seismic inversion scheme?  "
395,What is the better way to deal the missing and negative cells of satellite snow cover data,"Daily and monthly MODIS snow cover L3 data has downloaded, next to deal with missing and negative cells.  Different types of interpolation are being used to fill the missing cells. I want to fill the missing cells with mean of 3 surrounding values but it is very hard because in some cases large portion of data is missing? I know to mask the NaN cell by using (nanmean) command and long term mean of same area can also be use.  Permafrost Presence/Absence Mapping of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Based on Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data but I am looking any possible way beside these.  What is the best way beside above mentioned two to deal the missing and negative cells of MODIS snow cover data?   Note; I am using matlab environment for this purpose. "
396,"Volcanic activity in Taiwan, ever in recorded history, much chance in the near future?","News of Hawaii has got me thinking...  I've lived in Taiwan for many years and hiked many kinds geologically interesting mountain and seashore rock formations, seen steaming, sulfury fumaroles, even ate my lunch in a (presumably long extinct) volcano crater.   From what I've learned from others, volcanism has a significant contribution to Taiwan's geology and geography.  But is this very old and no longer a factor?  Question: Is there any historical reference to volcanic activity in Taiwan? Is there much chance of it again in the near future?

397,Eruptive fissures in Hawaii associated with Kilauea; what are they? What is really happening?,"I hear news of ""eruptive lava fissures"" opening up in Hawaii, nine of them at last count. But I don't understand what these are really.  Are these existing, older lava tubes that are suddenly opening to the surface due to recent filling with new lava, or cracks that go through the crust to to deeper chambers of magma, or something else?  update: I've just seen a the video in the CBS News website's Kilauea volcano eruption: Seismic activity increases, earthquakes strike 5 days in a row (scroll down for this particular video). I wonder if there is a better or more technical visualization of the sources for the fissures somewhere?   "

After some research, I found out that atmospheric pressure affects the temperature of the surroundings. How does atmospheric pressure affect the surrounding temperature? "
399,Global warming versus nuclear half-lives,"What is (roughly) the half-life of the materials used/generated in a nuclear plant, if that plant goes into meltdown? Could the world bounce back from global warming in a shorter time period than that half-life? Even in a worst-case scenario, could full-scale global warming be a better outcome than a cascading series of nuclear power plant failures (due initially to a natural event such as an earthquake, or to deliberate attack, war, etc.)?

400,Calculating exoatmosphereic flux and figuring out amount of SW Earth will absorb at an albedo of 0.3?,"Am working through two problems which I am not sure if I am handling correctly.   Here they are:     a. If the Earth decreases its distance from the sun by 0.03   Astronomical Units (AU), what will be the resulting exoatmospheric   flux?   Recall that at present the exoatmospheric flux = 1,370 [tex]   My solution (use inverse square law):    Inverse-square law: [tex]  [tex]     b. Assuming   an  albedo  of  0.3, how much incoming shortwave energy will   the   Earth absorb on average in [tex]?   Recall    that    Energy  absorbed    =   [tex]   This confuses me, the difference between [tex] and [tex].  What's the differences between Watts per meter to the first and watts per meter squared? Not sure how to combine the two to make the math/metrics come out right.  Going off what I have for part a:  Energy absorbed = [tex] Energy absorbed = [tex] (is this in [tex] or [tex]?)  Thank you "
401,Why is lithium so unevenly distributed?,"According to the US Geological Survey, nearly all of the world's lithium reserves are in Chile/Argentina, China, and Australia. Why is this? Lithium seems to be mostly harvested from brine pools, so are these just the areas where lithium can be economically harvested, or does it represent an uneven distribution in Earth's crust? "
402,How much change has there been to the shape of plate boundaries over geological time?,"This is a question that has bothered me for many years.  As a new teacher I was asked this question by a 12 year old in our plate tectonics class.  I said I would go away and find out.  I would really appreciate some help!  I have some understanding of plate tectonics but I struggle with understanding how the plate boundaries have changed in terms of their actual spatial positions over long periods of time.  For example, what would the 'jigsaw pattern' of plates at the time of Pangea have looked like?  At plate margins, does the pressure of compression or expansion actually change the spatial position of the margin?  Anderson comments... ""The definition of a plate and a plate boundary is subjective. Things are constantly changing. It is improbable that there is a steady state or equilibrium configuration of plates because both ridges and trenches migrate and only a few of the 16 kinds of triple junctions are stable.""  This serves to confuse me further unfortunately.  I have no issues understanding how continents move around, it is the potential change to the size, shape, orientation and position of plates that baffles me!  This probably relates to the potential for new plate boundaries to be formed...and existing ones to close up.  Is this possible?  Sorry if this is an overly simple question.  If this is possible it could explain a lot.  A geologist friend told me that the East African Rift Valley is an example of a weakness in the crust that could turn into a plate margin.  If that's true that could explain a lot.  If new plates can form and existing ones disappear this would go a long way to solving my dilemma.  Any views would be much appreciated and I can then give my 12 year old pupil a decent answer! Many thanks all.  PS. Just about every geography text book out there suggests plate tectonics is a result of convection currents in the mantle.  Many teachers teach this because that's what they've been taught.  I appreciate the science has moved on and now involved slab-pull and several other potential forces!  Without making it too complex, what should we be teaching 12+ year olds? "
403,"What does 5,000,000 tonnes of CO2 look like?","Reading a news article Probe after Gorgon releases millions of tonnes of greenhouse gas, I am confused.  CO2 is a gas, right?  Gases are not very dense, right?  So what does 5MT of the stuff look like?  How big a tank do we need to hold it? "
404,"What evidence is there that plant evolutionary history ""dances to a different beat"" than that of animals?","   Floral transformations have been due to gradual replacement and   piecemeal, not mass extinction.

405,In what geological situations can I find gold?,I've heard that gold ore is often associated with quartz veins.  What geological processes enable gold particles to naturally cluster together like this? What characteristics/properties should I look out for on the surface of a rock that are likely to yield gold within it? Are there remote sensors that I use to detect the presence of gold in a rock? 
406,"What started the US Dust Bowl of the 1930s, and could it happen again?","Most of us know about the Dust Bowl: the huge storms of dirt and dust that swept across America in the 1930's. But what I'm wondering is...    What actually triggered the start of the Dust Bowl? Is it very likely that it will occur again?   I've often heard that it was the farmers plowing up to much soil, but that doesn't make any sense to me because we're definitely plowing up more soil now than we were then. "
407,Why does Earth's outer-core rotate in the opposite direction to the inner-core?,Is it true that Earth's outercore rotates in the opposite direction to Earth's inner-core?  Is there a plausible explanation for why this phenomenon occurs and what is the available evidence supporting this notion? 
408,Phase changes deep in planetary interiors and their implications for surface tectonics,"Earth's core mantle boundary represents a phase change from a solid (though convecting) mantle to a liquid Iron/Nickel core. This dramatic transition is likely the origin of the D"" boundary, as well as thermodynamic perturbations and deep mineral heterogeneities in the mantle, which cause tectonic features on Earth's surface.   It is well documented that Europa and Enceladus have subsurface oceans, which represents a phase change inside the satellite's interior. Is this phase change responsible for the chaos terrain  on Europa, the Tiger Stripes and volcanism on Enceladus? Or do these tectonic features originate from exterior forces, such as gravitational tides and bombardments from Jupiter/Saturn's magnetosphere?   "
409,Peak phosphorus - what are the sinks?,"The minable phosphorus reserves are limited. Where is the mined phosphoprus landing, what are the global phosphorus sinks?  I would assume that most phosphorus is used for fertilizer and ultimately ends up in the water (via consumption by plants, than animals or humans and then wastewater or faeces). The most likely candidate in water would be phosphate ([tex]). I would assume that phosphate is fixed in microorganisms and that those ultimatly form sediment and get mineralized. But this is a wild guess.  How does the phosphorus cycle actually work after phosphorus is used by humans and emitted into the environment? What are major processes, and in what forms is phosphorus mineralized? "
410,Barite and Acantharians,"Acantharians are planktonic protists (abundant in today oceans), sister-group to polycystine Radiolarians, that have the particularity of biomineralizing complex skeletons in strontium sulfate SrSO4 (i. e. celestine).  Those protists have no (as far as I know) fossil record for the good reason that celestine is soluble in seawater once the organism decayed.  However it has been speculated (e. g. Bernstein et al. 1992) that acantharian-derived celestine could be at the origin of the formation of Sr-rich barite.    What is the status of this hypothesis? If this is still considered true, is there a way to differentiate unambiguously acantharian-derived barite from other kind of barite?  This would of course have interesting paleontological implications.  Source: Bernstein, R. E., Byrne, R. H., Betzer, P. R., Greco, A. M., 1992.

411,How did tectonic plates originally come to form?,"Plate tectonics is a theory which describes Earth's lithosphere as being composed of distinct plates which are able to move atop of the underlying asthenosphere.  At plate boundaries, this movement can give rise to convergent boundaries where subduction may occur, divergent boundaries, where molten lava rises to fill the gaps between diverging plates, or sliding plates at transform boundaries.  While I understand why we have come to adopt this theory, what I am less clear about is why  Earth's lithosphere is composed of such distinct plates in the first place, and is it possible for existing plates to split into two distinct plates?  Is there a theory on how the Earth's plates were initially formed? "
412,Did global warming cause the extreme cold 2013-14 winter in North America?,"There have been some claims made (example) that global warming had something to do with why the 2013-2014 winter was so cold in the Midwest area of America.  If this is true then how did global warming make the winter so cold? Shouldn't it make the temperature rise in all parts of the world, during all seasons? "
413,Could earth's core lose its heat?,"Will all of the drilling and digging to use the earth's natural heat as geothermal energy be affecting Earth's core, causing it to cool down? If so, would it result in an ice age? If not, how does it retain its heat? "
414,(How long) would Earth's atmosphere last without a global magnetic field?,"The Earth's magnetic field provides an important protection against the solar wind (for example, see Wikipedia on Earth's magnetic field and references therein).  Mars may have lost its atmosphere because it did not retain such a magnetic field, although Venus does not have an intrinsic magnetic field either.  This raises the question: what will happen to Earth's atmosphere if the global magnetic field would disappear?  Would the solar wind blow it all away?  If so, how long would it take until only a small part (&lt;10 kPa sea level pressure) is left? "
415,Alternatives to Plant Functional Types as parametrisations in land surface models?,"Plant Functional Types (PFTs) are a discretisation of global vegetation types. They are used in land surface models to parametrise many values, including albedo, various photosynthesis parameters, and water use. These affect the resultant estimates of Net Ecosystem Exchange of carbon (NEE), and heat and radiation budgets, and what happens to soil moisture. However, Alton (2011) has showed that for some of these parametrised variables, there is no significant difference between many commonly used PFTs. This means that PFTs may, in some cases, be a less than optimal method of deciding how each land surface model grid cell should operate.  Are there any alternative parametrisations of the global land surface that could provide more, or better information to land surface models? Perhaps based on soil types, or even statistical parametrisations (like something PCA based)? If so, are any in use in any current land surface models?   Alton, P.B., 2011. How useful are plant functional types in global simulations of the carbon, water, and energy cycles? Journal of Geophysical Research, 116(G1). Available at: [website]"
416,Why do snowflakes form into hexagonal structures?,Snowflakes are known to form into pretty hexagonal structures.  The image below shows a variety of such structures that are possible (although by all means not an exhaustive list):     What is the mechanism for snowflakes forming into these delightful symmetric hexagonal structures?  Also what is the mechanism for the differing shapes in each of the different snow flakes? 
417,What kinds of remote sensing required to observe methanogenic life on Titan?,"Inspired by Chris McKay's Possibilities for methanogenic life in liquid methane on the surface of Titan. In the paper, the PI's found that the consumed acetylene, ethane, and other organic solids would produce enough energy for bacteria to live. They hypothesize that because the Cassini-Huygens probe detects a depletion of acetylene, ethane and hydrogen on Titan's surface, that living bacteria could be a possible causation for this anomaly.  Obviously, there is some fantasy in this paper, but it is interesting none the less.   My question is, How could a scientist falsify this hypothesis? What biomarkers would be useful to look for? What kinds of sensors would track these biomarkers? "
418,How much heat is transported from the interior to the surface in the form of hydration enthalpy?,"Heat is transferred from the interior to the surface through several methods. One is simply the conduction of sensible heat through the crust - I would guess this accounts for most of it. But some is also transferred through another route: when crust is subducted, it becomes dehydrated, which absorbs heat. Elsewhere, new crust is created and becomes hydrated, which releases heat. The net effect is the transfer of heat from the interior to the surface, but it is transferred in the form of hydration enthalpy rather than sensible heat. A similar process is serpentinisation, which transfers energy in the form of chemical bonds.  I'm looking for data about the total (net) amount of energy that is transferred from the interior to the surface in the form of hydration enthalpy and heat of serpentinisation, as opposed to sensible heat? Is it a substantial fraction of the total ~45TW figure? "
419,El Niño Spring Barrier - optimal time to run a long range climate forecast,"In an  answer to this question - What is the predictability of El Ni&#241;o/La Ni&#241;a? Isopycnal Oscillation talks about a ""decrease in skill during the boreal spring as SST anomalies are abnormally variable"". Today a private weather forecasting company in India made a prediction of the Indian Summer Monsoon claiming that the Indian Summer Monsoon will be unaffected by an impending El Niño in boreal summer(news report available on the net).  Given the point made earlier about the so called ""spring predictability barrier"" my question is what is the ideal time to run this long range climate forecast? If I were to do it now(in boreal spring) then my forecast skill is likely to be lower due to the above mentioned factor. On the other hand running a simulation later in May may be of little use to the agricultural community as farmers would not have adequate time to prepare for a drought or excess rainfall a point noted by Webster et al. in 1  1) [website]"
420,What is the error in bathymetric observations in the presence of vegetation?,"How can we determine the error associated with bathymetric measurements when we survey over submerged vegetation?

421,Traits of invaded ecosystems? Are my compost worms a threat to New York?,"I was shocked to learn that there were few native worms in the glaciated portion of North America. I use worms indoors to compost paper and kitchen scraps. I don't think there is much chance of transfer as my garden is on the roof of an apartment. I was still surprised that my worms are essentially invaders in some parts of this country.  Thinking about all of this lead me to look up the damage done by non-native worms in North America. They have an impact on plants that once relied on the matted leaves on the forest floor. So, they can lead to more barren undergrowth. The native worms are not good at competing for some reason.  And I thought all worms were beneficial!  Still, before the most recent glaciers there were worms in these regions. So, why isn't this like turning the clock way back? In the end, after the glacier's impact fades, shouldn't there be a lot of worms again some day?   I guess sudden change is hardly ever desirable. But I'm very confused about how to identify an invaded ecosystem.  Is it just based on what humans notice? Has anyone tried to make the concept more objective? "
422,Are there any other earthquake magnitude scales other than Richter's?,"There are sometimes confusion about the magnitude of Earthquakes. What scales, other than Richter's, are used to measure the magnitude of an earthquake?   Is there a scale where magnitude 9.0 is regarded as small and 13-14 regarded as strong? "
423,Is a complete global flood physically possible on Earth?,"Genesis 7:11-20 presents an account of a precipitation event which, in 40 days, submerges the entire surface of the earth:     [On] the seventeenth day of the second month — on that day   all the springs of the great deep burst forth, and the   floodgates of the heavens were opened…      For forty days the flood kept coming on the earth… all the high   mountains under the entire heavens were covered. The waters rose   and covered the mountains to a depth of more than fifteen cubits   [6.86 m].   Based on this account, my questions are:   Given the amount of water on Earth (including all the water as liquid, solid, and gas, in all possible places: the atmosphere, the surface, and underground), is there enough water to flood the whole earth until ‘all the high mountains… were covered’? What is the estimated rainfall intensity based on this description, and how intense is it in comparison with today’s rainfall intensity in tropical areas?   Regardless of the veracity or otherwise of the account, this makes for an interesting thought experiment. "
424,Why is relative sea-level falling in Hudson Bay?,"  Why is the sea level in Hudson Bay decreasing so much? Hudson Bay is pretty far up north, much closer to glaciers. Would it make sense for it to recede at this level with sources of fresh water relatively close?  "
425,How big is the influence of tree leaves on global windsystems?,"As anybody knows, there are a lot of forests.  I stumbled upon the question whether these have any effect on the global wind-systems.   Imagine the following situation. All trees suddenly die in an instant. Soon the leaves will dry and fall down, thus only the wood-part remains standing.  The wind can now blow much easier through the trees.    But will this really have an effect?  Do forests influence the windsystems around the earth significantly? How would these winds change, if at all? Would storm-like squalls be more common? "
426,Regeneration rate of nature after environmental catastrophes,"It sounds logical, but I wonder if the regeneration rate of nature (natural absorption of [tex]) is decreased after an environmental catastrophe (resource stock depletion, etc.)?  Or are most catastrophes mainly caused by the decrease of regeneration rate of nature?  I would really appreciate academic references on this issue. "
427,Are coral cays and coral atolls just volcanic islands?,"Are coral cays and coral atolls just a different type of volcanic island? When I hear: ""volcanic island"" I think at places like Moorea or Hawaii, but ultimately, coral cays and coral atolls lay their foundation on the residuals of a volcano, right? "
428,How much land does it take to support New York City?,"New York City has about 8.5 million people living in an area of 300 square miles which gives a population density of 28,300 people per square mile.  The food required to support such a high population density is mostly grown outside of that 300 square mile area.  Likewise, the fresh water required to support that population is not collected within that area.   How much land outside of NYC is effectively dedicated to supporting it?  More generally, how much reasonably productive land does it take to feed and hydrate a human being on average? "

430,How many plant species and animal species are there in the ocean?,"For a biology research project I have to look for the estimated amount of plant and animal species in the ocean. After hours of searching, I came here to ask for help. I need both of these questions answered.    How many plant species are present in the ocean? How many animal species are present in the ocean?  "
431,Is continental drift caused by lava pushing the seabed apart?,"My daughter has a writing assignment based on a handout about plate tectonics. One paragraph says:     Molten rock from the earth's mantle pushes up through the surface at the mid-Atlanic ridge. The rock cools and forms new sections of crust on the ocean floor. The ocean floor has to make room for the new crust. To make enough room, the ocean floor must spread out. As a result, the earth's plates shift.   It's been a long time since I was in school and this is far from my field, but this doesn't sound right to me. Isn't the main cause convection currents in the earth's mantle? Is cooling lava pushing the plates apart a cause? I thought it was basically an effect — where the plates diverge, molten rock pushes up and fills in. (Or, is this just two ways of looking at the same thing?) "
432,Can large earthquakes happen twice/thrice at the same place within a short timeframe,"I want to know if large earthquakes can happen twice in the same region? The reason is that the recent earthquake in Nepal was followed by many after shocks of considerable magnitude.  I wanted to know if there are chances of earthquake of this magnitude in the same region again. Can we expect another earthquake in the same region, lets say in a month or few months? "
433,How to output slope parameter and shape parameter in WRF?,"I'd like to ask if it's possible to output slope parameter and shape parameter of cloud hydrometeors in WRF?  I'm calculating cloud effective radius and I'm using the formula found in Morrison scheme which involves slope and shape parameters. There are calculations for these parameters as well in the scheme, however, I don't think I should be using that calculations to derive these parameters as I think that calculation is done during the ""process"" aka when the model is running which gives the final values of the parameters. So if I use the calculation again, it will change the outputted values, if you get what I mean?  I'd be happy to re-explain it again if it's not clear. I'm only just starting to get into radiative transfer calculation so my knowledge is still low in this area, therefore I very much appreciate your input/replies. "
434,How much do tides affect earth's rotational velocity?,"Many of us are familiar with an exaggerated picture of the Moon's effect on Earth's tides:  Since the Earth is not uniformly covered with water, however, I imagine that the tidal effect will depend on which part of the Earth is facing the Moon (for simplicity, ignore the Sun's contribution).  I'm sure that the tidal effect still affects the Earth's landmasses, but I'm guessing that it would be to a lesser degree (i.e.: the landmasses would bulge out less than the oceans in the image above).  Now, by conservation of angular momentum, if the landmasses bulge out less, the Earth should rotate more quickly, hence this question's title.  How does the tidal effect of the Moon's gravity affect the Earth's landmasses differently from its oceans?  And how big is this difference? "
435,Does a mountain top have higher gravity than a nearby sea-level surface?,"Regardless the latitude and centrifugial 'force' is the gravity on mountains higher or lower than at sealevel?   Gravity is depending on the radius to the centre and the mass. Now if you are on a mountain you are further from centre but it looks like you have more mass under you. Probably the differences would be tiny but is it likely that on mountains the gravity is higher or lower than at see level? As far as I could see till now where there are mountains the gravity is lower, but are there mountains where the gravity is higher? "
436,Half of Earth with most landmass,"About 71% of the Earth's surface is covered with water and the remaining 29% is landmass*. If you could theoretically cut the planet in half, with the objective of producing a half with the most landmass possible (and another with the most water possible), where would the cut be? More specifically, where would the centers (in the surface) of both halves be located? "
437,"Nibiru, or Planet X","What is the popular opinion on this ""Planet X"" news that I have been seeing? It makes me a little nervous sometimes... I read so much on the internet about this subject and do not know what to believe... Can anyone help? "
438,Would you see a correlation between detrital zircon age and grain shape?,"If one was to quantify the shape (particularly roundness) of detrital zircon grains, would there be a correlation between the age of the detrital zircon grains and their shape? For example, if the grain is an Archaean one, would it be much more rounded than a grain that is Devonian? "
439,Why is ground water rising on these forest rings?,"I am seeking a physical explanation for this;  There is huge amount of such a Forest rings in Earth; (Link to Google Maps to one ~400 m Ring)     They range in diameter from 30 metres to 2 kilometres, with the   average ring measuring about 91 metres across. Over 2,000 of these   forest rings have been documented, but scientists estimate the actual   number is more than 8,000. Forest rings in Canada     My question relates to following observation;     There seem to be giant electromagnetic disturbances in the soil and   subsoil that affect not merely growth of vegetation over large areas   but also the level of the water table: it rises “against” gravity   within the circle.   Behind the link in the given link it's said more clearly;     But it gets weirder: as Hamilton’s fieldwork also revealed, there is a   measurable “bulge in the water table that occurs over the entire   length of the forest ring with a profound dip on the ring’s outer   edge.” For Hamilton, this effect was “beyond science fiction,” he   remarked to the trade journal Northern Ontario Business, “it’s   unbelievable.”      What this means, he explained, is that “the water is being held up   against gravity” by naturally occurring electrical fields.   And further from The Journal Ontario Business;     Hamilton was testing an analytical technique over a Matheson gold   deposit to determine if there was any kind of geochemical surface   signal. To his surprise, there were signals coming through 30 to 40   metres of glacial clay.      “We’re thinking there’s no way metals can move through clay 10,000   years after glaciation.”      After ruling out transport by ground water, diffusion and gas, he   theorized it had to have been lifted to surface on electrical fields.   He applied the same theory to forest rings and discovered that they   were also giant negatively charged cells.   Water does react to magnetic field. But the needed [tex] to make it lavitate is way too much compared to Magnetic field earth provides; it's just [tex] and we should be talking only some reasonable scale variations here.  QUESTION; Why is ground water rising on these forest rings? The most obvious one would be dissolved gases. And this paper does provide information to this direction. But with closer study, the influence of the gases can be only 0.16 ppm. This means that the density change must come from water temperature. It can't come from the Ice deep below the ground. There is a measured temperature drop in the edge of the ring, but the inside outside of the ring seems to have approx. the same temperature near the soil surface.    It's hard to see how coverd ice would explain the perfect ring shape (up to 2 km in diameter!)? and the landscape is not even flat. (Pingo's formates in dried lakes/flat grounds) And why there is up to 2 meters soil depression in the annulus? Why there is negative reduction anomaly in the center of the rings? There seems to be some Ice deposits in the ring edge.  To point out the Physical problem of this; Rising ground water with 10 cm on [tex]; [tex] area needs quite huge continuous power source. "
440,Could a large burst of super-heated or super-cooled air cause tornadoes to fall apart?,"We know how tornadoes form: when areas of hot air and cold air mingle, causing rotation. We can even see them form on the radar.   Yet, for all of our technology, we can't stop such events from happening - even though we can cause it to rain by seeding clouds.   But if someone were at the area that a tornado was about to form and was able to introduce an area of super-heated or super-cooled air into the potential tornado, would it destabilize the formation of the destructive whirlwind? Or would doing such a thing cause more of them to form or for them to form more quickly and/ or be more damaging?   "
441,Topography in general sense,"What does topography mean in topographical barrier? I can't fully understand the word topography. I have read the pages appearing on googling topography.  Topography is the arrangement of the natural and artificial physical features of an area. Could topographical barrier be any landforms like a mountain range,a plateau or even a forest? "
442,Is it possible that a change of the earth magnetic poles influences deep-sea currents?,"A deepwater circulation had changed direction about 55 million years ago, whereby salt cold water went from north to south. This was seen after research of foraminifera with carbon isotope change. But where salt water consist of ions is it also possible that the change of the magnetic field of the earth could cause this change? Or are magnetic fields not of influence on salt water? "
443,How Fast Could a Cyclone at the North Pole Achieve?,"Given a tropical arctic region on a planet like our own, how fast could a cyclone go at the north pole where the Coriolis effect is greatest? In essence: have current cyclones maxed out the wind speeds or is there room to grow at the north pole? "
444,"Were all of Earth's minerals created before Earth's formation, during, or after?","I've heard that during the accretion of proto-planets that formed the earth, 60 minerals were created through the reactions of atoms and molecules in the nebula.  Do these first minerals still make up Earth? Do we have more minerals? If so, how and when were they created?  "
445,Are clouds needed for lightning?,In big clouds of water vapor their could raise a difference in charges high and low in the clouds but is it necessary that there are clouds? Could there be lightning just with airstreams which create lightning?   Sometimes they say that life began in a mixture of liquids like methane hydrogen and ammonia together with lightning. But in the beginning of the earthlife were there already clouds to form lightning? 
446,Where does all the salt come from in the Dead Sea?,"Usually when I think of a lake it should be sweet water as all the water is coming from rivers/mountains and rain and, because it is very low situated, all ground water should also flow into it.  But the Dead Sea is very salty (32%). So how did all that salt came into that lake?  Also, why is it called a sea and not a lake? "
447,Desert greening - Do we have long term (several decades) data on precipitation around the Sahara?,"This article of desert greening states that some areas around the Sahara have seen increased plant growth in recent decades, caused by global warming. The causal chain would be warmer air can hold more water -> more precipitation -> more plant growth.  Apparently (from historical sources) the Sahara was wetter during the medieval climate anomaly, which would fit.  However, the article gives as sources satellite images, reports by locals on plant growth and climate models predicting increased precipitation. Which makes me wonder, isn't there direct measurement of precipitation in some relevant areas (over the last decades)? Don't we have direct data to check?  Helpful would be data from the areas indicated in the article: Sahel zone, central Chad, Western Sudan. "
448,Are hurricanes/cyclones/typhoons in the Pacific Ocean usually larger than in Atlantic Ocean?,"Just my experience of observation: hurricanes/cyclones/typhoons in the Pacific Ocean seem to look larger than those in Atlantic Ocean (by looks I mean they occupy more grids in satellite images).  If this is true and if so, what is the reason for this? Is it because the Pacific Ocean has stronger hurricanes/cyclones/typhoons? "
449,How and when people first realized that Antarctica is a continent?,Recently I got startled by this question I asked myself and I can't seem to find any sources of answers.  I have hypotheses about how it could have happened: It could have been by the fact that if you stand there you don't drift anywhere as opposed to the North Pole. Also perhaps by altitude.  Am I right?  What about nowadays? Do we use measurements of seismic activity to infer the shape of Antarctica? Are there other methods? 
450,The fertility of the soil,"I came across this question in my book, it says:     The fertility of the soil increases when there is a lot of ....... in it.   The choices to fill the space were:     Nitrogen - nodular bacteria - fungi   I would exclude fungi as in my course I don't have anything says that fungi affect the fertility of the soil. Both nitrogen and nodular bacteria are good choices and I am confused between them. Nitrogen is an important nutrient, nodular bacteria are the nitrogent-fixing bacteria, so both are important to the firtility of the soil, but I chose nitrogen, as I thought it is more correct, but I found that the answer was ""nodular bacteria"" so why is this? Is there anything I don't understand? "
451,Why should this be a thrust fault?,"Why should this figure represent a thrust fault?    I know this might be a stupid question, but I really want to understand. Since thrust faults are reverse faults why in the figure above if we turned the photo 90 degrees clockwise like this    we don't get the same shape as this    I think that in faults in general the fault plane is inclined to the horizontal, and the hanging wall is the mass of rocks above the fault plane, i.e., the side at which the angle between the fault plane and the horizontal is larger, and the foot wall is the mass of rocks below the fault plane, i.e., the side at which the angle between the fault plane and the horizontal is smaller.  In the second figure, we have a hanging wall on the left side and we have a foot wall on the right side, and it seems that the hanging wall is moving down relative to the foot wall, and that's what happens in normal faults not reverse ones, right? So why we consider the thrust fault in figure one as a reverse fault? "
452,How to simulate wind's trend from his windrose distribution?,"I need to simulate a realtime wind's trend from his windrose distribution (made from statistical data).  How winds change direction and speed in function of time? I cannot pick a random value from that distribution because I'll simulate some unrealistic situation (Example: at minute 1, wind blows from N at 3 kn, on minute 2 wind blows from SE at 10 kn)   Edit n.1  Actually i'm taking data from these datasets: [website]"
453,Formation of petrified trees,"In my book, I came across this question:     Give reason why formation of petrified tress is considered as a degradation and a sedimentation action of the underground water.   My book explains that underground water replaces the original plant material in trees with silica and other inorganic materials, and states this as a sedimentation action of underground water. But I don't understand the part of ""degradation action"" in the question, I think underground water only replaces the plant material in trees so why we consider this to be a degradation action? Or the degradation action mentioned in the question is something else? And if yes, could you explain it for me? Thanks in advance!   "
454,How are daily precipitation totals computed?,"I would like to use ASOS data from Iowa State University   to compute daily rainfall totals for specific locations. Using ASOS, I am unable to match the official NWS totals. I am assuming that the definition of a day is midnight to midnight, local time.  For example: KLGA had a record rainfall total of 3.33""  on June 7, 2013. An excerpt of the ASOS data covering June 7 is below. The ""D"" and ""H"" columns are EDT. It appears that rainfall totals are cumulative and reset hourly at 51 minutes (see hours 12 and 13 EDT for example). But I am unsure how to interpret certain cases. What do I do with hour 21, which reports 0.21"" at 36 minutes, 0 at 48 minutes, and 0.24"" at 49 minutes. Does that 0 denote a reset prior to 51 minutes, implying a total of 0.45"" for that hour? Or does it indicate something else, such as a temporary cessation?  The general questions are: a) how does one parse the p01i column, and b) should it be possible to use ASOS precipitation data to match official NWS totals? Thanks!

Using the algorithm above with the ASOS data for the same days yields 0.11, 0.96, 0.10, 3.32, 0.80. "
455,Where can I get mineral testing done?,Where can I send a sample of material to be tested to see exactly what it is?  Do you have an address where items can be sent for testing and evaluation?  I have a softball size rock that was given to me by my father some 50 years ago and the story that goes with it is awsome if true and would make this a great item to be passed down from generation to generation as a keepsake. (But only if I can verify the rock.)  I would like to try and validate the material and the story just for my own satisfaction.  I don't have a lot of money so if you know of someone or somewhere I could send a sample for testing and evaluation I would greatly appreciate it.

461,"Trying to calculate the percentage of carbon emissions that is offset by 45,000 acres?","In my problem there is an average net ecosystem production  rate    of:   0.25kgC/m2/yr  Am asked:  a. What percentage  of  140,000.000tons/yr  would   be  offset  from    reforesting 45,000  acres?    b. With that what area of reforestation/afforestation would need to be offset by 10% by the same emissions?  How I solved (not sure if correct):  Since 45,000 is in acres I converted to square meters:  45,000Acres = 182,108,539.008 M^2  Then I could say for every 0.25 there would be one M^2 from the above number. Therefore I multiplied.  0.25*182,108,539.008 = 45527134.752 kgC  So now I need to convert kg to ton:  45527134.752 kg = 50185.08 tons  So now I just need to divide into 140,000.000 to find how much it knocks off of the total carbon emitted:  140,000.000 / 50185.08 = 2.8%  Is this right? I'd imagine for 10% I'd just have to adjust the arcrage to get it just right. With land area being 25,414,258,332.672 m^2  Thank you "

469,What isn't recyclable or compostable?,"This might fit better on another SX site, but thought I'd ask the science majors first.  My community has single-bin recycling. Most consumer-level metal, plastic, and paper can go in there to be sorted at a recycling center. They don't take plastic grocery bags, cellophane, paper towels, and pizza boxes. Most of these I can recycle at a more specialized location if I'm feeling like a good citizen.  So most of garbage is food, paper towels, and cellophane.  I'm researching composting, and it seems like the only ""organic"" things I can't compost are cooked meat and dairy products. A site I'm reading mentions ""some paper"". Maybe that means paper towels.  But what I'm wondering is, what would be left after disposing of everything I can using the above methods? I get that this is a question with technically an unbounded answer. The sites I've read so far say something like ""everything else!"" I get that. But what do most people regularly consume and dispose of that wouldn't go in the ""trash"" bin if they had bins for trash, recycling, compost?  The first thing that jumps to mind is batteries, but those shouldn't be thrown in the trash if we followed their instructions. Big items like old computers or broken chairs (or whatever) don't normally go in the bin, and generally have better options for getting rid of them (donations, etc.).  So if I'm doing the mostly bare minimum but still following the basic rules on all of the above, what would be left? Dirty diapers and greasy pizza boxes and blocks of cheese that went bad?  I feel like I must be forgetting something obvious.  Thanks! "

The source of the graph is the Canadian Ice Service.      (in the graph, the x-axis is year, 1980-2014; the y-axis is percent ice cover 0-40%; Link to graph)  While the data in the graph are only back to 1980, looking at data from the NOAA Atlas of Great Lakes Ice Cover it can be seen that the amount of ice for this time of year is unprecedented back to 1973, the earliest year in the atlas.    My question is, how far back would one have to go to find a year with an equal or greater amount of ice coverage on the Great Lakes at this time of the year?  Obviously the Great Lakes were glaciated thousands of years ago :), but is there any historical record of a similar ice coverage event?  update 4/29/2014:    (x-axis is year, 1980-2014; the y-axis is percent ice cover 0-30% Link to graph)  As we close out April, the amount of ice remaining on the Great Lakes is more than 4 times greater than any other year in the 1980-2014 time period, and about 50 times the median value for this time of year.    Vast areas of Lake Superior which were considered by Canadian Ice Service as having a zero-probablity of ice-cover at this time of year are in fact covered in very thick ice:    update 6/2/14  A small amount of ice still remains on Lake Superior.  This is the first time in the satellite era (1973-) that ice has been present in June.   "

485,How far from basalt bedrock can magnetometic survey find archaeological features?,"Magnetometry is used to find archaeological features such as stone walls or ancient hearth. But it usually cannot be used for archaeological prospection in areas where the bedrock is strongly magnetic. Let's assume basalt - it is quite common near the town I come from. With an average cesium vapour magnetometer, how thick must be the soil so that I could find remains of highly magnetic features like remains of a burnt wattle-and-daub house or an iron depot? And if operating near a fault between magnetic and non-magnetic rock, how far from the magnetic rock can I find weakly magnetic situations like disturbed soil?  EDIT: I expect approximate answer. An answer I would expect could start: ""Iron is more magnetic than basalt, so several kilograms of iron (or iron rust) could be found even less than a meter above the bedrock under condidtions X, several meters otherwise. Very small iron items and piles of burnt soil would usually need several tens of meters..."" I just guess all the facts, I don't know, I'm just an archaeologist with no background i geophysics. The aim of this edit is to emphasize that I don't need exact numbers, but I need an idea which numbers might be exact and which are likely to be completely wrong. "
486,Is Earth an organism?,"According to Wikipedia, ""all known types of organism are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and self-regulation via homeostasis."" Further, watching a video like the ""Earth Breathes as Seasons Change"" (which is from NASA) - superficially gives the sense that the ""Earth is alive"" so to speak.   Is Earth an organism? Since there is no unequivocal definition of life, the current understanding is descriptive. To define Earth as an organism, your answer most show either via observed phenomena or theoretically observable phenomena that Earth exhibits all or most of the following traits: Homeostasis, Organization, Metabolism, Growth, Adaptation, Response to stimuli, and Reproduction.

487,how can a asterisk/star like crack occur on a rock?,how can a asterisk/star like crack occur on a hard pyroclastic rock? Could it caused by a meteroite or by some other mechanism?   You may see the shape of the rock on attached photo. 
488,Solar Cycle 25: Can a strong solar storm trigger a violent geomagnetic shift?,"In light of the material presented in the link, hopefully not disregarded as a complete mumbo-jumbo, I would like to pose a simple question, as mentioned above in the question -   While we are entering Solar Cycle 25: Can a strong solar storm trigger a violent geomagnetic shift?   Research. Thank you for reasoned, precise and specific replies.  "
489,Biomes that existed during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Max (PETM),"I understand that you could fill multiple books with descriptions of the PETM and the mechanisms that incited the event. I have always wondered what regions of the world were covered in what types of biomes.  I have read that there was virtually no ice, the tropical latitudes experienced a period of unbelievable wetness, and that many Asian mammals migrated north.  Were the tropics massive rainforests and jungles? Where might we have found desserts during this time? I know that the continents looked much more different than they do today, so if someone could just generalize what parts of the world were covered in what biomes my curiosity would be satisfied. "
490,Does the shear modulus of silicate minerals vary significantly with changes in P and T?,"I know that the bulk modulus, K, varies with pressure and temperature for silicate minerals and liquids, but what about the shear modulus? If so, is the change drastic for changes from standard temperature and pressure to mantle conditions? "
491,What is the most real-time method of determining SPI?,"For drought monitoring related to vegetation, I need to calculate Standardized Percipitation INdex for a given area. Where can I find the most real-time percipitation data to do this? The best I've found is CHIRPS data, which has a latency of one month. Is there any freely available data that is more up-to-date? "
492,What is the collective name for the seas of Indonesia?,"The seas in Indonesia or Sunda Shelf or Southeast Asia separates the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean. The seas in Indonesia itself are broken into many parts due to presence of islands such as Sunda islands, Philippines etc. Examples include Java Sea, Celebes Sea, Banda Sea, Flores Sea etc.   Is there a collective term to name the seas of Indonesia as a whole region???  "
493,Why do allophane soils behave as gels?,"It is notoriously difficult to determine the texture of soil containing allophane and immogolite. According to the literature this is because the clay fraction ""behaves as a gel"", i.e. it's not possible to disperse the particles from each other. But why? What actually happens? Somebody who knows, or who has a reference to where it is explained?  "
494,Did the Azolla Event 49 Million Years Ago Result in an Extinction Event?,"55 million years ago, the world was literally a jungle.  With such high temperatures, rainfall and humidity, life could proliferate.  But 49 million years ago, something drastic happened: The Azolla Event, where ice was forming at the poles.  The culprit?  A kind of plant called Azolla.  Within 800,000 years, photosynthesis and carbon sequestration from those plants reduced the atmospheric quantity of carbon dioxide from 3500 parts per million to 650.    [figure from Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations over the past 60 million years]    But the real question here is--did the cooling caused by the Azolla Event create a major extinction event of plant and animal species? "
495,At what point are water droplets too small to make a rainbow?,This question asks How to tell if fog is made out of water droplets or ice crystals?   I know that ice fog makes a rainbow where fog does not.  Ice crystals aside: How does the water droplet size determine the characteristics of a rainbow? When is a water droplet too small to make a rainbow? 
496,How temperature anomaly are measured,"Temperature Anomaly is the measure used to show that the earth is warming. The formula for temperature anomaly involves in the subtraction of average temperature measurement over 30 years considered as a base line temperature . Usually temperature anomaly graphs starts from 1880, was the average taken from 1850 or which 30 years was used in the baseline or average temperature calculation?  can you suggest places that i can learn about these and get these data?  even though subtracting the baseline temperature reduces the influence of errors in measurement, still how are these error accounted for in these graphs? even modern thermometer have +/- 0.5 deg error how are these error removed from the dataset?  "
497,Oscillations in the Keeling curve?,"I'm having a slightly difficult time understanding the Keeling curve, pictured here:    I understand that carbon dioxide (ppm) is increasing with respect to time, but why is there an oscillation between the summer months and winter months? I have two guesses but I'm not sure if they are correct:   Changes in density due to temperature? More plants in the summer, resulting in less carbon.   Are these guesses correct?  "
498,What atmospheric phenomenon am I seeing in this photo?,"On a trip to Brighton, England on April 12th, 2015, I noticed this strange plume in the sky over the English Channel at about 13:00 hours. It looks like;   Something that fell out of the sky - the news and other chatter over the following days revealed nothing which would support that. A tornado/wind vortex drawing water up from the surface?     Please note, I took this photo with my phone, with the window down and it is completely unedited. Is this a meteorological phenomenon, and if so, what is it? "
499,Wet and dry seasons - what are they and how do they form?,"While asking questions on Worldbuilding, I keep hearing about wet/dry seasons. Obviously, one has rain and the other doesn't, and I've gathered that they occur with regularity on an annual basis, but what exactly are they? What causes them, and when/how often do they form?  "
500,Meaning of Coupling in Modelling,"The Community Earth System Model (CESM) is described as a      fully-coupled, global climate model that provides state-of-the-art   computer simulations of the Earth's past, present, and future climate   states   I've come across ""coupling"" and ""coupled model"" many times but still have trouble with the term. What does ""coupling"" and ""fully coupled"" mean? Does refer to the physics or numerical aspects? "

502,"Tornadoes meeting with an Immovable, Unbreakable, Large Cube","What would happen to a tornado if a Large, Immovable, Unbreakable and Obsidian Cube was in its path?  The tornado is on a flat plain... but is heading towards the cube.  By large, I mean the length of the cube's edges is as long as half the width/height of the tornado, whichever is larger.  Or is this more Physics, instead, of Earth Science? "
503,"What color is the Sahara desert, as seen from orbit?","In images of the Earth taken from spacecraft (or composite images thereof), the color rendering seems to be really inconsistent.   Examples   (Source: NASA, [website]This is one of NASA's composite images. Here, the Sahara is yellow.   (Source: NASA, [website]This is a photo from an Apollo mission. Here, the Sahara is an orange/red ochre. This is a very different color.  I realize that there are annual variations to be expected in the color of the landscape, but the above differences seem to be too large to be accounted for by that effect.  Is the Sahara ochre or yellow? "
504,Do forests affect local rainfall and climate significantly?,"I know that forests can change the local temperature, but what about rainfall?.  Do forests affect rainfall in their region? I have read that if a forest is very big, it can cause minor changes to local rainfall and temperature.  How does that work? "
505,(Why) Is there more landmass on Earth's Northern hemisphere than the Southern Hemisphere?,"This Question on Worldbuilding is based on the presumption that there is a greater amount of landmass on the Earth's Northern Hemisphere than there is on the Southern Hemisphere.   While researching to form an answer to this question, I found it difficult to find a map that accurately portrays which hemisphere actually has a greater landmass, and started thinking about the actual nature of the question - assuming there is a greater concentration of landmass in the Northern Hemisphere than the South, why is that?   Does it have anything to do with the rotational procession of the Earth? Is it more related to the Earth's natural fault lines?  Or is there something else that influences a greater accumulation of land mass on our Northern Hemisphere (if that is, in fact, an accurate assumption)? "
506,Will a nuclear bomb stop an earthquake from happening?,"I was recently watching the San Andreas trailer and a thought occurred to me as to how best to prevent earthquakes. I figured, why not nuke it? My professor said that it's possible for nukes to stop hurricanes so it got me thinking as to what else nukes could stop (besides humanity). The friction that develops is because of two plates moving against each other, right? So if you used enough nuclear bombs to completely obliterate a plate, the other plate wouldn't have anything to rub against, correct? "
507,Mud bricks with shale,"I have recently bought a medium sized plot of wood/scrub land. Half of this plot was once used to dump shale from coal mines, which means I have a lot of shale.  I have been wondering/looking for possible uses for the stuff. One thought I've had is to make ""mud bricks"" however I can't find any mention of whether it is possible or not. I know the traditional method uses loamy soil but would it work with shale?  I don't have a kiln or any way of baking the bricks, so would be reliant on the sun. I was thinking maybe adding water and maybe some loam?  Aside: there are no suitable tags for my question and I do not have the reputation to add any, I'm thinking I could be on the wrong site for this question, if I am, please advise me of a more suitable one.  "
508,Groundwater unloading and corresponding changes in fault zone stick-slip behavior,"I was intrigued by this Slate piece, more or less a summary of Amos et al. (2014)'s Nature article, which essentially states that groundwater depletion and subsequent crustal unloading causes a decrease in the stress normal to the San Andreas fault, thus bringing the fault ""closer to failure"" (to quote from the abstract).  Does that mean, as Eric Holthaus, the author of the Slate post suggests, Amos and his co-authors believe that due to the drought, the next ""major"" earthquake may not be quite as significant in magnitude? (The idea being that an increase in small-magnitude slip events over several years will help ease the intensity of short-period rupture propagation during a larger event?) Or, does it mean that the released stress is just being redistributed to locked sections of the fault system, which I assume experience decreased Mohr–Coulomb forces due to the region wide groundwater draw down? Elsewhere in the Slate article, for example, Holthaus notes that the August 2014 Napa Earthquake actually redistributed some of its released stress onto the Hayward Fault, which doesn't quite seem to support the ""easing"" hypothesis.  Am I wrong in thinking that the two ideas referenced (easing vs. redistribution) might be mutually exclusive? I sort of wish Holthaus had delved a little deeper in his analysis, since it seems that the clarity of the Slate article takes a fair hit from this inconsistency. "
509,What is the geothermal potential of a volcano?,"If there were lots of geothermal plants—even mobile ones—near a volcano, how much power could this provide? Could the sapping of some of the heat energy make the volcano less likely to erupt? "
510,How do geologists find ore deposits?,"From my research, there is lots of information on how to extract ore, but I can't find any information on how these ore deposits are found in the first place, apart from 'looking for surface formations'. So, what kind of formations would exist for different types of ore? Are there any other ways of finding ore?  "
511,Flexure of a viscous lithosphere - derivation,"I have been trying to figure out solution for the fourth order differential equation of flexure for a viscous plate.   The fourth order differential equation for a viscous plate is given as  [tex]  here, [tex] is a function of viscosity and elastic thickness, and [tex] is the specific weight.  My solution so far is  [tex]  where, [tex] is the maximum deflection, [tex] is function of [tex], [tex] and [tex]; and [tex] is function of [tex] and [tex].  The problem with my derivation is I am not sure if it correct and I do not have a way to check it. Moreover, the [tex] term is an issue as it resolves to constant integer, which is not physically likely. Anyone out there, who could help me get on the right path? Any papers, any links? "
512,Should one extract wavelet from seismic or well log for the generation of synthetic traces?,"Synthetics are generated by convolving reflectivity series with the known wavelet. I have seen most of the wavelet are extracted from seismic data itself. Is there any hard and fast rule, or can one extract wavelet from well log as well? If so which gives better result in terms of correlation? The wavelet extracted from seismic or well log data? "
513,What ice phenomenon are we seeing in this video?,"I don't know what this YouTube video shows, but it appears to be half glacier and half ""the blob."" It almost appears to be ""growing"" although I assume it's being pushed somehow.  Can someone tell me what this is called, what causes it, and how common it is?    Warning: Strong language in the video. "
514,Confusion about grid registration concepts and their relevance in modelling,"I'm trying to make use of the ETOPO1 dataset as the bathymetry input of a wave model. I came upon this discussion of grid registration: Registration of Structured Square-Cell Grids.  I read this material several times and I'm still confused about some things. From what I understand of the diagram on that page: the blue dots represent the data values. We know from the dataset what the latitude and longitude of each of the blue dots is. And for each blue dot, it is always in the center of the cell, which is the area it represents. If I'm right so far, what is the difference or significance of these two schemes? What is the purpose of the red lines? Why might there be an ambiguity, since we already know the locations of the blue dots and the data values at those locations? Does it affect how we interpret the data?   If anyone can help me with this, or point me to relevant resources, it would be much appreciated. "
515,Is ice also created ín cold water of the oceans?,"Salt water of the oceans could freeze into ice at a temperature of -1,8C. Now there is a lot ice on the poles but of all the floating ice how much is that a grown in and of the water itself?  With other words, is the current of the ocean waters an obstacle for creating ice or is there a minimum temperature at which water in each case will turn into ice independent of currentstreams and is this temperature reached in the articpoles?  So I'm not asking about snow what is pressed into ice on the poles. "
516,"Lava and Magma, Meteor and Meteorite--What's the Difference?","Some features of Earth (and beyond) have been bugging me for quite some time.  When molten rock is beneath the surface, it's called ""magma"".  Above the surface, it is called ""lava"".  When a bolide is in orbit of any planet, it's called a ""meteoroid"".  When it makes contact with the atmosphere, it becomes a ""meteor"".  When it hits the surface, it becomes a ""meteorite"".  But changing one's name based on a change in location is, at best, superficial and has no relation to chemistry and composition.  Are there any REAL differences between magma and lava?  Are there any REAL differences between a meteoroid, a meteor and a meteorite?  If not, then why do we call them by different names? "
517,"How can we have ""floating"" and convection currents in a non-liquid mantle?","I've always thought the earth's layers were as follows:   Crust, a few dozen KM think in most places Mantle, completely composed of liquid rock and molten metals, a few thousand KM thick Outer Core, molten iron Inner core, solid iron   The mantle being composed of a liquid made a lot of sense. The idea of plate tectonics floating on top of magma and bumping against each other made sense.   However, I've been told by Michael that the mantle is completely solid, which seems to not work as well with the ideas of   Floating/moving plate tectonics Convection currents   If the earth's mantle is solid, why don't we say the plate tectonics are ""resting on"" the mantle instead of ""floating on""?  How can we have convection currents through something that doesn't flow? Even if the solid rock in the mantle can why doesn't the heat just distribute itself evenly through conduction, and negate any convection tendencies?  I realize that entire books can be written on this topic, so a generalized answer is fine. "
518,How much and what kind of radiation passes through a cloud?,"I've read that 80% of sunlight is passing through clouds. Now there a small clouds and big clouds so it should be some average. Is this true or is the amount of sunlight passing throug a cloud really much more depending on the size of clouds. Is it for instance on a totally cloudy day that only 30% is passing and on a nice summerday when a cloud comes by it is 90%. Probably it depend on how high in length the clouds are.  But perhaps even a more interesting question is, are all wavelengths passing though on the same level? So is uv-light passing even easy as infrared light? In my experience though when walking in the sun it feels that much more than 20% of those warm IR-rays are being blocked by clouds (even if they are very tiny). So is it possible that even 70% of the IR rays are blocked or perhaps relatively moren than visible light or UV-light? "
519,Why cannot people burn all the atmospheric oxygen?,"We are told that photosynthesis, developed a couple of billion years ago has produced all the atmospheric oxygen. I wonder, why did the process stop? Why do modern plants prefer to recover the entropy whereas ancient ones...   Actually, the ancient ones separated the carbon-hydrogen fuel from the oxygen. The modern trees consist of this fuel which re-joins with the oxygen afterlife. But why didn't this happen to the ancient plants? Where did the ancient carbohydrates go? If it is the oil and gas we can burn it. Why do you say that we do not have enough fossils to burn all the oxygen? Where are the ancient plant bodies deposited so securely that we say for sure that they cannot come back into the contact with the oxygen? "
520,Large scale structures in the Sahara – what are they?,"In Google Earth we can see some very clear lines in the Sahara.  In the screenshot below you can clearly see these lines starting at the top going southward, then gently curving westward towards the bottom.  What are these structures and how were they formed?  Are they related to the wind?  Some sort of flow?  Are they surface structures or they are embedded deep in the rock?  Or something else?  I realize that this may be a trivial question for anyone with some knowledge of geology, but I really wasn't able to google up the answer.   "
521,Why are lenticular clouds circular?,"I recently visited Japan, where I observed a lenticular cloud above Mount Fuji:    Curious by the cloud, I looked it up and found it it's a lenticular cloud, that forms because of rising moist air coming into contact with cooler air. However, why is it circular? If I would look at it from above would it still be circular? Since air moves in a certain direction, I would expect the cloud to be laminar and elongate towards one direction rather than circular.  What makes it circular? "
522,Recovery From the Great Dying,"252 million years ago, Earth underwent its worst, most violent chapter in the form of the Permian-Triassic extinction event, or ""The Great Dying"".  70% of the terrestrial species and 95% of the marine species became extinct.  There was one thing that I had noticed in Permian and Triassic landmasses--both periods had Pangaea, all the world's continents clumped together into one singular landmass.  And recent evidence has found that it took life ten million years to recover from the Great Dying.  So why did it take so long?  Was the damage of the Great Dying that extensive?  Or did Pangaea play a part in delaying the recovery process? "
523,Explanation for single rainbow that contained colors several times,"I saw a rainbow outside Silverton, CO last week that for a few minutes seemed to show part of the color cycle (red to purple) several times within the same band. This picture is how it looked to my eye. I assume this is some refraction phenomenon of multiple rainbows, or ... ? It was also a double, but that part isn't shown.     I took another picture a few minutes later of it looking normal (the rainbow brightened, the droplets were bigger, and there was a strong double):    What is causing this strange banding?  "
524,Is there a seasonal difference in the average cloud floor?,"It always looks like clouds are so much higher in the sky (altitude) in the summer than in the winter. Is that true? If not, is there some sort of optical illusion? If so, why is that?  I live in Iowa, so I don't know if this is a phenomenon that exists in all climates, just temperate climates, or just the US Midwest. And, for that matter if this actually happens or if I'm just misinterpreting what I'm seeing.  "
525,Do winds behave like waves?,"Like a sound wave, there are compressed and dilated regions in the air. But do compressed regions also occur in winds. If one considers squalls, they feel like a compressed region of air. Perhaps they are too great to be considered as a kind of amplitude, but is there anyway a kind of wave in wind?  In the other question/answer is not mentioned anything about forming waves. So does wind behave (perhaps only a little bit) with sound-wave compressions and dilations? "
526,Desalination and Weather Impact?,"I have a question I've always been curious about regarding the topic.  As I understand it, the desalination process is that they take the salt water, create usable water from it and then salt sludge is pumped back out into the ocean.  When I've read about it an issue from this seems to be that the waste is bad to the ecosystem they pump it back into plus that extra salt can't be that good for the ocean as a whole and its inhabitants.  I understand that one plant might not be that much of an impact on the ocean as a whole but if it became more standard and over 50yrs+, especially with the changing climate and droughts maybe it would and there are greater ecological issues.  My question is: Why can't they just pump the salt water into a designated area in the desert?    I live in California and we have plenty of desert and every time I head out toward Las Vegas or travel up north I think about this.    Why couldn't some chunk of land be allocated where raw salt water can be pumped into and then let it evaporate?  Wouldn't that just generate more rain which, at least in the winter, create more snow pack in the mountains and help create drinking water more naturally?  The salt and stuff left behind could just stay there and become a salt flat.  At a minimum couldn't they process the water and then pump the sludge into the desert (the remaining water would still evaporate) and it seems to me that would be a better solution than putting it back into the ocean for it to have more salt.  If it could be done on a reasonable scale, maybe some land that was once unusable could be terraformed to forest which would help with the climate, pull carbon out of the air, and on a 5 or 10 year cycle the trees can be cut down made into mulch and then new ones planted...  Not the salt water or land where the salt is left but additional land allocation for this (we do have a LOT of desert) and I know sand would need to be cultivated but we also have a lot of cows and organic material we can use to help convert the sand into more usable soil.  Running some pipes from a coast inland while posing some logistical challenge doesn't seem unreasonable to me.  Better than oil pipelines...  Thanks for the responses "
527,Relative dating of intrusion,"I am quite new to geology and have a realtive dating problem which I am a bit unsure of. I know very well the principle of superposition, principle of cross-cutting, etc., but am still a little bit unsure on one part.  The problem is illustrated in the following picture:    My question is about the intrusion (E).  Obviously the intrusion must have occurred later than the deposits of layers B, C and D, but how can I tell if the intrusion occurred before or after the deposit of layer A?  In my opinon, both of these scenarios are possible.  The intrusion does not appear to cross through A, so I suppose it is possible that A was deposited after the intrusion.  But isn't it also possible that A was deposited before the intrusion, and the intrusion simply did not make it past layer B?  If anyone can let me know if there is any certain way of reasoning whether A or E occurred first, then I would greatly appreciate it. "
528,Is there a better system than latitudes and longitudes?,"I am a student programmer, with very little knowledge of geography and am working with maps for a project, and have to convert latitudes and longitudes to points on a screen (map to pixels). So my principal problem with the system of latitudes and longitudes is having to specify a hemisphere along with the co-ordinates of a point on a map.   Is there a system which provides co-ordinates without having to specify a direction, which is also widely used?  And if so, do tools to convert between the two systems exist? For example something like the left-top corner of a map is given (0,0), and as we go right X increases, and as we go down Y increases.  Thank you! "
529,What causes ringing effect when using corner filter?,"I used the corner filter (band pass) with this frequency values (8,10,45,50). I get ringing effect on the data. my questions are:   what is the name of this effect and the cause? should be removed and how? 3.on what basis the frequency values should be chosen? what are the visual features of seismic data make us decided the processing steps.      After filter:     Before filter:    "
530,"There are cloud identification guides, are there also (guided) rock identification websites?","Seeing all these rock identification questions, got me wondering, is there no straightforward guided rock identification website?  In Intro to Geology lab, I remember going through a bit of a process towards trying to identify different rocks.  There are some pretty decent cloud sites/charts around these days, not just basic descriptions like here, here, and here, but great in-depth site like here, and and especially these step-by step guides like here and here.  I know there are a lot more types and complexity to rocks than clouds, and clouds typing tends to be a little less useful (in part because the formation mechanisms are fairly non-distinct).  I've slowly started to see apps to lead you through plant/creature identification increasing, which is great, but are there any places we can point people to do the same for rocks? "
531,Why is ocean salinity not a good chronometer?,"In 1910, George Becker published The Age of the Earth, in which he used the sodium accumulation rate in the ocean to estimate the earth's age as 50 to 70 million years. We now know through various methods that the earth is much older, and as far as I can tell there hasn't been much interest from scientists in using ocean salinity as an age indicator since Becker.  One more recent paper, ""The Sea's Missing Salt"" (PDF), claims a maximum age of 62 million years after totaling sodium inputs and outputs. I've found a couple claims of measurement error floating around the Internet, but can't find any solid citations. I did find a reference to ""The sodium cycle and the age of the ocean"", but it's behind a paywall and I cannot read it.  Why does this salt chronometer not agree with the other dating methods? That is, what went wrong in computing the age of the earth from ocean salinity? "
532,Estimate the flow velocity of a river with satellite images,"I'm looking for a more or less straightforward (and not very mathematical) way to roughly estimate the flow velocity of a river based on satellite imagery (e.g. Google Earth).  In more detail: I would like to verify data on flow velocity of rivers that has been submitted to me. Usually it was taken at the side of the river (within 2-5 meters of the river bank. What features would I be looking for on Google Earth to get a rough idea if the submitted values could be correct or are completely off the edge? If there is a sandbank or if the river splits I would assume a slower flow velocity and if I can see wave-like turbulences even on satellite imagery or rivers flow together I would expect the flow velocity to increase.  There is no need to calculate an exact velocity, just to get an idea, let's say in the range of +/- 0.5 m/s if submitted values could be correct.  Are there any other signs I should be looking for on the satellite images that could indicate the flow velocity? Does it make sense at all or does it vary too much across small river sections anyway? "
533,"Can a voltage difference precede cloud-to-ground lightning, and can it be measured over a short distance?","I recently heard an anecdote about cloud-to-ground lightning striking an area where some kids were playing 20 seconds prior. They experienced their hair rising which would indicate there is a significant voltage preceding such strikes.  I assume that a common multimeter would indicate a very high voltage between the ground and a cloud which is about to produce a ground strike (and it would facilitate the strike).     Would there be some voltage between the ground and, say, 2-3 meters in the air? How long before the strike would this voltage become noticeable (significant relative to noise)?  "
534,Reasons for choosing LES in stead of RANS models?,"In oceanography, is there any particular reason why choosing large eddy simulations in stead of RANS (regardless of the type of flow)? In both cases, 2d simulations would be used (shallow water model).  What are the pros and contras, in general, of both approaches? "
535,Why are CO2 sensors so expensive when CO sensors aren't?,"Please excuse me if Earth Science is not the correct place to ask this question.  I read a New York Times article about increasing CO2 levels in the atmosphere: ""Carbon in Atmosphere Is Rising, Even as Emissions Stabilize"" (26 June 2017)  According to the article, there are not enough CO2 monitoring stations for scientists to have a detailed understanding of where CO2 is being emitted/absorbed (e.g. by landmasses and oceans)  This got me thinking, would it be possible to design a dual-use product that integrates a CO2 sensor (e.g. a solar powered garden lamp) from which we could crowd source CO2 data for scientists? Perhaps a bit naive, since the sensors may not be accurate enough for scientific studies, and if it's a consumer product they would likely have a dense install base in metropolitan areas and less in the countryside/oceans.  But that isn't the biggest flaw in this idea. No, that came when I looked up CO2 sensor prices:    I was able to find some Arduino compatible sensors from a Google search for around 50USD at the low end, but looking at electronics distributors, a more reasonable price for a raw CO2 sensor seems to be at least 70USD.  Carbon Monoxide detectors which you are encouraged to install in your home are much less expensive!    How can it be that CO2 sensors are so expensive compared to CO detectors?  Is this due to the fact that carbon monoxide sensors use a detection method which cannot accurately determine the PPM of CO?  "
536,What is that drain east of newfoundland,On Google Maps I just found a drain east of Newfoundland:    More details at [website]I wonder what that could be?  I heard about issues from different datasources which can occur when Google mixes data from NOAA or other sources with their own. Or could that be issued by a giant ice mountain drifting southwards? Or from the last ice age?  
537,Good practices and pitfalls when fitting models $y = f(weather)$ and predicting $\hat{y} = \hat{f}(GCM)$,"I've got a phenomenon of interest, [tex].  It is determined in large part by the weather.  Naturally, one becomes interested in what climate change may do to [tex], so one fits a model of the form [tex], where [tex] is a potentially high-dimensional representation of historical weather.  To get a sense of impacts into the future, one uses the fitted model [tex] applied to (downscaled) GCM projections of weather.  Given uncertainty in which model provides the most faithful representation of the distribution of weather given CO2, one should compute a distribution of [tex] as    [tex] [tex] [tex] [tex] [tex]   A few questions:   GCMs get some things badly wrong, like convective precipitation.  Is it good practice to make sure that your model [tex] and your training data [tex] represent things like convective precip at an appropriate level of coarseness, such that the GCM can be roughly ""correct""?  For example, should I only use monthly summaries of precip from a GCM, even if the GCM's raw output gives it to me sub-daily?  What are some other examples of things that GCMs don't do well, that one might consider coarsening? One shouldn't average GCM output across multiple models, obviously.  But it makes more sense to average [tex].  But should this be a simple average, or should the average be weighted somehow to account for the fact that some models are more similar to one another than other models?  And how would this be practically done, given that the GCM's are so high-dimensional that it becomes impossible to calculate distance metrics? Given that historical simulations exist, one can compute a ""backcast"" projection [tex], and then compute a ``bias'' term [tex].  (Naturally one would use a difference in means, rather than a pointwise difference, because GCMs attempt to model the distribution of the weather, rather than realized weather.)  If the estimated bias [tex] is nontrivial, should I add it to my projections, forming [tex]?  Or is there a better way to achieve the same end?  "
538,How to calculate the kinetic energy spectra from ocean current timeseries?,"How does one practically compute the kinetic energy spectra from a timeseries of u- and v- Cartesian components of ocean current velocity ([tex]) obtained from an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) moored on the seabed?  Do you:   1) compute the spectra of each u- and v- components and then calculate the resulting kinetic energy from the spectra in the frequency domain? i.e. [tex]; where [tex] is the kinetic energy spectrum per unit frequency and similarly [tex] and [tex] are the u- and v- power spectra?  or;   2) compute the kinetic energy [tex], where [tex] &amp; [tex] are the current velocity timeseries and then calculate the power spectral density (i.e. using Matlab's pwelch) of the resulting KE?  Any guidance with the theory or practical calculation would be very much appreciated.   Thank you. "
539,Does global warming affect tsunamis?,"I have been doing some research into global warming, and I was curious as to whether or not increasing the temperature of the oceans would affect tsunamis to any significant degree.  My gut tells me that adding more energy into the water would make the tsunami worse, but tsunamis are caused by earthquakes, not by heating like a hurricane. On the other hand, increasing heat would reduce the density of the water, which might make them less severe.  Would these forces actually affect the tsunami? Which one would win, or would they cancel out? Or am I completely missing something obvious? "
540,Permian-Triassic mass extinction. Consequences on Earth's system,"Coming from this post:   Causes of fluctuations in atmospheric oxygen in past 300 Mya  I believe there are a lot of questions still unanswered about Permian-Triassic mass extinction, but I ask only for its influence on the Carbon Cycle, atmosphere levels and climate in general.  What did the extinction change in Earth's system? Did unicellular organisms restored some kind of new equilibrium? What do we know? "
541,Is there a maximum size for a single snowflake?,"Just based on my previous experiences a wetter snow, in general, has larger flakes.  Some online sources say that raindrops do have a maximum size before they start to break apart when surface tension can no longer withstand air resistance, however the maximum size of a snowflake is less defined (1&amp;2).  One source also states that light winds and a wetter snow is more conducive to larger flakes because the light wind helps keep them from breaking into pieces, and the additional moisture creates a film which helps the flakes stick together (2).  I understand that it may be difficult to measure a snowflake before it melts and that may be why the only non-confirmed size that I have found is from the 2014 Guinness Book of World Records of an eye witness account in 1887 of a snowflake 15"" wide by 18"" deep (3).     So my question is twofold:   Is there a theoretical limit to how large a single snowflake can be? If there is a reliable way to measure snowflakes, what is the largest snowflake ever measured?   Sources:   [website][website][website]"
542,Are there areas of desert sands which experience blizzards?,"Building off of another question I recently asked (Is there sand in Antarctica?) I want to ask a broader question coming from the same motive described there.  Are there desert sands that experience blizzards? I know of places with sand that experience blizzards, for example certain beaches in the Adirondacks or Great Lakes of northeastern USA. But what about desert sands?  The other question identifies Antarctic desert sands, and a comment even notes that where Chicago is now was once covered in desert sands. The latter point made me realize though, do blizzards (snow storms with high winds, to be specific) occur in these sand dune areas? If yes, then are there numerous examples of where this occurs, or is it a somewhat rare thing? "
543,Data of terrestrial evapotranspiration over large areas?,"I have been looking for information regarding the total amount of water that evaporates from terrestrial systems and found some global estimates like this one  [website]However, the units are mm/year but that doesn't mean much without the area. Are there any estimates of evapotranspiration that are available? Or how could I calculate evapotranspiration by area using maps such as the ones I have linked to? "
544,Does nitrate take a particular long time to percolate from surface into groundwater?,"In a recent discussion with a farmer, the (at least in northwestern Germany) ""popular"" topic of nitrate infiltration into groundwater came up. The general view is that lots of fields receive more nitrate fertilizer than the plants can use, this then percolates through the ground and eventually shows up in the groundwater that is also used as drinking water. So far so plausible. Raised nitrate content in groundwater is indeed often observed.   One should probably add that in this area, a lot of agriculture is raising of hogs and cattle, consequently much of the fertilizer is manure that has a (compared to commercial fertilizer) low NPK content and is thus not worth to transport over far distances. So there's an incentive to dispose on ones own fields, nearby.  Now, this farmer claimed that the nitrate content we see now is decades old, that the bylaws and controls as well as agricultural practices in place now work. Is this true? Does nitrate penetrate ground so slowly? The only mechanism here I could think of that nitrate is adsorbed and desorbed on minerals in the ground, sort of like in chromotography column.  If neccessary, I can provide more figures for nitrate content of specific wells, groundwater table etc - but I don't think it's neccessary since I want a qualitative answer wether or not such a slow infiltration is plausible at all. "
545,"What's the difference between these most basic, first-order models for estimating runoff?","There are a lot of variations of basic, first-order hydrology models to estimate runoff from rainfall with a few other parameters. From what I can tell, most very basic rainfall-runoff models use one of the following methods at their core: the SCS Curve Number method, the Rational method, and the Simple method. I'm trying to understand: how do these methods differ, and are there other methods used at the core of basic, first-order hydrology models?   From what I can tell, the SCS Curve Number method is only slightly different from the Rational method in that it uses a Curve Number (based on land use and soils) rather than a Runoff Coefficient (based on soil and basin slope). The two are both event-based models, at least in their initial design.  The Simple method appears to be a lot like the Rational method but the former is for estimating pollutant loading (using pollutant coefficients and runoff) while the latter is for estimating runoff (using runoff coefficients and rainfall). I could see the two being coupled, but they don't appear to have any redundancy in their use.  Considering the summary of my findings, can these methods be described together as ""empirical models"" given that they are all based on empirically derived coefficients (either Curve Number values, runoff coefficients, or pollutant coefficients)? "
546,Did the Geothermal Power Plant contribute to Pahoa's Lava Fissures?,"There was lava in the area near the wells that the Puna Geothermal Venture facility created.     The plant has nine wells that run as deep as 8,000 feet, according to Wil Okabe, managing director for the County of Hawaii. -Washington Post   8,000 feet is really quite deep. While I understand that those are not the deepest wells created for geothermal energy, in Hawaii that seems deep enough to get to where lava would also be pooling.   For example, it would be deep enough to hit the pool at one of the main volcanoes.     Rocks that are moving upward in the mantle beneath Hawai`i begin to melt about 40 to 60 miles (60 to 100 km) depth. The molten rock, called magma , rises because of its relatively low density. The magma ""ponds"" in a reservoir 1 to 4 miles (2 to 6 km) beneath the summit. [website]In addition to the availability of lava in the area near the wells, it seems that geothermal energy has also been linked to earthquake activity in the past.     An analysis of earthquakes in the area around the Salton Sea Geothermal Field in southern California has found a strong correlation between seismic activity and operations for production of geothermal power -UC Santa Cruz   Moreover, the facility itself is basically right on the location that the set of fissures opened up.    As location of seismic activity is in question here, I also found a map from the US Geological Survey with 30 days of activity for this portion of Hawaii.   The largest circles are a 5.4 and 6.9, the smallest ones are equal to or greater than 2.5.  Given the proximity of the facility, as well as the fact that these wells were not only near underground lava, but also have been known in other areas to produce earthquakes, what roll, if any, could the Puna GeoThermal Venture have played in the recent fissure activity in Pahoa, Hawaii? "
547,Why do the earth sciences use mega-annum instead of mega-year?,"I've noticed that geology and related fields use mega-annum (Ma) instead of mega-year (Myr) as the unit for 1 million years.  Why is that?  Is an ""annum"" different from a ""year"" in geology? "
548,What are these radial line patterns shown in representations of antarctica?,"In the video of the recent Iridium-6/GRACE-FO launch at about T+ 33:00 (curently at 49:00 in the video) the 2nd stage passes over Antarctica and this is shown in the animation.  I noticed a strange pattern of radial lines drawn on Antarctica, presumably near the South Pole. I remembered seeing these before and assumed them to be some kind of graphics glitch, until I saw something similar in the BBC News article Giant canyons discovered in Antarctica.  Are the patterns in the two images related, and what do they mean?       "
549,"Every 202,500 years, Earth wanders in a new direction; does it affect climate?","I refer to this article on nytimes.com: Every 202,500 Years, Earth Wanders in a New Direction  TLDR: Scientists believe the earth's orbit oscillates between circular and more elliptical due to the gravitational pull from Jupiter (big) and Venus (close). It takes 405k years to complete a cycle.  The big question: could this affect climate-change? Could it make colder winters, hotter summers or just more extreme weathers? Changing Gulf stream?  "
550,Transformation of soil moisture units,I have soil moisture data from Regional Climate Models expressed in [tex]. Τhis quantity is the total soil moisture that is estimated for the land column. The depth of this column is dependent on the land surface model that was used.  How could I transform soil moisture units expressed in [tex] to [tex] so that model outputs are comparable to remote sensing soil moisture data that are expressed in [tex]? Is there a way of doing this transformation without taking into consideration the soil depth? 
551,Time standard for IERS Bulletin A,"IERS Bulletin A and Bulletin B contains Earth orientation parameters. These include the time difference between UT1 and UTC and pole position. The values for these parameters are listed once per day, keyed by ""MJD"" (Modified Julian Date).  The documentation does not say which time scale these MJD values reference. Without qualification, MJD is typically taken to mean some flavor of Universal Time. If that is the case, which flavor of universal time is it: UTC, UT1, or some other flavor? If that's not the case, which is it?  I'm using the data in an interpolative fashion (Lagrange interpolation) to estimate the Earth orientation parameters at arbitrary points in time, so not having the correct time standard will lead to small errors in the interpolated values. "
552,Why did the carboniferous period have so much atmospheric oxygen?,"Even if all the carbon dioxide (which makes up less than 1% of the atmosphere) in the air were sequestered by plants, would the atmosphere not remain about 21% oxygen? Why did the carboniferous period have 35% atmospheric oxygen? "
553,About the actual radiative impact of greenhouse gas emission over time,Say we will emit a certain amount of greenhouse gas over the next 50 years (e.g. 100 billion tons CO2-eq in total). What would happen if I implement a certain GHG mitigation effort to cut the same amount of GHG (say sequester 20 billion tons CO2-eq) in the early years (e.g. year 0-10) vs in later years (year 40-50)?  I would imagine that cutting the gas earlier would be better since overall global warming is a cascade of positive feedbacks? A bunch of other similar questions can be asked like cutting the same amount of GHG over first 10 years (but no cutting thereafter) vs spread out the cutting to the entire 50 years. What are some major consideration to look at? Is it generally better to cut GHG as early as possible? 
554,"By how much did the Earth's diameter decrease due to cooling, if at all, since it was formed?","The answer to How long until Earth's core solidifies? question cites an estimation that the Earth (as a planet, not the surface of it) has cooled down by about 250K since it was formed.  The question is, just by how much the Earth's effective/average diameter has decreased because of this cooling?   Also, considering that the Earth's crust has appeared ""almost immediately"" -- about a hundred million years -- after the Earth's formation, what has happened to it because if this cooling?  There is also the effect of the Earth's mass increase due to its gravitation pulling cosmic dust as well as cosmic bodies falling onto it, which surpass the loss of mass through the atmosphere, thus slightly increasing the weight of crust and its pressure against the mantle.  Obviously, the crust is too (relatively) thin and weak to allow emptinesses/cavities/hollows appearing under itself because of the shrinkage of the inner matter, so it was breaking in places thus forming continents that float over the mantle and ""falling"" downwards a bit instead, right?  Or the additional volume because of the cooling did not really change the Earth's effective/average diameter at all since the mantle (and deeper layers) was pushing against the crust with high pressure in the first place so the decrease of volume of the Earth's innards did not happen and it all only ended up decreasing the pressure against the crust, thus decreasing volcanic activity instead of changing the effective/average diameter of the planet?  Thanks in advance.  (The question was inspired by Dunno on the Moon scientific fiction novel, which is obviously unrealistic, but is fun to wonder about hypothetically in terms of real-life physics.)

555,Has biology's influence in CO2/Phanerozoic variations been decisive?,"I must say I always as geologist have explained myself CO2 changes at Earth's History in terms of Wilson Cycle. And I always thought biosphere is adapted to geology. But from two questions I link at the botttom, I start to think biology may has had a considerable role in those changes.             Source: Wikipedia. From Gradstein et al.,2005     I formulate my question as: has biology influenced a lot biochemistry of Earth's Carbone atmosphere, or conversely all those changes can be explained just with Plates Tectonic?    Related questions:  Why did the carboniferous period have so much atmospheric oxygen?   How did plants adapt to CO2 levels past 400k years? Why won't they do it again?

556,What goes into a tide power prediction for every fifteen minutes over the next twenty five years?,"I was watching a segment about tidal power generation on a PBS NewsHour broadcast. I've set the time code at about 11:45 to capture a little background. This bit starts at 12:36:     As the tide ebs and flows, the turbines spin between seven and fifteen times a minute, generating power similar to a wind turbine. Cables cary the energy back to shore; first underwater, then underground, where it’s then fed into the national grid.      The tides are so predictable that Atlantis says it can tell how much energy these turbines will generate every fifteen minutes for the next twenty-five years.   What kind of information goes into such a long-term prediction? Is it just the relative positions of the Sun, Earth, and Moon, or something more? I ask because those positions can be calculated for thousands of years, there wouldn't be a cut off at only 25 years, so I assume there's more that goes into it. "
557,Why does the frost depth increase when the surface temperature warms up?,"We've had an unusual winter this year, with a late cold snap that is causing people's underground water lines to freeze. Now that the weather has warmed up quite a bit, even more people's lines are freezing, because the frost is being pushed down even deeper by the thawing ground above it.   What causes this phenomenon? Why does the frost not simply thaw from top to bottom after it warms up? Why does it continue to go deeper? "
558,How do I get the velocity of the P-wave or S-wave without using the travel time graph?,"I'm trying to write a program that would determine the magnitude and epicenter of an earthquake. From [website][tex]  However, I'm not really sure as to what the values Vs and Vp are. From the travel time graph Vs and Vp varies with the distance of the sensor from the earthquake. Given that I have 3 sensors with given latitude and longitude, from which I am able to get the lag time, is there anyway I can estimate the Vs and Vp from these variables?  Otherwise, is there any other way I could get the distance of the sensors from the epicenter? "
559,Where are old Himawari weather satellite images available to the public? Is the 18-Dec-2018 Bearing Sea fireball still there?,"In Scott Manley's new video 173 Kiloton Explosion Over Bering Sea Was Asteroid Breaking Up a bit after 01:30 he says     The good news is that in these days of near-limitless data storage capabilities the internet has a long memory, and we can look at the Himawari satellite which is a weather satellite in geostationary orbit that covers the area in question.    I normally view Himawari images from [website]Question: Where are three-month-old or possibly even year-old Himawari weather satellite images available to the public?

560,Public sources of topographical data of Earth?,"I would like to find sources of topographical data for Earth's surface.  I've looked in GIS SE and Open Data SE but haven't found a good answer to this so I though I'd ask here in Earth Science.   Are there public sites where I can download free topographical data; tables of surface height above a reference surface?  Is it possible to download them in text or tabular form?   I'm looking for resolution of something of the order of 5 meters vertically an 10 horizontally, but there's no specific hard requirement. "
561,Temperature Advection using finite differences with gridded data,"Advection of a scalar quantity, such as temperature (T), by the horizontal wind, is defined as follows:  [tex]  where [tex] is the horizontal wind vector, [tex], being [tex] and [tex] its zonal and meridional components, respectively (source).  To compute it with gridded data, it is convenient to use finite differences (or similar numerical approaches), as pointed here.  Using this method, the following lines written in Python calculate the advection of temperature (TAdv):    dy=111000 # [m] lonres=lon[1]-lon[0] # constant tadv=np.zeros(np.shape(T)); tadv.fill(np.nan) for t in range(np.shape(T)[0]):     for x in np.arange(1,len(lon)-1):         for y in np.arange(1,len(lat)-1):             dx = abs(111000*np.cos(lat[y]*(2*np.pi/360))*lonres)             tadv[t,y,x] = -(u[t,y,x]*(T[t,y,x+1]-T[t,y,x-1])/(2*dx) +\                               v[t,y,x]*(T[t,y+1,x]-T[t,y-1,x])/(2*dy))   I would expect a similar result from scaling the wind components by the temperature, at each grid cell, which is done as follows:    ut  = np.zeros(np.shape(T)) vt  = np.zeros(np.shape(T)) UT  = np.zeros(np.shape(T)) for t in range(np.shape(T)[0]):     for x in range(len(lon)):         for y in range(len(lat)):             ut[t,y,x] = u[t,y,x]*abs(T[t,y,x])             vt[t,y,x] = v[t,y,x]*abs(T[t,y,x])             UT[t,y,x] = ((ut[t,y,x]**2 + vt[t,y,x]**2)**0.5)*np.sign(T[t,y,x])   The magnitude of the scaled wind vectors (UT) would be then similar to this ""amount of transport of T"". It is multiplied by the sign of T (-1 or 1), because T are anomalies (there is T&lt;0), in order to keep its the sign.  However, the results are totally different. What I am missing here? Is it a mistake in this assumption (that both results should look fairly similar)? Or is it a coding problem?  In the figure below, I show the original T, u and v fields (left), and the results of the two above calculations: Tadv with u and v (middle), and the magnitude of the scaled vectors, UT, with the scaled vectors themselves uT and vT (right). TAdv is multiplied by 24*3600, so that the units are K/day.     Here is a link to a Dropbox folder, where the full script and sample data are available for download: [website]"

563,Roughly what proportion of a cloud does 'rain out'?,"What proportion of the water in a cloud will 'rain out'?  Or, comparing the cloud before and after it has rained, what proportion of the water is left afterwards?  I really have no idea so am just looking for an order of magnitude range, is it 50%, 1% or something tiny like 0.00001%?  Edit: I wanted to leave the specifics to the answerer, but maybe an easier question is the difference in amount of water (any form) above the surface before and after rain. "
564,Do normal modes of oscillation cause permanent deformation?,"It is known that when a large earthquake occurs, say [tex], The surface waves travel around Earth over and over, ""ringing the surface like a bell"". The GIF below is an example (Image Source):     Do these normal modes cause permanent deformation AWAY from the earthquake source or does Earth affected simply slide back in place after the wave passes through it? If there is no permeant deformation, why does the surface near (but off source) crack and fault?  "
565,Bifurcation Scenarios in the Atmosphere,"I read that the mathematical definition of bifurcation is that, at a critical value of a parameter that governs the dynamical system, the system changes to a topologically different system than the previous.  I recognize that the scope of this question is large, but still:  Why is this phenomenon relevant in atmospheric sciences?  One can say that since the topology of the systems orbit changed, so different, previously unaccounted for, phenomena will show up - but that is obvious.   Why, if at all, should a climatologist trying to predict a long term time series keep bifurcation in mind, given they can also compute the results numerically within the limits of precision, without explicitly worrying about bifurcation? "
566,Why do those glaciers form on the lee side of the mountains?,"In the Scandinavian mountains, there is a strong effect of orographic precipitation.  The west receives far more precipitation than the east.  This difference can be a factor 5 or more in some places.  But when I observe the locations of glaciers, they seem to be mostly on the eastern side.  An example can be found by studying the Norwegian topographic map near Narvik.  Almost all the glaciers, on Rienatčohkka, Storsteinsfjellet, Ristačohkka, and others, are on the east side of the mountains, while the west side is mostly bare.  If the precipitation is orographic, shouldn't it fall on the west side?  Then why is the east side more glaciated?  Is this a typical effect, or is there a strange situation locally? "
567,How much will sea level rise if all the polar ice melts?,"There are many movies about global warming, which say that melting of all polar ice would cause the whole world to suffer a huge flood. According my research (teachers, TV, Internet) people hold one of these two viewpoints:   There will be a huge flood, because the polar ice has a huge volume. There won't be any flood, because the volume of polar ice is small compared to the whole world.   Which one is correct, if all the polar ice melts? What would be the approximate sea-level change (in meters), if this were to happen? "
568,Measurement of groundwater levels,"There are numerous measurement systems available for measuring groundwater levels (head / stage). What period of time should measurements be collected in order to draw solid conclusions about the average groundwater level, min/ max, trends, etc?  I would reckon at least one year to take account for seasonal effects, although longer would be preferable.  Long measurement periods (several years) are often unwanted, due to the need for fast results. So the optimum between research duration and solid conclusions lies somewhere in between I presume.   EDIT: There is a factory which is investigating the possible use of groundwater for their industrial process. Enviromental law dictates that the effects of the substraction on the long term groundwaterlevels have to be investigated.  The first question then becomes: what is the current long term variability in groundwaterlevel? Only then we can continue with answering what the effects of the substraction will be. "
569,Is global warming occuring only because of humans?,"I learned that human activities produce gases that deplete the ozone layer, and create the greenhouse layer, which increases the world's temperature. (And seems real , now in Thailand it's 35 degree Celsius)    Now. I want to know that if there isn't any human activities that causes changes to atmosphere , Which statement is correct?   The earth will be cool. As the same temperature as before the industries age. It's only human's fault that makes the world hotter. The earth will be gradually hotter. In the past there are ""ice age"". And Now there might just be ""hot age"". Humans activities are just make the process faster.    Can we point out which statement is currently correct? If not , you can add your own statement and if you are able to explain , do it. "
570,Lab procedure for analyzing/assessing the presence of semi-volatile solids,"I'm looking for a lab experiment design that shows how to measure the presence of semi-volatile solids in water (and not sludge or soil or solids).

572,Why is earth's axis tilted?,"Why is the axis of earth tilted?  It can't possibly be that the Northern hemisphere is larger causing it to be pulled toward the sun, because then it would always be summer in the N hemisphere and winter in the S hemisphere.  If the cause for the tilt is because a large space object collided with earth offsetting the axis, then wouldn't earth keep moving in the direction of the collision?  Any insite would be appreciated. "
573,is the low-compressibility of seawater responsible for its bouyancy?,"I'm trying to wrap my head around water's density, low-compressibillity and bouyancy. Are all these 3 things related, if so, how?   I'm particularly interested if water's low compresibillity of responsible for the physiological appearance of marine organisims.  For example, small marine organisms are held by the density of water and as a result have amorphous spherical bodies suspended in a relatively viscous material. On the other hand, larger organisms need to move quickly through dense water and have stream-lined bodies. Consequently, you can deduce an organism's body size simply by looking at their body shape.   Or a briefer example, marine mammals' body weight are supported against gravity by the buoyancy of water, hence why oxygen-breathing marine mammals die when stranded as a result of crushing their organs through body weight.  Is the low-compressibillity of water responsible for these characteristics in marine organisims?   "
574,Thermohaline: Why is cold and dense seawater salty when warm water holds more dissolved salts?,"I read that thermohaline circulation is caused by cold and saline water sinking, while warm and less dense water rises. link  I understand that saline water is more dense, as there is a higher mass due to dissolved salts.  However, decreasing the temperature of water decreases the solubility, so in theory, shouldn't cold water hold less salt than warm water?   Vice-versa, shouldn't warm equatorial water increase in density as it is able to hold more salt? "
575,How this sedimentary rock is made?,"Apologies in advance for a beginners question. Different rock types make me curious and recently went to an area where interesting sedimentary rock is all over. As the area is on the coast, sea has washed away some soil and is making it easy to observe rocks.  This sedimentary rocks is composed of different pieces. Sometimes the pieces are in different color, while other times are white. I took an image of a typical rock:     How such sedimentary rock is made? In which period of crust formation? Can you point me to links where I can learn more about it? "
576,How long will it take for the ocean to erode Rockall?,"Loosely related to the question Will the ocean eventually erode all land?:  How long will it take for the ocean to erode Rockall (an uninhabited granite islet within the exclusive economic zone of the United Kingdom)?    On the assumption that plate tectonics is paused. (If you know that plate tectonics will carry rockal below the waves before it erodes please do mention this in your answer!)  I understand that the rate and size of storms will have an effect, both of which are unpredictable, therefore I am more than happy with an order of magnitude indication.  If you have any sources to back up numbers you've used in calculations, such as the rate of erosion of the basalt, that would be great, as I would love to do some further research. "
577,Does the size of Earth increase due to volcanism?,"In a volcanic eruption, magma rushes to the 'outside' of the Earth. Does this mean the size of Earth also increases? If not, how is the volume left after the magma rushed out refilled? "
578,"Ions & elements, which is the correct terminology to use when discussing chemical compounds in Earth Science?","Different textbooks use different terminologies when discussing the same chemical compounds, for example when discussing the minerals...   Elements / Compounds     Sulfide minerals consist of metallic elements in chemical combination with the element sulfur Phosphate are a group of minerals of one or more metallic elements chemically associated with the phosphate compound PO4  Ions     Sulfide ions (S[tex]-) bond with a number of positive ions to form the sulfides Phosphorous in the form of phosphate ions (PO4[tex]-) binds with positive ions to form the phosphate minerals    Are element/compounds and ions the same thing? If they are the same, why the two terms? Which is better terminology?  I'm just after a basic understanding of how elements form rocks and being able to differentiate between this terminology is beyond my layman abilities.  "
579,Seismology: What causes an earthquake?,"I am doing a research on earthquakes but I cannot fully understand what causes earthquakes.     ""Caused by a sudden releases of energy by the Earth's crust, causing   seismic waves which causes the ground to shake.""      ""Energy release associated with rapid movement on active faults is the   cause of most earthquakes.""      ""Earthquakes are usually caused when rock underground suddenly breaks   along a fault. This sudden release of energy causes the seismic waves   that make the ground shake.""   I have been puzzled by these statements and I really can't seem to understand.  Do these mean that energy is released by the earth's crust then produces seismic waves, then the seismic waves make the ground shake?  Does it also mean that earthquakes often most on faults because the release of energy and seismic waves occurs near or on a fault? "
580,volcanic effects on the climate during Pangaea,"Which influence does the constellation of the continents have on the global climate? Was the biosphere more susceptible to climatic effects a volcanic eruption may cause during the Permian than it is today?   We know that eruptions of volcanoes can influence the global climate and we know that during the Permian period the continents drifted together to a supercontinent extending from the South Pole along the meridian almost to the North Pole. At such a constellation of the land mass, it's imaginable that an eruption of a volcano may have triggered a chain of effects which caused a change of the global climate which was different than we could expect in our current environment.   Are there any evidences from a palaeontological point of view that such a concentration of the land mass strengthened the rise of the global temperature (which probably killed many species) after the release of greenhouse gas a volcano might have caused?  "
581,Is it hotter in different places with the same air temperature?,"I am from (and live in) Minnesota, USA. In the summer here it always reaches temperatures in the 90s (F) for periods of time but not every week. The humidity is often high and the dew point often tropical.  My wife is from Guangdong province in the south east region of China. The temperature there most closely resembles Florida, USA. It is usually in the 90s during the summer instead of sometimes. It is always humid and feels tropical.  My wife, her friends and family routinely comment on how incredibly hot it is in China. They say people often don't even go outside because it's so hot. They say it is not like Minnesota, but much worse.  My question then... how? Is this merely perception of growing up in a tropical environment without artificial climate control or is there science that backs up their claims? If our regions are the same air temperature with similar humidity and dew points, I don't understand how it can feel so much hotter there. "
582,Making Sense of Coldwater Ocean Currents,"The basic understanding of ocean currents is that warm currents carry moisture whereas cold currents carry nutrients.  This is why some scientists believe in the connection between the Arctic ice caps and the warm Gulf Stream and the frigid Humboldt and Benguela currents turning the tropical lands of Chile and Namibia bone-dry.  With that, there are some confusions with the workings of coldwater ocean currents.  Antarctica is surrounded by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, a coldwater current, yet it is covered in mile after mile of frozen water.  The Pacific coast of North America is nurtured by coldwater currents, yet we see temperate rainforests.  So what's going on?  Why are there habitats that require a lot of moisture near coldwater ocean currents that can't carry that much? "
583,"Why is Vladivostock so cold, while Dalian is so warm?","Over at SE History we're pondering the relation of temperature to Russian motives in establishing its Port Arthur colony in the late 1800's.  Wikipedia says that Vladivostok is cold due to the Siberian High. Meanwhile, in my answer, I repeated what I learned decades ago in my high school earth science class about ocean currents and why Port Arthur was warmer. (Port Arthur was located near the modern large city of Dalian)  Another astute SE member in the comments pointed out that trade winds are more responsible than ocean currents for weather effects.  What is the truth for these two places? (Note that we are asking more about Winter than summer, as both places would make fine summertime 19th century ports)   Also, was Vladivostok significantly colder 120 years ago than it is now?   "
584,Amount of Earths water with consideration to space travel?,"Everyone always says that there has always been, and always will be, the same amount of water on planet Earth.  What about space travel?  They obviously need water in space, so they must take it up with them. Take the International Space Station: astronauts must survive up there for around 6 months. And yes, I know they have ways to recycle it, but it must eventually be ""refreshed"".  I know that it makes the only teeniest, smallest of differences (a few hundred gallons taken from billions of gallons), but could that phrase be proved wrong?  Thanks in advance!  Note: I put this on the Earth Science SE because I couldn't find anywhere else it would fit. "
585,How Common is Volcanic Tuff?,"Volcanic tuff was a key material in the Roman invention of concrete, something that modern concrete, or ""Portland cement"", lacked.  With tuff, not only would Roman concrete be waterproof, it would also harden as it would get older.  For the concerns of both geologists and construction designers, how common is volcanic tuff?    As an example for what I'm looking for, this map shows grey veins of coal.  Is there a similar map showing global distribution of volcanic tuff deposits? "
586,Is there a 'standard size' for volcanic eruptions in terms of gas output?,"We saw recently the Iceland volcano Eyjafjallajökull produced significant gaseous output that impacted the flight paths of several planes.   When we look at volcanic gas components, we see they produce:   water vapor (H2O) carbon dioxide (CO2) sulfur either as sulfur dioxide (SO2) (high-temperature volcanic gases) or hydrogen sulfide (H2S) nitrogen argon helium neon methane carbon monoxide hydrogen    I'm trying to answer the question - ""how many 'standard volcanic eruptions' does it take to product X moles of sulfur dioxide."" Can I do it in terms of Y number of Mount St. Helens 1980 eruptions?  My question is: Is there a 'standard size' volcanic eruption in terms of gas output? "
587,Why do we see the limestone on top of Cambrian layer?,"The official story says like Cambrian Ordovician transition was caused/accompanied by animals learned how to build the Ca-based skeletons. These skeletons and shells started to fall upon the sea bed causing the rich and durable limestone formations on top of earth crust. I wonder didn't limestone form itself in pre-Cambrian epochs? You already had the CaO in the primordial crust (I wonder why do you give the leverage to he people who chronically cannot understand a question even after it was answered). You do not need animals for the CaO to react with CO2. Actually, there was much more CO2 even before Cambrian, billions of years ago. But we do not see any limestone formations at that time. So, why do we see the limestone on the top layer sediments 460-60 mln years ago rather than at the very bottom of the crust? "
588,How should core-rim detrital zircon ages be reported in a sedimentary provenance study?,"I understand this might be drifting into the black hole of subjectivity but I would like to know if anyone knows if there is a generally accepted practice. If one has a detrital zircon with a core age of 1100 Ma and a rim age of 400 Ma and one wanted to construct one of the many graphs for visualizing such data (e.g. KDE, PDP, histogram plots), would one report both ages or only one? If only one age is to be reported, then does one choose the core or the rim? If you choose the core, then perhaps it reveals something about the ultimate source of the zircon. But the rim would most likely represent the source from which the sediment was derived (this being the goal of a provenance study!). However, if you have other detrital zircons in your sample that yield an age of 1100 Ma then perhaps one can include both the core and rim ages? "
589,The age of tectonic plates,"There is information which says that East European Platform sticks out at the Baltic Sea and, therefore, we can see the ordovican layer in Estonia whereas crystalline Paleoproterosoic basement crops up in the Finland.     What does that mean? I see that other layers are cambrian and ordovican, which means that they were formed 500 and 400 mln years ago. Does it mean that East European Platform has formed 2 giga years ago when we had the Paleoproterozoic era? I ask because it is hard to believe that we could have the magma cristallization at that scale to solidify over the whole continents. I expect that these processes that shield formation has finihsed in the range 5-4 giga years ago and pretty solidified Earth existed for ~ca 2 bln years before Paloproterozoic ever begun. Why is that platform called Paleoproterozoic? "
590,Prevailing Winds: Is the speed relevant?,"The Wikipedia entry for prevailing winds notes (in my understanding) that the prevailing wind direction is determined solely by the mode of the directions. They note another qualifier called 'dominant wind' which should give the direction of the strongest wind.  However, it feels a bit counter-intuitive that if we had (an example) over 8h a wind from the east at 2m/s and after that a 10m/s wind from the north for 4h, that the prevailing wind direction would still be east.   Based on the above example, would the prevailing wind direction be east?   Is the term 'dominant wind' (with a northerly direction) used in common meteorology, and would that be (in the above example) northerly? "
591,What are the Theoretical Limits for Tornado Size and Strength,"Is there a theoretical physical limit that we can calculate with regards to Tornado formation? At what size and strength is a hypothetical tornado physically impossible.  The largest tornado in recorded history was the El Reno tornado at 2.6 miles wide on May 31, 2013. The fastest wind speeds ever recorded were 301 miles per hour in Moore OK May 3, 1999.  *Edit for clarity: How would the physical properties of air constrain the size and strength of a tornado and can we estimate the largest and strongest tornado physically possible? "
592,Single-layer water content variables,"In different reanalysis products (ERA 20C and NOAA/OAR/ESRL/PSD 20th Century daily data specifically) one can find the following variables:   Total column water (ERA)  Total column rain water (ERA) Total column water vapor (ERA) Total column cloud liquid water (ERA) Cloud water content (NOAA) Precipitable water content (NOAA)   How are they calculated? What are the differences between them? Could you please cite a reference or book in which this is explained in details?  Which of these may serve as a best approximation to represent large-scale patterns of rainfall (monsoonal cycles)?  Which of these is the vertically integrated specific moisture?  Are any of these equivalent to the vertically integrated moisture flux divergence as an approximation for precipitation, as in Banacos and Schultz (2005)? "
593,Correlation and causation,"Linear correlation (Pearson's) is vastly applied in meteorology/climatology to assess the relationship between two variables, say precipitation and SST, for example.  However, we know that correlation does not necessarily imply causation, mainly for two factors: there may be external factors acting on both series or spurious coincidences may also happen.   What are possible and comprehensible ways, that have been used and are possible to reproduce in the Earth Sciences (Meteorology, Oceanography, Clmatology...), to go further and make a point to show that correlation does imply causation in some situations?  EDIT to make it more specific:  Imagine correlation is found between sea surface temperature (SST) in some region and rainfall in another. How to test if the variability of the two series are not being externally forced by a third party?  Thank you. "
594,How to properly setup a domain in NWP model (WRF) according to meteorological input data,"I want to setup a mesoscale weather prediction model (WRF or something else) to work with NCEP/GFS meteorological input data with resolution of 0.25deg. My question is how to choose a proper size for the parent domain, considering the resolution of the input data. In my case GFS resolution is around 20km in mid latitudes, is it necessary for my parent domain to be around this value - for example 18km (or 21km) and then use nested domains to go down to 2km.  18km>6km>2km  Or i can start directly with parent domain size 2km? What will be the effect of this big gap 20km to 2km?  Do i need a longer spinup so i can resolve clouds for example, if i choose to start straight with 2km resolution? Am i going to miss some kinetic energy from the coarse meteorological input because of dissipation not represented properly? I suppose computation time is not much more if i use 18>6>2km compared to starting directly with 2km. From my experience with WRF, finer domains take most of the time to be computed -ar. 85% in my specific setup. "
595,Relative UVB reflectance of white cloth vs aluminum,"Which reflects more UVB from the sun, a flat laying white cloth sheet, or a flat laying aluminum sheet? Ie. Which material would reflect a wavelength of 280 to 315 nm best? "
596,How are deposits of metals like tantalum located?,"I am curious of how metal deposits are located in general, but to keep my question focused I wanted to just ask about tantalum for example.  Are there people who traverse their own country drilling core samples here and there? What indicators would they be looking for tantalum in particular? "
597,Is there a formula to calculate shoreline length or water position from ocean?,"Assuming in the past the water of the oceans were lower does it also mean that the water was not where it is right now?   If yes, then how do we calculate approximately where the water would have been 300 or 1000 years ago? "
598,What could the ball of cloud I saw be?,"I wish I had a picture of this thing I saw, and I did try to video it, but then they hurtled very quickly out of sight.   Anyway, I will try to explain. . .   You know when you're up in a plane in the sky, you can see clouds in 'individual' balls? Well, it was about to rain yesterday and the sky was dark. Then suddenly I could see something like a very big, dirty, semi-transparent ball of cotton wool-like cloud hurtling towards me and over my roof. Then another, and then another. By the time I ran outside to try and video them, I could only see one very far off and it was going in a different direction.  The thing about it was that it wasn't like the entire mass of clouds moving across the sky, but it was like balls of clouds or gas, and they were just stumbling across the sky like they had been detached and blown away. And they were not looking nice or anything, but like a pocket of bad gas or something.  I have very little knowledge of science and I wonder if anyone is familiar with and can tell me what I saw? "
599,Can the atmosphere affect the composition of igneous rocks?,"Recently I was reading 'How to build a habitable planet' by Langmuir and Broecker and in chapter 15 they speak about how Life has led to a difference in oxidation potential in the atmosphere, essentially leading to the earth becoming a fuel cell. They also spoke about how this led to certain ions being oxidized - ie uraninite to uranyl oxide, iron to hematite.  I was wondering if this could mean that as atmospheric composition would affect the sea floor, when this subducted it would affect the melt of the mantle - as far as I'm aware, it is the dehydration of the subducting slab which allows for the hydration, and therefore melt, of the mantle in regions such as Japan. If the subducting slab's composition is affected by the atmosphere, could this have any effect on the composition of the igneous rocks formed? Would this be detectable?  Thank you. "
600,How do we calculate if a meteoroid will completely burn up in the atmosphere?,"Most meteoroids burn up in the atmosphere, so they don't impact the Earth's surface.  Factors that seem important include:   size and mass of the meteoroid angle of meteoroid's path through the atmosphere latitude where meteoroid enters Earth's atmosphere speed of meteoroid relative to Earth's movement   Are there other factors that are needed to calculate if a meteoroid will burn up in the atmosphere?  How do we calculate if a meteoroid will completely burn up in the atmosphere?   "
601,How do I convert a latitude/longitude coordinate to a NOAA GFS grid cell location?,"Looking at this GFS [website]The range defined by the second and third set of brackets specify the grid coordinates, however I'm not sure how to convert between what NOAA is using and the common geographic coordinate system.   What would the NOAA equivalent be for this coordinate pair: (36.25, -78.75)? "
602,"Could this study ""totally dismantle"" Global Warming claims?","Could this study ""totally dismantle"" Global Warming claims?  That's the assertion made in the article ‘Bombshell’ climate-change study could totally dismantle the claim humans are causing global warming.  Quoting from the study:     ""The conclusive findings of this research are that the three GAST data   sets are not a valid representation of reality,” the authors wrote.   “In fact, the magnitude of their historical data adjustments, that   removed their cyclical temperature patterns, are totally inconsistent   with published and credible U.S. and other temperature data. Thus, it   is impossible to conclude from the three published GAST data sets that   recent years have been the warmest ever — despite current claims of   record setting warming.""   On reading that article I noticed that they name but do not link to the article nor it's publisher. I was able to find it here: On the Validity of NOAA, NASA and Hadley CRU Global Average Surface Temperature Data &amp; The Validity of EPA’s CO2 Endangerment Finding (pdf), but that's on a Wordpress site, not a credible scientific journal, as far as I can tell.  Further googling only turned up more references in political-influence sources like TheBlaze.com.  The one place that may be presenting as something that they published is the Heartland Institute (here), but I cannot tell if they are legit or not.  There is no publication information in the paper itself, nor any evidence of formal ""peer-review"" other than the list of scientists(?) on page 2 who affirm that they agree with the conclusions (which is not my understanding of what peer-review means nor of how it works).  I also have some trouble following the reasoning of their findings and conclusions, which seems like a bit of a logical leap.  So, my questions are:   Is this a legitimate peer-reviewed scientific paper as they claimed How legitimate/credible is their methodology? How legitimate/credible are their findings?  And is this really something new? Is it published anywhere, and has there been any open scientific review, critique or commentary of it? Does this paper really represent a credible threat to current climate change theories?  "
603,"Is it possible to determine where gold might be found based on a map, and if so, how?","Is it possible to locate potential gold deposits using maps that describe dominant rock type, altitude, vegetation, or geological formations?  (I realize that the location would probably still have to be verified by traveling to the actual site. I am only looking for information that serves as an indicator of potential gold reserves.)  For the sake of this question I am assuming of course that these maps would not directly list gold deposits or existing or past gold mining operations.  What kind of information would a map need to contain in order to derive an indication of gold deposits from it? "
604,Are the oceans rising or the continents going down? How can we know?,"The century old sustained rising of oceans, at a rate of 2-4 mm/y, remains a unexplained phenomenon; there is no correlation with temperature variations, so it is not due to the thermal variation of the volume of the oceans or to a decrease of Antarctic ice (which in fact is increasing).  A possibility, given that this raise of the oceans is not absolute but relative to coast, is that it is not the oceans’ absolute level that is raising but the continents that are sinking. A possible cause is global oscillations of the mantle surface level, and tectonic plates move up and down besides drifting.  Another cause is the solidification of the mantle under continental plates due to the decrease of Earth internal temperature. What do you think? Are the oceans rising or the continents going down (in average)? Only satellite measurements can solve the riddle?  "
605,Will the ocean eventually erode all land?,"It seems as if the 'lowest energy' state for the Earth is to not have any mountains and that given enough time, the oceans would erode all land. Essentially it's an argument like entropy. And I mean in the far future, once tectonic activity has ceased.  Is this the case, and if so how long might it take? If it is not the case, why not? "
606,What's it like inside a natural gas cavern on Earth?,I suppose natural gas underground caverns on Earth have substantial volume and gas is in gaseous form there.  As such I wonder how it would look like inside such cavern (with artificial light of course). Will one see a rocky sky at big distance?  What is the actual volume of such caverns? It is correct to talk about methane oceans or seas?  Are they empty or the gas is mixed up with solid substance? 
607,The relation between the magnitude and duration of earthquake,"I am asking this question in reference to the recent earthquake that struck Nepal last month. I read that the magnitude 7.8 richter scale earhtquake would have caused more damage had it lasted for longer time. In case of Nepal it lasted for nearly 30 seconds. I also read that that magnitude scale was not able to release all the energy that has been stored in the form of strain in the plate.  So what I wanted to ask is that if that earthquake had lasted for more time, would it have released more energy? Similarly does an earthquake of magnitude, say 6, would release energy just as equal to 7.8 if it lasted for more time? "
608,"Can climate change cause earthquakes, tsunamis, or volcanic eruptions?","Different scientists have brought forth a theory that climate change can cause earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. For example:   Professor Bill McGuire of University College London in his book Waking the Giant: How a changing climate triggers earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanoes (OUP, 2012). Giampiero Iaffaldano of the Australian National University, for example in this article or this article.   What is the general view among Earth scientists on this theory? How strong is the evidence that supports or refutes this theory?  "
609,Confusion on the Nepal earthquake expert statements,"Nepal hit by second huge earthquake and more are still to come  Equally big earthquake coming in eastern region of Nepal  Nepal quake followed historic pattern  The experts on mentioned on the first and second link says that the big earthquake is coming on the eastern side of Nepal whereas the expert on third link says the big earthquake is coming on the western and southern Nepal.  First of all, I don't understand why experts are predicting a big earthquake in the eastern region once again as the fault there has already ruptured. According to the expert mentioned in new scientist,the fault zones can be seen like a 3D zipper. If it is so, the one side of the zipper has opened up(in this case eastern side), then it is western and southern ones that remains to be opened up. (1)So then should not it be affecting western and southern sides?  (2)Similarly, if another earthquake does occur, will that earthquake have the same epicenter as that of the previous one? (3)Also will it affect the region where the fault lines running through it have previoulsy been ruptured? "
610,Stochastic seismic inversion,"Could anyone recommend a free and reliable software capable of Stochastic seismic inversion for my project? am aware that Petrel is capable of Genetic inversion based on a non-linear multi-trace approach but i have no clue what that is about, I prefer stochastic method because it is more reliable. Any help? "
611,Simulating the earths crust,"I would like to create a computer simulation which would fold two plane-ish surfaces into two crumpled-ish surfaces. This in order to simulate the earths crust movement and collisions resulting in mountain chains, vallies and hills etc.  Is there any existing calculations or models for this? Are these models already put into computer simulations or are they just available on paper?  What is the math behind this? "
612,How does the influence of clouds on climate vary with height?,"It is generally assumed that clouds affect climate by reflecting sunlight back to space and therefore decreasing the total warming of the Earth.  However, stratospheric ice clouds are said to have a net warming effect, due to (I think) the insulation properties of clouds and the low reflectivity of ice clouds.    How do various clouds affect climate?  Specifically, what is the relative energy balance effect clouds have as you go up in the atmosphere?  Is it just stratospheric ice clouds that have a net warming effect?  What really are the insulation properties of a cloud and how do they compare to the reflectivity?  "
613,Digging depth and heat,"I have a question about the underground heat at different distances from the core of the Earth.  I was wondering if there was a depth at which you can dig that the decrease in heat (as a result of being lower) and the increase in heat due to the depth that you dug that the loss of heat was the same as the gain in heat.  Here are the assumptions that I am using:   The lower an object is, the cooler the air around it and therefore the cooler the object can become. Cold air tends to sink below heated air. (I'm thinking like a basement is cooler than the top floor during summer without air conditioning). The deeper you dig towards the centre of the earth, the hotter your surroundings become. (While there may be some initial decrease in temperature, I'm assuming as you dig towards the mantle or core the hotter the ground around you is).   I am holding constant the heat from the sun and atmosphere. Is there a defined depth at which the loss of heat (from falling cool air) = gain in heat (from the heat of the earth)? Does the shape of the hole dug affect the depth at which this occurs? "
614,How to tell if a single day of weather is an anomaly or due to climate change?,"I am interested in understanding how to tell if a single day of 'abnormal' weather is due to climate change or not.   From my understanding, you would compare this day's weather to historical weather. However, is a day-to-day comparison accurate? Or would you have to take a large sample, like week, month, or season?   It seems to me like it would be hard to compare one day to another historical weather average, because the day could just be an outlier not due to climate change...  In other words, how do you tell if a seasonal storm or really hot summer day is due to climate change? "
615,How can I learn to spot fossils and fossil-bearing rocks on the Jurassic coast?,"Due to a pleasant change in my circumstances, I have been to Lyme Regis several times recently, and it seems as though I'm going to be a regular visitor over the next few years.  As a former biologist I found the experience of combing the shore of the famous Jurassic coast for fossils to be delightfully addictive. Having spent about six hours over three days doing so, I've amassed a decent collection of ammonite fragments. Having got the bug for doing this, I'm eager to try and find some more impressive specimens.  Chatting to some of the local palaeontologists on the beach it became apparent that to do so you need to split rocks, and that you need to know which rocks to split. It's also clear to me that while I've become attuned to watching for the shapes and patterns indicative of ammonites, I don't yet have the eye for the other colours and shapes of fossil shells and bones.  I tried to do some reading about the geology of the region, but most of what I found online was either too basic (i.e. aimed at non-scientists) or too advanced (i.e. aimed at actual geologists) for me.  So: how can I learn to better spot fossils and fossil bearing rocks in this region? I'd be very interested to learn some geology if it would help, but if that's the case, how can I find material pitched to the right level?  "
616,What is a mud diapir and how does it form?,"Mud diapirs are relatively common features in seismic reflection images. What is a mud diapir? How is it different from a mud volcano? What are their common characteristics (size, age, composition)? How are they formed and preserved?  Source [website]"
617,Does earth itself emit electromagnetic waves?,"(.... and if so, of what frequency and amplitude)?  This Skeptics.SE question about nonsense called 'geopathic stress' made me wonder if and how earth itself emits electromagnetic waves.  We need moving charges for that, and I can hardly imagine that things like moving magma or 'moving' radioactive minerals would 'emit' anything, but maybe I'm missing something?  I'm not asking about atmospheric phenomena, or about externally introduced electrical currents (man made, lightning). "
618,Determining hardness using teeth,"So I know scratch tests are pretty common to quickly get an estimate of a rocks hardness. Also tooth enamel is a common material with a 5 on mohs scale. So far so good, but what shocked me is that I heard students on field trips actually use their own teeth sometimes to determine hardness.   The obvious explanation is that I've been fooled, which I expect will be the answer.   But if this is really true, how do your teeth survive? Or is it just an occupational hazard that you're going to need dentures before your thirties as a geologist?  Disclaimer: this question comes from a story someone told me some time ago, whose girlfriend studied earth sciences. I found it implausible then, but it keeps bugging me and I can't find information on this except that gold miners probably routinely lost their teeth during the 19th century. "
619,How high could snow form on a mountain?,"I was reminded recently of a moment in the Eragon books where the main characters see a ""tall"" mountain range, and then after a minute realize that the white sky stretching up above them is just mountains too, covered in snow. Which got me wondering - if there was a mountain that reached to space, obviously there would be some point above which snow would not accumulate. Where would this be?  Thoughts: I know most of the Earth's moisture is in the troposphere, so it seems reasonable to assume it would be confined to that region - but higher clouds like nacreous and noctilucent clouds are made of ice crystals, which could conceivably deposit on a mountain. Or would this be rare enough that it would sublimate faster than it could accumulate? "
620,Why high tides occur simultaneously on opposite sides of the Earth?,"From this question, this picture:      As tides are mostly (2/3) due to gravity pull from the moon, I'd expect water is pulled in the direction of the moon, and high tide occurs only on the side facing the moon. Why is there a high tide opposite to this location?  Probably the same answer for this linked question: When the moon is located between the sun and the earth, and gravity from both bodies adds, shouldn't water on the night side be at its lowest height?

622,Just how dry could Ben Nevis get? Is this surprising?,"The BBC article Soggy Ben Nevis can be remarkably dry describes results of a crowdscience effort to transcribe historical meteorological records recorded manually by researchers living on top of ""Ben Nevis - the highest mountain in Britain.""     The revelation that this notoriously wet peak should have times of near-zero humidity comes from the analysis of a newly recovered, unique data-set.      Weather observations were made around the clock by a group of men who lived atop Ben Nevis from 1883 to 1904.      Their records have now been digitised for modern science by volunteers.   Question: Just how dry could Ben Nevis get? Is this surprising?  Are there highly unusual conditions that must occur for the humidity atop Ben Nevis to drop as low as they are reporting, or in hindsight is this unsurprising?   "

632,Why an inertial gyro has a frequency and a geostrophic gyro does not?,"Inertial flow is given by the balance between Coriolis and centrifugal forces. A geostrophic flow is given by a balance between Coriolis and the gradients of pressure. The frequency of the inertial flow is the Coriolis frequency (at 43.5N, the Coriolis frequency is [tex] [tex], which is equivalent to an inertial period of 17.4h). To me this is just the time that a particle takes to perform a full rotation around its center of rotation. Why does this peak shows up in plot like this? Is it because is carrying around a flow field at a certain smaller scale? In a perfect Inertial gyro, since it is at steady state, if you sample in one point you get always the same velocity, right? A perfect geostrophic balance does not have rotation, and I understand that in that case we would have frequency=0. But a little departure from that could give rise to large scale geostrophic gyro (like low pressure systems in the athmosphere). Would not that gyro be associated with a frequency, in the same way the inertial gyro has a frequency?  Why it is common to say the geostrophic flows do not have a frequency? For a geostrophic gyro it still takes a certain time to rotate around a center of rotation. "

636,How can agricultural ammonia lead to PM2.5 production in the atmosphere?,"The NPR News article Growing Corn Is A Major Contributor To Air Pollution, Study Finds talks about all sources of pollution associated with growing corn, and it singles out the application of ammonia to the soil as a surprisingly polluting aspect.  The article says that the ammonia which escapes the soil and is released into the atmosphere ultimately leads to the production of PM2.5 and is a major source of pollution harmful to people. It links to the new paywalled paper in Nature Air-quality-related health damages of maize.  Question: What would be the chemical and/or physical processes by which traces of ammonia in the air would lead to PM2.5 production?   From the article:     The study estimates that ""4,300 premature deaths can be attributed to corn production,"" says Hill. ""That's about a quarter of all [air pollution-related] agricultural deaths. That's significant.""      The vast majority, 86 percent, of PM2.5 emissions happen on farms, with the rest occurring elsewhere in the supply chain, according to the study. The main culprit?      Fertilizer application.      ""Ammonia from fertilizer application accounted for about 70 percent of attributable deaths,"" says Hill. The nitrogen in fertilizers helps fuel plant growth, but not all of it can be used by the plant. ""Some of that nitrogen washes into waterways, and some of it gets released into the atmosphere as ammonia,"" says Hill.      Once ammonia hits the atmosphere, it reacts with other particles, mostly nitrogen and sulfur oxides, to form PM2.5, according to Hill.     From the question in Biology SE Why do soil bacteria produce nitrous oxide as a result of anhydrous ammonia fertilizer application?:     below: Anhydrous ammonia tanks in a newly planted wheat field. Walmart has promised big cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases. To meet that goal, though, the giant retailer may have to persuade farmers to use less fertilizer. It won't be easy.

637,What effect does concretization (paving/flooring with concrete) has on ground water table,"I am a newbie for hydrology. If the question seems to have ""well known answer"", I appreciate if you point me to the resources. I will add details to the question based on comments.  Consider a town of 30km x 30km, nearby a hill, in a place where rain averages 40cm per year. The town is at an average elevation of 30m compared to the surroundings. It gets water mainly from rain. The water table seems to drop off as we walk away from the hill (30m near the hill, 90m once we walk 30km away from the hill).  If we concertize the town (fill every road, every open place with concrete 1m thick), what effect would that have on water table (water availability in earth)? Would the water flow away and sink into outer places (away from the town)? "

My area is a bit too small for the Köppen Map to correctly reveal patterns.  I'll be getting a weather station etc. soon, but it'll take a few months to a year before I have enough data to work with. But right now I have some experimental planting to do, so..   My question is, if you were at around 5800ft in a tropical/subtropical region of India, would the climate then be more like a temperate zone or an alpine climate, but with monsoons?  To put it another way, my question has a general aspect to it too, which is: what happens to a tropical zone as the land increases in elevation? Does it become more ""temperate"" or ""alpine"" for all practical purposes? And what ""tropical"" factors remain in effect (for example, sunlight, I'm guessing)?   If I sound confused about how this stuff works, I would love if someone could direct me to a guide of some kind too!  Further information: It's in the Nilgiri Hills, Tamil Nadu, in a region called Bengal Mattam. There's a small stream that runs through the farm, right at the border, all along the lowest point of our farm/the hillside. The stream then turns sharply and in one kilometer from that turning point, empties into an irregularly shaped reservoir, which is about 669 meters from one end to other, and about 250 on two other extremes.

Do models that store output in this calendar run on a more physically accurate timestep and then somehow interpolate to a different calendar, or are they actually simulating on a 360 calendar? If they're actually using a 360 calendar, how does that work? Is incoming solar radiation simply parameterised in an interpolated way across the year for 360 days of regular duration? I can't imagine that the days are stretched out to account for being 1.5% fewer.  Does any of this have a substantial impact on the results? "

659,Why is the night very bright in the Himalayas?,"Some years ago I had the chance to climb the Himalayas. Not the Everest of course, but the Annapurna Base Camp which is about 4km above sea level.  During the night of the stay I went out to do some stargazing and I found that the night was very bright, so bright that I was able to make out letters on a book. (Of course I didn't read.) I figured that since there was practically no light coming from the ground within several kilometers to illuminate the air, the light from the moon and the stars were comparatively bright (just the opposite of why we can't see stars clearly from a city).  But recently it hit me that, well, night is supposed to be dark. Anyone who lived outside cities will tell me that.  Lack of light source from the ground will make the moon appear brighter because there will be greater contrast but it won't make moonlight reaching the ground any brighter, will it? So this confused me. How was that night in the Himalayas so bright? Is it an expected thing if I'm so high up, or are there some factors that might have made that particular night so bright? Or are nights outside cities normally bright regardless of the altitude (assuming clear sky and near-full moon)?  One thing I suppose could be the reason is that the thinner air due to the altitude meant there was less scattering of the light. I'm not sure if the air was thin enough to make such a difference though. "

First guess was that the temperature of the would impact its density (for example, here's the data for -50° and 50° c) - though this does not appear to show the cause of why is the troposphere 8km higher at the equator than the poles.

664,What would a replacement for SEGY look like?,"I have been having a miserable time this week reading SEGY files. This is data from the largest seismic acquisition company in the world whose client is the 7th largest oil company in the world. So if anyone could get it right you would think it would be these two.   The SEGY standard for storing seismic data is used throughout the oil industry but is showing it's age quite badly. Problems include:   non standard header information the textual header can be in ASCII or EBCDIC crazy machinations to save a few bytes binary data stored in IEEE or IBM floating point etc.    Some of the most glaring deficiencies are being patched up with a v2 release in the works. Details are here: [website]This is not a standard you can implement just by reading the spec and this new version won't help fix that. The continual abuse of the standard means that it takes calendar years to 'debug into existence' a library that can withstand real world data files. This is hugely frustrating for both the software developers and the geoscientists who have to work with it.   There was a discussion on this excellent blog recently where HDF5 was mentioned    [website][website]I would prefer to see a new standard that is less complicated than SEGY and with no dependencies on third party libraries. So while I think technologies like HDF5 (and JavaSeis etc.) may have a role within a company they are not a replacement for SEGY. Even a technology like XML is going to be outlived by the data files we will have to read in the future. So I think the format will need to be extremely simple and conservative.   Some features of a format that could replace SEGY might include:   one character encoding (ASCII or UTF-8) all headers in human readable form – key-value pairs? mandatory header information, e.g. shotpoints, x/y locations etc.  standard unit definitions, map projections etc.  traces may be binary but only IEEE data should be in one file (SEGY got this right) no data compression   So now for the question – what do we have to do to move beyond the extremely frustrating SEGY standard? Is there anything out there already we should just start evangelizing? If not, what do you think a replacement format needs to look like?   Thanks for reading. I feel much better after this rant and will get back to debugging why byte number 3603 is wrong.     EDIT: After chilling out over the weekend here are some more thoughts. SEGY is complicated for a number of reasons:   inherent complexity accidental complexity different expectations for the format from users   So SEGY is hard to use because the seismic problem domain is an inherently difficult one to model. We are lucky to have the benefit of the wisdom of those who came up with the format.   Even so, a lot of cruft has accumulated in the format over the years. This creates a non-trivial cognitive burden that I could do without but will realistically just have to deal with.   The last point though is interesting. We already have SEGD for storing the raw field data. This format is a lot more challenging than SEGY but is also a good place to bury a lot of the inherent complexity of real world seismic data.   When people suggest HDF as a replacement I guess that (maybe) they are viewing SEGY as a 'processing' format?   Last week I was thinking of SEGY as a vehicle for sharing final seismic volumes with interpreters. I read at the weekend that 80% of SEGY headers are not populated in real world data. So, this is speculation on my part, but perhaps what we need is   SEGD for raw field data something else for actually processing  and something else again for sharing data between processors and interpreters   To accurately, and reproducibly, load seismic data into interpretation systems we don't need much meta-data but it absolutely does need to be present. The hand-off from processors to interpreters via SEGY is where I think we could use a new approach.  "
665,How does the lapse rate in clouds compare with the lapse rate of air?,So moisture decreases the temperature lapse rate (relative to the dry adiabat). My question is this: does a cloud decrease the lapse rate at the same rate as 100% humidity would decrease it? Or would it depend on cloud type (e.g. stratus vs cumulus)? 
666,Are clouds significantly easier to simulate in weather models than climate models?,Cloud forcing is still one of the major uncertainties of radiative forcing in climate modeling because there are so many uncertainties in it (and parametrizations). But also because the timescale of cloud development are much shorter than the timescale that climate models are run at.  So I'm curious: are clouds much easier to simulate in the short timespans of weather models? Or are they still a beast to simulate in them? 
667,Why does the rising of high clouds due to climate change impart positive radiative feedback on radiative forcing?,"As seen in the figure below.  The larger the temperature difference between surface and cloud, the more positive the radiative forcing is from the cloud.  So as the cloud moves up, it supposedly should move into a colder altitude. But doesn't climate change also increase the temperatures at any given altitude too? If so, why does the cloud move up into a colder altitude due to climate change? (even after accounting for heating at the given altitude?)   "
668,Recharge a dry aquifer?,"Aquifers have a natural recharge rate.  However, some aquifers rely on fossil water for their primary (or even sole) water supply.  When water in a well is pulled from these aquifers faster than they can replenish, the level drops and they eventually ""dry up"" (or the water table drops below the bottom of the well, at least).  In the case of aquifers with no recharge, such as fossil water, it seems that the water could literally be used up so that the aquifer becomes completely dry.  For these fossil water aquifers, is there any known technique to recharge them?  Since they're labelled as a non-renewable resource, I presume the answer is ""no"", but I'd like to get a better understanding of this.  For aquifers with a low recharge rate and a severly dropped water table, is there any known way to increase their recharge rate? "
669,Why does El Niño only exist in the Pacific Ocean and not the Atlantic/Indian Oceans?,"El Niño is associated with the weakening of the ‘normal’ pressure/temperature gradients between the western and eastern Pacific Oceans.  My question is this: why does it only exist in the Pacific Ocean?  Could it be that the Atlantic is always in an ‘El Niño’ state too, given that the pressure/temperature gradients in the Atlantic aren't as steep as those of the Pacific to begin with? "
670,Does Earth's air leak into space over time?,"From my current understanding, Earth's atmosphere and air are held by the balance of two forces: 1. Earth's gravity and 2. Air pressure from air out to space.  Is my understanding correct?    So, do these two forces always stay the same? If they are not the same, have the earth lost its air into space? And if so by how much each year? "
671,The motion of tides,"I found this animation from a satellite:    which shows the motion and elevation of tides on a certain date. Can you find an animation of a date  when there is a spring tide?  my question is as follows:  since the earth moves toward the East, tides should move to the West, but there is only one, at the Antarctica, which goes in that direction and keeps pace with moon, although it never overtakes it, as it was supposed by the theory.  What people at Astronomy could not explain is why most tides move to the (North-) West, and that means they run faster than the earth's rotation. Can you explain that? Higher water is at a greater radius from the center of the Earth and must slow down because of conservation of AM,  how can they move faster? "
672,Early Earth crust,"My question is related to a former question about the Earth's early crust. I would like to understand HOW the crust that seems to have been mafic during the Hadean, changed into the other more felsic compositions later. Why this happened? How did it arrive to being so well-separated with the felsic crust under the oceans (I understand that felsic is buoyant and it does not get dense enough, so it can't be under the oceans) But HOW? and WHY?  Thank you! "

674,Why is Egypt so dry?,"If you look at this wind map (for July, but following the link you can also view other months):   you will see that Egypt gets its air from the Mediterranean sea. During other months it could get less moist air, but still from the same direction.  If you look at the topography of Egypt:    (taken from Wikipedia), you will see that it doesn't have any mountain ranges that could intercept the precipitation. But it still receives very little rain.  I don't quite understand why. Is the Mediterranean air not moist enough? "
675,Why is a mild earthquake often mistaken as dizziness or vertigo?,"Is it due to the longitudinal nature of the seismic waves?  When a heavy bus or truck goes by at high-speed, the shaking in nearby ground is not mistaken as dizziness, rather the feet and body feel a vertical jerk (seemingly a transverse wave vertical to the ground).  But when a natural, mild earthquake takes place, it is not felt as a jerk or switch in a direction at all. Rather we feel it for a while as dizziness. I have experienced this, and heard of many others who have as well.  In-fact it takes a few seconds to distinguish whether it is dizziness or an earthquake.   Is it due to the longitudinal waves? Is it because they are horizontal with the ground, matching the direction of dizziness?  Also I guess maybe there may be similarity between the frequency of seismic waves and this video from Wikipedia's article on vertigo:    Does this phenomenon's frequency act similarly to the motion and simulates  dizziness? "
676,Can runaway methane gas emissions be an extinction level event?,"Much ado has been made by a few petroleum engineers and global-warming alarmist about all of the methane gas trapped in frozen form, mostly on the ocean floors.  The ""What-if"" scenario begins to play out in 2080 or so, when a few petroleum engineers claim that the skies will start to turn a brownish color, making the earth even hotter.  These comments are buried deep in old magazine articles and by now these engineers are probably working for another employer. Even Al Gore did not say much at all about natural frozen methane gas being set free in massive quantities. But a few geologist and alarmist say it will happen as expected.  Even if it comes true, questions abound about what year it maybe dense enough to make the Earth like Venus. Will it mean that as it builds up it will move closer to the ground and begin to poison us directly? Birds will drop out of the sky by the millions. Animals will move down from tall mountains. 90% of the human race could die off, but some would die from ignorance, like in hurricane Katrina.  Would this be the toxic gas that could ""Shroud the world"" within the next 100 years? Someone please prove this is wrong, or at least there are ""workarounds"" for the problem. "
677,Effects of pressure at sea level,"According to this answer atmospheric pressure can vary between 870 and 1070 mb.  Can you tell what (if any) effects would there be on sea level if such difference of pressure (200 mb) on two near areas of the ocean, has anything similar has ever been recorded? If there is an elevation (or depression) can you say to what difference in gravity it corresponds? How do pressure effects compare with Earth's non-homogeneous gravity which affects local sea levels?  "
678,What would be the correct terminology for soft cover on crust?,"Earths' crust is usually not exposed. Above-water portion is covered with soil, and Underwater portions are covered with various deposits or sediments. Oceans contain Pelagic sediments.(I don't know whether this underwater sediment considered as soil or not).  The soft cover is probably not being considered as Crust. Some sources telling it  pedosphere (soil-sphere), but with pictures of only terrestrial soil.  But it is not clear to me :  exact how-much portion is being called pedosphere? Is it the whole skin of Earth (including underwater-depositions)? If not; then   what is the correct term for the complete soft-layer on Earth?  Is there any term for part-of skin-of-Earth which is beneath water?  "
679,Quotient farthest mouths/nearest sources,"Much googling has not left me any the wiser, so here goes. Let FM be the distance between the mouths of two rivers X and Y. Let NS be the distance between the sources of the same two rivers X and Y. What pair of two rivers X and Y on Earth will produce the biggest quotient FM/NS? Or the smallest?  Two candidates for the biggest might be Indus and Brahmaputra but I am sure there are others. "
680,How to derive the (dry) deposition velocity for particles in the atmosphere,"In atmospheric dispersion modelling the deposition velocity of particulate matter is often described by: $$ v_d = \frac{1}{r_A+r_B+r_A r_B v_g}+v_g \hspace{10mm}(1) $$ where [tex] is the aerodynamic resistance (describing turbulent fluxes in the surface layer), [tex] is the viscous resistance (molecular diffusion in the quasi-laminar sublayer) and [tex] is the terminal fall velocity of the particles.   How is [tex] derived?  It is used in numerous models but I haven't found any references explaining how the expression is derived. The closest I've found is in this book by Seinfeld and Pandis (ISBN: 9781118947401), chapter 19.  There, it is explained that [tex] is derived from the following system of equations describing the total flux through an assumed constant flux layer: $$ F = \frac{C_3-C_2}{r_A} + v_g C_3 = \frac{C_2+C_1}{r_B} + v_g C_2 = \frac{C_3-C_1}{r_t} \hspace{10mm} (2) $$ where [tex] is the particle concentration at the top of the surface layer, [tex] is the concentration between the surface layer and the viscous sublayer and [tex] is the concentration of still airborne particles at the surface.  At this stage it is assumed all particles close to the surface will adhere to the surface so that [tex] is practically 0. Then [tex] can be simplified to: $$ \frac{C_3}{r_t} = \frac{C_3-C_2}{r_A} + v_g C_3 = \frac{C_2}{r_B} + v_g C_2 \hspace{10mm} (3) $$  By elimination of [tex] and [tex] from [tex] one is supposed to end up with [tex], since [tex]. I've tried doing this but end up with this instead: $$ v_d = \frac{1}{r_t} = \frac{1}{r_A+r_B+r_A r_B v_g} + \frac{v_g}{r_A(\frac{1}{r_B}+v_g) +1} $$  So either my algebra is a bit rusty or there are additional assumption involved... "
681,Carbon dioxide and ocean acidification based on temperature,"For our assignment, we are required to analyse and compare the [tex] level (in both ocean and air) of two different sites. Theoretically, shouldn't the [tex] level of a colder region (e.g., Alaska) be higher due to [tex] being more soluble in colder temperatures?   I've looked at the data (I'm comparing Alaska and the Equator) and the carbon dioxide concentration is higher for the equator. What could explain this? The data can be found at NOAA's PMEL Carbon Data Observation Data page.*  * The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration / Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory "

683,Chicxulub Asteroid Remains?,Do scientists know if the Chicxulub asteroid disintegrated completely upon impact or if any (large or small) chunks of the asteroid remained intact? If it is possible that a significant fragment of the asteroid survived could it have been preserved until today somehow (i.e. can it be found)?  
684,"As the earth's core cools, will the size be affected?",Objects can change in size when their temperature changes. I'm wondering whether the cooling of the earth's core will affect it's size? Or will the change be insignificant due to the elements and states involved or the pressure acting on the core etc.? 
685,Is Ozone Layer a Valid Concern,"I’ve had a simple puzzlement concerning the ozone layer.  Succinctly, the troposphere is largely and preferably ozone free.  When it thermally rises at the tropics to become the stratosphere molecular oxygen cleaves under actinic radiation to from nascent oxygen that, in turn joins with molecular oxygen to form ozone.  The stratospheric ozone, of course, is vital to protect against harmful radiation.  Then at the polar vortices the flow once again returns to the troposphere.  Ozone is undesirable in the troposphere and is removed at this point.  If this is accurate (?), why would halides that disassociate ozone (in conjunction with ice crystals only present at the Antarctic pole) be seen as adverse? "

Will the placement of a GPS tracker/weather monitor or two, or even a seismometer be next?    above: The edge of A-68, the iceberg the calved from the Larsen C ice shelf. Photo by NASA/Nathan Kurtz.  update 1 : According to the BBC Article British mission to giant A-68 berg approved:     The British Antarctic Survey has won funding to visit the berg and its calving zone in February next year.      It will use the Royal Research Ship James Clark Ross.   This would present a potential opportunity to add some ground-truth telemetry to A-68. Details of it's short term and long term motion could then be monitored with higher resolution both in space and time than what can be obtained from periodic photographs from polar-orbiting satellites.  Video: [website]Study of the movement of cold fresh water in the form of ice bergs is important for climate models. The plain language summary in the recent paper A simulation of small to giant Antarctic iceberg evolution: Differential impact on climatology estimates; Rackow, T., C. Wesche, R. Timmermann, H. H. Hellmer, S. Juricke, and T. Jung (2017), J. Geophys. Res. Oceans, 122, 3170–3190, doi:10.1002/2016JC012513 says:     Antarctic icebergs are large blocks of frozen fresh water that melt around the Antarctic continent while moving under the influence of winds, sea ice, and ocean currents. Small icebergs (2.2km) are mainly driven by winds and ocean currents, whereas giant icebergs   (> 10 km) tend to ‘surf’ the tilted sea surface and are less sensitive to changes in the wind. The relative importance between melting at the iceberg’s base and mass loss at the side walls is also different for small and large icebergs.We present a computer simulation of Antarctic iceberg movement and melting that includes not only small icebergs, but at the same time also larger icebergs with side lengths of 10 km or more. The study highlights the necessity to account for larger icebergs in order to obtain an accurate depiction of the spatial distribution of iceberg meltwater, which, e.g., stabilizes and fertilizes the upper water column and thus supports phytoplankton growth. Future climate change simulations will benefit from the improved distribution, where the impact of iceberg melting is likely to increase due to increased calving from the Antarctic ice sheet.   The authors describe the use of the Finite Element Sea ice-Ocean Model  (FESOM) to address the effect of the 3 dimensional ocean currents and wind pattern on the paths of icebergs and their addition of cold fresh water to the ocean.  At some point any predictive model will be compared against measured data, and traditionally satellite imaging provides the capability to track large numbers of icebergs with a wide range of sizes.  From the new BBC article Drifting Antarctic iceberg A-68 opens up clear water:     A-68 should follow the highway up the eastern coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, leading from the Weddell Sea towards the Atlantic.      ""It will most likely follow a northeasterly course, heading roughly for South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands,"" Dr Rackow told BBC News. ""It will be very interesting to see whether the iceberg will move as expected, as a kind of 'reality-check' for the current models and our physical understanding.""   The large size (~6,000 km^2) of the recently calved iceberg A-68 from the Larson-C ice shelf suggests it will will be relatively long lived, and so telemetry equipment placed on it is likely to collect data for a longer time than smaller ice bergs. I'm wondering if it might in fact be able as a sort of ""meteorological station"" of sorts, recording a variety of temperatures and currents and relaying the data via satellite.   But my question is not if that is possible, but if it is likely to be done. Will A-68 get GPS beacons or more elaborate environmental telemetry in order to measure the local conditions? Having both the actual movement data together with the local environmental data may be of more value than satellite reconnaissance alone.     More information available at this question and answers.   As noted in this comment and by the BBC and the Washington Post, a very large chunk of the Larson C ice shelf in the Antarctic has calved and is now a free iceberg.   below: Photo from BBC, source: Rackow et al..    below: Photo from BBC, source: Deimos Imaging an UrtheCast company   "
687,Are fossil fuels really formed from fossils?,"Hydrocarbons have been found in great abundance elsewhere in the solar system where there is unlikely to be evidence for life past or present.  No fossils involved.  Petroleum and natural gas wells that have gone dry 50 years ago, are found replenishing a fraction of their output.  No fossils involved.  Vast biomass of micro-organisms and extremophiles beneath earth surface estimated to be several times the size of the surface biomass found deriving their chemical energy for life from methane and oxygen pulled from sulfates and ferrous oxides.  The source of methane way too deep to come from fossils.  No fossils involved.  These recent findings and other evidence were foretold by the late scientist and researcher from Cornell, Thomas Gold, who authored ""The Deep Hot Biosphere, The Myth of Fossil Fuels"".  After seeing evidence of extremeophiles in relative abundance in even the deepest of mines, Gold ties the sub-surface biosphere to the ""Deep Earth Gas theory"" to show a more plausible primordial explanation of hydrocarbon fuel formation than the generally accepted ""fossil"" theory.  He posits that  ""Hydrocarbons are not biology reworked by geology (as the traditional view would hold), but rather hydrocarbons are geology reworked by biology.""  In other words, as in Saturn’s moon Titan and other hydrocarbon rich areas of the solar system, the source of hydrocarbons is primordial; but as they upwell into earth’s outer crust microbial life uses it as energy source.  While the details of the Deep Earth Gas Theory are beyond scope of elaboration in this question area, the main points which Dr. Gold supports, and provides evidence for are:    Hydrocarbons are primordial. IOW, hydrocarbons like elsewhere in the solar systems are here since the planet's birth. The earth was subjected to only a partial melt. Hydrocarbons are stable to great depth.  High pressure greatly stabilizes hydrocarbons against thermal dissociation. Rock at depth contains pores. Primordial hydrocarbons are still upwelling from the deep earth.   some sub-points worthy of mention:  It more adequately explains why Helium is only present in the earth at any mine-able quantity in natural gas.   There are no pure Helium wells.  Why the strong association of hydrocarbons with Helium, an inert gas that can have no chemical interactions with fossil organic materials or with hydrocarbons?  This is known to geologists as the ""Petroleum Paradox"" and cannot be explained at all by a sedimentary origin of hydrocarbons.  The presently accepted theory of fossil fuels is that the hydrocarbons formed from the decayed remains of ancient organic matter (fossils) that somehow sank down into the deep earth and got trapped in sedimentary rock formations where increased pressures assisted in converting the organic material over time to hydrocarbons.  Well, hydrocarbons are found in depths where no surface life remains could have possibly geologically submerged to.  The physics of how the ancient organic materials or the resulting hydrocarbons sank deep into the earth have yet to be explained.  Also, hydrocarbons have been found in igneous rock formations, which the accepted surface to sediment theory cannot explain.  Can we still say that fossil fuels are really from fossils? "
688,"Hypothetically, would digging a big trench from the ocean and flooding desert areas be a bad solution to combatting sea level rise?","My question is basically the title.

690,How do glaciers move? Could Antarctica be separated?,"Consider the example of the Larsen Ice Shelf. Ice platforms are attached to glaciers such that they prevent surrounding warm air from directly melting the glaciers.  This is an important aspect of ice platforms.   What are the mechanisms of glacier movement?  When we talk about glacier movement, do we consider advance and retreat due to melting and snow deposition, or is the study of glacier movement more about the fluid sheet underneath the glacier that comes in contact with the rocks, which allows the glacier to move downhill?  With this second type of movement, glaciers can separate.  So is it possible for Antarctica to separate and disappear? "

703,Siberia (Beringia) during last glacier period,"Today, Northern Russia is considered quite cold. It is not populated because it has low biological productivity: low light and cold. It can be below -50 at winter and 10 C at summer peak. It is low populated because there is basically nothing to eat. Poor reindeers dig some moss from below the snow, which grows there a little during short summer period.   I am telling all of that, because I cannot even imagine what the hell Yakutiya would have been when all north of the continent was 1 km below the ice! Siberia stays permafrost even now, when you have warm summer days +5 Celsius. Certainly, it had to be frozen at glacier time permanently. Meantime, it is curious how people managed to cross the Bering Land Bridge during that latest glacier. How was that possible at that time, was it a Polar Voyage?   Now, I read that Yakutiya was a wild life refugee during the last ice age. It had much more rich wild life than now, comparative to what we have in Africa today. People appeared there 12 000 years ago, when half of the Great Glacier was melted    and slaughtered mammoth. The mega-fauna extinction collapsed Siberian ecosystem, say scientists who undertake an attempt to recover it. They tell that mammoth grazed grass. Did they procure it from below the snow, like reindeer do? Ok, Beringia says that      During the ice ages, Beringia, like most of Siberia and all of north   and northeast China, was not glaciated because snowfall was very   light. It was a grassland steppe, including the land bridge, that   stretched for hundreds of kilometres into the continents on either   side.   Fine. But, the fact that all ice was concentrated over Europe and Canada does not mean that Beringia surface was not permanently frozen. If there is so cold that whole Europe is under 1 km of Ice, the cold Beringia must be frozen either, despite all ice is over Europe. We can have low temperatures without ice, right? And, if it was terribly cold in Europe, it must be at least that cold in Beringia, right? So, what could poor animals eat there, in the frozen desert?  To summarize, my question is:   How is this nonsense possible that the 'freezer' of our planet was flourishing, whereas the rest of the Planet was starving in frozen state during last glacier period?   PS! I was suggested to look at the climate zones during Last Glacier. I have seen it but I cannot believe that northern Canada and Greenland was thriving forest whereas almost whole US was under permanent ice sheet. Similarly, we see that Tundra (current Eastern Siberia state) ruled in permafrozen Beijing whereas Eastern Siberia was enjoing same thriving steppe Forest that Alaska did    That is unbelievable and that is what I basically ask to explain. I guess that I have just mismapped the colors. There are too few colors. On the other hand, if anomaly did exist, I want to hear that explicitly, desirably with explanation. Is it really large animals who maintained the warmth at the very north (see ""Park"" above) before people exterminated them or what?  PS2 I have revised the climate zones map and realized that we had Polar Desert in Siberia and Alaska rather than Forest Steppe. This makes more sense. But how did we had the large animals and thriving greenlands there anyway? Polar Desert is incompatible with green land, obviously. Polar Desert at zones map seems also to contradict the Beringia article, attributing Beringia to grassland steppe during Ice Age. "
704,Intuitive definition of the Monin-Obukhov length?,"The Monin-Obukhov length (L) is defined as:  [tex]  where [tex]=moist air density; [tex]=air specific heat capacity; [tex]=virtual temperature; [tex]=wind friction velocity; [tex]=0.41 (von Karman constant); [tex]=gravity; and [tex]=sensible heat. Note that there are lots of different formulations - this one is taken from this video on eddy covariance.  It is used when describing how turbulence is affected by bounancy, e.g. from rising thermals from the earth's surface. I would like to get some intuition for what the length actually physically represents. The wikipedia page states that:     A physical interpretation of L is given by the Monin–Obukhov similarity theory. During the day -L it is the height at which the buoyant production of turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) is equal to that produced by the shearing action of the wind (shear production of TKE).   However, that is still pretty opaque to me. To me, that sounds something like a parameter of a distribution that describes at what height wind shear starts to break up up-welling packets of air, but I really don't have any idea. Is there a good intuitive description of this quantity? "

706,Why do certain areas on Earth have a higher or lower air pressure at sea level?,"For instance, looking at this map of world air pressure in January and this map of July, why do some land surfaces have a higher pressure during the winter?  I know that the tropics and Coriolis forces have something to do with the direction, and that wind flows from higher to lower pressure, but how can you guess what the pressure for an area will be for a certain season?  If I describe a certain surface area (water or land, cold or hot, high or low elevation) given a certain season (winter or summer), what generalizations can I make of the average air pressure during that season (high or low)? "
707,Why is the Sahara so much larger than the other horse latitude deserts?,"Every continent has a dry strip between about 15º and 35º on its west coast, but they vary drastically in size:   The Baja/Mojave and Atacama are fairly narrow, stretching about 300 miles inland at the widest (using the ""25 cm annual precip"" definition of desert. The Namib, about 600 miles. The Great Australian Desert covers about 2,000 miles, most of the continent. The Sahara, Arabian Desert, Dasht-e-Lut, and Baluchistan together stretch over 5,500!   These are all caused by the winds of the horse latitudes, in turn caused by the continental high-pressure zones, AKA subtropical ridges.  But why does this produce just a slim strip of desert on some continents but a massive span southwest of Eurasia?  The size of the continent is the obvious answer, but if so why is Australia almost all desert, despite being the smallest continent, surrounded by warm ocean?  Looking at the Andes, the Rocky Mountains, the mountains of Iran, Angola, and Namibia, and the Great Dividing Range, it appears that each subtropical desert tends to end at a mountain range, but not always: the southern Namib climbs half a mile before stretching across half of South Africa, and the Sahara has several highlands.

708,Eliminating range folding error in doppler radar returns,"With weather radar, it's not uncommon to see large areas of the image blocked out due to detected range folding.  It's my understanding that this occurs when a reflection outside of range comes back after the next pulse has been transmitted, making the receiver think that a late reflection from the first pulse is actually for the second pulse and near by.    Graphic Source:  [website]It seems to me that it if we could differentiate between pulses, we could eliminate the possibility of range folding error.  Frequency  My first thought was that each pulse could be sent at different frequencies.  They would have to be close enough to not affect the amount of energy reflected, but far apart enough to be easily detected and not assumed to be part of doppler shift.  Even something as wide as 1MHz seems to fit this characteristic.  Is there a reason we don't use this method today?  Polarization  If we have to use the same frequency for both pulses, could we instead mount two antennas on the transmitting rig, one polarized clockwise and the other polarized counter-clockwise?  In this configuration, the exact same equipment could be used for transmitting with something that just switches between antennas for each pulse.  I'm curious if either method would work, and what the possible pitfalls are. "

E.g.:[website]It seems that often the RMS amplitude is used instead.  When do one use amplitude and when do one use RMS amplitude?  When using RMS amplitude one must integrate over a window around the horizon.  Which window do one use?  I often see images of RMS amplitude maps where the caption simply says something like ""lower tertiary horizon with RMS amplitude extraction"".  Does this mean RMS calculated over a window from z =horizon - 10 m to horizon + 10 m for instance?   Or could it mean RMS calculated over a window from z = 3 peaks above horizon to 3 peaks below horizon?  "

714,To what year do we need to return to prevent climate change?,"I regularly see articles like this where a country has or has committed to reduce their carbon emissions by a certain percentage in relation to a certain year. That article mentions that Scotland has dropped their emissions to 49% below 1990 levels.  Other discussions talk about cutting carbon to come under a 2 degree, or 3 degree warming level.  How do these two relate?  If everyone goes back to 1990 how many degrees does the planet warm? What do different 'years' look like 2000? 1960?  edit: The answers given pretty much cover it but what I was really after was a bar graph or similar that says 1960: 0.3 degrees, 1990: 1.1 degrees, 2000: 2.0 degrees. ie how do year levels correspond to warming predictions. "
715,Seismic dispersion: What does it really mean and what causes it?,"Body waves (to some extent) and especially surface waves show dispersive characteristics during propagation. In Dr. Christopher Liner's book [Elements of Seismic Dispersion (2012)], this phenomenon is quickly attributed to propagating seismic energy being frequency-dependent. I've heard this phrase for a long time, and I am still unsure how to visualize and/or quantify it for the sake of really understanding this phenomenon.  Indeed, why can't one phrase it as being wavelength-dependent as well? Also, for both surface and body waves, what are the primary factors that cause/generate seismic dispersion? "
716,Are you more likely to get a sunburn at the pole than the equator?,"After looking at this post I can see that a flat object is more exposed to the sun at the equator.

717,Are there lava flows inside a volcano?," (source: netdna-ssl.com)    In these popular diagrams for the three types of volcanoes, it seems as though the lava flows are inside the mountain. I suspect that they're trying to show rivers flowing on the surface (with an awkward illustration), though. So my questions are:   Are these rivers flowing on the surface or are they inside the mountain? Is the lava flowing down from the top of the vent or is it branching out from somewehere in the pipe? Why doesn't the cinder cone have any lava flows?  "
718,"Internal energy, enthalpy, and work in the atmosphere","I'm writing a toy radiative-convective atmospheric model and need to relate the heat flux convergences (either surface sensible heat flux or the radiative flux) to changes in atmospheric layer temperatures. The first law of thermodynamics states:     The change in internal energy of a closed system is equal to the amount of heat supplied to the system plus the work done on the system by the surroundings.   My question is: Should gravitational potential energy be directly incorporated into this in any way, and where? When I calculate the internal energy of the layer, should that be just the thermodynamic internal energy [tex] or should it also include the potential energy [tex]? The pressure work done on the system by its surroundings at the bottom of the layer is [tex], which is clearly related to the raising and lowering of the layer. Should this work then be excluded from the RHS if the potential energy is excluded from the LHS?  I essentially have the following possibilities for calculating the change in temperatures:   [tex] [tex] [tex] [tex]   It seems like the first and last of these are equivalent (at least assuming hydrostatic balance), but the first would use the isochoric heat capacity and the last the isobaric heat capacity. I believe the last one is the correct choice but I feel very unsure about it. The same dilemma persists when a surface heat flux is applied, or convection changes the height of the upper atmosphere without changing any of its temperatures.  Relatedly, the full equation in a fluid dynamics point of view would include kinetic energy, and for an RCE model that would be turbulent kinetic energy. Should this be tracked? If I exclude it, is that the same as assuming that all kinetic energy gets turned into heat by viscosity between each timestep?  (These may be very basic questions to some of you, but for the life of me I can't convince myself of the right approach to take. I don't have any of my atmospheric science books with me, so if you throw in a reference, please make it to an online resource.) "

720,Clarification of overbank flows,"Apologies for what may be a very basic question, but I am struggling to understand the definition of overbank flow.  Overbank flow is defined along the lines of this: Water flow over the top of the bankfull channel onto the floodplain.  Does this flow include the flow that is in the channel? or is it only the flow that is over the channel?  I am working through a document that seems to say one thing with the words, and a different thing with the mathematics.  If Qf = overbank flow; Qb = bankfull flow:  Is the total flow = Qf, where Qf >= Qb  so if Qf = Qb all flow is in the channel  Or, is total flow = Qf + Qb, flow in channel plus flow out of channel? "
721,Temperature differences in sand,"Sand is granular in nature, which allows air columns to trap in between them. As we know that air is an insulator of heat. So here are my questions:  Does sand maintain its temperatures close to its surface? (Like a conducting shell distributes charge on its surface)  If there were layers of sand, is it possible that in the deeper layers the temperatures remain constant? And only the temperatures of the upper layers changes as the surrounding environment changes?  P.S. If all of this is true is there a particular formula or a study I can use to figure out the temperature difference between the surface and at a depth in a desert? "

724,What exactly are enantiotropic and monotropic polymorphic transitions?,"Recently, I've been studying the subject of polymorphism and met two important concepts, the monotropic and enantiotropic polymorphic transition types. However, I can't really seem to grasp the difference between them practically.  What I do understand is that enantiotropic polymorphism is reversible, but what does ""reversible"" mean practically?  Also, the definition for monotropic polymorphism says that it is irreversible due to metastability. But what exactly is metastability, what does it mean practically? Also, what does ""irreversible"" mean? Because, surely, I can transform diamond into graphite and graphite into diamond despite it being a monotropic polymorphism.  Thanks in advance for any insight given! "
725,what is the best way to actually make the Earth lose heat?,"I know that refrigerated air just moves heat around, and creates more by using fossil fuel energy in the process.  If we wanted to actually reduce the amount of net heat energy in an area on the planet, and not just move it around, how?  How does the Earth do it?  Is it all in radiating infrared back up through the atmosphere?  Can we humans help with this in a way that doesn't just need more carbon based energy?  Can we have thermoelectric (Seebeck) generators powering infrared spotlights pointing out into space or something? "
726,How closely related is surface air temperature to pressure?,"Obviously with a given mass and volume of air, pressure is directly proportional to temperature. However, I would expect the total mass of air within a column of atmosphere to vary over time, due to atmospheric waves (and oceanic waves, over the ocean).  How highly correlated is surface air pressure with surface temperature, at a given site? How much does the variation of atmospheric mass affect that relationship? "
727,Why is the bedrock buried so deeply in much of northern Minnesota?,"Although parts of northern Minnesota have bedrock exposed at the surface (especially in the Boundary Waters area and along the short of Lake Superior), the more usual situation here is for the bedrock to be buried very deeply indeed - with, in places, more than a hundred meters of soil overlying it, according to this map.  This doesn't make sense to me; the whole area was buried under an ice sheet during the most recent glaciation, and the hundreds of meters of moving ice would have scraped everything down to bedrock (and scraped off large amounts of the bedrock itself) and prevented any new soil from forming until the ice sheet retreated.  Northern Minnesota has only been ice-sheet-free for a blink of an eye, geologically speaking - how did hundreds of meters of soil manage to form in such a short period of time? "

729,Which particles are classified as PM2.5? How exactly is this defined?,"Question  When discussing ""PM2.5"", is there any standardized understanding of which particles are or are not included?  Is it everything that's 2.5 microns and smaller? Or Everything between 2.5 and 0.1 microns?   Likewise does PM10 include all of PM2.5?  And by what method is ""size"" specified? Is this an aerodynamic size from some kind of inertial impactor configuration (virtual or real), or an optical size from scattering, or something else?  Background  PM2.5 and other classes of particulates are a ""hot topic"" now. From Wikipedia's Particulates; size, shape and solubility matter:     [...]The 10-micrometer size does not represent a strict boundary between respirable and non-respirable particles, but has been agreed upon for monitoring of airborne particulate matter by most regulatory agencies. Because of their small size, particles on the order of 10 micrometers or less (coarse particulate matter, PM10) can penetrate the deepest part of the lungs such as the bronchioles or alveoli; when asthmatics are exposed to these conditions it can trigger bronchoconstriction.      Similarly, so called fine particulate matter (PM2.5), tend to penetrate into the gas exchange regions of the lung (alveolus), and very small particles (ultrafine particulate matter, PM0.1) may pass through the lungs to affect other organs. Penetration of particles is not wholly dependent on their size; shape and chemical composition also play a part. To avoid this complication, simple nomenclature is used to indicate the different degrees of relative penetration of a PM particle into the cardiovascular system. Inhalable particles penetrate no further than the bronchi as they are filtered out by the cilia. Thoracic particles can penetrate right into terminal bronchioles whereas PM0.1, which can penetrate to alveoli, the gas exchange area, and hence the circulatory system are termed respirable particles. In analogy, the inhalable dust fraction is the fraction of dust entering nose and mouth which may be deposited anywhere in the respiratory tract. The thoracic fraction is the fraction that enters the thorax and is deposited within the lung's airways. The respirable fraction is what is deposited in the gas exchange regions (alveoli).      The smallest particles, less than 100 nanometers (nanoparticles), may be even more damaging to the cardiovascular system. Nanoparticles can pass through cell membranes and migrate into other organs, including the brain. Particles emitted from modern diesel engines (commonly referred to as Diesel Particulate Matter, or DPM) are typically in the size range of 100 nanometers (0.1 micrometer). [...]     From AirNow.gov's Particle Pollution (PM):        Coarse dust particles (PM10) are 2.5 to 10 micrometers in diameter. Sources include crushing or grinding operations and dust stirred up by vehicles on roads.   Fine particles (PM2.5) are 2.5 micrometers in diameter or smaller, and can only be seen with an electron microscope. Fine particles are produced from all types of combustion, including motor vehicles, power plants, residential wood burning, forest fires, agricultural burning, and some industrial processes      However, EPA.gov's Particulate Matter (PM) Basics; What is PM, and how does it get into the air? says:          PM10: inhalable particles, with diameters that are generally 10 micrometers and smaller; and   PM2.5: fine inhalable particles, with diameters that are generally 2.5 micrometers and smaller.

731,What is a Micro-Aethalometer; how do portable Black Carbon (BC) Monitors work?,"The screenshot below is from MIT's Erik Velasco's presentation Particle exposure and dosage on public transport. My question is about the small, portable Black Carbon (BC) monitor.   From my reading, Black Carbon refers to mostly carbon particles, mostly produced in natural and anthropogenic combustion processes (e.g. forest fires, vehicles...). Unlike most of the particles that fall into the PM10 and PM2.5 classifications, it seems that a very important fraction of BC comes from very small particles of the order 0.1 microns since they are formed during a short time during combustion.  0.1 micron particles are hard to detect using laser scatterometry since they scatter very weakly compared to the larger particles, and the size of the portable meter shown seems quite small for an advanced scatterometer.  Question: How do small, portable Black Carbon (BC) Monitors work? I believe this one is called a Micro-Aethalometer in the presentation; what basic principles do they use to quantify BC in the air that fits in such a small form factor?

736,"Why the ""Mission to Earth’s core"" proposal suggests using liquid iron instead of lead?","Nature communications article ""Mission to Earth's core — a modest proposal"", suggests placing a large volume of liquid iron in a crack and let it sink all the way to the Earth's core, carrying along a probe that can transmit data using seismic waves.  It is an interesting idea. Although there might be many technical problems I feel no one seems insurmountable and it is worth a try.  However, I wonder why the author suggest using a liquid iron instead of a liquid lead. I would expect lead to be cheaper and also require a smaller volume to achieve the same fracture stresses (due to higher density). In addition, a lower melting point would facilitate the initiation of the fracture propagation near the surface.  Would lead dissolve in the surrounding magma? Would it chemically interact turning into a lighter compound?  As the original article is behind a paywall I copy here the main text:     "
737,Why Earth's outer core does not dissolve into the mantle?,"It is well accepted that the outer core is made out of liquid iron and nickel, and as everything else it should tend to reach chemical equilibrium with its surrounding.  In particular, I would expect it to interact with the lower mantle through mixing and chemical reactions with the oxygen, silicates and other compounds. These interaction would result in the outer core slowly dissolving away into the mantle.  I would also expect this to happen in spite of the density gradient, that anyway should be less relevant down there, where the acceleration of gravity is much smaller than in the surface.  Why this dissolution doesn't happen? Why is the outer core stable?  As a bonus question inspired by this one: would any other blob of molten iron be stable anywhere in the mantle? "
738,Would the subsurface event leading to tree death at West Tern Lake in Yellowstone be visible in thermal imaging?,"The New York Times article It’s Warm and Stealthy, and It Killed Yellowstone Trees and Turned Soil Pale describes an even that took place over the past few decades where a small and well-defined forested spot in Yellowstone National Park underwent some change, killing all of the trees growing there.    Credit: United States Geological Survey  The article explains the possible explanation that the trees died from changes in subsurface water chemistry.     Dr. Vaughan perused the aerial shots taken of the suspicious region. In 1994, nothing seemed amiss and trees were growing healthily. However, from then through 2017, trees had perished, and the soil had turned a sickly off-white color. The only reasonable explanation was that a new thermal area had been covertly growing in the region since the late-1990s, altering the ground’s chemistry with its superheated fluids.   Parenthetically speaking, to me ""superheated fluids"" sounds like something that could kill trees thermally, even without chemistry.   Would heating like this show up as a hot spot in thermal IR Earth imaging? Or is this likely to have been too deep to result in a significant surface temperature change?

740,How would plate tectonics differ if Earth had no water?,"Water plays a crucial role in plate tectonics by easing the brittle and ductile deformation of the Earth's lithosphere. Water lowers the Mohr-Coulomb for brittle fractures. During ductile deformation, it lubricates different deformational regimes. This is also important for the deformation in the asthenosphere.  In addition, water plays an important role in the formation of water-bearing minerals and the fluxing of melts, thereby substantially changing the rheology of the lithosphere and asthenosphere.    So, what would plate tectonics look like on a waterless Earth? Would it even work? Would there be different rates, or totally different processes taking over, similar to what is seen on adjacent solar system bodies?   Sources: V.S. Solomatov.

By the way, this is nearby Area 51 (the camera is looking in the direction of Area 51). "
748,How would pesticide vapor drift behave near a valley?,"I am considering buying a house in a valley with pesticide-intensive agriculture on both sides. Schematically, it looks like this:    It won't win any design awards, but it should make things clear.   My question is how the pesticide vapor drift would behave? Wouldn't there be a high risk that the cold air with the vapor gets trapped there? "
749,The rock that gives birth to quartz sand,"Thanks to one minute of the Earth we know that beach sand mother rock, besides the quartz itself, is (or was?) made of olivine, amphibole and orthoclase. I wonder, what is the name of that rock and where do the 3 annihilated minerals go if only quartz is left? "
750,How did Great-Britain separate from France?,Looking at continental plates both France and GB lie on the Earasian plate. Now those plates moves and created our continents of today out of Pangea.   But a lot of pictures shows that France and GB were once stuck together. Also their shapes looks like they fit together.  But if they lie on the same plate how is it possible that those contries are now separated? Is it possible that the oceans eroded land between them so they became separate?  Or is it possible that in one plate there were plenty of little continental drifts too; if that is true what is the difference between a continental drift and drift within plates. Or is it even possible that GB lies on its own plate?   Picture taken from the hi-res drawing at Here's what Pangea looks like mapped with modern political borders 
751,Why is it so important to gather data from inside tornadoes?,"Or, in other words, what kind of data can be gathered from inside tornadoes and how could it help in predicting them?

752,How are lightning and thunderstorm intensity linked?,"I have lightning data that contains individual strikes and their location, time, polarity, amplitude and type (cloud-to-ground, intracloud). I am trying to develop some metrics that will help me assess if a thunderstorm is intense or not. By intense, I mean if it has the potential to generate heavy rain, large hail and strong winds. I plan on using radar reflectivity as my best guess of storm intensity and building a statistical model between the two datasets.  By browsing through the litterature, it seems that a sharp increase in positive cloud-to-ground lightning frequency is a sign of storm intensification to come. I was wondering if there was anything else that I could work with. Is amplitude useful in any way? Is the ratio of IC to CG lightning relevant? Is there another metric I could develop?  Thanks! "
753,Does the level/reading/measurement of solar exposure impact temperatures,"Does the level/reading/measurement of solar exposure impact temperatures?

"
754,What affects the surface characteristics of cumulus clouds?,"I love looking at clouds. I love trying to describe them and compare what I see day to day.  I have dozens of questions about the things I’ve observed and I would really like to understand the physics of the world around me. Today I would like to focus on the surface dynamics of cumulus clouds. Why do some cumulus clouds have distinct textured surface while others are softer and wispy at the edge?  I imagine it probably comes down to temperature and pressure. It may also be an effect of direct sunlight, I’m not sure. I notice the soggy cotton clouds are more common in the evening and the billowy ice cream clouds are more common mid-day.  Do clouds have surface tension like liquid water?  Does the flow of water either into or out of a cloud affect its surface characteristics?    "
755,Is daylight time symmetrical between northern and southern hemisphere?,At lat +50.0 on Jun 21 and lat -50.0 on Dec 21 is the time between sunrise and sunset exactly the same?  And so on throughout the parallels and the days of the year?  If not can you explain why?  I once read something about the earth's wobble on its axis means that daylight length is not symmetrical north to south. 
756,How old are Pecten fossils in general?,"Many years ago, I found a piece of rock on a lakeside in Switzerland (see picture below). I think that it could be a ""fossil"" from some Pecten species (do you agree?).     My question is: how old such a fossil can be, approximately? Is it like 1000 years, or rather 1'000'000 years?   I have no idea, that's why I just would be interested to have your opinion on this topic. I don't know if it is frequent or rather uncommon to find such ""fossils"".  Thank you for your help!   "
757,Will increased precipitation in Antarctica prevent sea level rise?,"It has been suggested that global warming will lead to increased precipitation in parts of Antarctica. This would sequester water in the ice sheet, preventing sea level rise.  However, the slope (and thus the height and volume) of continental ice sheets is limited by ice properties. What if the ice sheet is already at its maximum slope/height/volume (is this known)? Wouldn't adding more ice just cause more flow to the sea?  According to ""Ice Sheet Modeling""     ice behaves as a deformable plastic material, which means that there   is a critical shear stress, below which no strain (deformation or   flow) will occur ... If the slope is too low, the basal shear stress   will not match the critical shear stress, ... but as snow piles up,   ... flow will begin. ... The result of this is that a glacier has an   equilibrium profile   I am presuming that the ice sheets are already slightly above their equilibrium profile (since they are flowing). Since the profile depends on the area and shape of the base (which is shrinking due to melting around the edges), they are already holding as much ice as possible, and adding more snow to any region will just accelerate the flow. I don't know on what timescale this occurs. (I have not tried the computer models described in the paper.) "

761,What denotes a parameterization in a model? (semantics ),"I know that WRF has many different uses and options, from atmospheric chemistry to uses with fires, and so on. What exactly denotes a parameterization? For example, in WRF-Chem, is the chemistry considered a parameterization? If not, what separates a mechanism from a parameterization? Is photolysis a parameterization? Are the biogenic emissions parameterized? "
762,Does finer input data lead to a better model accuracy?,"Climate and chemical transport models all need input files including meteorology data, emission inventory, surface data (e.g. land use type) to initialize the simulation field.   Take the case of WRF for regional meteorology data. I always use the 1 degree x 1 degree NCEP FNL analysis data in grib2 format as the model-driven data supporting the boundary and initial information every 6 hours.     Now, I find that the ECMWF interim reanalysis data with spatial 0.25 degree x 0.25 degree can also be used as the WRF input.   So, I'm wondering does finer input data induce better model performance? How much can be improved if the answer is true?      I have thought out some pros of finer input file (in both spatial and temporal scale):  pros: (1) finer input field means the physical process of smaller scale(e.g turbulent transport of water) can be depicted better in some extent; (2) finer temporal variation of chemical species can emulate the real emission process better(e.g, emission related to traffic in a day).   Are there any cons that come with the performance improvement except the computational cost?     "
763,How to locally identify a cold front passage?,"I know that the passage of a cold front affects local conditions by decreasing the temperature and shifting the winds. Some precipitation could happen as well.  How do software that analyze weather station data identify a cold front passage? Is there a certain change in temperature, wind, pressure, or other variable that allows the software to identify a front?  "
764,At what humidity does it start to rain?,"As far as I understand it is perfectly valid for air to have 100% humidity. At that point, all water can still exist in form of vapor, non-condensed.  Does it immediately start to rain if humidity is >100%?   If so, why do we have slight rain and heavy rain if any 0.1% above 100% drops out immediately? That should always be only a small amount of rain and rainstorms could not be explained.  If not, what is the limit of humidity if not 100% and why can it exceed 100%?     I have tried to understand the Wikipedia article but I'm stuck in various places:     Water vapor is the gaseous state of water and is invisible   Invisible to me would mean that clouds are excluded from humidity.     Absolute humidity is the total mass of water vapor present in a given volume of air.   That again makes me think a cloud must be included.     The humidity is affected by winds and by rainfall.   Rainfall certainly decreases humidity, but it is not stated at what percentage it starts to rain. "
765,Specific humidity range in tropical lowlands?,"I am running a land biosphere model that uses meteorological data as drivers. The model has a threshold of 32g/kg for specific humidity. The data I am using taken from a reanalysis performed by J. Sheffield at Princeton has some values of S. Hum. higher than 32g/kg. Given that such data is of resolution of 1 degree and 3 hourly interpolated from 6-hour data, what is a typical range for S. Hum. in lowland tropical areas. I need to know this to deem if these data is close enough to the real world or if it includes unrealistic values I will consult the author and point out that data might be inaccurate for these regions. It is difficult to find online any direct measurements, I only find these big data sets such as NCAR-NCEP.  edit: looking at a region of the Amazon, I see frequent values around the 30g/kg range, for example here [website]"

767,Evaporation loss formulas,"A while ago I created a spreadsheet to calculate evaporation loss. I found several formulas to do that, two from Kevin Rafferty and one from Engineering Toolbox. The one from Engineering Toolbox was too convoluted, and I couldn't figure out how to write it in Excel. The ones from Rafferty were fairly straightforward, but the two he published were different and yield different results.   The first is from Kevin Rafferty, P.E., Pond Heat Loss, 1986:    [tex]  Where:     [tex] = Rate of evaporation in lbm/h   [tex] = Pond surface area in ft[tex] [tex] = Air velocity in ft/sec [tex] = Saturation vapor pressure of pond water in psia [tex] = Saturation pressure air dew point in psia [tex] = Surface temperature °F   The other is from Kevin Rafferty, P.E., Tonya Boyd, Aquaculture Information Package, 1998:    [tex]  Where:   [tex] = Rate of evaporation (lbm/h) [tex] = Pond surface area (ft[tex]) [tex] = Air velocity (mph) [tex] = Saturation vapor pressure of pond water (psia) [tex] = Saturation pressure at the air dew point (psia)   [tex] is calculated by the formula  [tex]  [tex] is calculated by the same formula except that the dew point temperature in °F is used in place of [tex], so the pond surface temperature is used in both main formulas, except that in the second formula it is used to calculate the pond saturation vapor pressure.  The spreadsheet file can be found here.  Does anyone have any idea which is the more accurate?   "

770,Algorithmically Determining the Rainy Season,"I have historical precipitation data for hundreds of cities around the world. I would like to algorithmically determine when the rainy season (if exists) is for each location. Are there any algorithms out there that can determine this based on the monthly averages alone?  Some problems that I envision are:   Having a lot of rain is not enough. Many places in south east asia have very heavy rain falls for a couple of minutes a day, but it still is not necessarily considered rainy season. Is it better to say that if the weather is x standard deviations above the average precipitation that it is rainy season or use a moving average? Any other ideas, links, etc?   I'm brand new to the field so help and an open discussion would be appreciated. "

776,Differences between TEOS-10 and EOS-80 for salinity,"In 2009, the oceanographic community decided to adopt the Thermodynamic Equation Of Seawater - 2010 (www.teos-10.org) as the standard to calculate the properties of seawater. As part of that, they changed from the conductivity-based salinity (Practical Salinity, PSS-78, as part of the EOS-80) to Absolute Salinity (mass fraction of salt in seawater). What are the main differences between the two standards? Where in the world ocean should we expect to see the biggest differences between the two?  "
777,What are the benefits of using conservative temperature in oceanography?,"The new standard for ocean temperature is the ""conservative temperature"". It is based on a hypothetical adiabatic and isohaline change in pressure to the sea surface. Conservative temperature was adopted as the standard by the oceanographic community as part of the Thermodynamic Equation Of Seawater - 2010 (www.teos-10.org). The previous standard (EOS-80) was Potential Temperature.   What are the differences between potential and conservative temperatures? What are the benefits of using conservative temperature? Where should I expect the biggest departures between the two temperatures and why?  "
778,Are Southern Hemisphere 'Polar Blasts' caused by global warming?,"The SMH journalist writes about a cold snap hitting the East Coast of Australia in July 2015:     Proof of the big chill will be the extent of regions across Tasmania, Victoria and NSW experiencing zero temperatures, the Bureau of Meteorology said.      A belt of low pressure systems is a fairly permanent feature of Antarctica. One of those lows - at a latitude of about 55-60 south - is currently to the south of Tasmania and further from the Antarctic coast than usual, Dr Trewin said.   What would cause this low pressure zone to extend further from the Coast of the Antarctic than usual? Could it be a large chunk of ice melting?  My question is: Are Southern Hemisphere 'Polar Blasts' caused by global warming? "
779,Making sense of the math of climate change,"Let me state upfront, I'm not arguing the existence of climate change, just trying to clarify my own understanding of something that doesn't make sense to me yet. With apologies for the layman's question...  I've seen similar numbers frequently, but let's use this xkcd  as a reference. It states that a 4.5 C change in the global climate is the difference between Boston under a half mile of ice, and the temperate zone it is today. Boston's current annual average temp is 10.75 (~15 average high, ~7 average low). Looking for an analog for a city that's about 4.5 C cooler than Boston gives a location like Moncton, New Brunswick. Colder, yes, but not buried under half a mile of ice.   My brain says that a place covered by ice is far colder than current temps minus 4.5 C, and that since the ice sheets covered so much of the earth, I can safely skirt the ""climate is global, you're looking at local temps"" hangup. So what gives? How can a climate like Boston's cool by ""only"" 4.5 C and support such enormous glaciers? It would seem that the presence of such enormous ice sheets would imply that the average temperature must have been far colder than that... "
780,Different atmospheric models available for personal usage?,"We are two high schoolers who would like to embark on a project to simulate the atmospheres of exoplanets.  More specifically, we would like to change the atmospheric composition of such planets. We have seen various climate models, such as CESM and PlaSim. Unfortunately, CESM appears to be quite complex, while the latter option doesn't have the resources we would need.  Are there any other simulators that may consistently do the same thing, but need lower computer specifications? Otherwise, are there any resources to become familiar with CESM at a high school level?  Furthermore, what would be the required specifications for running CESM on a fairly consistent basis? I have heard that you would need a cluster, but we currently do not have access to one. We may be able to rent one out, but we'd rather be familiar with CESM before we do.  Thank you!  EDIT: (for clarification) I know a bit of FORTRAN, and have access to help from a Physics instructor. Although I understand that it may be out of the reach of two high school students, is there any sort of ""crash course"", one could recommend on more advanced astronomical physics?  Furthermore, we are interested in a rocky exoplanet, and potentially have access to a cluster/help from a professor.  Thank you once again! "
781,"How to calculate air temperature for given time, location and altitude?","I would like to calculate (estimate) air temperature at given time, location and altitude.  All I have is air pressure for 20°C. The formula based on NTP (Normal Temperature and Pressure) to calculate pressure.  =101325*(1 - 2,25577*10^-5*h)^5,25588  h is height in meters` result is in Pascals.  I expect that the formula for calculation of the temperature would depend on sun position or even solar radiation. I know that the formulas for calculation of the sun position or solar radiation are complicated but maybe there are source codes/programs which can do that? So I could use such program to calculate what I need? I have found SolTrack (C/C++) on SourceForge which calculates various data like rise time, transit time, azimuth, altitude, ecliptic longitude, latitude, right ascension, declination... However I cannot use these results to calculate temperature.  Purpose of the calculation  I would like to use the calculation for game, to generate air temperatures for map. The game is not simulator it is just game. So I need to add some values to the map so when the aircraft flies it can accept some temperature changes. The values are important in vicinity of terrain, mountains and hills. I don't need include winds into the calculation.  Calculation of Solar Radiation What I have found so far is calculation of solar radiation written in Visual Basic - it is xls table (Excel) ecy.wa.gov/programs/eap/models/solrad.zip. Where I have added the pressure for 20°C. Of sure the problem here is unsolved because I suppose the temperature and pressure changes during time.

783,Should Imilac (meteorite) be singular or plural?,"I first saw the term ""Imilac meteorite"" in this BBC News article. It shows a photograph of a meteorite on display along with the caption:     The Imilac meteorite was found in the Atacama Desert in Chile in 1822.   I then looked it up in Wikipedia's article Imilac and saw:     Imilac is a pallasite meteorite found in the Atacama Desert of Northern Chile in 1822.   Both of these sound like there is one meteorite, and it's is called the Imilac meteorite.  But then the article goes on to say:     Classification:      Imilac is classified as a stony–iron pallasite. Imilac specimens are highly prized by meteorite collectors due to its high concentration of beautiful olivine grains.      Strewn field:      Numerous masses were found in a valley to the SW of Imilac. The total weight of the Imilac fall is estimated to be around 1,000 kilograms (2,200 lb). The primary strewn field is long about 8 kilometres (5.0 mi).   There seems to be multiple, distinct specimens, and yet I don't see ""Imilac meteorites"" (plural) written here or anywhere. For example, in this British Natural History Museum article The Imilac meteorite: a gem as old as the solar system:     Pallasite meteorites like the Imilac formed in the asteroid belt, located between Mars and Jupiter. They are made up of minerals and metal, remnant materials from the first few million years of the solar system.      They formed inside asteroids at a time when planets were only just coming together.   So are all of these Imilac specimens believed to be fragments of one single object that exploded before reaching the surface? If so, why not call them Imilac meteorites (plural) instead of talking about ""Imilac meteorite"" as a name for a material that is uncountable?   "

787,"Coal self-heating and spontaneous combustion, how does this happen?","I finally broke down and read the Wikipedia article on spontaneous combustion and I was surprised to see how serious of a problem this can be. Wet hay, oily rags, there really are exothermic reactions in these combinations that speed up as the temperature increases.  Then I saw the following:     Coal      Self-heating in coal has been extensively studied. The tendency to self-heat decreases with increasing rank of the coal. Lignite coals are more active than bituminous coals, which are more active than anthracite coals. Freshly mined coal consumes oxygen more rapidly than weathered coal, and freshly mined coal self-heats to a greater extent than weathered coal. The presence of water vapor may also be important, as the rate of heat generation accompanying the absorption of water in dry coal from saturated air can be an order of magnitude or more than the same amount of dry air.   I understand that coal is a complex material, it's more than a lump of carbon. But what are the types of chemical reactions within coal that will cause a pile of it to self-ignite? Is moisture always required? Is there moisture in freshly mined coal naturally, or is it absorbed hygroscopically from the atmosphere or is a liquid source necessary (getting wet)? "
788,Why is Helium only found in wells mixed with natural gas?,All commercially available helium comes from natural gas wells?  Is it theoretically possible to have a pure helium well?  Helium is produced by the radioactive decay of primordial uranium and thorium.  It should not be strongly associated with non-primordial 'fossil' hydrocarbons. 
789,The phase of a seismic source,"There are different seismic sources for both land and marine acquisition surveys. Measuring the spectral characteristics (phase, frequency, amplitude, etc.) is a critical part of evaluating the usefulness of the source and is quite difficult to measure accurately (especially on land). We always seek to generate an impulse (or a Dirac spike).      All this said, my question is this: how and why do different frequencies retain various phase delays and amplitudes? Is this a phenomenon that does not occur the instantaneous moment the source is used...? I used Seismic Unix to generate the figure below - note that a phase diagram is not included here, but you already know that there some degree of phase delay/difference associated with each frequency (note: the horizontal axis is frequency and vertical is amplitude):    If my question seems vague, think of it this way. Let's say I (and my source) are in an infinite, elastic, and homogeneous medium. I set off my source (note that it is NOT a perfect impulse), and the result may look like what is pictured below. What causes frequencies to retain different amplitudes? What causes the phase delay associated with each frequency? I know I've included a lot here, regardless, any insight/comments are greatly appreciated. "

Ceil rounds up; floor rounds down.  The problem is that if I set old date like 1849/06/31 11:15 The Solar constant corrected to Radius does not fit the historical records. In the case the result would 1322.3 be for SolConst 1367. Which is crazy. According historical data it should be 1361.035. So I expect the radius is wrong calculated.

791,Seismic Reflectivity and Fractal (Random) Behavior,"*One of the fundamental assumptions of the convolutional model (and subsequently a lot of deconvolution methods) is that reflectivity is a purely random (or ""white"") process. Overall, the only predictable part of a seismogram is that of the source wavelet. Now, reflectivity is NOT purely random. Despite this, the convolutional model is still a very useful tool.  -My question(s) is this: what if reflectivity is somehow predictable? What would that (for lack of a better word/phrase) look like? How would that jeopardize the usefulness of different deconvolution methods...? Thanks in advance to anyone who can help clarify this. "
792,Hydrology - Depression cone VS transmissivity,"My question concerns the depression cone of a pumping well in a confined aquifer: Say the transmissivity of the aquifer is 1200 m^2/day how will the cone change if the transmissivity is 600 m^2/day? All the aquifers parameters stay constant in both scenarios and so is the pumping rate (say- 300 cm/hr).  The main interest is what happens to the radius of influence (where there will be no change in head from the aquifers regional head)? and also what happens to the head at the well it self?  Thanks, Asher "
793,correct way to calculate transport through a section in an ocean numerical model,"Suppose that I want to calculate the transport across a certain transect (green line) from the outputs of an ocean numerical model. The model has the [tex] values at the center of the grids (crosses) and the [tex] values at the corners (circles), as it uses a C-grid.    Should I use the velocity values closest to the transect? Should I average the values at the corners? Interpolate?  Side question: does anyone know some Matlab toolbox to analyze numerical model outputs? "
794,Predicting rainfall with governing equations,"Which model is a good starting point for predicting precipitation (rain) for 24 hours in advance? I looked at Kalnay's Atmospheric modeling, data assimilation and predictability, and Holton's An Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology as well as various other sources. These are great references but I could not figure out which part I could use to compute what I needed. It seems there are governing equations which are solved numerically, the output is used for a prediction. I am knowledgeable on numerically solving ODEs, PDEs, and am familiar with Matlab, Python, but there aren't any references that I could find providing clear formula -> data -> code -> output.  The most talked about model with clear solution is the Barotropic Vorticity Equation, which, I believe, models wind and pressure. This model was proposed by Charney, Fjortoft and von Neumann during the 50s, and solved with a computer, the results are recreated by Peter Lynch on 2008 (Matlab code available). Could this model be used for rainfall prediction?   If one has to dig in the basic equations, which part of the governing equations should I focus on? Any pointers, references with running code is most welcome. "
795,Light at the coast - is it different?,"I have heard artists talk about the unique quality of light near the sea, and now I live near the coast I want to know if there's any truth in it. Does being near the ocean affect light inland?  I'm in the UK, where it's not usually  clear blue skies; it's cloudy or partially cloudy (clouds may have an effect?).  I've lived in a flattish region in the centre of the UK, and at the coast. I think it's brighter here, but I can't figure out if it's a real difference. And Google is silent.  I've come up with possible explanations:   It's purely psychological It's a side-effect of the big horizons making places feel lighter because more sky is visible Sunlight reflects off the sea, and the clouds scatter it back onto the land   Is this real? If so, what's the mechanism and how far inland does the light penetrate? "

797,Why are the latest additions to the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain the highest?,"The Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain stretches from Russia to the Hawaiian islands.  When I look at them on a map, it seems that the oldest seamounts by Russia are shorter and smaller than the newer seamounts/islands, and even in the most recent additions (the Hawaiian islands) there seems to be a gradient in size, with the older islands being the smallest and the newest island by far the largest and with the tallest volcanoes.  Is this gradient in size due to erosion?  Were the seamounts at one point islands?  Or is there something related to the volcanic activity and plate motion itself that is producing larger volcanoes more recently? "
798,How quickly can coral fossilize?,"On a trip to Honduras a few years ago I visited one of the islands off its north coast with a friend and went to a section of it mostly with nothing but residences which looked far less visited by tourists and which had no live coral off the coast in that section of island unlike other parts of it. While in that area we saw what looked like a rocky protrusion a little off from a small beach, about 50 or so yards offshore, so my friend and I waded out to it and we were stunned to discover that it was a rather large exposed section of coral that had been completely fossilized. It was pitted in parts, reminding me a bit of the surface of the moon, but we clearly saw amazing varieties of coral and their fossilized contours and patterns in the ""rock"".   But more puzzling is that it protruded at its base a good 1-2ft above sea level on average (though erosion made the edges gradually slope down to the water) and up to probably betweeb 5 to 7ft above sea level in some other areas where the coral [or mass it was on] protruded), which made the higher sections clearly higher than the beach we had just waded from. That seemed to indicate that the ocean level may have been quite a bit higher when it was still alive and parts of the island may have been more submerged at some point in the past if I had to guess.   Ignoring for a moment my imprecise measurements and notes about its exposure relative to sea-level, how long would it take any portion of alive and healthy coral to fossilize once exposed directly to the sun outside of/above water at its quickest, turning rock-grey and becoming firm, even if the fossilization process is not completed to its utmost extent? Can it happen in a few thousand years, or does it happen only at a significantly slower rate than that? Has any such process of fossilization actually been observed (as proceeding through its stages) at any point throughout recorded human history, and what would intermediate stages look like in terms of color, firmness, etc.?   I am not an earth scientist so you'll have to go easy on the explanation here.    Edit: I have now uploaded some photos to Flickr of the particular coral I saw. The ""mini island"" (I'll call it) was quite alien-looking and bizarre in places, also overgrown with some plants on the main mass, but you can, for example, see the close up I took of one fossilized bit of brain coral that was firmly set in the rock.    I also found a similar photo on Flicker taken by someone else taken from San Salvador (Bahamas) at what is identified as the Cockburn Town Fossil Reef, and the photo has an interesting scientific essay with citations in the image description.

799,Does the Coriolis Effect affect a wind from East to West?,"I'm studying meteorology for a pilot license and there I was taught as a rule of thumb that wind at higher altitudes is approximately turned 30° clockwise to the wind on the surface due to the Coriolis Effect.  The explanation I got is that if an air parcel moves e.g. towards the pole, it started with a higher velocity around the earth's axis than the destination point has, so it will arrive ahead of the destination point on the earth's surface.  While that totally makes sense for winds e.g. from south to north, or the other way round - why does the Coriolis effect also impact a wind that's blowing exactly from East to West? Shouldn't the origin and the destination of that wind have the same speed around earth's axis and therefore no Coriolis force should act on the wind? "
800,Debunking weather conspiracy with statistics - why does temperature rise then fall for last weekend in June in recent years,"I have a conspiracy-prone friend who believes that people are controlling the weather to ensure good weather for a large, annual festival (last weekend in June in San Francisco). As a scientist, (not earth science), I was interested in testing this hypothesis. So..I built 2 linear models--one representing the days leading up to the festival, one representing the days following the festival-- where the I regressed max daily temperature onto the number of days away from the festival. Lo and behold, indeed the temperature did appear to rise, peak on the weekend of the festival, and then drop afterwards! Next I figured, it must just be a natural trend, irrespective of local festivities (and weather-controlling overlords). So next, I included data from the years before the festival began (1972), made two groups (pre-festival and post-festival) and included a days_away_from_festival*group interaction term. To my great surprise, the interaction was significant! Testing only the group dated before the festival began, did not yield significant results.  And so! My question is... can any of you experts explain this by means other than a statistical coincidence/wealthy weather gods? Why might the temperature in San Francisco tend to rise in the week leading up to the last weekend in June, and then fall afterwards--but for this effect not to be present in the years before 1970'sish?  EDIT: Here are my two models.   The first model represents the days leading up to the festival and days are indicated by the countdown variable, (e.g. Friday = -1, Saturday = 0) There are 5 days prior included in the model. The group variable refers to the fact that I split the years into two groups, old:(1942-1971) and new:(1972-2017). TMAX is the maximum temperature of the day.    The second model is the same except it represents the days following the festival.   As you can see, after 1972 the temperature seems to rise, peak during the festival in the last weekend in June, and then fall immediately after. However, this effect was not present prior to 1972.  EDIT2: The data came from [website]"
801,What happens in the upper air when the altitude of the tropopause changes?,"I know about the seasonal changes of the altitude of the tropopause as well as the differences by latitude. I thought the change at one location was a very slow process, but I just found upper air observations through radiosounding from Iceland where I could see that the altitude of the tropopause changes up to 7000ft (over 2km) within 12 hours, such as:     What exactly happens in the atmosphere when the altitude of the tropopause changes that rapidly? Is air moving horizontally? Vertically? Is air exchanging heat energy with surrounding air? My best guess would now be that since the polar jet stream is above Iceland, it transports vast amounts of air, so an observer in Iceland each day sees different atmospheric conditions when looking upwards. How close to reality is that guess? "
802,Why doesn't subducted earth crust melt?,"If you take a look at a typical picture tectonic plate subducting under another plate, the subducting plate is always drawn as deep (seemingly tens of km) into molten rock, but the subducted part of the plate itself is not molten. Why are the subducted plates not drawn as shallower into the magma?  My logic looking at this is the following: the surrounding medium is hot enough to melt rock. Alright, rock may take time to melt. A typical continental plate moves 10cm/year which yields 100,000 years / 10km. Is an order of a hundred thousand years really not enough time to melt that subducted plate? Why are so many textbooks drawing it subducted and unmelted to such depths? "

The wikipedia article on sinkholes seems to suggest that they should be called collapses and not sinkholes:     Collapses, commonly incorrectly labeled as sinkholes also occur due to human activity, such as the collapse of abandoned mines and salt cavern storage in salt domes in places like Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. More commonly, collapses occur in urban areas due to water main breaks or sewer collapses when old pipes give way.   (emphasis mine)  The media keeps calling them sinkholes.

This will definitely change the climate. This argument for climate change seems easy to understand and bulletproof. However, I have not heard this argument mentioned by the media. Why? "
817,Why doesn't Wolfram Alpha show low gravitational acceleration for the Hudson Bay?,"I thought I would be clever and add a new answer to Hudson Bay Has Low Gravity? by using Wolfram Alpha to report gravitational acceleration for different locations, but it looks like my cleverness backfired.  From this answer I found this view, a subsection of which is cropped and shown below.  I chose three points, the lowest, purple area near the West shore of the Hudson bay, a medium green-orange in lake Michigan near Chicago, and a high area just north of Iceland.   I was surprised to see Wolfram report such a high gravitational acceleration for the Hudson Bay area at 9.85 m/s^2! I was expecting something substantially lower than 9.81 m/s^2  Question(s):   Why is the gravitational acceleration for the west coast of the Hudson Bay so high from Wolfram Alpha? Roughly what acceleration should I be getting there? Could it be related to Wolfram Alpha's use of EMG2008 12th order for a model? Why would it be reporting such large deviations in altitude for locations on water?

818,Do snow and ice have different temperatures at their interface?,"tl;dr: For snow on top of ice, is the temperature at the base of the snowpack always (practically) the same as the temperature at the top of the ice?  I was trying to understand how the thermodynamics in a sea ice model (LIM3) were set up and how one could set up a finite element method (FEM) for the heat equation in the sea ice system. My focus is on the skin temperature and its importance for the coupled atmosphere-sea ice dynamics. The whole point of skin temperature is that properties at the interface between two substances can be different from the bulk properties of either substance.  My first attempt at setting up an FEM following the same logic as LIM3's finite difference formulation resulted in an underdetermined system by 1 equation. I then realized that the model allows density, heat capacity, and thermal conductivity to be discontinuous between snow and ice (obviously) but the temperature was continuous. I get that the conductive heat flux has to be continuous, but is the temperature? If not, where might an additional constraint for heat diffusion come from? I can describe my FEM in more detail if that helps, but that might be better suited to a different SE. "
819,Modification of an air mass,"If an air mass that exists in North America starts moving south west or south east what kind of modification will affect it and how would you characterize it in it's final state?  My answer is that it would be a cP or an A air mass that would start moving so firstly it would be dry,cold and stable.During it's south movement it's temperature would decrease because of the latitude and also if it moves over any major lakes it would pick up some moisture.My problem is what happens when it reaches the Pacific ocean or the Atlantic ocean.I know it's moisture would increase but do I need to know if it's winter or summer to conclude if it's stable/unstable and cold/warm?  Is my answer complete? "
820,Using salinity to predict rainfall,"Recently, a new method has been proposed by Ray Schmitt (WHOI) and collaborators to use salinity patterns in the ocean to predict weather events (more specifically, rainfall) at scales from weeks to months. First, they were able to predict rainfall in the Sahara region. More recently, they have expanded their methodology to predict weather in the US and their method performed better than most of the traditional approaches (that included patterns like El Niño).  Predictions for  Apr 23 – May 6, 2019 (Source: Salient Predictions)  Considering that we are having more and better salinity information from satellites (SMOS and SMAP):   can we expect to have a better global seasonal rainfall prediction in the near future as they described?  What are the limitations of the approach?  How far in the future can we extend the approach?  "
821,How can linear oceanic ridges (like the East Pacific Rise) be explained by single point mantle plumes?,"I'm a bit confused about how divergent boundaries between tectonic plates work, or just why plates move. I've read that these ridges that are in the place of divergent boundaries are created when magma arises from the mantle convection, probably powered by a mantle plume. This creates a hotspot, but in every illustration I have seen, they use these plumes or just the mantle convection force to explain why plates move apart each other:    Here, that convection of the mantle is used to explain the formation of a ridge and why the plates move apart.  However, this is easy to understand with a cross section of the Earth like in that picture. But I can't wrap my head around the idea of this phenomenon creating the linear ridges we see extending across thousands of kilometers, like the East Pacific Rise. Because, that ""ridge"" we see in the above picture is just an elevation seen in a cross section of the Earth, that could very well be just a volcano or a single oceanic mountain, not a linear ridge of continental dimensions.  I mean this:    That can't be produced by a single mantle plume, right? Because a mantle plume is just in one spot. Is the convection force of the mantle rising across that entire line that is kilometers wide, creating a linear mantle plume? If that last one is the case, I would be even more confused about the shape of the convection cells in the mantle. Or are there multiple individual mantle plumes conveniently aligned across and beneath that ridge?  So, I don't understand how the ridge is formed. Because the first picture helps me only to understand how a single elevation spot is created, like an underwater mountain, or a volcano, or even a volcanic island, but not an entire ridge.  Now, I do know that the chain of Hawaiian islands up to Siberia was created due to the tectonic plate passing above a plume, or just a hotspot, and that created the entire ""ridge"". But are all oceanic ridges formed in that same way? Due to a single plume creating a hotspot and the plate moving above it drawing the ridge as it passes? Or is this a different process? Because I also know this is happening in the middle of a plate, not a divergent boundary  This is a picture about the Hawaiian island formation I read:    I hope someone can help me understand this a little better! Thanks! "

Can we quantify the relative influence of each greenhouse gas over global warming  ? "
823,Can CO2 / greenhouse gas levels override the effects of milankovich cycles?,"I understand that we are, in all likelihood, towards the end of an interglacial period (the holocene). What I'd like to know is, what has a stronger effect on global temperatures - the low point of the combined milankovich cycle, or CO2 levels of a certain amount (e.g. 600ppm, 1000ppm, etc)?   Could current greenhouse gas levels (around 410ppm) prevent us from entering the next glacial period, or will we enter it no matter what we do? "

825,What leads to formation of a nonassociative gas reservoir?,Why in some cases natural gas occurs in association with oil (associated gas) and in others there is no oil (nonassociated gas)?

826,Computation of geostrophic wind,"I am attempting to calculate the zonal and meridional components of geostrophic wind using the equations below:  [tex]  [tex]  In the equations:  [tex] are the latitude and longitude respectively,  [tex] is the zonal and meridional components respectively, [tex] is the Corlilios parameter, [tex] is the mean radius of the Earth, and [tex] is geopotential height.  I got these equations from the link below:  [website]My question is primarily concerned with the calculation of geopotential height. Based on my understanding thus far, geopotential is calculated using this equation:  [tex]      Note: [tex] is the local gravitational constant. It is sometimes I believe represented as [tex].   Which plugs into the equation for geopotential height below, where [tex] is the standard gravity at mean sea level:  [tex]  I think this works fine for the zonal component, however, it results (again I think) in an output of 0 for the meridional component. This cannot be true, can it? Am I missing something crucial?  I do know one extra piece of information. Under the continuity equation:  [tex]  Therefore:  [tex]   In short, I am looking for an equation that considers latitudinal and longitudinal variation in acceleration due to gravity.

827,How much hydrogen can be extracted from the deep continental crust?,"Far below the earth's surface, hydrogen gas is continuously produced through serpentinization.  At least some fraction of this hydrogen remains trapped in the deep continental crust; indeed, Soviet geologists found that mud from the Kola Superdeep Borehole was ""boiling"" with hydrogen.   Are the Kola Borehole results unusual?  (That is, would an equally deep borehole somewhere else find just as much hydrogen?) If not, why is no one trying to mine this hydrogen and use it for, say, producing energy or powering cars?  Is it ""just"" a matter of economic infeasibility – for example, due to the extremely deep borehole required?  "
828,"Rock ID: dark grey, white spots going through from Brecon Beacons, Wales, UK","I found this curious rock in the Brecon Beacons, a mountainous range in South Wales. The regular dotted pattern stood out from the plan slate and gravel in the area and I'm not sure if these are fossils or quartz?        The white dots run through the whole stone.    This particular rock was part of a gravel pathway and shallow quarry where the gravel was excavated from. This dotted pattern stone seemed quite abundant there.  The dark rock is fairly unremarkable and can be scratched with a coin. I believe there are quite a few slate quarries in the area and it does feel a bit like slate or similar.   I can't be certain it's the same but in the quarry it looked like the dots slightly extruded from some of the rocks (my apologies for the photo quality)     Does anyone know if this is fossil or quartz or how this pattern could of formed? I'm really curious. "
829,Atmospheric pressure in weather forecasts: actual pressure or sea-level pressure,"What is the usual way to report surface  pressure in weather forecasts online, in smartphone apps, on TV/radio? Is it the actual local pressure or the sea-level adjusted value? Does it differ by country?   Update: For example, English Wikipedia article on Atmospheric pressure says mean sea-level pressure is normally given in weather reports. And Russian Wikipedia article says the actual pressure is used. After some research I can say, that English weather websites I've seen report sea-level pressure and Russian weather websites mostly report actual pressure, but some of them report sea-level pressure.

830,Difference between soil Water Holding Capacity and soil pore volume?,I have got confused  I took 100g soil in a funnel with filter paper. poured 100 ml water and collected the drained water in a calibrated cylinder.  Water added in funnel = 100 ml Water collected in cylinder = 39 ml. Water retained by soil = 61ml. Thus soil WHC = 61ml/100g soil  Is this same as Soil Pore volume? If not how should I calculate soil pore volume by water volume method?

832,Near-Surface Investigations: FWI vs. MASW,"MASW is a common processing method for civil/geotechnical and even for oil/gas exploration (usually weathering static corrections) applications. In my experience, it seems to work well for most environments and various subsurface conditions.   The more I learn about FWI and MASW (for either Raleigh- or Love-waves), the more I realize that perhaps one day FWI methods will surpass any MASW processing because it attempts to overcome the limitations naturally imposed by MASW because of its inherent assumptions of subsurface conditions.   To date, I cannot find a case study that compares both methods in a single environment. Also, I realize that deriving a reliable source function, recording the 3-D seismic wavefield, and overcoming the stability constraints associated with multiparameterization of FWI (especially for elastic wave phenomenon) is task to be handled with in the future.   My questions are: (1) Has anyone seen a paper dealing with comparing both methods - if so, where? (2) Will some form of FWI possibly surpass MASW workflows (e.g. ParkSeis or SurfSeis) in the near future? "
833,Travel Times for Seismic Wave Types - Why reflected t-x plot curves,"I do not understand how the reflected wave in a seismic survey has a steepening slope (slows down)  Please bear with me as I lay out my thoughts because I feel like I can grasp all of this except this one thing and I am struggling to reconcile it.   If a wave source produces waves at a point, as in a seismic geophysical survey there are 3 types of waves which we consider. There is the direct wave, the reflected wave, and the refracted wave. The reflected wave is never a first arrival. The refracted wave is first lagging behind the direct wave before reaching it at the crossover point and overtaking it. This makes sense because the refracted wave has a higher speed but it does not register its propagation at the first geophone until a certain time has elapsed since the initial pulse at the wave source; and the direct wave has been traveling from the source all the while.   On an arrival time plot where time is the vertical y-axis and where distance is the horizontal x-axis we see that the refracted wave has an unphysical beginning at the y intercept and the direct wave begins normally from the origin. Where the intersect the refracted wave overtakes the direct wave. On this type of diagram the smaller the slope, the faster the wave. The slope of the refracted wave is 1/v2 and the slope of the direct wave is simply 1/v1.       What I do not understand is why the reflected wave has a hyperbolic or curved trajectory on this plot. The slope steepens as it asymptotically approaches the direct wave. It makes sense that over long distances that the direct wave and the reflected wave should merge to almost being indistinguishable, but how is it possible that the reflected wave plot as a steepening slope i.e. is slowing down?  The reflected wave travels less  surface distance per unit time the smaller its angle of incidence ( meaning closer to the source) because it is more vertical than horizontal. Over time it becomes more horizontal and therefore more like a direct wave which takes a shorter and quicker path across the surface.  What am I missing? Why does the reflection plot curve as it does? "
834,"CO2 density, is it really a greenhouse gas?","Since there are only 400 ppm in the atmosphere how can a molecule, which doesn't generate heat but absorbs it, possibly have such a great heating effect on the other 999,600 molecules?   During the Jurassic/Mesozoic era the density of CO2 was as high as 7000 ppm and the earth was lush with vegetation and animal life. Aren't we actually in an exceptionally low CO2 density, historically? "
835,Does tropical rain forest as defined by the Holdridge Life Zone classification exist in any meaningful prevalence?,"I've been recently introduced to the Holdridge life zones and their method of classification, and have been somewhat concerned/confused by the definitions of tropical rain forest as described by the system.  From looking at the zone of tropical rain forest, as opposed to subtropical rain forest or tropical wet forest, the minimum annual precipitation for the category appears to be 8000mm/8m. However, I've also found a number of mentions that the Holdridge system considers a ""true tropical rainforest"" to have annual temperatures over 24 degrees Celsius and annual rainfall higher than only 2000mm/2m.  The former threshold seems extremely high - very, very few places on Earth, even looking specifically within regions in the Amazon or SE Asia, appear to experience 8000mm or more of annual rainfall. However, an area with above 24 degrees annual temperature and between 2000mm and 4000mm of annual rainfall would appear to be considered a ""tropical moist forest"" and between 4000mm and 80000mm a ""tropical wet forest"", separate categories from the ""tropical rain forest"".  This seems like a very simple definitional question, but I've been unable to find a clear, solid answer on it. Thus:   Is it correct that ""true tropical rainforest"" and ""tropical rain forest"" are not referring to the same thing, when discussing the Holdridge life zones classification? Are there any appreciable regions in the world that are considered ""tropical rain forests"" rather than ""tropical wet forests"",  ""subtropical rain forests"", etc. under the Holdridge classification?

838,What is a seamount?,"   Per Oxford Dictionary of Earth Sciences: Seamounts are isolated, submarine mountain rising more than 1000m above the   ocean floor. The sharp, crested summits of seamounts are usually   1000-2000m below the ocean surface. Seamounts are of volcanic origin.        Per kaberett: To avoid classifying seamounts by arbitrary sea level (dependent on availability of surface water), the key point is   then that seamounts are features of volcanic origin that rise over   1000m above oceanic crust.        Per Wikipedia: A seamount is a mountain rising from the ocean seafloor that does not reach to the water's surface (sea level), and   thus is not an island.        Per Oxford Dictionary: Submarine means ""Existing, occurring,   done, or used under the surface of the sea.""        Per NOAA: A seamount is an underwater mountain on the seafloor.   Are all seamounts below the water, or do they include formations that rise above the water?    UPDATE: Atolls not within the scope of defining formations that rise above the water; meaning atolls are atolls, and not seamount crests. "
839,"What definition of ""seamount"" is used by the largest utilised databases of seamounts?","Appears that answering what seamounts are is a non-trivial question. My take is what matters is data, since authoritative opinions on the topic are at best subjective. As such, my position is the definition used by the largest (utilized) database of seamounts would be the best source understanding what seamounts are and are not.

If 75% of A and 25% of B are present, how many half-lives of material A have elapsed?  I was recently taught that the correct answer is ""one half of a half-life has elapsed"".

"
842,Is it possible for a sting jet to form over a continental landmass?,"Sting jets are thought to be responsible for some of the most damaging winds associated with extratropical cyclones in the mid-latitudes. So far they have only been confirmed in the European region, associated with the Shapiro-Keyser model of cyclone development. They have been considered to be much less important in storms forming in the Pacific which can impact the west coast of North America, though new studies indicate that they are theoretically possible, and likely occur in this region. (Do North Pacific sting jet cyclones exist?)  Two sting jets have been postulated as having occurred over the (continental) Midwest USA though. Given that the Shapiro-Keyser model is applied to oceanic cyclones, is it theoretically possible that these continental forming sting jets are genuine sting jet cases?  I don't know if the sting jet identified over the Canadian Maritimes from ex-hurricane Arthur 2014 technically nullifies this question, but I think it remains valid for those storms in the continental centre of North America. "
843,"How can scientists be confident of isotope ratios in past eras and varied locations, used for radiometric dating?","Radiometric dating relies on past isotope ratio predictions being very reliable.  However, this is not necessarily so. For example, in Uranium forensics, 235U and 238U ratios are about the same for all sources, but 234U varies and can sometimes be used to identify the source region. So, how can we be so sure that the isotope ratios used for radiometric dating are as reliable as we assume. What if the ratios of 238U and 235U we observe are a signature of the earth, like U234 is a signature of geographical regions?  Also, for meteorites, scientists say that the radiometric dating shows when the rock was last melted. Well, what if it was melted more than once? Does each melting reset the isotope ratios in the rock? If a rock of 4 billion years was fully melted, what happens to the isotope ratios in the rock? In pages that explain radiometric dating, that I have read, don't even mention this scenario - or the following one.  And what about the assumption that we can predict the isotopic ratios of the solar system 4 billion years ago? how is the assumption justified? "
844,Are Richter-magnitude 10 earthquakes possible?,"The largest earthquake since 1900 according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) was Richter-9.5 magnitude quake in Chile in 1960.

845,What would happen if we could revert $\mathrm{CO}_2$ production but took it too far?,"So recently, scientists managed to produce fuel basically out of thin air (water, air and sunlight).  And in a discussion I had with a friend, the question came up, what would happen if you took that idea too far?  Say you could build an air-to-fuel plant large and efficient enough to take CO2 out of the atmosphere faster than all the things we currently do to increase CO2 levels add it in.  What would happen? First of all, how far could you realistically even take this: Would it be possible with the used process to go all the way down to 0 atmospheric CO2 (or at least approach this arbitrarily closely)? And what effects would this have on the environment?  I immediately had three ideas that could happen but I wonder how realistic those would be:   Average temperatures would drop (inverse Greenhouse effect) (but how far?) Plants would eventually be unable to produce sugar through photosynthesis and die off Instead of acidifying, oceans would become increasingly alkaline. Lime might drop out of the oceans rapidly which could, perhaps, have cancer-like effects on coral reefs and anything that heavily depends on lime.   And besides those, are there any other obvious notable effects? "

849,How was the atmospheric/oceanic circulation different prior to the formation of the Isthmus of Panama?,Did El Niño extend all the way to the West Coast of Africa? Did the meridional overturning circulation exist back then? Was there another overturning circulation that existed? 
850,Why does the meridional overturning circulation take the convoluted path that it takes?,Why does it take the very weird loop that it takes in the Pacific Ocean? And also in the Indian ocean too?    
851,Why are most peninsulas oriented north-south?,"Weird question, bear with me. Most large peninsula on Earth are oriented southwards (and most of the rest northwards), much fewer east or west. Some examples: Florida, Californa peninsula, Yucatan, South America, Antarctic peninsula, India, Kamtjatka, Korea, Malaysia, Scandinavia, Italy, Greece, Greenland. Contrary examples would be east Siberia, Kola, Turkey. (Is it just me, or have this question ever been raised before in history?)  Is this just coincidence, or could conceivably some tectonic, gravitational or rotational forces help cause this phenomena? Maybe because the tectonic ridges in the Atlantic and the Pacific are north-south oriented and stretch almost from pole to pole? And could that in turn be caused by the dynamics of the inner Earth?  Elevation maps of Venus are more fragmented than the continents of Earth. And Mars is half highland half lowland. Neither has plate tectonics like Earth. "
852,What are the physical upper bounds on the magnitude of an earthquake?,"Given what we know about the physical mechanisms underlying earthquakes, what do the theoretical upper bounds on the magnitude of an earthquake look like? What physical phenomena impose those upper bounds?   Assume that we're talking about the ""modern"" Earth, i.e. from the past 4 billion years, after the Earth was fully formed. Also assume that only natural phenomena are involved - no nuclear weapons or Deep Children or anything of the sort.  If it makes a difference, I would like to know what the answer looks like in two cases:   No impact events are involved - the earthquake is generated by purely terrestrial phenomena Arbitrarily large impact events are involved, provided that the Earth still looks ""roughly the same"" (defined however makes sense to you) after the impact   We have a trivial upper bound of moment magnitude ~25 for the former case, since the energy released by a magnitude-25 earthquake is roughly equal to the total mass-energy of the Earth1 - but I'm sure you folks know of tighter bounds than that. :)  (cf. the question Are Richter-magnitude 10 earthquakes possible? - but most of the answers there are from a statistical perspective, not a physical perspective.)    Notes  1 As we know, the total mass-energy content of a system is given by   [tex]  Since the Earth's motion (both translational and rotational) is non-relativistic, we discard the momentum term as negligible and simply write [tex]. Using [tex], this gives us [tex]. Converting this to a moment magnitude using  [tex]  we get [tex].  "
853,Why is the Ozone Layer 'hole' more pronounced in the Southern Hemisphere?,"Lots of people comment that you have to use more sunscreen in Australia compared to European countries due to the hole in the ozone layer. (Even for roughly equivalent latitudes).   What would cause this imbalance? It can't be gravity, since that comes from the centre of the earth. Perhaps magnetic poles could have an influence, but I don't understand how.   My question is: Why is the Ozone Layer 'hole' more pronounced in the Southern Hemisphere? "
854,Is the difference in 'Summer tanning' in the Southern Hemisphere related to the Ozone hole or are there other factors?,"Many people have observed that people 'tan faster' in the Southern Hemisphere, compared to equivalent latitudes in Europe. Some Australians even say the sun is 'less bright' on a European beach.   Now is there some natural Earth-Science explanation for this - or do we go back to a climate-change explanation for this?  My question is: Is the difference in 'Summer tanning' in the Southern Hemisphere related to the Ozone hole or are there other factors? "

Using the compensation column, I reach:  $$ x = (\rho_w * 200\ m)/ 3300 = 60.60\ m $$  but normally I expected to find 290 m.  Can someone explain to me what's wrong? "
856,Identifying serpentinite reworked during high-T metamorphism,"What kind of mineralogy results when a serpentinite is reworked during high-T or UHT metamorphism? I am envisaging a possible scenario where an obducted ophiolite terrane is buried and metamorphised within thickened orogen.  Since seprentinite is hydrated/altered mafic or ultramafic rock, I would assume dehydration would be the first pathway. With further heating are serpentinites likely to yield melt? Could they end up as a 'normal' mafic granulite? Are there mineralogical or geochemical characteristics that could be used to identify a mafic granulite that started out life as a serpentinite? "
857,Optimal vertical coordinate for complex topography,"There are plenty of choices in models in so far as choice of vertical coordinate is concerned for meteorological models.  Five that I know of:   The sigma coordinate system - Hybrid coordinate system(used by ECMWF); Terrain following pressure as vertical coordinate that is used by WRF WRF Vertical Coordinate; The system used in CM1 which is Cartesian coordinate (that leads to metric terms); Step-mountain coordinate used in the Eta model, which was NCEP's operational regional model (NAM) from 1993 to 2006. Gal-Chen and Somerville vertical coordinate Gal-Chen Somerville vertical coordinate   How applicable are these different vertical coordinate systems in complex topography, especially in mountainous areas? Is there a case that one can make for a different type of vertical coordinate or can these existing vertical coordinate systems adequately reproduce meteorological measurements and observed phenomena?   Phrased differently: What sort of vertical coordinate leads to ease of implementation as well as adequate portrayal of weather events (lee troughs, pressure gradient force, etc) in mountains.  Please ignore whether such a coordinate system has currently been implemented by any model, but specify what an ""ideal"" vertical coordinate should be for complex topography.  "
858,Is it true that earthquakes are not felt in a cave?,"I took a tour of a cave in northern California last weekend. The tour guide asked us, ""If an earthquake occurred, what would we feel in here?""  My answer was, ""fear,"" but she said we would feel nothing - that earthquakes are not felt underground.  Although I did not contest her assertion, I have my doubts about it - after all, don't earthquakes normally have their epicenter underground (well, all the time, I reckon, as they can't emanate from the air)? And if an earthquake happened to erupt from within a cave[rn], wouldn't it most definitely be felt there?  I would think one might even end up with a stalagtite stuck in his noggin.  UPDATE  And, if I'm right (that there could be a whole lotta shakin' goin' on while on a journey to the centre of the earth), has anybody lived to tell the tale and really done it (told the tale)? A first-hand account could be riveting. "
859,Undersea riverbeds?,"On a meandering bit of research through Wikipedia, I was looking at the  Google Maps location of Texas Tower 4.  South-east of that location there is what looks like a river valley under the ocean. If you follow it back to the land it is obviously the Hudson river.  So my question(s) is: when was this 'valley' formed? Is the current of the Hudson river eroding this valley now, or was it eroded during a previous ice age? How old would this valley be? "
860,How deep are the cracks in the earths crust at fault zones?,"I have seen pictures of the cracks in the Earth's crust in Iceland and the San Andreas fault. To my eyes, the crack is relatively wide at the surface than a few meters down seems to be very narrow or just not there. I know this might seem stupid, but how come the crack does no go all the way down to the mantle? Is it that the crack opens and then the soft rock down below slides over to fill it in again?  How deep are the cracks at fault zones, I am thinking of the Silfra crack in Iceland between Europe and the US. "
861,"What is the significance of the ""super historic"" rainfall for July 2015 in southern California?","On July 19, 2015 there was record rainfall over the Los Angeles and San Diego areas.  This is amidst a historic drought and the rain is needed.  This article: [website]states that     Widespread showers and thunderstorms across the Desert Southwest are being fueled by moisture from former Hurricane Dolores.   and     Los Angeles and San Diego set all-time rainfall records for the month of July on Saturday.   and     National Weather Service meteorologist called [it] ""super historic.""

863,Significance of crystal classes in crystallography,"I am studying crystals and I learned that there are 32 crystal classes with well-described data regarding symmetries. I have visited a few sites and am having difficulty determining the significance of these classifications. For example, how can any crystal be categorized under these 32 classes? I understand that the information exists somewhere within the symmetry data, but it's difficult to tell what it says; I'm trying to learn a lot of foreign concepts at once (space groups, lattices, symmetry concepts, etc.).  I suppose I'm asking two questions: how can I determine the class a mineral falls under and how were the 32 classes determined? "
864,Should RTM amplitudes (pre- and post-stack) be related to rock physics properties?,"There is as huge uplift in the image quality near and under salt bodies (e.g. the Middle Miocene of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico) by using reverse time migration or RTM. We can now make accurate structural interpretation in places we couldn't just see using Kirchhoff migration.  Is it proper to make an amplitude analysis of RTM migrated data to invert for reservoir properties? Do RTM horizon amplitudes relate to rock properties?  I figure this will depend on the specific vendor implementation of RTM, and the assumptions made to speed up the code, but in its pure form is RTM amplitude friendly?  Please help. Any literature on the subject is much appreciated. "
865,How do the swirls and veins in marble form in detail?,I am finding surprisingly little information about this. I imagine that the process is somewhat like foliation except because the particles that go into marble (to my knowledge) don't have any noticeable elongation you get more amorphous billowing shapes rather than more regular layers. Any more details on this?    EDIT: Or does it have something to do with the magma intrusions that contribute to the marble formation process? 
866,How are low pressure zones tracked across the ocean?,"When you look at a surface pressure chart e.g.:    (from [website]you can see low pressure zones over the North Atlantic ocean. How are these zones tracked? I cannot imagine there are many monitoring stations in the Atlantic ocean.  Possible ways:   Ships - but I doubt there are enough to get readings over a wide enough area. Comparison of pressure readings from coastal monitoring stations. Are there enough points for accurate interpolation of the readings? Aircraft - comparison of GPS altitude to barometric pressure readings could give the surface pressure in a given area. That said, most aircraft travelling over the Atlantic are on specified tracks which may not cover a given area. Monitoring stations on buoys at well spaced locations in the ocean. Potentially impractical and a hazard to shipping.  "
867,When does the Northern Hemisphere reach minimum land area covered by solid H2O?,"What's the average day of the year when the fewest square miles of the hemisphere's land is covered by snow or ice or transitional forms like slush? Not counting anything below ground like permafrost or uh, temporaryfrost.  Maybe the land minimum is pretty late since North Pole air temps seem to flatline near freezing for ages? That seems to imply there's enough insolation to make it above freezing in the Arctic for quite a while if there was no snow or ice there to chill it by melting. So maybe the last non-permanent snow finally melts in late August or September or something and the ground has like 1-2 weeks before avg temps reach freezing again? "

870,What is the evidence it is feasible to reverse ocean acidification by adding large quantities of a base (bicarb soda)?,"A commenter made the following reflection:     Ocean acidification is different than sea level rise and global warming, however. With ocean acidification, we're making an excursion unlike anything the planet has seen in 300 million years. There's simply no precedent that allows us to say ""yeah, it's gonna hurt, but the world has already shown that it can cope with this kind of thing"". It hasn't. As far as we know, this level of OA could produce a full trophic collapse -- and that isn't something that even I can't be cavalier about, as it would certainly be a civilisation-limiting (and possibly complex-life-limiting) event. Until we know for certain that the impacts of OA will be less severe than this, we should be doing everything we can to stop and reverse it.   I did High School chemistry. To me it seems that if you have something that is too acidic, then you change the pH by adding a basic (base) solution. (Albeit the reaction may cause some warmth).   But this feels like it is missing something that smarter people than me have spent time thinking through.   My question is: What is the evidence it is feasible to reverse ocean acidification by adding large quantities of a base (bicarb soda)? "
871,How do long rivers exist?,"I was recently on a long-haul flight over Siberia and it struck me as rather remarkable that something like the Lena River could exist. It seems very surprising that there's a route from some random spot near Lake Baikal over 2,800 miles or so to the Arctic Ocean, which is downhill all the way. Likewise, the Missouri River tells us that there's an even longer downhill-only route from some place in Montana to the Gulf of Mexico.  But these things certainly do exist and it's a pattern repeated all over the world: the great majority of the Earth's surface is drained by rivers that run downhill to the sea. They don't get stuck and they don't seem to form huge numbers of lakes where they have to flood an area to raise the water level over some barrier. I'm aware of endorheic basins, which don't drain to the ocean but they only cover about 18% of the land surface, mostly in central Asia.  Is the existence of long downhill routes more likely than I imagined? (I can't tell if I think it's more likely in mountainous areas than in flatter areas, which suggests I have poor intuition about this) Or is it just a coincidence of our planet? Did the rivers make the downhill paths themselves?  "
872,Is the concept of seismogenic zone still relevant after the 2011 Japan earthquake?,"The concept of subduction seismogenic zone, where megathrust seisms occur in a layer between an upper and a lower limit is well documented in the 1990/early 2000 literature :   Some example :   Pacheco, J. F., Sykes, L. R., &amp; Scholz, C. H. (1993), Nature of seismic coupling along simple plate boundaries of the subduction type. Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth, 98(B8), 14133–14159.

Island Arc, 6: 244–260. doi:10.1111/j.1440-1738.1997.tb00175.x   But is this concept still accurate and used in the scientific community now ? i.e. after the megaseisms of Indonesia in 2004 and Tohoku in 2011, where huge areas break up to the surface and generate big megatsunamis. More exactly, is the notion of upper limit still making sense and, if yes, what are the currently-supposed parameters which control it ? "

874,Coral growth keeping up with sea level rise?,"On 11 sep 2016, the Australian Herald Sun placed an opinion piece by Andrew Bolt titled Drowning in cash: Pacific islands love this scare* about the $300 million** financial aid pledged by the Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, at a Pacific leaders’ forum in Micronesia last week (I guess that's this meeting), to help the Pacific “manage climate change and improve disaster resilience"".  Bolt's critique is that these islands do not actually face much danger:     The scare that these islands risk drowning as man-made warming melts our ice caps is wildly exaggerated.   Professor Paul Kench, an Auckland University coastal geomorphologist, along with Australian scientists, has studied more than 600 coral reef islands.   His findings: about 40 per cent have actually grown in size. Another 40 per cent stayed stable, and just 20 per cent have shrunk.   Much of that is because coral islands, essentially living things, grow with rising seas, as well as with sand washed up by the waves.   What’s more, populated islands can reclaim land.   Paul Kench's page at the University of Auckland lists several of his publications, and maybe the blog post refers to this one:  Destruction or persistence of coral atoll islands in the face of 20th and 21st century sea-level rise? From the abstract:     Here, we analyze the physical changes in over 200 islands on 12 atolls in the central and western Pacific in the past few decades when sea level in the region increased at rates three to four times the global average. Results show little evidence of heightened erosion or reduction in island size. Instead island shores have adjusted their position and morphology in response to human impacts such as seawall construction and to variations in climate–ocean processes.   The article is behind a paywall, so I cannot look at the actual study - the abstract does not mention anything about coral growth.  As far as I know, sea level rise is going to be much faster than coral can grow, plus we have the complication factor of reduced grow (or actual coral death) because of rising sea water acidity and temperature.  But it's still an intriguing question: Could there be a hint of truth in this, that coral growth could keep up with sea level rise? Maybe with a little help from us? Has this been investigated?  * You may have trouble following this link directly. In that case go to the start page, Andrew Bolt's blog, and look up the article there. ** Australian dollars, I assume. That would be US$ 227 million "
875,Deadly minerals,"I would like to go into mineral excavation as a hobby. What deters me is the fact there are quite a few deadly minerals/ores out there. My question is how likely is it there are those deadly ores in landlocked countries on Balkan peninsula? I know there are some cinnabar findings near me but other deadly minerals are usually found near volcanic vents and other geological formations not characteristic to Balkan peninsula. In statistical terms, how likely is it I will come across those nasty things here? "
876,Dig in the rationality of model evaluation of WRF with land-based station data,"I use WRF (Weather research and forecasting) model for in regional scale meteorology simulation. And then, the WRF output files will be deemed as criterial input data applying for chemical transport model(e.g CMAQ, CAMx).         The meteorology information are very important for chemical species in the atmosphere. It will influence its emission, diffusion, transportation and removal process and thereby determine the distribution of chemical in horizontal and vertical scales(healthy effect and climate effect related).   Since the importance of meteorology mode output data, the model evaluation process is essential before applying WRF output file for further use.    Several papers I have read mainly has the similar method that introducing some land-based station data(e.g NCDC) within the simulation area and compare them using statistic method.   Usually, we use point-to-point statistic metrics to estimate the similarity of observed data and simulation data in nearest grid in value(MB, RMSE, NMB, NME) and temporal variation(R).   But I have some doubt here  (1) The land-based data is the physics parameters collected from one specific spot and the corresponding WRF output grid data is the average value of the whole area(e.g 9 km^2). They represent the meteorology condition in different scale. What's more, if the station spot is near or at the boundary of grid system, how do we choose the best grid indices?     (2) We always regard the land-based observation data as 'true' value. But the instruments also have its own errors. If the observed data has large bias with 'true' physics process, it should be considered as useless. How do we evaluate the observed data itself and analysis it with certain uncertainty?    (3) More detailly, the WRF output data 2-m temperature(RH) and 10-m wind direction/wind are directly used for point-to-point difference. Does it reasonable to compare in these altitude or the value has little difference in several meters range.  I think this problem not just exist in WRF model. The air quality model evaluation may has the same issue when comparing simulated value with observed concentration. Is there any more advanced method?    Any one has some thought about this question can share your valuable opinion here! "
877,Are extratropical cyclones the same as baroclinic waves?,"Are extratropical cyclones the same as baroclinic waves?

878,How does one interpret negative geopotential height values?,"I am using NCEP Reanalysis Geopotential height data and this is at 1000 mb and downloading it from here - 1000 Mb Geopotential height values and some of these values are negative for a particular date - May 12th 2014 00Z. I am aware of geopotential height anomalies - Geopotential height anomalies  and that these can be negative i.e. the average of a height surface is lower than than what it should be. But the negative values I am referring to are ""raw"" geopotential height values and not anomalies.   When I sent them a note and asked them what that meant this is the explanation I got - ""1000mb geopotential height could be negative if the contour line drawn around the surface of the earth connecting all 1000mb pressure intersected with the earth's surface. At the point where the height was negative, the 1000mb height is actually below the ground and pressure is low.""  Can someone explain what that means as doing a google on  negative geopotential does not reveal anything meaningful ?    "
879,Formula for numerical model for sustained warming in marine sediment?,"I have been reading this paper and found simple numerical formulations to model the time duration, affected depth and amount of warming of marine sediments. The author uses a rudimentary estimate of the depth to which sediments are affected by an instantaneous, sustained temperature change DT in the overlying air or ocean waters that can be made using the diffusive length scale:  1 = √kt    (1)   which describes the depth (m) that 0.5 DT will propagate in elapsed time t (s). k denotes thermal diffusivity, which ranges from ~0.6 to 1x10-6 m2/s for unconsolidated sediments.  For instance, it is said that over 10, 100, and 1000 yr, the calculation yields maximum of 18 m, 56 m, and 178 m, respectively, regardless of the magnitude of DT. However, in page 6 (section 3), it is said that using a DT=1.25ºC (plus some other assumptions) during 100 yr of sustained warming affects a depth of ~40 m. How about if just DT is changed to 4ºC? deeper than 40 m in the same 100 yr?  I understand that (1) can be used to estimate both the time of the sustained warming and the affected depth. However, this formula does not provide a way to define the amount of warming or to estimate how much warming was applied if time and depth are known. Is there a formula for the amount of warming that complements (1)? "
880,"Possible new air pollution in town, what to do","Over the last approximately six month an auto parts plant in town has started releasing quite a bit of what smells like paint fumes. When it first started it was pretty rare to get an overwhelming breeze, but now it seems quite often, especially at the park a few miles away and often downwind.   Since this is a fairly recent new smell in the town, how do I know the EPA or state regulatory office are monitoring this? Who should I contact?   And after the EPA's failure to disclose lead in Detroit's drinking water, what kind of kits, or testing can I do myself? I have no idea what's in paint that makes it dangerous, only that it should always be done in well ventilated areas, ironically what the auto parts plant is doing. "
881,Would a global cooling event disable solar energy usage?,"Imagine that we've improved the level quality, affordability, and ease of use of photo-voltaic solar, and it's use is widely distributed in the USA.  We've improved the grid for power distribution, we increase wind, hydro, geothermal sources for 24-hour generation and create a storage network to the point where fossil fuel generation is only needed for, say, 20% of our energy needs, and peak/backup needs.  Everyone is happy, bliss abounds.  Would such a system be vulnerable to a natural disaster?  If there was another Krakatoa event, with an equivalent amount of ash thrown into the atmosphere, how much, percentage-wise, of a reduction in solar intensity would we see, and for how long? "

883,How fast does the Earth's inner-core spin?,"How fast does the Earth's inner-core rotate compared to the Earth's daily rotation?   The inner core is always described as a spinning/rotating solid core while the Earth has a single revolution per day. I've always imagined it as a fast spinning top, but realised I don't actually know if it is a faster spin or slower spin when compared to the Earth's rotation.  And even if I knew the speed (which I don't), a number doesn't mean anything unless compared to something relatable.  So how much faster/slower is the core rotation compared to the 24 hour day rotation?   Eg the inner core rototes 25 or 2.5times per 1 day. Or the inner core rotates 0.5 times per 1 day.  "
884,Why (actually) is the night sky so bright in the city? How far up is that happening?,"The recent news reported by the New York Times, the BBC and the NPR web sites (for example) as well as in the Iceland Review and Iceland Magazine sites, about the shutting-off of Reykjavik's streetlights in order to better enjoy the Aurora (northern lights), got me thinking.   There are many life-long city dwellers who've never really seen a relatively dark sky or more than a handful of stars. Even people who could do so sometimes have never made the trip out of the city far enough for the experience.  So I was curious if this ""lights-out"" technique could ever be tried in a city or somewhere else besides in Iceland.   I'd like to estimate how big of a radius of ""lights-out"" would an observer need for the sky to be noticeably darker. But for that I'd have to know what is actually doing the scattering, and how far up does it extend.  My question: Why (actually) is the night sky so bright in the city? How far up is that happening?  I'm also curious if it is generally stronger in some climates vs others. "
885,What? Northern lights are *not* simply caused by energetic charged particles from the sun?,"Reading the article Northern Lights: The traditional explanation for the aurora borealis is wrong, physicist says I was surprised to find out that the simple, standard explanation for the production of aurora that I have always read and cited (and is described well in this answer and it's linked sources) is at best incomplete.  The article cites this talk and this video. Briefly, the size and brightness of at least some Auroral displays are larger than can actually be explained by particles from the sun simply following field lines down to within a few hundred kilometers of the earth and exciting the atmosphere, especially on the night side.  Magnetic line reconnection can serve as an energy source to accelerate electrons to higher energies (and fluxes?) to produce the more powerful displays.  I'd like to know - is this reconnection phenomenon important with most displays, or only in highly unusual events? Can Aurora observed at midnight be excited by the energy of the particles as-is (from the sun) or is acceleration from reconnection necessary to insert them on lines that reach to the anti-sunward line on the earth?  The following NASA videos appear to be related:  [website][website][website]"

888,Are there any saltwater rivers on Earth?,"I'm curious if there are any saltwater rivers on Earth. These would presumably arise if a saltwater lake had a river outlet to the ocean.  However, all the saltwater lakes I looked at (Caspian Sea, Dead Sea, Great Salt Lake Utah), apparently don't have any river outlets.  Do any exist? And the obvious follow up, why or why not?  Edit: For the purposes of this question, undersea flows don't count. They are fascinating, but I'm interested if any ""regular surface rivers"" exist as saltwater rivers. "

At the lower precision limit of the measuring instrument, there are values given like &lt; 8. For statistical analysis however, a defined value is needed.  What is the best possible way to deal with this?    Replacing it as missing values? Replacing it by 8 or even 7 (&lt; 8)? Assuming 0? Assuming the mean value between something like 0 and 8; e. g. 4?   Or is there a better solution, maybe considering the natural background value?

891,"Ocean level rising, or the floor getting higher?","I randomly had a question pop into my head: ""Why are oceans salty, but rivers are not?""  This article seems to provide a plausible explanation: [website]It basically says:   Rain keeps putting fresh water into the rivers, which is why they aren't ""salty"". Rivers, as they flow, pick up sediment from the earth and push that into the oceans.  It's more or less this sediment that makes the oceans taste ""salty"".   That leads me to my question:  Is the ocean really ""rising"", or is the floor just getting ""thicker/higher"".  The article states that millions of tons of sediment is being deposited on the ocean floor every year.  Most people say/believe that melting ice is causing the ocean level to rise.  I'm not trying to counter that, but couldn't all that sediment be a significant factor as well?  i.e. Maybe the ocean level isn't ""rising"" as much as we believe, but, rather, the water is getting displaced by all that sediment? "
892,How did Australia separate from India?,"So on a lot of maps of tectonic plates, it appears that India and Australia share a tectonic plate (hence the Indo-Australian plate). But in maps of Pangaea, India and Australia appear to have once shared a border. Since continents only move because the plates they sit on move, how is it that India and Australia have changed relative positions if they share a plate?   I've looked around a lot online and I can't seem to find a specific reason, and my science teachers weren't much help either. Supposedly they once sat on separate plates, and diverged from each other, with a mid ocean ridge spewing out sea floor between them. If this is the case, how did they fuse together? Also, I believe that Australia is currently moving towards India as well. Do convection currents change direction? "
893,Pileus / velum & altocumulus / altostratus - classification problems,"I have a lot of free time and often observe and take photos of the sky. Along with that, I always try to figure out what exactly I saw. I think that I have the basic understanding of clouds and cloud classification, but sometimes I see a situation which doesn´t fit the articles about clouds and there is a problem in classification. I have the biggest problem in case of the strange altocumulus lenticularis - pileus / velum clouds. See the photos below.   The first photo - several pileus clouds forming   Second photo - I would say this is not a pileus. The two photos were taken in the same day, few minutes difference.  The thirs photo - there is a lenticular cloud on the left. On the right there is.. I dont know. I would not say it is a pileus cloud.  According to definitions, there is no strict difference between pileus and velum. I am fine with it. I have seen some pileus clouds and those are often very thin, sometimes multi-layered. Velum is, in fact, a large (horizontaly expanded) pileus. I am fine with it. But, according to some definitions, it would be classified as altocumulus / altostratus, if there were no connections to the cumulus top. That makes me confused. I have seen many ""pileus"" clouds that were not tha classic, pileus. Those looked like altocumulus lenticularis AND isolated Ac len were present on the sky in these situations. Definition of altocumulus lenticularis doesn´t say anything about connection with low level clouds, though.  A situation I came across many times.. the sky is full of isolated cumulus mediocris clouds &amp; altocumulus lenticularis clouds. Ac len are supposed to form above terrain elevations, but I believe that there is a mechanism which allows them to grow above cumulus clouds. I have seen many photos all over the world showing a typical cumulus mediocris connected with a relatively large altocumulus. Like this one:  [website]My intuition says that it should not be classified as a pileus or velum cloud.  Have you ever seen the same thing happening ? What do you think ? "

Why is ocean surface velocity around 3% of wind velocity?  Is there a similar estimation for the depth of such a current?  Intuitively, a surface current can't continue to move towards the shoreline, as there is not enough space underneath for a bottom current to compensate the surface current, and those currents would interfere. Also, there should be some mixing of the water layer in the breaking waves near the shore, that would contribute to canceling the surface current too.  Having a wind-induced surface current directed towards the shoreline, how close to the shore can such current continue, depending on the steepness of the seabed, the wind and the wave conditions? "
898,Does negative reference evapotranspiration make sense using FAO Penman-Monteith equation?,"I computed the daily reference evapotranspiration [tex] using the Crop evapotranspiration - Guidelines for computing crop water requirements - FAO Irrigation and drainage paper 56. The outputs seems realistic regarding the dynamic and the annual total but the time series contains negative values (about 1% of the time series).  The computation involves many equations for the sub-terms but the general formula is the following:  $$ ET_0 = \frac{0.408 \Delta (R_n - G) + \gamma \frac{900}{T + 273}U_2(e_s - e_a)}{\Delta + \gamma(1+0.34 U_2)} $$  with   [tex] reference evapotranspiration [mm day-1], [tex] net radiation at the crop surface [MJ m-2 day-1], [tex] soil heat flux density [MJ m-2 day-1] (=0 in this case), [tex] mean daily air temperature at 2 m height [°C], [tex] wind speed at 2 m height [m s-1], [tex] saturation vapour pressure [kPa], [tex] actual vapour pressure [kPa], [tex] saturation vapour pressure deficit [kPa], [tex] slope vapour pressure curve [kPa °C-1], [tex] psychrometric constant [kPa °C-1].   It appears that the negative values are due to a negative values of the net radiation [tex]. A negative value of [tex] makes sense but what about negative [tex] ? How should I deal with these as I intend to use [tex] as input for hydrological modelling ? "
899,Why has the average low for the hottest months in Clearwater Florida about 5 degrees higher than the historical average?,Look up Clearwater Florida on Wikipedia and it gives you the average low for the Months of July and August as being 74.2F. About 3-4 years ago I picked up running as a main hobby and the temperature is the biggest factor determining my speed every day. Since then Ive been following the temperature and I am sure that for the last 2-3 years at least the daily low has been 78F to 82F for a mean of about 80F.  Why is the recent average lows for July and August so much warmer than the historical average?  Is this just a recent trend due to El Nino or some other weather pattern? 
900,Did the Haber-Bosch process enable the population explosion?,"Im a bit confused on how crucial Nitrogen fixation with the Haber-Bosch process really was. On the Wikipedia page of the Haber-Bosch process it says:     In combination with pesticides, these fertilizers have quadrupled the   productivity of agricultural land.      With average crop yields remaining at the 1900 level the crop harvest   in the year 2000 would have required nearly four times more land and   the cultivated area would have claimed nearly half of all ice-free   continents, rather than under 15% of the total land area that is   required today.      Due to its dramatic impact on the human ability to grow food, the   Haber process served as the ""detonator of the population explosion"",   enabling the global population to increase from 1.6 billion in 1900 to   today's 7 billion.   However I have read that the products labelled ""Bio"" in the stores in Switzerland that don't use nitrogen fertilizers have only about 20% lower yields, which is a dramatically different number than what the Wikipedia page on the Haber-Bosch process claims (quadrupling of productivity).  What am I missing? Did the nitrogen cycle change so much so that we don't need nitrogen fertilizer nowadays? Did new technology enable us to get similar yields without nitrogen fertilization? What explains these numbers? Was crop rotation an unknown concept in the 1900’s? "

902,What is likely to have happened with these newly discovered antarctic volcanos below the ice?,"The Guardian article Scientists discover 91 volcanoes below Antarctic ice sheet highlights a recently published University of Edinburgh School of Geosciences discovery and cataloging of over ninety new volcanos under the Antarctic ice sheet. A new volcanic province: an inventory of subglacial volcanoes in West Antarctica by Maximillian van Wyk de Vries, Robert G. Bingham and Andrew S. Hein, Geological Society, London, Special Publications, 461, 29 May 2017, [website]edit: ...by clicking through the Lyell collection to here: [website]Below is a screenshot of figure 3, including a cropped subsection. If you open the figure in a new window you can view it at full size. In the subsection there are two rectangles with the word CONE above them. Below these words there are two traces. If I understand correctly, the lower trace is (for lack of better vocabulary) the surface of the Earth, and those cones have been identified as volcanos. However I believe the upper trace is the top of a layer of tephra:.     Tephra is fragmental material produced by a volcanic eruption regardless of composition, fragment size or emplacement mechanism.1      Volcanologists also refer to airborne fragments as pyroclasts. Once clasts have fallen to the ground they remain as tephra unless hot enough to fuse together into pyroclastic rock or tuff.   I'm trying to understand what might have happened here. the two cones are of the order of 10 km apart, and they extend above and below sea level. Was there an eruption below the ice which acted as a buffer and contained the ejecta? With some melting, some water below the ice could help it to flow over time and redistribute more evenly between the cones. Or would these volcanos just blow the ice away completely for an extended period of time and Southern Ocean currents could assist in the redistribution?      Fig. 3. (repeated here in case the original is not easily legible on your device) The upper panel shows an echogram from NASA’s Icebridge mission (NSIDC 2014) that shows generally good agreement between a cone on the echogram and on the Bedmap2 data. The lower panel shows an echogram from Corr &amp; Vaughan (2008) with basal topography picking out two cones; the dark layer above the bed is tephra believed to have erupted around 2000 years ago.  "
903,"What would be the depth variation of a ""water ellipsoid"" above a reference ellipsoid Earth?","The question If the Earth was a smooth spheroid how deep would be the ocean? has an excellent answer which explains the shape and surface area of an oblate spheroid before calculating the average depth of the Earth's surface water (about 2.7 km). The difference in radius, and surface area compared to a sphere look to be of the order of parts-per-thousand compared to a sphere.  But even within the approximation of an ellipsoid, the Earth's gravity is not uniform in direction nor magnitude, and so the assumption of a constant water depth from pole to equator may also require some correction of the order of parts-per-thousand.  How would one calculate the variation of depth of the water from pole to equator taking into account some kind of first order variation of gravitational force and rotational effects (centrifugal force) to get the shape of the ""water ellipsoid""? Does it turn out that the thickness would end up being uniform because the Earth ellipsoid is already a response to rotational effects, or would there be a pole-to-equator variation in depth of order parts-per-thousand?

904,Where are earthquakes felt more: on top of a building or on the ground floor?,"I have this notion that at the top, the building will be more likely to shake than at the bottom, where it is grounded.  So, how does it work with an earthquake? Who would be more likely to perceive a small earthquake? Someone at the ground floor, or at the 3rd floor? Or 20th floor? Or does it depend on the magnitude of the earthquake? "

906,Strange scar marks on pebble,My question is not specifically about identification of this piece of rock. Instead I am focusing on the origin of the scar marks on this rock. I have found this stone in the pebbles in the path. This stone is different from any of the pebbles present nearby. What makes these straight line curves on this stone ? Also what are the yellow dusts on this stone ?     Update  I found it in our university campus. I am not sure about its origin. Possibly it was there in the sand that was used for building construction. There is no other stone nearby that have similar scar marks or any scar marks at all. Location and Surrounding Pebbles  Adding Photos taken with Flash and using USB port and Blade for scale.      Harder than blade. The unclear glossy line is where I tried to scratch with the blade.  I have no idea about these marks. However as these lines are all straight lines sometimes it looks like a fossil of a tree that wrapped around the stone for long years. Some of the figures look like some primitive flower like shape.  
907,Could the earth be much older than the currently accepted number?,"According to wikipedia, the Earth is about 4.543 billion years old. If I understand correctly, this number is based on radiometric age-dating of meteorites. So basically, the logic is this:   We've got this material We can show that it's about 4.543 billion years old We haven't found anything older. Therefore this is probably about the age of the Earth   However inference 4 seems a bit problematic. How do we know that the Earth isn't significantly older? Could it be 5 billion years old? Could it be 8? Discounting the big bang theory, could it be 13 or even 15 billion years old, using only what we know about the science of the Earth? "

909,Identification: Greenish Greek stone,"Volume: 100ml +- 2% (yes, I couldn’t believe it either); Mass: measurement pending, but above 200g  I just bought a mineral identification book and it says to take a streak. I tried with tiles at home, but I am not sure which scratches which. If I don’t apply force, I see nothing. With enough force, I see very little white powder on the tile and white marks on the stone. I am not sure, whether the tiles are untreated. Here is the tile:   Here the stone after streak tests:   The stone is also harder than the coins I tried. They leave golden or red streaks on it.  With red streak from 2 cent coin:   With golden streaks from 10 cent coin:   The stone was given to me near Lafkos, 37006, Greece and probably found on a nearby beach, hence the rounded shape.  From the pictures in my book, I might guess green apatite, but I doubt it has the required density (book says between 3.16 and 3.22g/cm^3 I now try to determine weight and volume, but I have to ask my neighbours, because it exceeds the 200g limit of my precision scale.

This made me ask: is the movie-storm a realistic storm? If yes, under which conditions?  In particular, what caught my attention is the shape of the cross-section of the advancing storm, with dust protruding on the bottom and clouds protruding on the top at the same time. Could it happen? "
913,"In terms of the greenhouse effect, what is the Earth's heat capacity?","(Question moved from physics to earth science)   Has the earth’s atmosphere reached an equilibrium at which the input radiation energy roughly equals its output, or is the output significantly lower than the input because the energy is being used to heat up stuff? In other words – if the atmosphere’s composition remains exactly the same as it is now, will the atmosphere continue getting warmer, or will the temperature remain as it is now?   If Chuck Norris removed all man- and cow-made greenhouse gases from the atmosphere in an instant – would the atmospheric temperature return to ""normal"" in a few years, or would there be a significant lag due to the high heat capacity of atmosphere, oceans, and land?

914,Searching for ground water,"I would like to attempt to build a well-type structure in a woodland area. This woodland is mainly inhabited with Silver Birch and Sycamores and there is a shallow stream running down off of a moorland around 80ft from where the well would be ideally placed, but this can move.  My thoughts are that due to the prevalence of water there is likely to be a body of water underneath the ground simply through the natural process of infiltration.  So my questions are the following:  1) Am I likely to come across water if I dug this well?  2) How deep will I have to dig before I reach water or impermeable ground? "
915,How can I test my house water supply for hydrocarbon presence?,"I live in a city where the water supply quality seem pretty good on daily/average basis. However, it is also well known that there is a huge problem with deteriorating water pipes.

I say hydrocarbons, because it smells a bit like what you smell at a petrol/gas station. But in reality, don't know what it is.    How can I test my water myself for hydrocarbon presence? Where can I obtain such a test without having to spend a fortune on expensive equipment or buying ""testing services""?

919,What physical measurement / elevation is used to define Earth's radius?,"Earth's radius is usually given as 6378137 meters (equatorial radius), its flattening is defined as 1/298.257223 (WGS84), and thus its polar radius is calculated as 6356752 meters.  However, the average depth of the Earth's oceans is 3688 meters (i.e. 3688 meters below mean sea level), and the average height of all land above the oceans is 840 meters.  Assuming 71% oceans and 29% dry land, this gives  [tex]. In other words, 2374.8 meters below (current) mean sea level would be the ""billiard-ball"" Earth if all the oceans were drained1.  So, my question is:  What is the defining elevation of how the Earth's radius is measured? Is it the billiard-ball elevation, current mean sea level, or something else?  1 Of course, this ignores the oblateness caused by the flattening and all the undulations described by the geoid. "
920,Plate Tectonics vs Gravity for Creating Highs and Lows,"I have a question that I thought of when discussing a Worldbuilding scenario here. In that question, a super earth with gravity 1.35 times that of earth's is discussed, and is assumed to have shallow oceans. It is the assumed cause of these shallow oceans that got me thinking.   The question supposes that the shallow oceans are a result of a crust more uniform than that of earth, i.e without significant variations in depth, and that said uniformity is caused by gravity evening things out somehow. However, the imaginary world is also said to have more volcanic activity than earth, which I interpret to mean at least some tectonic activity.  My first thought was that there is no reason for gravity, at the scale we are discussing, to influence the uniformity of a planet's crust after its formation, and that plate tectonics would play a much larger role. I suppose the crust would be a bit denser depending on its original composition, and perhaps the magnitude of gravity influences the tectonics themselves more significantly than I realize. (Obviously with no gravity, there are no plate tectonics, and in fact no planet, so that's not what I'm after).  Earth Science Questions: What effects, if any, does gravity have on the mountains and depths of earth's crust? Assuming earth-like dynamics at play, would plate tectonics have more of an influence on the formation of a planet's crust's highs and lows than gravity? If not, why?  Bonus (World-Building) Question: Is there a way to construct a planet's crust and core such that volcanic activity is possible, yet gravity has the primary influence over crust uniformity? "
921,"In hydraulic fracturing, can total oil/gas production be broken down by stage?",I have a hydraulic fracturing data set with some wells and each well is broken up into stages. My response is total well production and my goal is to be able to predict this total well production. The number of wells is extremely low (&lt;10) for any prediction task though but there are many stages per well and each stage has a rich feature set. To synthetically increase my number of observations I want to try to derive a per stage production that is a little smarter than simply dividing the total well production by number of stages. I am thinking of using Gibbs Sampling to produce observations of stage production using the total well production and stage features as givens and a mild assumption of what the covariance matrix would look like. I am wondering from a hydraulic fracturing perspective if it makes sense to think of the total production being a sum of the individual stages?   For reference I am thinking of multiple stages in terms of this video: [website]

923,Is there a formally-defined converse of a Prominence Walk?,"My question was inspired by this one - in particular, the subtopic of pumping water from the ocean to the below-sea-level basins to deal with rising sea levels (spoiler: it's horribly infeasible and impractical).  I have also read about topographic prominence, line parent(s), key cols, and the concept of a ""prominence walk"".  Then, I was reminded of my experience futzing around with Google Earth's elevation data when trying to understand how Lake Assal is the lowest point in Africa (-155 meters / -510 feet) yet it's unusually close to the ocean (only about 5 km from the Gulf of Aden).1  Obviously there's a saddle point above sea level which separates this lake and ocean, plus there are line parents and a prominence walk crossing this saddle point,  but,  how about the line of lowest elevation leading up to this saddle point from each of the Lake and the Gulf, i.e. the converse of a prominence walk?  In terms of physical geography and the study of prominences, is there a formal name for this line?  1 Somewhat related:  I've been intrigued for decades about how Reno, Nevada is 4500' elevation but nearby Lake Tahoe is 6220'. "
924,Intuition on overall effects from climate change under different levels of warming,"I am not a climate scientist, but I have been reading climate literature lately for my own education. Much of it discusses various effects that could be expected with different levels of warming, usually by 2050 or 2100, e.g. reductions in crop yield, flooding, etc. However, I find it very difficult to intuit what the effects of various scenarios would mean in aggregate. E.g. say we have 4 C warming by 2100. What is the overall level of economic damage globally? Even better, what is a way to get a grasp on the level of damage or suffering that results - is it a societal collapse, or something similar to WWII, or something similar to the Great Depression, or something much less?  Are there any good resources or papers that discuss overall (net amount of damage, net amount of suffering) range of possible effects in an intentionally intuitive manner like this, for different warming scenarios?  Note that I am not looking for predictions of temperature rise. Ideally, I am looking for predictions of damage that are stated in a way that is easy to get an intuitive global handle on, given specified temperature rises, by specified years (e.g., presumably 1 C by 2030 would cause more damage than 1 C by 2050 or even 2100).  The closest thing that I have found to this so far are the burning ember diagram in the IPCC reports, and the corresponding referenced papers. This is a step in the right direction as far as what I am looking for, and gives some references that may be helpful (I haven't explored them yet), but still doesn't quite hit the mark for me.  Anyway, this might be a broad and strange question, but an answer or partial answer to it would help me greatly to contextualize the subject as I study it. "
925,"If the Kola Superdeep Borehole were opened today, what would come out of it?","The BBC News article The Deepest Hole we have Ever dug says:     This is the Kola Superdeep Borehole, the deepest manmade hole on Earth and deepest artificial point on Earth. The 40,230ft-deep (12.2km) construction is so deep that locals swear you can hear the screams of souls tortured in hell. It took the Soviets almost 20 years to drill this far, but the drill bit was still only about one-third of the way through the crust to the Earth’s mantle when the project came grinding to a halt in the chaos of post-Soviet Russia.   The first image below shows the top of the Kola Superdeep Borehole, and the caption says that it is welded shut.   Is there any way to form a reasonable hypothesis what would happen if it were opened today?

926,How does multiple layer seismic reflection work? How do we distinguish arrivals from different layers and their velocities?,"Whenever we are investigating multiple layer interfaces in a seismic reflection survey the root-mean-squared velocity is often employed to deduce travel time to a certain n-th layer and also to deduce velocity of any given interval. This is done because it is a way to account for refraction that is also occurring between layers which alters the reflection of a shot made through multiple layers.   What I don't understand is how do we know the travel times in any layer beforehand? How are we distinguishing between different travel times and assigning them to different layers we've distinguished? We need travel times of successive layers in order to compute the root-mean-square, but this is puzzling to me because how could you already know them?  Who is to say it is multiple and not just 1? or 3, or 5 or some arbitrary number? What about the arrivals to the geophones tell us this?  I don't get how we know there are extra layers in the first place to which we must assign travel times, and when they do exist, from where do these travel times come?  I have included a graphic to help show what I mean. The more I think about this, the more I start to think I don't understand multiple layer seismic reflection in general.

927,How reliable is sea-ice concentration (fraction) data in ERA-Interim?,"I am using sea-ice data from the European Reanalysis from ECMWF (ERA Interim), but some grid cells over land have sea-ice information. Not a big issue so far, because spatial discretization must always lead to some discrepancy in land-sea mask. But these specific grid cells, those closest to the coast (or even on land) show very weird values sometimes.   Should I just remove the first couple of grid cells, that are closest to the coast, of sea-ice data? Is this a well-known issue? Or should I just use another source of data? If so, which other source? "
928,What exactly is ammonite?,"I miss the definition of ammonite. In my opinion, many authors confuse the term ""Ammonite"" and ""Ammonoid"". Ammonoids (Ammonoidea) are large group of cephalopods including for example goniatites (Goniatitida), ceratites (Ceratitida) and ammonites (Ammonitida?).   EDIT: If you think that ammonites and ammonoids are the same, you are not right. Notice that researchers try to avoid using the term ammonite when talking about paleozoic ammonoids. Ammonites are usually refered to jurassic and cretaceous ammonoids.  ""While goniatites proliferated during the Carboniferous, ammonites thrived in Mesozoic times."" [website]But how can we strictly define ""true ammonite""? Is it because of the ammonitic suture? This way, many triassic, jurassic, creataceous and possibly paleogenic (danian) ammonoids could be called true ammonites, because they have complex (ammonitic) sutures.  Can we call all jurassic and cretaceous ammonoids (phylloceratina, psiloceratina, lytoceratina, ammonitina, haploceratina, perisphinctina and ancyloceratina) ammonites? Can you show me where ammonites are on phylogenetic tree? "
929,How to improve this prediction about the climate in future?,"The more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere the more global warming. The more global warming the more cloud formations that cool the earth and clean the air from carbon dioxid when rain- and snowfall, in a very longtime perspective.   Sooner or later the cloud formations will reach a point of equilibrium when global warming cease in a state of much more clouds, much more and stronger storms. When global cooling and decrease of carbon dioxide, the glaciation will increase the albedo and support the global cooling with amplifying feedback, as atmospheric carbon dioxid support global warming with amplifying feedback.  This seems to be in accordance with the historical peaks of temperature anomalies and carbon dioxide rates. The question is, does this mechanism works in the industrial era? Will the storms, if necessary, stop the extra  emissions of carbon dioxide? If human being isn't able to cut it down?    I can't change the question as that may make answers inadequate, but I will formulate your criticism under the line, eventually.   Simulations doesn't attests that clouds in general have a netto cooling effect. Rain and snow doesn't transport a significant amount of [tex] from the atmosphere to the ground in a short term perspective. The prediction doesn't refer to the equilibrium  [tex] in the oceans. The prediction doesn't refer to the effect of [tex] on formation of clouds or it's influence of the cooling effect of clouds.

932,Decomposition of variables in horizontal and vertical modes,"I have a query regarding the practical applicability of variable separable method. Usually we decompose the variables w.r.t components corresponding to different dimensions, this method is used to solve a differential equation analytically. When it comes to the practical usage, we are often provided already with the solution in form of model output. Is it possible to decompose them along their dimensions? For example I can write the zonal velocity as                U(x, y, z, t) = uv(z) * uh(x,  y,  t)   Will this decomposition be unique? I am clueless because it just seems to be a matrix multiplication. I wonder how would be the form of those matrices. Is it possible to obtain uv and uh from the data variable using any software tool?   Edit: An example of such a decomposition is provided here at page number 7 (equation 2.6). I wonder if it is possible to obtain the decomposed RHS values practically from a variable.   Moreover I often see a PDE associated with the decomposition which is absolutely logical. The equation is solved analytically by substituting the decomposed variables and different software tools are able to plot the analytical solution. The situation is little different in the study attached herewith. I wonder how to obtain the decomposed values if I am not getting any way to solve it analytically. "
933,Is there a way to approximate the density of air during rain?,"Given a rate of precipitation (in mm^3/hour), and average droplet diameter, is is it possible to calculate (or even ballpark) the density of the air+rain droplets at time of rainfall?  What I mean is, if I were to take a random metric cube of rain+air during rainfall, how much would it weigh? "
934,Assessing graded bedding in metamorphosed pelitic sediments,"I have the following image of metasedimentary outcrop from a Proterozoic continental rift-fill sequence:    The middle layer has a pelitic composition and contains abundant cordierite porphyroblasts (visible as weathered depressions). The layers above and below this layer are more psammitic. The lower layer appears to display inclined cross bedding, whereas the top layer seems to be more massive. I suspect that this outcrop preserves a 'fining upwards' sequence with the psammitic layers representing the coarser (high-energy) deposition and the cordierite-rich layer representing a finer (low-energy) depositional phase.    What I'm not sure of is which way this outcrop is younging. Are the cross bedded layers deposited on top of the pelitic layer (i.e. the image is 'upside-down')?  Or, was the pelitic layer deposited on top of the lower layer cross beds? "
935,"What are ""young thrust faults"" and why are they significant on the Moon?","The abstract of the new Nature Geoscience paper Shallow seismic activity and young thrust faults on the Moon reads:     The discovery of young thrust faults on the Moon is evidence of recent tectonic activity, but how recent is unknown. Seismometers at four Apollo landing sites recorded 28 shallow moonquakes between 1969 and 1977. Some of these shallow quakes could be associated with activity on the young faults. However, the epicentre locations of these quakes are poorly constrained. Here we present more-accurate estimates of the epicentre locations, based on an algorithm for sparse seismic networks. We found that the epicentres of eight near-surface quakes fall within 30 km of a fault scarp, the distance of the expected strong ground shaking. From an analysis of the timing of these eight events, we found that six occurred when the Moon was less than 15,000 km from the apogee distance. Analytical modelling of tidal forces that contribute to the current lunar stress state indicates that seven near-apogee events within 60 km of a fault scarp occur at or near the time of peak compressional stresses, when fault slip events are most likely. We conclude that the proximity of moonquakes to the young thrust faults together with evidence of regolith disturbance and boulder movements on and near the fault scarps strongly suggest the Moon is tectonically active.   I'd like to understand what young thrust faults are, how one can decide that there is a fault on the Moon (apart from the ""evidence of regolith disturbance and boulder movements on and near the fault scarps""), that it is a thrust fault and that it is young, and why this specific kind of fault is so significant here.  The Nature Geoscience paper is paywalled, but there is some additional discussion in Phys.org's The moon is quaking as it shrinks    Some background on the seismometers on the Moon:   Why were the “perfectly functioning” seismometers placed by Apollo 12, 14, 15 and 16 astronauts all shut off in 1977?

938,How big of an event is needed to trigger a long winter?,Could a small meteor or natural nuclear explosion melt an ice cap on Earth to trigger a mini ice age without the event being observed by people?

939,Amount of scattered vs. direct UV light from the Sun,"I was wondering about the common saying that on a sunny, cloud-free day, depending on location, you can get a sunburn even when spending the whole day in the shadows.  Already our blue sky provides ample evidence that there is some photon intensity  being scattered out of the direct solar irradiation path into the whole celestial half-sphere very efficiently. One can formalize this, by defining the ratio of energy in a certain waveband B coming from the sky minus the sun divided by the energy coming from the sun as [tex]  Also, as is known, Rayleigh-scattering efficiency goes with [tex]. Therefore I would expect it to be in the ultraviolet [tex].  But my question would be: What is  [tex] exactly? And how does it depend on lat/alt/time of the day...? I bet there are measurements as well as radiative transfer computations on this, but I have zero familiarity with the Earth science literature on this, so I'm asking here.

941,Project Mogul: Does upper atmosphere indeed have a sound waveguide channel?,"While the project was deemed a failure (see below), does the upper atmospheric acoustic waveguide exist?  What are the propagation losses for low-frequency sounds?  Where can one find further information on the acoustical characteristics of the upper atmosphere?    PROJECT MOGUL     Project MOGUL was first conceived by Dr. Maurice Ewing of Columbia University, NY, and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, MA. Dr. Ewing had conducted considerable research for the Navy during World War II, studying, among other things, the ""sound channel"" in the ocean. He proved that explosions could be heard thousands of miles away with underwater microphones placed at a predetermined depth within the sound channel. He theorized that since sound waves generated by explosions could be carried by currents deep within the ocean, they might be similarly transmitted within a sound channel in the upper atmosphere. The military application of this theory was the long-range detection of sound waves generated by Soviet nuclear detonations and the acoustical signatures of ballistic missiles as they traversed the upper atmosphere. He presented his theory to General Carl Spaatz, Chief of Staff of the Army Air Forces, in the fall Of 1945. ...      ...By December 1948, serious concerns had arisen regarding the feasibility of the project as first conceived. Even though the principle on which the project was based was determined to be sound, questions concerning cost, security, and practicality were discussed-that ultimately led to the disbandment of the project, and Project MOGUL as first conceived was never put into operational use. ...      ...The primary scientist for MOGUL was Dr. James Peoples, assisted by Albert P. Crary, the Field Operations Director. Both scientists had previous associations with Dr. Ewing: Dr. Peoples at Columbia, and A.P. Crary at Woods Hole. Both scientists were assigned to MOGUL for the entire length of the project. ...

943,Is the poleward migration of the maximum intensity of cyclones a result of tropical expansion or are there some other contributing factors?,"In the recently published article by Kossin et al. (Nature, 2014, dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature13278), they show that there is a trend toward poleward migration of the location of tropical cyclone (hurricanes and typhoons) maximum intensity in most areas of the world.   Their proposed explanation focuses on the tropical expansion (the increasing area of the world where tropical phenomena is observed has expanded in time). Is there some alternative explanation for the poleward migration of the hurricanes?   The shift seems to be occurring in the Pacific and Indian Oceans but not in the Atlantic. How can we explain that difference? "
944,Use of Neodymium in Paleoceanography,[tex] (i. e. the relative deviation of [tex] from a standard) is often used as a proxy in paleoceanography to identify the basin of origin of oceanic currents.

945,Will model resolution have an effect on model spin-up time?,"In terms of uncoupled AGCM studies, I've seen people use periods within a decade (say, 5 years) as spin-up time, but I also see some people take tens of year as spin-up in some recent studies.

For example if the same model is run in different resolution, would the spin-up time be any different? Thanks! "
946,Fine particulate matter - Why the lack of attention? What can be done to tackle it?,"If fine particulate matter as a pollutant from industrial or natural sources (e.g. a desert) can be such a cause for concern in terms of (further) desertification as well as health impacts, is there a reason why there does not appear to be much action to control or solve it?  For instance - you will sometimes see construction sites required to use a canopy and/or water to localize the spread of fine particulate matter to a particular site, and forestation projects can serve to anchor some land in the face of advancing desert boundaries - but such applications seem limited in their enforcement.   What more could be done to control and combat fine particulate matter (and perhaps avoid warmer, drier countries and regions from becoming dust bowls)? "

948,Sediment layer chronology,"In the new Cosmos series, Neil DeGrass Tyson in explaining different ways the age of the world has been determined, shows how sedimentary layers at the Grand Canyon are a fossil record of a lot of the Earth's history. He points out how each layer is (obviously) laid on top of the last, showing the chronology of various stages in the biosphere.   I remember learning how the Colorado river ""carved"" the canyons, on a trip there as a kid. You can visualize this -- the huge open canyons being eroded over millions of years, the riverbed turning grooves into valleys until enormous mesas are separated by the river. But, if the river ""carved"" the canyons, doesn't that imply the sediment layers were exposed from the top layers down, chronologically? How was all this fossilized life embedded in rock that at one point was a mile under the surface, that was later exposed by the river's erosion?  I'm not doubting the science at all, just trying to understand how the canyons formed.  "

This is a cyclic phenomenon of the Pacific ocean that   has a great impact on sea surface temperatures and other parameters.    A graph is shown below.  We were in the warm phase from roughly 1976   to roughly 2005 and now appear to be in a cool phase.  The strongest   El Niños like to be in the warm phase, which is not where we are now.    So perhaps we should be careful about predicting super El Niños.   I'm wondering: do we have a mechanistic explanation as for why? "
952,How does the amount of mass in an atmosphere affect the seasonal changes and dynamics of the planet's climate?,"I was thinking about this question, which may turn out to be simple, about climate dynamics: How does the amount of mass in an atmosphere affect the seasonal changes and dynamics of the planet's climate?  For example, while I know there are seasons on Mars, there surely isn't as stark of shift between seasons like Earth for example. Perhaps the amount of mass in the atmosphere really isn't a controlling variable? Perhaps composition or even distance to external heat sources is more important? "

However, there is another type of moonquake that occurs just 20-30 kilometers below the surface. Do we know why these quakes occur?   The article I linked above suggests that the cause is currently unknown, but that article is a few years old and is just a popular news article.

Of course, if we go back to the early Hadean Eon, there were no oceans at all, so obviously there was an upward trend, at least initially - but what was the nature of that upward trend?

The literature abounds with examples of AR models from different families applied ""everywhere"" to fully understand how streamflow changes throughout the hydrologic year. One particularly well accepted model is the periodic autoregressive model, as in Hipel and McLeod (1984).  So far, from all I've ever read, all streamflow AR models will have a signficant first order lag. That is, when one calculates the PACF to find the order p of the model, p will assume a value of 1, at least.   Is there any known case registered in the literature of an AR streamflow model of order 0, i.e., AR(0) for streamflow? That is, is there a possible way that the ""yesterday's flow"" won't explain the ""today's flow""?  "

966,What causes the earth to be a good grounding system?,"When working with electricity, rubber shoes are recommended because they prevent current from running through your body.  But I've read that usually the earth is more negative charged than positive. So how is it possible that contacting the earth is dangerous in some situations as it is also negative charged, and when you touch an electrical wire you also get a lot of negative charges (electrons). So in theory, they should repel each other, but apparently, they attract each other to cause a current in a body. How is this possible? Isn't the earth negative charged (most of the times)? "

970,Have these optical satellite ground station locations been chosen for clear skies?,"Having lived in southern California, I know that some areas on the planet can be absurdly sunny and clear throughout the year, and having lived several other places, I know some areas can be chronically overcast.  The article Laser Light to leverage free-space optics in space for Optical Satellite as a Service describes a proposed group satellites in medium Earth orbit (MEO) that would maintain high speed optical data links with a large number of Earth stations. I did some further reading, and found the map shown below. I assume this is still conceptual and the final ground station locations may be different.  But I am wondering, besides that one station in southern California, do these appear to be in meteorologically favorable locations for continuous optical data links to satellites? Are these particularly sunny/clear sky locations?  Does a map of clear-sky hours per year - independent of day or night - exist?   As pointed out in this comment and this article the network can work by reconfiguring depending on atmospheric conditions.

971,How did the continental plates came above the oceanic plates?,"The continental plates are more or less loose from the oceanic plates which are heavier and of other material (basalt) and because continental plates are lighter they 'float' on top of the oceanic plates. But how did they get there?  I don't know if I'm right that islands like Iceland is made of the oceanicp plate because it is in middle of the oceanic plates? But did all 'countries' start like that? It doesn't seem so as most countries/continents are made of lighter material. So how did that lighter material get on top of the oceanic plate?  The explanation of an other answer was: ' This is because the magma that solidifies to form each of these crusts travels, by partially melting its way up, through different materials and different thicknesses. The consequence of this is that the crust making up the continents is less dense than that making up the bottom of the oceans.'  Does this mean that the magma comming from beneath (hotspot etc.) is getting mixed with different materials? Or is this magma already a mix of different material where the heavier ones would stay more or sink at the bottom of the solidifieing two plates? But what makes the upper one not tight joined or gradually to the one beneath? "

974,How does argon-argon dating work - need a simple but not-wrong explanation,"The Washington Post article Scientists discover hundreds of footprints left at the dawn of modern humanity describes the geological dating of  stratified layers of mud by analyzing and dating minerals within each layer.     But since floods jumble materials of different origins and ages together, that meant the scientists had to date dozens of different minerals. The youngest crystal in the footprint layer would represent the oldest possible age for the prints; the oldest crystal in the layer above it would represent the youngest they could be.      Using the argon-argon dating technique, by which scientists measure the decay of an isotope called Argon-40 into Argon-39 in order to find the age of crystals, they came up with a rough approximation of the footprints' age: 19,000 years at the oldest, 10,000 or 12,000 years at the youngest.   I can't exactly follow the logic, but I'm asking here about the dating process itself. How does argon-argon dating work?  I do not think that Argon-40 decays into Argon-39 as the article states, at least not all by itself. And when I look at the Wikipedia article, the discussion is so technical and defensive that I can't actually picture what is going on.  How does argon-argon dating work? "
975,How often do king tides (perigean spring tides) occur?,"Recently, there has been a lot of information about ""King Tides"" (i.e, perigean spring tides) on the news with a number of groups relating the peak king tide to future normal conditions (2050) under sea level rise scenarios along the east coast of the United States.   The effects on the magnitude of the tides are obvious when we compare normal tides (OSU model results for a day in 2010)    with the recent tides for the entire planet (spring tides): .   While most of the difference is associated with the spring tides, about 2-3% is associated with the relative position of the Moon.   My question is related to the recurrence interval of perigean spring times. Some sources mention that they occur 3-4 times a year. If that is the case, then why such a focus on the mid-October 2016 event?   Another related question, which constituent of the tide is associated with the perigean/apogean oscillations? "
976,"If North America were in the southern hemisphere, would the mountains and high desert have to be -east- of Tornado Alley?","I've been trying to collate the reasons why Tornado Alley in North America is what it is. So far, I have the following:   The continental landmass is in the mid-latitudes (where the polar jet has the greatest amount of influence). There are no geographic barriers, like bodies of water or mountains, between the North Pole and the rest of the NA landmass. Australia, New Zealand, South Africa (and Argentina for the most part) are separated from the South Pole/Antarctica by water.There's not much in the way of cold polar air dipping down as far south as the Florida Panhandle if there's a deep enough trough in the polar jet. Sources of abundant heat and moisture at the surface. This primarily comes from the Gulf of Mexico, but there's also the Caribbean Sea, tropical Atlantic, plus the influence of the Gulf Stream and Bermuda High. Large areas devoid of rough/rugged terrain. Besides the Appalachians and the Ozarks, there isn't a lot of mountainous terrain in the middle and eastern sections of the continent. The clash between tropical and polar air can continue undisrupted. In fact, the Appalachians can have the same funneling effect to tropical air that the Rockies have, shielding the Mid-Atlantic/Delmarva region while the Mid-South (sometimes even up to the Ohio River Valley) gets raked by tornadoes. Mountains and high desert to the west. Warm, dry air coming off the High Plains in the leeward side of the Rockies and the High Plains in eastern New Mexico create westerlies at mid-levels. It acts as a lid, preventing surface moisture from rising. This is called a capping inversion, ""cap"" or elevated mixed layer. When the cap erodes, supercells can erupt. Wind shear: Cold, dry northwest winds aloft; warm, dry westerlies at mid levels; and warm, moist air at the surface. Not only is wind direction changing with height, but wind speed as well (if there's a strong flow of moisture from the southeast, a ""low level jet"", then shear is further exacerbated).   But I wonder, what if North America were in the southern hemisphere? Would the mountains and high desert have to be situated on the eastern side of the continent to compensate? The predominant airflow in the northern hemisphere is west to east, due to Coriolis forces caused by the Earth's spin. "
977,Do reverse faults tilt the underlying layers of rocks to form an angular unconformity?,"I came across this question while studying in my text book: What does the existence of strata containing a reverse fault and above them parallel strata refer to? I thought that referred to an angular unconformity, thinking that the fault should make a tilt in the layers, and that the tilts which appear in angular unconformity happen by a fault or a fold, but I found that the answer is ""disconformity"", so I became confused. Would that reverse fault present only a crack not a tilt? Or was the strata where the fault appeared was parallel so the movement didn't affect the angle of the layers? Would the tilt which appears in angular unconformities happens by other factors more than a fault and a fold?. I would like anyone to help me understand this, because I didn't get help searching in many websites but some definitions and concepts which made me more perplexed. "
978,Why don't weather forecast models normally take solar eclipses into account?,"Since there is a total solar eclipse somewhere almost every year, I would have thought it would be included as a standard option in weather forecast models.  However, I've learned that is not really the case.    The moon does not normally affect weather, but during a solar eclipse, there is reduced solar radiation reaching the surface of the Earth.  This causes cooler temperatures and changes in wind speed/direction than would not otherwise be predicted.   The NOAA ESRL HRRR took the solar eclipse of August 21, 2017 into account when doing the weather forecast and found cooling of up to 6 degrees Celsius in some places.  Do any other weather forecast models take solar eclipses into account?  Or, is this the first time?  Why don't weather forecast models normally take solar eclipses into account?   "
979,Are there probably decent oil fields located in the middle of the ocean?,"I did a google image search for a world map of offshore oil. Surprisingly I found virtually nothing. I had to search country by country for such maps.  I noticed most if not all were located very near the country's shore, on the continental shelf. These are fairly shallow seafloors, not even going below 1 km deep.  I guess this is because, it's easiest to explore (and drill) in the shallow regions first. But what I want to know, is there good reason to believe the very deep ocean also has oilfields.  So here is my question: Given our current understanding of geological history, is it likely that the oceans have decent oilfields located underneath the very deep seafloor?  ""Decent oilfield"" would be something like 10+ million barrels of oil without more sulfur than a Heavy Grade of Crude.  We have good bathymetric data of most oceanfloor, e.g., the underwater mountain-range in the mid-Atlantic, and the superdeep trenches following the Mariana Islands. I'm hoping that just by looking at the shape, we can make a good prediction where oil is located.  My only hint is a few very deep regions in the Gulf of Mexico, like this field that's 2.7 km below the sea. I am not aware of any other deep offshore platforms. I noticed the Gulf of Mexico has a fairly...what's the word here...bubbly shape in the deep parts. "
980,How can a storm drop 40 inches (1 metre) of rain?,"Hurricane Harvey dumped more that 20 inches (500 mm) of rain over a large region, with 40+ (>1000 mm) in some spots... and much more expected.  How is that possible?  Does the atmosphere really hold that much water?  Or is it getting repeatedly evaporated from the ocean and dropped onto the land by the circular winds, implying an enormous evaporation rate while over water? "
981,Difference between NCEP's 20th Century daily Forecast and Analysis variables,"NCEP's Twentieth Century Reanalysis (V2) provides daily variables from 1871/01/01 to 2012/12/31. Monolayer analysis variables are made available in a regular grid and forecast variables in a gaussian grid. This distinction is made very clear in their list on their webpage, although I think the grid is not the main problem here, but the terms in bold.  Daily precipitation rate, for example, is a forecast variable. This makes you think weather you may use forecast and analysis interchangeably. What are the main differences? Any pros or cons? Are all of these still considered reanalysis? Any assumputions I need to make?  This question came up as a consequence of the discussion held here.  Thank you in advance. "
982,"Why do human populations concentrate near fault lines, volcanoes, etc.?","I've noticed that many places with large populations tend to be prime zones for natural disaster.  Examples: Silicon Valley = earthquakes, Houston = hurricanes and floods, Japan = tsunamis and earthquakes, Santa Maria = volcano, Vesuvius = volcano, etc.  This doesn't seem like a coincidence, especially given that people would naturally want to stay away from disaster-prone sites. Clearly there must be a benefit to living in such places.  My guess has always been that it probably goes something like this:     Active fault zone → mountains &amp; volcanoes → rain &amp; water → fertile soil &amp; wildlife → food   Or maybe like this:     Storms/monsoons → rain &amp; water → fertile soil &amp; wildlife → food   But I really have no idea, and this has been a question I've had for a long time.  Is this accurate? Is there more than meets the eye? Is it maybe partly a coincidence? Explanations would be greatly appreciated, since all I have right now is just a guess. "
983,Interpolation and extrapolation of unstructured data in python: memory error,"I have 3 arrays, for longitude, latitude and temperature (so the observations are scattered in space). I want to apply interpolation on these data, but also extrapolation. I 've written the code beow, but I get an error about memory. Each of the three arrays has about 700 points.  The reason that I want to extrapolate is because i want to cover all of the region of the map.  This is the part of my code, which is about what I described:  m = Basemap(projection='merc',llcrnrlat=34,urcrnrlat=42,\         llcrnrlon=19,urcrnrlon=35,lat_ts=20,resolution='h')  xi = np.arange(19,35,0.01)  yi = np.arange(34,42,0.01)  xi,yi = np.meshgrid(xi,yi)  lon = np.asarray(lon)  lat = np.asarray(lat)  temperature = np.asarray(temperature)  rbf = scipy.interpolate.Rbf(lon, lat, temperature, function='gaussian', smooth=0.)  zi = rbf(xi, yi)  x,y = m(xi, yi)  zi=np.array(zi)  mdata=maskoceans(xi,yi,zi,resolution='f',grid=1.25)  m.drawcoastlines()  m.drawcountries()  m.drawmapboundary(fill_color=""#cce6ff"")  sc = m.contourf(x,y,mdata, np.arange(-15.0,40.01,1),cmap=jet,extend=""both"")   Does anyone have any ideas about the interpolation methods that I should use and how I could make it work?  I've already used griddata, which works fine, but it is just for interpolation, so the new matrix is limited and it doesn't cover the whole area. I've also read that rbf doesn't work for more than 20 points, but is there any other method for large datasets? "
984,Are there ways stormwater attenuation can be quantified for comparison between different systems or conditions?,"Various sources agree land cover changes impact the attenuation of stormwater. E.g. forest areas generally slow the rainfall-runoff response and moderate it, reducing peaks in hydrographs, as compared to urban areas.   Is there a way stormwater attenuation can be quantified, by field measurements (eg. observed streamflow) or model outputs? If so, what are some examples of how this can be done? The reason to quantify attenuation would be to compare differences in attenuation between different basins or between different conditions within a basin. "
985,Will global warming lead to agriculture in the Arctic?,"From what I understand, global warming will make growing food a lot harder in areas like the American Midwest because temperatures will become too high for most crops. At the same time, Arctic (and Antarctic) regions will heat up and permafrost will melt. Would areas like Alaska, Siberia, and northern Canada then become suitable for large-scale agriculture? And if so, would this be enough to make up for the lost production in warmer areas? Or are there other factors in those areas that would make farming impractical? "
986,"Was climate change inevitable anyway, or is there more to it?","Climate change is now one of the greatest challenges facing humanity, but it seems that we have been here before; if we look at the world's climate over a much longer period than 150 years.   During the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum which occurred 50m years ago, the poles were ice-free tropical regions, with very high carbon levels, and temperature increases of as much as 5 degrees.  I am just wondering if what we are currently seeing was going to happen anyway? Has the discovery of oil, and the resultant human activity just accelerated an already inevitable outcome? "

989,Does crustal thickness have anything to do with how life existed and sustained on Earth?,"The original question that was put on hold ""If the crust were the thickest layer of Earth, what effect would its thickness have on organisms?""  was actually one of those 'counterfactual question' found on my science book, and it was really just a 'reflect upon' question. And it's actually a hard one for me to answer since it's 'what if?'s. So by revising, it would still confuse some poeple, but I guess it's already specific on its own. But I still find it hard.  Follow up question:  And what if it ever was thicker than the mantle or the rest of Earth's layers, can the planet still sustain biological life? "
990,Is moonlight a significant condition for making life possible on earth?,"We know of course that light from the sun is a fundamental component to making life possible on earth because of the energy it provides. Does the light that is reflected off of the moon make a significant impact on the earth as well?   For example - at night, would it be at lot colder on earth without moonlight? And would it basically be pitch-dark on earth without moonlight? Or do stars and other astronomical entities provide a significant amount of light compared to the moon?  "

I am wondering: Would this hypothesis have any practical use? Does it make any predictions? Or alternatively: How could it be falsified?  While the Wikipedia article lists a few detailed examples for homeostatic mechanisms, these do not seem to have been predicted, but interpreted a posteriori (I may be wrong about this though). Criticisms of the hypothesis being a metaphor are referenced, but the word falsify does not appear in the article. "

996,Why do rivers sometimes travel down the opposite side of the mountains from where the rain happens?,"My teacher explained that when wind coming from the ocean gets blocked by a mountain it makes rain on one side of the mountain, like in the image below. This rain leads to the creation of rivers.   (found on Google Images to be on numerous websites, difficult to determine original source)  My question is: Why is it that rivers sometimes run from the other side of the mountain inland instead of being on the same side of the mountain where the greater rain happens, traveling back to the sea?  One example of this is when monsoon winds coming from the Arabian Sea hit the Indian Western Ghats, it makes rivers which travel to the east instead of traveling to the west. "

There are a number of explanations online (Wikipedia lists eight plausible causes!)

They develop on a wide range of rock types, from granite to sandstone to tuffs and conglomerates, and in many situations where they'd be expected to develop they don't.  From what I can tell, they seem somewhat mysterious, and there are explanations that make sense in some cases but not every case of tafoni is well explained.

1003,Is there a place where the sea floor descends into the mantle of the earth?,"My understanding of plate tectonics is that in the middle of the oceans magma rises from the mantle of the earth, cools and then spreads out, building up the sea floor. These places are pretty obvious because they have lava coming out of them.  On the other hand, there are places that sink into the earth, subduction zones, where the reverse happens; the existing crust slides into the mantle. Is there any place where this is visible, like the lava, or does it only take place invisibly far below the surface?  For example, let's say I have an object, like a shipwreck hulk. If I put the hulk on the sea floor in a subduction zone will it get sucked into the earth and vanish? If so, how long would it take for it to disappear? "

If so, is this because the island was formed recently and is still too hot for a coral reef to flourish? "
1006,Why can't we dig deeper?,"I recently read on another SE site that there's a limitation on how deep we can dig into the earth.  A Google search reveals that temperature is the problem.  I quote from a Popular Mechanics article which speaks on the Kola Superdeep Borehole     The limiting factor is almost always the temperature. The Kola was abandoned in 1992 when workers hit 356 degrees Fahrenheit, far hotter than they had anticipated. The tunnel was eventually closed off in the early 2000's.   356[tex]F is 180[tex]C, for those of you who don't get Fahrenheit, like me.  Iron's melting point is well above 1000[tex]C, and I think it is okay to assume most of our machines have iron as a major constituent. Alloys with iron will only have higher melting points.  Why is 180[tex]C a problem? Why can't we dig deeper? "
1007,What could cause a turn from global warming to global cooling?,"Except a hypothesized orbital forcing! Ice cores shows that there are several irregular sharp temperature peaks in between of the big 100,000 years glaciations. What could cause those peaks?   Almost all energy excess is stored in the oceans and common sense says that there have to be a threshold for how much energy the oceans can take up without drastically changing the climate. There are two possibilities: either there is a turn to cooling down the oceans or there isn't.  Could the energy from the oceans take over the climate system totally for a time long enough to be cooled down? Could the energy from the oceans, if big enough cause global storms independent of the insolation? Convective clouds transport warm vapor high up in troposphere where condensation release an enormous amount of energy - mostly as heat energy that spreads from there. Could a global cover of convective clouds be maintained entirely by the ocean heat content, if big enough?     In the diagram, there is a well defined peek about 50,000 years ago, for example. Sudden up and sudden down. Increased insolation (or something else) caused a sudden warming, that ""immediately"" turned back. Could it have been caused by a long time of storms and convection? "

1013,Yearly changes of solar irradiation and atmospheric feedback,"I think I understand the mechanism of water vapor feedback in climate change pretty well: a (theoretical) temperature increase due to some isolated factor (e.g. increase in [tex] concentration) causes a shift in water vapor saturation density and an additional evaporation rate. The consequential shift in actual water vapor concentration causes additional absorption together with isotropic re-emission, slowing down the radiation transport. So the theoretical temperature rise [tex] without consideration of feedback is ""amplified"" by some factor [tex], giving the real temperature rise, with feedback  [tex]  Of course I know that this argument has to be replaced by solving a differential equation in a more rigorous treatment. There is no ""before"" and ""after"", there is only the combined effect.  But what if we consider the ""theoretical"" temperature change due to the change in solar irradiation from orbital eccentricity? Shouldn't this be amplified by the same water vapor feedback mechanism as well?  Solar irradiation varies over the year between [tex] [tex] and [tex] [tex]. According to Stefan-Boltzmann's Law in differential form we would have a heating of the ground by direct absorption of sunlight   [tex]  or  [tex]  So I would expect the temperature change due to yearly changes in solar irradiation (but without the effect of water vapor feedback) to be about  [tex]  The favorite answer to this question shows a plot that seems to indicate that the order of magnitude is indeed like that, the global line shows a variation of about [tex] [tex]. I don't know if this was derived from measurements, but I assume that it is somehow substantiated.  But if we now adopt the assumption that these ~5 Kelvin get amplified by the water vapor feedback as well, and take into account that this amplification is said to be in the order of magnitude ~2 in the context of [tex] entry by mankind, I would expect the amplified yearly temperature change due to the orbital eccentricity of earth to be [tex] [tex].  Is the linked answer wrong, or is there some flaw in the argument? "
1014,Is the magma in one volcano different from the magma in every other volcano?,"First off, a confession:  I'm asking this question because of The Lord of the Rings.  If you're not aware already, in the story, a magical ring can only be destroyed in a specific volcano.  The reason for this is presumably ""because magic"".    But the issue got me wondering if this volcano is any different from every other volcano on the planet.  Is there a significant difference between the magma in different volcanoes?  If so, why?  Doesn't all magma come from the same place if you go down deep enough? "
1015,"Could the Dead Sea dry up? and if so, when?","According to recent findings, during the last interglacial period, about 120,000 years ago, the precursor of the Dead Sea (Lake Lisan) dried up perhaps entirely. Today, the Dead Sea level is dropping at rates of around >1m/year from the countries surrounding the Sea using all the runoff. Future climate change scenarios for the region suggest even more arid conditions. Even though previous studies suggested that the decrease in water level would stabilize around 100-150 m below current conditions, the Goldstein et al. (2011) core evidence might suggest otherwise.  Could the Dead Sea dry up? What conditions could lead to such an extreme? When would that occur? "
1016,Can rocks have pressure signatures?,"Since rocks can have magnetic signatures, as is the case with paleomagnetism, can they store past pressures also?   For example, when researchers are trying to determine past ocean levels, they usually look at isotopes. But is there any way they can look at rock morphology to see how high sea levels may have been (maybe a more compressed rock meant higher pressures, meaning higher sea levels and vice versa)? "
1017,Are there sufficient quantities of limestone to dump in the ocean to reverse acidification?,"This question asked: What is the evidence it is feasible to reverse ocean acidification by adding large quantities of a base (bicarb soda)?  The result was:      Danny Harvey of the University of Toronto has already looked into this. His solution is to deposit 4 Gt/a of limestone into the oceans. To put this in perspective, global coal production in 2013 was nearly double this at 7.823 Gt and it is more than global iron ore production in 2014 of 3.22 Gt.   The respondent then posed the question: Are there sufficient quantities of easily obtainable limestone to do this?  My question is: Are there sufficient quantities of limestone to dump in the ocean to reverse acidification? "

1019,How much reduction of insolation (solar energy) would be required to stop global warming?,"Suppose a giant sheet of semi-reflective mylar (or some other kind of partial sun-screening material) was temporarily placed into space between the Earth and the Sun with the intent to lower the amount of solar energy reaching the surface of the planet.   How much solar radiation (and in what frequency ranges) would need to be filtered to cool the planet to the most-desirable global temperature? Also, would the entire planet need to be shaded or just a key area like the Equatorial region?   Obviously the plan would be to reduce the warming effect without dramatically darkening the day since so many plants require the visible spectrum of sunlight to live. "

1021,Why are impact craters radially symmetric?,"Okay, so I believe that most of the impact/collisions happen at oblique angles to the planet's radial direction. (I am not very sure about this, but since it is not a freefall, we can assume that the collision is oblique).  So why are most of the craters radially symmetric?   Why isn't the depression skewed?  I have almost never come across a photograph of a skewed crater. "

1023,What causes clouds to appear blue?,"In a thunderstorm cloud about sunset time, I saw these clouds, including some (in the upper right) that were a unique shade of blue.  I don't think I've seen clouds quite that color before.  I tried to capture the color as best I could with a digital camera, though the blue is slightly washed out in the image.  I took these images facing East at sunset time, during summer.    Optically zooming in on the blue cloud:   This answer suggests that the sunlight should be missing those wavelengths (""at sunset, when only the red/yellow end of the spectrum hits"") which is consistent with the brilliant warm colors to the left.  But...the cloud was a strong and unique shade of blue, different from the blue behind it.  How does this happen?  That is, what natural processes underly the occurrence?  (Although that question is on Physics.SE, there seem to be more questions about cloud appearances on this site.)   "
1024,What would the climate be like on an Earth-like planet if it had only one convection cell per hemisphere?,"Earth has three convection cells per hemisphere. These are the Polar cell, Ferrel cell and Hadley cell. These create the trade winds, westerlies and polar easterlies which control many aspects of climate, such as where rain shadows &amp; dry zones are located and where ocean currents flow.    However, if you were to slow down the rotation rate of a planet, you could turn those three convection cells into a single, gigantic convection cell. Assume a roughly Earth-like planet in all characteristics (sans rotation rate, which is slowed down in order to turn the three convection cells into one - and apparently axial tilt might have an effect, I'm not sure). Because climate is a combination of multiple factors, there are several questions to consider:   How would the movement of oceanic currents be affected? In what direction would the wind blow at different latitudes of the planet's surface? Where would the dry zones of the planet be? The wet zones? Where would the hot zones of the planet be? The cold zones?   Bonus:   How would this affect violent weather phenomena such as hurricanes and tornadoes?  "
1025,"Why do maps of melanoma prevalence correlate negatively with UV index, negatively with ground ozone, and positively with atmospheric ozone levels?","What is the causal link behind the correlation of melanoma: negatively with UV index, negatively with ozone in the lower atmosphere, and positively with ozone in the upper atmosphere? Intuitively, melanoma would positively correlate with UV index, and negatively with upper atmospheric ozone.   Increased melanoma risk with higher latitude seems to be true on a global scale as well as locally in the US, but is reversed locally in the UK and Australia where melanoma rate negatively correlates with latitude. Could high population density and high ozone in the lower atmosphere be affecting a lower risk of melanoma?   It appears melanoma rates do not always negatively correlate with ozone in the upper atmosphere, and positively with high UV index. It does appear that melanoma sometimes negatively correlates with population density and ozone in the lower atmosphere (caused by pollution in heavily populated areas).   In this study, Chinese individuals living in the US have a higher risk of melanoma than those in China. The map of the United States with the highest rates of skin cancer (below in blue) appears to strongly correlate with a map of ozone in the lower atmosphere (below in orange).   Positively correlating latitude with rate of melanoma (higher towards the poles)   US map from CDC in cases per 100,000  World map from Nature    Negatively correlating latitude and population density with rate of melanoma  UK   UK melanoma rate map from BBC  UK population density map.

1026,Red volcanic soils - what are the likely constituents?,"I live very near an extinct Andesite volcano and hiking in that area I've noticed bands of soil that have a dark red coloration. I've also been in Kauai, one of the volcanic islands of Hawaii, but those soils appear to be a lighter, almost orange color which I've heard is attributed to iron content.  So for the soil in my local neighborhood, what is the likely constituent that gives it the dark red color? Is there a simple chemical test I can use to confirm it's iron? "

It was so weird, everything looked like it was tinted. It was almost like it looked iridescent or something?  What could it be? Could someone explain? "
1029,What would change if our earth lacks mountains?,"I just asked myself what is the role of the mountains on our planet earth? Well there's a well known role for the climate and weather.  But is there a kind of physical or geological role? What would happen if our earth lacks the mountains on it? Will we have more earth ""Movements"" (earthquakes, tectonics...) i suppose erosion will be much heavier then it is now. And therefore i suppose that human life in such a planet would be impossible.  In the Answers i would like to consider two scenarios:   Earth as we know but without mountains (mountains have never been formed or don't exist at all) What will happen if the Mountains would just been taken away?   Well i would like to get some kind of scientific answer from a geological point of view! "

1035,"In what sense did the Oklo reactor ""trap"" its own nuclear waste?","A number of popular writings on the natural fission reactor at Oklo, Gabon (e.g. here) state that some of the energetic byproducts (krypton and xenon, presumably 85Kr and 133Xe) of the reactor were ""trapped"" in aluminophosphate.   How, exactly, does ""aluminophosphate"" (I assume this is some sort of framework mineral?) trap gaseous elements? Is it related to the mechanism by which clathrates trap gases?  "
1036,"Is it true that ""[sand] grains in the Coconino Sandstone come from the Appalachian Mountains""?","The Creation Museum is a terrifying place for scientists of all stripes. One of their exhibits is the ""Flood Geology"" exhibit, which purports to explain how a flood of (literally) Biblical proportions circa 6000 years ago explains all the features of the Earth we see today. One panel at that exhibit is titled ""Evidences of the Flood in the Grand Canyon"":   (photo taken by John Scalzi; click for larger, more-readable version - if you think you can handle it)  This is obviously boneheaded in so, so many ways, but anyway - this panel makes the following claim:     Sand grains in the Coconino Sandstone come from the Appalachian Mountains.   Three related questions:   Is this claim true? (The Creation Museum is not beyond telling outright lies, so I have to ask...) If so, how did it get there? How do we determine that a particular grain of sand originates in the Appalachians?   "
1037,How does radiogenic argon-40 get into the atmosphere?,"There's an awful lot of argon in the atmosphere: about 0.93% of the atmosphere is argon[1], making it the third-most abundant gas after N2 and O2. As I understand it, most of it is produced by the following decay path:   $$ \ce{^{40}_{19}K + ^{0}_{-1}e- -&gt; ^{40}_{18}Ar + \gamma{} + \nu_{e}} %edit $$  How does all this radiogenic argon make it into the atmosphere, though? Most of the decaying potassium-40 must surely be at some depth beneath the surface, thus trapping the argon-40 in the interior of the Earth, right? "
1038,What is the range of possible atmospheric pressures on the surface of the Earth?,"I'm developing an Android app which uses a pressure sensor. Due to storage limitations I have to normalize and scale the atmospheric pressure values. For this I need to know the extreme values of pressure.  Different conditions should be respected, e.g.   Weather conditions (low/high) Locations (high mountains, deep valleys like Dead Sea with a surface elevation of: -427 m (−1,401 ft))   If this is unknown, does anybody know the range at sea level? Something like 1013 hPa ± X?  With a formula I've found I calculated that the pressure on Mount Everest should be something like 300 hPa and at Dead Sea about 53 hPa more than at sea level. But this is not a very complex formula, so these values might be theoretical and wrong.  Edit / additional info  I discovered that my sensor provides values like 980.01 hPa, so there are 2 digits precision (don't know whether this reflects sensor precision). A difference of 0.01 hPa means ~8cm altitude. This might sound little, but I need to calculate the current incline of athletes, so I cannot sacrifice precision. My current scaling algorithm produces normalized numbers from 0 to 32768. It would imply much work to change the output range. "
1039,How do meteorologists grade their past forecasts?,"In every professional field, practitioners may come home at the end of the day and say ""Yeah! I knocked it out of the park!"", or alternatively ""Oh, man. Gotta do better tomorrow."" What about meteorologists?  When a meteorologist makes a weather forecast, she will strive to ""get it right"", so that when the date in question arrives her prediction will have matched the actual temperature, dew point, wind velocity and direction, precipitation, etc. But, when that date arrives, and the actual conditions have been measured and compared to the prediction, how is the prediction graded?  Precipitation seems to be the most problematic aspect, as it's quite nonlinear and predicted statistically. What does it mean to have ""gotten it right"" by predicting a 30% chance of precipitation? Yes, it rained 30% of the time? Yes, it rained in 30% of the forecast area? Yes, 30% of the public will answer ""Yes"" if asked whether it rained?  There's complexity in the other metrics as well. For instance, how are errors in the different values compared? Would it be better to get the temperature spot on but the wind velocity 5MPH high, or the wind exactly right but the temperature 5&deg;F high? What about timing: what if that front came through two hours after it was predicted?  Edit: part of the difficulty is getting clarity about the consumer of the weather information. Fred the Farmer wants to know how much rain he can expect in next day or so, but the exact timing probably isn't important. Pete the Party Planner wants to herd his guests into the bar before the front comes through, but if it's going to rain he probably doesn't care whether it drops a quarter inch or a half. And Francine the Fisherman doesn't really care about the precipitation at all (within limits); her world centers around wind and waves.  I may want to post a second question that is explicitly from the consumer viewpoint: given weather data and meteorologists' historical forecasts, how would I choose a meteorologist? "

1043,Is Mars' mantle homogeneous or heterogeneous and what might this say about mantle convection?,"A supervisor of mine made an off-hand comment about the fact that Mars used to have plate tectonics, and there is evidence that Mars used to have plate tectonics, however now it does not. The theory that she mentioned was that Mars is either heterogenoeous or homogeneous, however I have forgotten which one she said! Now I can't find anything online which says which one it is! Can anyone help me out here?  Also, the follow on from this was that this led to the ceasing of mantle convection which ended the possibilities of plate tectonics? Could somebody more knowledgable than I perhaps outline a theory of why this is?   In addition if mantle convection has ceased, than when do we think it stopped being active?  "
1044,Life on Earth previous to us,"I've seen in several places that there seems to be an extinction cycle on Earth of approximately 27 million years. I've read this here:  [website]And also saw a similar explanation on Cosmos last week. Since the Earth is about 4.54 billion years old, that means there have been around 168 different extinction cycles. From what I understand, the Earth will either heat or freeze at extreme temperatures and then either cool or warm until water and life is a possibility again.  Given that this is correct (and definitely correct if I'm wrong, I'm eager to learn!), what are the chances there was a full civilization like ours that got completely wiped out in a different extinction cycle than ours? Is it possible or are there other factors in the history of our planet that would have prevented life from flourishing to the point that we are in now? I do understand that the factors of creating humans exactly like us are pretty drastically low but I suppose I'm referring to 'civilization' as intelligent life.  And a second part to the question, I know there are fossil records in the different layers of sedimentary rock but would there ever have possibly been an extinction event that ruined the Earth so drastically that it destroyed fossils and rocks (i.e. records of the past)? I've read that the oldest fossil found was 3.5 billion years old but it's not conclusive. Do we have a vast record of fossils and life that is billions of years old? "

1047,"How do climatologists define the ""start"" of a rainy season in a unimodal monsoonal climate?","For a number of gridcells, all between the 500mm and 800mm rainfall isohyets in sub-Saharan Africa, I've got dekadal rainfall (from FEWS).  They are pretty spread out over the continent and there are a lot of them, so they'll have different seasonality, though they should all be roughly unimodal (particularly given the latitudes that I've got).    I want to define an algorithm to define the average start and end of the rainy season.  So far, I'm thinking of the following:  For each gridcell:   Define the month of average maximum rainfall Find the month prior to the average maximum rainfall month that minimizes the sum of 3 lags of average monthly rainfall, subject to that month containing at least 20% of annual rainfall.  Define it as the average start. Find the month after the average maximum rainfall month that does the same thing, only with 3 forward lags of average monthly rainfall.  Define that month as the end of the rainy season.   The 20% figure seems arbitrary, though I'm not sure what else to do.  I'm not really a climate scientist, though maybe I could play one on television.  Is there an accepted convention here?  If not, any suggestions on improving my algorithm?  "

A few related questions:   Who came up with it? If it was, in fact, someone named Taylor (which it need not be), which Taylor? Is there a paper/talk/etc that contains a definitive form of Taylor's axiom?  I think we can all agree that testable models are the best ones. Why, then, did Taylor's axiom even need to be stated? e.g. was there a time when when untestable theories of lunar formation were in vogue or something?  "
1049,What is the steepest surface that can hold snow?,"I know it depends on the type of snow (dry or wet) and the rougness of the surface. I'm looking for an approximate rule of thumb answer. Assuming a reasonably smooth surface, at what angle it's likely to be free from snow?  Google results only discuss snow and slopes in context of skiing and roofs not caving in. Obviously, a snow safe roof (60+ degrees) will still accumulate a few inches of snow.  For example, imagine a sandwitch board sign. What's the minimum ""uprightness"" for it to not get obscured by snow and stay readable throughout the year? "

1057,Why are pole reversals not more detrimental to life?,"This question is linked to the following question, and has two parts.   Mars interdicts approximately 40% of the radiation (per square meter) of the sun that Earth does. It has been claimed that Mars is unsustainable to human life, in part due to the particle radiation from the solar wind, such that a four year round trip to Mars is likely to cause cancer and/or permanent damage to the genome etc.  Why does a pole reversal, which typically takes 1000 years, not have a period of radiation that is intolerable to life?  Not only do migratory birds require the magnetic pole for direction, certain bacteria/algae do to rise and fall in the oceans correctly.  If the pole reversal is not very quick, why do bird migrations not go askew in major numbers. (P.S. I am a little skeptical of the learned landscape proposal found in the linked question - is there evidence for a similar lateral paths taken by birds, year on year, to prove they are recognizing landscapes? Landscapes and features change very quickly over distance. And if so, does the magnetic direction sense really help the migration? Also, when it does reverse, if magnetic field is a key component to knowing direction, then won't that tend to drive them in the opposite direction, so even a quick final phase of a reversal may result in a large number of missing birds.)  Also, why doesn't the food chain collapse when microbial creatures start to dive deeper when they used to head to the surface as a result of their magnetic compass?  "
1058,Could further oil drilling remove an insulation layer of the Earth cores heat?,"Putting aside burning fossil fuels, what are the consequences of another 100 years of drilling deeper and deeper to extract oil reserves globally?

1060,"Hourly solar radiation estimates on a horizontal plane, preferably in R","I'm looking to estimate the temperature at the end of a river reach of a few miles in length based on known (measured) temperature at the start of the reach plus weather information: historical data for model fitting and forecast data for forecasting.  I'd like this on a sub-day temporal timescale--let's say hourly.   From what I read, I presume that solar radiation is a key factor in determining the change in temperature from the start to the end of the reach, so I'm looking for ways to estimate the hourly solar radiation.  Then I can try a regression model of end-of-reach temperature vs. start-of-reach temperature and solar radiation.  I tend to work in R, so solutions that come as part of an R package would be nice, solutions easy to implement in R would probably be okay.  The R packages solaR and insol seem like potential candidates, but neither strike me as obvious choices yet.  I also found the 2005 ""Estimating hourly incoming solar radiation from limited meteorological data"" by spokas et al.

I haven't gotten any answer, but there was some discussion about the reality of the measurement.   So I'll ask here, is a sustained rainfall with a pH of roughy 3.1 possible on Earth? Of course it would have to be related to some serious sources of pollution - perhaps intensive coal burning over a large geographic region. I say 'sustained' to rule out any fluke or highly unusual situations. Could I really fill a plastic bucket with a substantial amount of pH 3.1 water by putting it outdoors, under the sky, in the rain, in the right place on Earth?  Oh, for this question I'd like to exclude unusual situations related to volcanic eruptions as well.  "
1065,North Bay of Bengal warm pool anomaly,I am looking for an explanation for this warm pool of water in the North and North East Bay of Bengal - North Bay Warm Water Anomaly. Currently the path of the sun is towards the southern hemisphere and we are in the fourth week of October. In contrast there are no warm SSTs along the North Arabian Sea.   Is it possible that warm water from the equator has moved up North along the eastern wall of the Bay of Bengal ? Is that indicated by the gyres on display on the Earth Null site ? I observe that there is a warm pool along the eastern seaboard near the equator(negative Indian Ocean Dipole) - IOD Index. Is it possible to show (if my guess is correct) that there is a south to north pressure gradient that is moving warm water north(ageostrophic circulation)  ?      As you can see the weekly SST global anomaly as well shows a warm pool anomaly in the North Bay of Bengal.

I'm actually currently working towards a high school biology degree but when I'm done with that I will continue with an earth science degree until I can teach college. Not just a dream, I WILL make it happen.   Anyway, I was wondering what sorts of tricks I can do right now to play with geology until I actually can get into the field.

I have the gusto, I literally just launched some R-candy rockets using a mix of 63% KNO3, 32% sucrose, 4% aluminium and 1% iron sulfate.   Also, is there any self employment for amateur geologist? Like if I figure out how to analyze my own yard, can I then do the same for others for a small fee? (I'm a substitute teacher now so I'm always broke).  What cool things can be done by an amateur geologist with no prior geological schooling (and very limited funding) but with a strong drive to understand the world we live in?   PS. I built a primitive forge from homemade clay bricks that I use to melt aluminum from scrap into art so is there any uses for that in amateur geology? "

What do you guys think? Will we see vertical farming taking over the agricultural industry? 
1071,Milankovitch cycles and what?,"Observe the vertical green lines in this diagram:  Those events shows when temperature starts to sink when radiance is at top or even before that. If there was a simple connection between radiance and temperature the temperature should start to sink after radiance maximum.     What climatic mechanisms could start a global cooling when the   radiance is maximal or heading to maximal, due to the Milankovitch   cycles? Could it be a drastic increase of convection?

1073,"If the sun disappeared, how long would it take for the earth to freeze beyond excavatable depths?",If the sun disappeared   How long would it take for the earth to freeze beyond excavatable depths? How long until it freezes to the core? (is this different than without removing the sun?) Would we be able to live for a while by relocating downwards?   If so around what portion of the population and for how long? Could we find a way to keep some oxygen with us or to extract what would turn liquid/solid on the surface?  Would the molten/ductile rock expand or contract?

1075,Effective Temperature of a Planet and Surface Temperature due to Greenhouse Effect,"There is something I don't quite understand about the Greenhouse Effect and Effective Temperature, so please bear with me as I lay out what I do understand and where I begin to stumble.  The effective temperature of the Earth is roughly 12 degree Fahrenheit, which means that in thermal equilibrium when it is emitting as much radiation as it is absorbing, the distribution of wavelengths and intensities of electromagnetic radiation an observer in outer space would measure would correspond to the temperature of a blackbody object at 12 degrees Fahrenheit.   Of course, the surface of the Earth is actually much warmer than 12 degrees Fahrenheit due to the Greenhouse Effect. If there are greenhouse gases in an atmosphere then some fraction of infrared radiation from the terrestrial surface is absorbed by the atmosphere and re-emitted toward the ground. This re-emission of infrared radiation to the ground is like a trap for energy and over time it will cause the surface temperature of the planet to rise. This is right about where I have actual questions:  If the terrestrial surface is warming it will have to emit even more infrared radiation back to space. Is the atmosphere (and greenhouse gases) now absorbing the same fraction of a now larger amount of infrared radiation? in order to eventually rebalance incoming and outgoing radiation? I was thinking that the surface will grow warmer and emit more radiation until the amount exiting equals the amount incoming, establishing the new thermal equilibrium.   I often get confused because most diagrams for the Earth energy budget and net radiation balance show more infrared leaving the surface than is ever supplied by solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere in the first place. Is this because they count percentages or units of radiation twice? because some is re-emitted back?  I have included a photo showing how the electromagnetic wave types are partitioned in the radiation balance. It is from NASA's CERES page. As you can see, more infrared is leaving Earth than enters as solar radiation and yet this is still a picture of equilibrium where the net radiation is zero.    "
1076,Why does Hong Kong have one of the best natural harbours in the world that can protect ships from the typhoon winds?,"My question in this post's title is predicated on Reddit -     Hong Kong was perfect for the British as a staging point from which to trade with China. This was because Hong Kong has one of the best natural harbours in the world which was capable of protecting ships from the typhoon winds. Also due to the British superiority in naval warfare Hong Kong could be easily defended from attacks. The taking of Hong Kong was primarily to establish a base from which Western (not just British) traders were able to sell opium to the Chinese without the Chinese being in a position to stop them. As far as I am aware there was never a desire to invade China, just trade for its silk, teas and manufactured goods.   I've riffled through some satellite views of HK, but I can't espy   which harbour is the one? Victoria Harbour? what makes HK so ""capable of protecting ships from the typhoon winds""?    The picture beneath ""was compiled from data acquired by Landsat 8 satellite in 2015.""   "
1077,Could the Grand Canyon be flooded by the ocean if it got deep enough?,"The Colorado River has been carving the Grand Canyon for a few million years now, such that the canyon floor is around 6000 feet lower in elevation than the surrounding area, at about 2400 feet above sea level. If things continue as they have, the Colorado River will continue to make the canyon deeper. If the river eroded away enough rock so that the river's bottom got to sea level, and this process continued to go upstream the river from where it empties into the Pacific Ocean so that the floor of the canyon eventually eroded below sea level, would the canyon gradually be filled in by the ocean? Would this even be possible? If not, why don't we see the mouth of the Colorado (or any river for that matter) gradually  move upstream, with ocean filling in where the river once was?  "
1078,Can we predict the rising temperature of Earth?,Where can I find a model of Earth's past climates and future projections from combined possibilities like magnetic pole movement and other forms of global warming as a map? Without a reference it has been said that enough heat could trigger a mini ice age.  At what temperature change would people have to migrate towards or away from the equator?  What happens when the North and South poles flip? 
1079,The seriousness of global warming/ climate change?,"Why is such an emphasis placed on sea level rise?? As this can be devastating in itself, it can be looked at as a great economic opportunity to put people to work preparing our coastal areas for the inevitable, but slowly progressing future situation.  Isn't the disruption of ocean currents (as portrayed in ""Day After Tomorrow"" or in Peter Ward's Medea hypothesis (hydrogen sulfide poisoning)) even more serious?  There are also major consequences such as fresh water shortage, ocean acidification, decrease in biodiversity, etc. etc. Some of the worst consequences may be ones we haven't even thought of yet.  I feel that we are oversimplifying the message to the public by focusing on sea level rise. Am I wrong?? "
1080,How and when was the $\mathsf{CO_2}$ scrubbed when Earth was still primordial?,How and when was the [tex] removed in primordial Earth atmosphere? What is the main mechanism of this removal of [tex]? Is it dissolving in water? Or rock weathering? Or was the bulk of [tex] actually removed by early life? 
1081,Calculate GWP over arbitrary time,"The GWP (Global warming potential) is calculated over a given time scale [tex] (20 or 100 years usually), defined as the ratio between the energy absorbed by a pulse of 1Kg of gas during time [tex] compared to the energy absorbed by a pulse of 1Kg of CO2 during the same time.  The AR4 IPCC report gives a table of the GWP[tex] and GWP[tex] of most greenhouse gases. How can someone calculate the GWP of a given gas (say methane for instance) over another period of time GWP[tex] ?  I understand from the AR4 that the calculations of GWP depend on several assumptions (among which how the carbon cycle is calculated and predictions in emissions to a lesser extent, due to the nonlinear increase of radiative forcing of CO2/methane with concentration). So let's put that problem aside and just focus on one scenario (the IPCC's for instance.)  What would be a concrete formula [tex] ? "
1082,A few questions about the morphology and sediment dynamics of Wissant Bay (France),"Could someone please explain what exactly is shown on the following image? I have a few questions such as:    How did the 'Banc à la Ligne' come about? (I know it has something to do with the fact that the beach drift is subject to south-west winds, and the orientation change of the coast)  Why are the western sectors (Dune du Chatelet, Dune d'Aval) eroded in contrast to the more eastern locations (Dune d'Amont)?  I read somewhere that the height of the dunes is increasing towards the east, what is the explanation for this? "
1083,Do flights affect tides?,"Can artificial satellite positions affect tides? on Space Exploration.SE asks if artificial satellites can affect tides, because they are a lot closer than our natural satellite, even though they are much smaller in mass.  The top answer to that question is basically ""no.""   A commenter estimates that Pluto might have a larger effect, but Pluto is such a distant object I didn't think most people could easily relate to that, so I tried running the numbers with something people might be more familiar with, closer to our surface: airplanes.    Let's start by considering a big plane in relatively common use.  The Boeing 747 is well known as a popular aircraft type, and it seems that the version of it they're producing now is the Boeing 747-8.  This page says it has a maximum takeoff weight of 4.48*105 kg and a maximum landing weight of 3.12*105 kg, with a service ceiling of 1.3*104 m.  I'll round that to a weight of 3.5*105 kg mass and 1*104 m height above the surface of the ocean.  Now, the moon.  Wikipedia says the moon has a mass of around 7*1022 kg and a distance from the center of the earth on the order of 4*106 km, which is 4*109 m.  Earth's radius, about 6.3*103 km, is about a tenth of a percent of that distance and lost in the rounding/simplification of the Moon's orbit to be circular instead of its actual eccentricity.   This means that the moon's mass is (7*1022 kg / 3.5*105 kg =) 2*1017 times that of the 747. The moon's distance from the surface of the ocean is (4*109 m / 1*104m =) 4*105 times that of the 747.    Comments on this answer note that ""the amplitude of tides is proportional not to the strength of the gravity force, which is proportional to r2, but to its gradient, which is proportional to r3...a factor of 103 in distance means a factor of 109 in tidal effect.""  Therefore, the effect that the distance has on the amplitude would be ((4*105)3 =) 6.4*1016.  Thus the overall effect of the 747 on tides should be (6.4*1016 / 2*1017 =) about a third of the effect of the moon.  It's a back-of-the-envelope order-of-magnitude calculation, but a much larger result than I expected.    Did I mess up somewhere in the math or facts above?  (If not, I'm willing to cut &amp; paste that content into an Answer, but for now it's just showing the work I've done in arriving at this question and attempting to solve it myself.)  Now, there are many flights in the sky at any given moment, all around the world, and to a certain extent any tidal effects of one flight would be cancelled out by the effects of one or more others.   However, the flight map is not completely balanced or evenly distributed north-south or east-west.     Do flights affect tides? "
1084,State of Stress in rotated 2D system,"I'm working on the rotation of the state of stress using the book Geodynamics of Turcotte page 101.

The force in the [tex]-direction on face [tex] is  [tex]  and the force in the [tex]-direction on face [tex] is  [tex]  The force in the [tex]-direction on face [tex] is   [tex]  I don't understand why the force in the [tex]-direction on face [tex] is equal to the above equation?   I think the negative signs are there because the stresses are not oriented in the same direction than the [tex]-direction. I don't know why it is necessary to subtract the two lengths. "
1085,Evidence of a seismic trigger of the Storegga Slide ~8.2ka,"The Storegga Slide was a catastrophic underwater landslide that occurred off the coast of Norway about 8,200 years ago. This YouTube clip shows simulations that indicate that this slide resulted in landslides in the 10's of metres across the surrounding shorelines, including the Norwegian coast, Greenland, Iceland, Shetlands, Orkneys, Britain etc and by several accounts, it wiped out the now submerged North Sea land-bridge known as Doggerland.  A possible cause from the Wikipedia article (linked above) is:     A likely triggering mechanism is thought to be an earthquake causing a catastrophic expansion of methane hydrates.   This earthquake scenario is also mentioned in this YouTube clip.  What evidence is there of a seismic trigger of the Storegga Slide? "
1086,If there were no continent that spanning between the North and South Hemispheres would there be a Circum-equatorial Current?,Let's just imagine that there are no continents that span the equator like Africa and South America and also no large Equatorial Islands like those in Indonesian archipelago.  So that between latitude 10 north and 10 south there are no substantial landmasses.  Holding Earth's other physical parameters constant would there be a circum-equatorial current like Antarctic Circumpolar Current?  Would it be stronger/faster than the current Pacific Equatorial Current? How strong would it be?  Could a wooden sail ship cross the current from North to sail to South?  This is the first part of the question. The second part of question would be to ask the effect of a continous equatorial current on the world climate. 
1087,How is abundance of elements in the Earth's crust estimated?,"In an quiz app I surprisingly learned that aluminium has a larger abundance then iron. When researching this on Wikipedia, I found this article, which also had the comment:      Note that numbers are estimates, and they will vary depending on source and method of estimation.   Now I wonder what methods exist and were used to estimate this? The only idea I had, that they took probes from different places and averaged the result, but that sounds like a very vague guess, because you would need a lot of probes from different places and depths (up to 50km deep), so I guess they used another method to estimate this. If somebody knows how the numbers are estimated, can he also say how accurate this estimations are? "
1088,Why can't wave models model storm surge?,"I found this nice module here on MetEd that gives an overview of the WAVEWATCH wave model. In it, in the Introduction section, it is mentioned that WAVEWATCH cannot model storm surge or tsunamis. Is this true of all 3rd generation models? Can source terms be added to the energy balance equation to model these phenomena? "
1089,"Do ""water-worlds"" not have plate tectonics?","Water-worlds are becoming increasingly important in the exoplanet/astrobiology community. If plate tectonics create land masses, then can we say that a water-world (a planet with a global ocean and no land) does not have plate tectonics?  Many astrobiologists say that plate tectonics may be a prerequisite for life to form on a given planet. Therefore, if the assumption that water-worlds do not have plate tectonics is true, then can we also say that these water-worlds cannot harbor life?  "
1090,Ship turning causing calm water,"Can anyone tell me the official or technical term for the effect of when extremely calm water appears when a ship turns sharply in a full circle?

1092,Why is Mauna Kea taller than the maximum height possible on Earth?,"We can calculate the maximum possible height of the mountain on earth.  If the elastic limit of a typical rock is [tex] and its mean density is [tex], then the breaking stress is [tex], where [tex] is height, [tex] is the density of the rock, and [tex] is the acceleration due to gravity. Then  [tex]  Putting the values we get,  [tex]  which is the maximum possible height. Now Mount Everest is within this limit, but Mauna Kea is 10,210 m tall (measured from its oceanic base).  Does this suggest that rock types at the base of this mountain are different? Or does the presence of water have an effect? "
1093,What color(s) would Earth be without water or life?,"Many of the celestial bodies in our solar system have well-established color schemes, at least in the minds of the public.  Mars is pale-red and black, Venus (beneath the clouds) is generally shown in rich yellows and oranges, the Moon ranges from dark to light gray, etc.  And, of course, Earth is famously blue and green.  However, this is entirely because of the presence of large oceans and life.  We're not seeing Earth's geology represented in these colors, as we are with the other planets, we're seeing overlaid colors from other processes that don't apply to Mars, Venus, or the Moon.  So I'm wondering, if you stripped away life and the oceans, what color(s) would Earth be?  Based on types of rock, etc.  Would the seabed be a different color from the continents?  Would it be more uniform, or would it vary in color quite a bit from region to region?  Would it be a similar gray to the Moon, or would other chemical processes (like the rusting of Mars) give it a more unique palette? "
1094,Possibility to influence oceanic evaporation to protect Sahel/Sahara,"When reading about the projects that want to plant trees on the Sahel-Sahara border, for protection of the Sahel, I wonder what other possibilities there are.  Like, would it be possible to influence precipitation in the Sahara desert by enlarging the evaporation of seas and oceans.  This question would combine a number of different sub-questions.  First of all, would moistening the air help at all? When reading Wikipedia, it looks like the air in the Sahara is extremely dry, but there's also a lack of precipitation generation mechanism. Can rain be generated there if the air would be wetter?  Secondly, when it rains in the Sahara, where does the rain come from? The main wind over the Sahara desert is an eastern to northeastern wind. So it comes from over the Asian mainland, and can't carry a lot of water.   Does it mainly come from different winds (like an occasional western wind)? Does it mainly come from evaporation of the red sea (though that has a small surface) Does it get carried all the way over Asia, so coming from the Pacific ocean? Anything other ideas?   Thirdly (this is more a physics question), is it feasible to alter the evaporation rate of a large water body (feasible as in comparison to the tree-planting project, so it can cost a few billions). The experiments I've found wrt the relation between water-surface temperature and evaporation seem to suggest an exponential relation. Which is at least nice,   Water doesn't have a colour, so it doesn't extract a lot of energy from the solar rays (at least not at the surface, but the energy gets spread over the entire depth). If we could let an energy-absorbing coloured surface (a black surface) float just a few inches under water, it could heat the water surface and make it evaporate more.  By making it evaporate relatively near the coast (as opposed to evaporation in the middle of the ocean), the majority of rain will also have to fall on land   When this technique could be applied to a decent portion of the Red Sea, the surface temperature could be enlarged sufficiently, which could let the Red Sea act as a big ocean, thus result in a wetter Sahara and Sahel.  This might of course be a very stupid idea (like the majority of fresh ideas).  I thought someone would have studied this thoroughly before me (at least before planing millions of trees), but I couldn't find a lot of info on it (not even on the basic questions like how strongly surface colour influences evaporation).  Thanks for reading through this, and trying to answer (a part of) it. "
1095,What makes a nuclear winter so extreme and destructive?,"This may be a sort of, pertinent to the times, and disturbing question, inspired by the difficulties surrounding North Korea and the situation with it and nuclear weapons.  I've heard of this idea of ""nuclear winter"" that can result from a nuclear exchange, and more interestingly, very surprisingly, and disturbingly, that a major winter could be caused by even a ""small"" nuclear exchange, like on this paper:  [website]suggests that only ""150 teragrams"" of ""smoke"" released from a Nuclear exchange, would be able to produce a HUGE temperature drop of 7 degrees C for a couple of years or so, with attendant devastating effects on agriculture - indeed there's another version of this I saw with a map showing far greater temperature drops, like 20 degrees C or more, in places like Europe and North America (the USA) over land, right where the breadbaskets would be. Considering that it's not just crops but other plants as well that would be affected, its would seem to be a geologically significant event for a fair number of life forms, not just humans.  But the thing I'm having trouble with is just how is this possible, in particular, this magnitude, because it seems to be comparable to, if not greater than, natural events that would seemingly be of far greater magnitude. The 150 teragrams of carbon soot is only like a cube 400 meters on a side when solid, which is then vaporized and spread throughout the atmosphere, but that seems utterly tiny compared to the release of thousands of cubic kilometers of ash and other materials from volcanic and super-volcanic eruptions(*), much more asteroid strikes like Chicxulub releasing doubtless millions of cubic kilometers of material of all sorts. Is the soot really tens or hundreds of thousands of times more powerful per unit mass at cooling than anything released from any of these events would be? Or what? Further, especially considering that an event like Chicxulub would no doubt have ignited at least continent-scale areas of of forests in the area around it if nowhere else from the ejecta storm, which doubtless would have produced far more black carbon soot than burning down all the cities in a nuclear war, no? Yet this suggests effects that, while not equal, seem almost comparable - and this is considered for a much diminished set of arsenals, compared to what they were at their peak, suggesting the peak could perhaps even eclipse the Chicxulub at a tiny fraction of the total energy release from the latter. What would have happened to the Earth in an imaginary scenario where the 100 million megatons (400 zettajoules) of Chicxulub asteroid energy were replaced with 100 million megatons of hydrogen bomb mushroom clouds exploding over a comparable area of forests (alien attack? :) ) to those that the asteroid would have burned, 65-66 million years ago?  (*) See, e.g.   [website][website]where it is mentioned how that the Toba super volcanic eruption was first thought to have produced a big cooling, but more recent evidence suggests it may not have. Yet the nuclear war seems able to almost match it, with only 150 teragrams of carbon vs. 6 000 teragrams of SO2. Now of course maybe the former is better absorber (gas vs. fine dark solid), but literally so much better that the latter could barely move the meter (according to observational evidence, not the simulation mentioned), while the former would drop it 7 degrees C, 20+ in some areas? And that's just the SO2 component, what about all the other material released by the eruption to no doubt similar very great heights? And furthermore, how does this all fit in with Chicxulub? Is there any data on the ""anti greenhouse"" power of C soot versus SO2 and other materials released by volcanoes and asteroid strikes?  In short, what makes nuclear weapons so damn good at being destructive, compared to everything that nature seems to have in its arsenal short of the death of the Sun itself, despite seemingly the much greater raw power in terms of energy of the latter? "
1096,What allowed the Himalaya to become so high?,"Of course the mountains were caused by moving tectonic plates. But in case of the Himalaya mountains was the speed of the plates just higher so more energy got 'into' the mountains. Or was the continental plates just slightly more loose on the plates? Or did the plates just submerge more, if so what caused that? Or.... "
1097,How can crystal habit be determined when rock is worn and rounded?,"In many cases when I find interesting rocks they are worn and rounded off so the crystalline structure is not clear.  How can I determine what kind of crystal it is in those cases?  Is there a simple instrument that can be used to determine the angle of a crystal, even if it is worn and rounded? "
1098,"Ways, Through Science, to Counteract Hurricane Forces?","I know nothing significant about meteorology and definitely not a science guy so this will probably seem naive...  But today I am wondering if there is any existing science or methods a government (with enough funds) could employ, through science, to lessen the force of a hurricane?  I vaguely remember something about them being affected by air temperatures, so couldn't something be done to somehow inject heat or refrigeration into the area? Or something to counteract against it's speed increases?  What approaches would one consider in such an endeavor? "
1099,Which parts of the ocean have been explored?,"So there's a sea, right by my house. How do I know if it's been explored, and what info do we have about it?  According to the internet, about 5-10% of the world's oceans has been explored.  Is there a map that shows which parts of the ocean have been explored, and which haven't? Does it show what has been discovered about X part of the ocean etc.? Where can I find such information?  If I just google ""Unexplored parts of the world"", it'd drive me to very specific and popular parts of the earth, many of which have actually been explored (to a certain point), such as the Mariana Trench etc. "
1100,Could a firestorm create a hurricane-like cyclone?,"Mesocyclones form when air rises and rotates in a ""pillar"" of sorts. It's sometimes associated with thunderclouds and tornado formation.  A certain kind of cumulonimbus, the cumulonimbus flammagenitus, can form above a firestorm of sufficient strength (magnitude, temperature, whatever the thing being measured is). Some cumulonimbus flammagenitus clouds have generated true fire tornados (as opposed to the fire whirl, which is commonly called a fire tornado) indicating that these clouds do form mesocyclones.   My question is, could a firestorm generate a hurricane-like cyclone, with strong surface winds along a large area, raining ash and embers? If so, would it move or be stationary? How long could it sustain itself? What would be involved in its formation? "
1101,How to handle leap years when working with environmental conditions time series?,I have a time series of snow and temperature and I want to analyze changes over time for a specific period of time: 15 April - 15 June. In the perpetual calendar April 15 is the day 105 and in a leap year is 106. How should I handle/correct for leap years? Should I subtract one day on leap years? Is there a bias in the data because of leap years?   thanks for you answers! 
1102,Can hurricanes set off earthquakes?,"Large hurricanes can show up on seismographs. Do they do this by shaking the ground with wind? Moving large amounts of water putting weight on the tectonic plates?  A large earthquake is the result of long term tectonic forces, but I wonder if local weather activity could trigger earthquakes?  Is this obviously impossible? "
1103,Is there a table available for the maximum potential intensity of hurricanes?,"The maximum potential intensity (MPI) is a computed quantity that often sets a maximum bound for maximum hurricane wind speed, though rarely, the wind speeds observed can exceed it. MPI is based off of the idea that hurricanes effectively work as Carnot engines. Has there been a table produced with historic MPI calculations (reanalysis or forecast based)?  Also, is there a source that calculates MPI for each model and each hurricane?  For reference, [tex] where [tex] is the theoretical maximum speed (MPI), [tex] is the surface drag coefficient of enthalpy, [tex] is the surface drag coefficient, [tex] is the change in enthalpy between the surface and environment, [tex] is the sea surface temperature, [tex] is the outflow temperature, [tex] is the convective available potential energy (CAPE) from sea level and [tex] is the CAPE of the boundary layer air.

1104,Hurricane eye on landfall and relation to wind speeds,"I am not a meteorologist but watching Hurricane Irma (2017), I have a couple questions about how hurricanes keep their formation based on geographical landmarks.   How does the radius of the hurricane's eye affect the winds felt by those at different distances from the eye? When a hurricane reaches land, how does the land affect the eye's formation?  "

1106,A few questions about glass,"A glass, as I understand it, is a material whose solid phase is amorphous and which undergoes a glass transition when heated.    My train of thought - and therefore my questions - began with obsidian.  My understanding is that obsidian is formed from material that would normally form crystalline rock, but since it's exposed to air during an eruption, it cools too rapidly to crystallize and therefore solidifies as glass.  This led me to wonder: how large can a lava stream be and still produce obsidian?  In particular, in season 7 of Game of Thrones, the island of Dragonstone is revealed to contain a veritable mountain of obsidian - is such a thing possible in the real world?  I would have thought that, above a certain volume, the center of the mass would be well-enough insulated so that crystallization could occur, spoiling the obsidian.  What's the largest mass of obsidian found in nature?  Thinking about too-rapid cooling led me to another question: can water form glass?  Is it possible to blast-freeze water so quickly that ice crystals do not form?  If so, what would be the properties of such a glass?  Finally, I wonder about regular, garden-variety silicate glass (as found in windows and bottles.)  Can it be cooled slowly enough so that crystals do form?  And if so, what are its properties?  (Have I essentially re-invented quartz?) "
1107,Could we cool the ocean by reflecting away sunlight to influence hurricanes?,"I was wondering if we could possibly reduce the severity of, or steer a hurricane by changing albedo (e.g. dying the part ocean with a temporary light colored dye)?  My thought would be to put this dye well in front of the path of a hurricane, with enough time to reflect the sunlight back off the ocean and cool the ocean surface.  When the hurricane arrives there, the ocean surface should then be cooler, leading to the hurricane being less powerful.  I am also wondering if this could be used to steer the hurricane somehow (e.g. if a hurricane would be drawn to or repelled away from cool ocean surface).  If so, could we use that to steer a hurricane away from populated areas?  Some potential methods (there may be others):   Use light colored dye injected into the ocean Use light colored smoke to block the sun from reaching the ocean Possibly use ""cloud seeding"" ahead of the hurricane and form clouds to block the sun light from warming the ocean. - Covered in the alternate question Perhaps a ""surface film"" could also be applied temporarily to part of the ocean (sort of like a ""light colored oil spill"", hopefully with something safer for the environment than oil). - Covered in the alternate question   If this experiment were to be conducted, I would think it should be done far from inhabited land.  Environmental impacts would need to be thought out too, e.g. would a film block the carbon dioxide / oxygen exchange in that area and cause severe environmental impact?  Could the experiment actually strengthen instead of weaken a hurricane?  Edit:  The linked question and answer addresses some, but not all the methods I propose here.  It also proposes some other methods, definitely an interesting read! "
1108,Human hurricane forecasting?,"I'm referring to an article I've read on Ars Technica about the differences in various weather models. One thing that stood out for me was a mention of       Forecast models typically show their skill with three-, four-, and five-day forecasts. For simplicity's sake, we will focus on 120-hour forecasts. At this lead time, the average error of the European model with respect to Irma has been about 175km in its position forecast. The next best forecast is from the hurricane center, which is slightly more than 300km. An automated model, then, has so far beaten human forecasters at the National Hurricane Center (looking at all of this model data) by a wide margin.     A similar thing about models beating human forecasters was also mention in another article linked in this article and nowhere is there any other explanation for it, so:  Do humans seriously forecast extreme weather? I get it, that meoteorologists get trained in physics, hydrodynamics etc, but I can't believe that humans try to compete with computers in crunching the numbers on differential equations. Or how else does 'human forecasting' work? "

1110,Do hurricanes cool the earth?,"I noticed that temperature drops in the surrounding area of a hurricane.    Is the heat converted into kinetic energy? Could the shape of the hurricanes reflect sunlight? Do they create more lightning in an area that would normally have lower levels of lightning for the same timeframe, in turn creating more ozone?  "

1112,"How did a tropical storm starting with ""D"" end up next to a typhoon starting with ""T""?","While keeping a close eye on typhoon Talim, I noticed that tropical storm Doksuri is also on the map and has caused serious damage and loss of life. I had thought that the naming of tropical storms is alphabetical (within a given area) so it seems that Doksuri with a ""D"" must be quite old by now, and Talim fairly young.  Do I have the basic idea correct? I've tried to read the Wikipedia article Tropical cyclone naming but it gets a little complicated to read as it start to break things down by East Pacific and West Pacific and I am not sure from where these two originated.  How did a ""D"" and a ""T"" end up so close together? Is this unusual?  below: Screen shot from the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau's Typhoon News page.   "
1113,Do surface temperatures at lower latitudes continue to correlate with frequency of noctilucent clouds in the arctic stratosphere?,"I saw this image in this answer to the question Noctilucent clouds and anthropogenic climate change which was listed as related to the question “New” cloud types: Can they be used as markers for climate change observations?.  The answer says:     In recent observations, reported in the NASA article Unexpected teleconnections in noctilucent clouds in 2014 found that the winter air temperature over the USA and Arctic stratospheric conditions have a direct link to the frequency of NLC over Antarctica (as per the image below from NASA):     At first glance I thought it was an illustration of coincidental correlations until I realized that it's arctic and not antarctic and so they are in the same hemisphere.  Question: But I'm curious, was this still a one-off 45 day coincidental correlation, or has this happened again in 2015 and 2016? "
1114,Why are Lomekwian tools considered different from Oldowan tools?,"I just read this short article from Scientific American: Archaeologists Take Wrong Turn, Find World's Oldest Stone Tools about Sonia Harmand's discoveries. The last sentence is:     Harmand says the newly discovered tools are different enough from the early Oldowan implements to warrant a new name: the Lomekwian.   Earlier the article says:     The tools from Lomekwi 3 are quite large—larger than the stone tools from the site of Gona in Ethiopia that were previously the oldest on record and larger than the rocks that chimpanzees use to crack open nuts. According to Harmand, preliminary observations suggest that the Lomekwi toolmakers intentionally selected big, heavy blocks of very hard raw material from nearby sources even though smaller blocks were available. They used various knapping techniques to remove the sharp-edged flakes from the cores.   How does the Lomekwi technique (ca. 3.3 mya) differ from Oldowan (ca. 2.7 mya)? From Wikipedia:     These early tools were simple, usually made with one or a few flakes chipped off with another stone.   Without any further details, the two techniques sound the same, and the size difference alone doesn't sound like enough to warrant a separate classification. What is so different about Lomekwi to not call it Oldowan? "
1115,Why do major earthquakes keep happening in Lombok recently?,"So I've been following the situation in Lombok, Indonesia from both online news and friends on the ground. One thing that I can't seem to figure out is why there are so many earthquakes over an extended period of time?  Is it common for there to be earthquakes for a whole month and of high magnitudes too in seismic zones?  I have read that there can be aftershocks but I don't think that all these quakes can be characterized as aftershocks of the initial quake? These quakes seem to be independent quakes and not a continuation of aftershocks.  The major 3 have also been progressing from the south to the northwest to the northeast of the island as though it is following some pattern. So is this a sign that an underlying seismic development such as a major shift in tectonic plates or a new volcano formation will take place?  Please explain it to me like I'm 5. "
1116,Does the magnetic field really protect Earth from anything?,"Many topics discussed here in Earth Science SE, tend to be about facts that are of consensus in the scientific community but not widely accepted by the general public. Instead, this one is widely accepted by the general public but it seems to generate doubts and debates between the leading scientists in the field.  We have always heard that Earth's magnetic field protects us from harmful cosmic radiation and solar wind, that would otherwise strip the atmosphere away and kill us all due to high doses ionizing radiation.  Well, all that seem to actually be under debate. Because (if I understand the issue correctly), the magnetic field deflects most of the incoming charged particles, but on the other hand it increases dramatically the cross sectional area through which Earth interacts with the solar wind.  This figure from Wikipedia's Magnetosphere page will illustrate the problem:    As you can see, most of the charged particles are deflected away from Earth (orange lines), but a fraction of them gets funneled towards the poles through the so called ""polar cusps"" (yellow lines), that's why auroras (a.k.a. northern lights) happen around the poles. As you can see, the size of the polar cusps ""funnels"" is comparable to the size of the Earth, therefore giving rise to the discussion if the magnetic field increases or decreases the amount of charged particles that hit the atmosphere: If the funnels are smaller than the Earth the magnetic field would decrease the amount of particles hitting the Earth, but if the funnels are larger the particles hitting us would increase.  These charged particles are usually cited as relevant due to two reasons:   They are harmful to life by increasing the dose of ionizing radiation that reach the surface. Such radiation in turn generates mutations in the DNA. They can hit molecules in the atmosphere fast enough to send them to outer space, leading to atmospheric escape and the thinning of our beloved atmosphere.   The first point is only partially true, because the atmosphere itself is an extraordinary shield against cosmic and solar radiation. Therefore, even in the eventual shutdown of Earth's magnetic field, not much radiation would reach the surface anyway. That's perhaps one of the reasons why nobody has been able to link magnetic reversals to mass extinctions. More on that is discussed in this question.  The second point is also questionable, because although the magnetic field does redirect the charged particles to the poles, it is unclear if the amount of particles currently hitting polar areas is more or less than the amount that would hit the entire Earth in the absence of a magnetic field. Notably, atmospheric escape would be equally bad if it happen distributed over the globe or if it is concentrated at the poles.  It is important to note that in this question I refer to the intrinsic magnetic field. Because, all bodies with atmosphere that are exposed to the solar wind develop an induced magnetic field. This induced magnetic field is observed in Venus, Mars and even comets. However, it is much weaker that Earth's intrinsic magnetic field.  The lack of intrinsic magnetic field is often blamed as one of the reasons that Mars lost its atmosphere. However, Venus have always challenged that idea: Venus have an atmosphere much thicker than Earth's and it doesn't have an intrinsic magnetic field. This article from Space.com describes how this discussion was restarted due to:     recent observations that show Mars and Venus are losing oxygen ions   from their atmospheres into space at about the same rate as Earth   And they cite Robert Strangeway (a leading scientist in the field) saying ""My opinion is that the magnetic shield hypothesis is unproven"". Strangeway also presented a poster on last year's AGU fall meeting describing the same skepticism: ""Does an Intrinsic Magnetic Field Inhibit or Enhance Planetary Ionosphere Outflow and Loss?""  In that work he backs the above cite of Space.com with actual numbers:     The oxygen ion outflow is frequently assumed to be a proxy for the   loss of water from the planetary atmosphere. In terms global outflow   rates for the Earth the rate varies from [tex] to [tex]   s[tex], depending on geomagnetic activity. For both Venus and Mars   global rates of the order [tex] s[tex] have been   reported.   Giving some credit to his skepticism, his work was cited in a 2018 paper written by most if not all the leading scientist behind the MAVEN probe that have been orbiting Mars since 2014. There they say:     our expectation is that stripping of atmospheric gas by the solar wind   is minimized by the presence of a magnetic field (e.g., Hutchins et al.,   1997), although observations of escaping ions at Earth suggest that   this may not be strictly correct (Strangeway et al.,2017).   The second author of that paper: Dave Brain, also gave a very interesting TED talk where he mentions the topic: What a planet needs to sustain life (starting at minute 7:31).  I'm fascinated by the topic, but my understanding of the physics of Earth's magnetic field is minimal. So I wonder: What evidence is there supporting that the intrinsic magnetic field really protects Earth's atmosphere and its living organisms?  In other words: In the absence of models and speculations of how the intrinsic magnetic field interacts with charged particles: Is there any reason to believe that a stronger magnetic field offers more protection than a weak or negligible one?  "

1118,Transferring water using underground channel,"I heard in tv show, there are water channels in underground like rivers or small channels! So I just wondered why don't we use such underground water channels to recharge the underground water of one area from another area, incase there are connections?  I'm sure if there are channels, scientists would have been done some research about it?     So, Do we have any underground water channels maps for world wide? Do you think its possible to recharge lakes few miles away from river using this idea?  "
1119,Are hurricane storm surges smaller when the storms strike small islands?,"My understanding of a storm surge is that it is caused by the hurricane ""pushing"" water towards the land. When a hurricane makes landfall, this water washes up on the short generating a storm surge. From the Wikipedia article, certain geographical features such as shallow water or a funnel-shaped landfall point can exacerbate surges since the water pushed by the storm cannot dissipate ([website]Thus, when a hurricane strikes a small island, is the storm surge usually not as much of a problem since the water can dissipate around the island? Are islands thus often less affected by the flooding aspect of hurricanes vs. mainland landfall locations? "
1120,Does lightning release the same electromagnetic emmisions as an arc welder?,"Looking at an arc welder is bad, it is a source that emits on a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum. More specifically the blue and UV are particularly bad for vision:     Artificial sources of UV radiation also cause corneal damage. Injury   from a welder's arc commonly is known as flash burn, welder's flash,   or arc eye. Other sources of UV radiation injury include sun tanning   beds, carbon arcs, photographic flood lamps, lightning, electric   sparks, and halogen desk lamps. Several outbreaks of ultraviolet   keratitis have been observed in the United States after installation   of improper lighting in school gymnasiums, resulting in high levels of   UV radiation.   Source: [website]Does lightning release the same magnitude of electromagnetic emissions as an arc wielder, in UVA, UVB or UVC spectra? Could watching lightning repeatedly degrade human vision? "
1121,Are strong deep earthquakes that result in minimal impacts common?,"Happened to see notice of fairly strong earthquakes near Fiji and Peru within the past few days, and thought I'd find they had been fairly damaging... only to find the impacts were quite minimal.  Have to think maybe that relates to the depths they occurred at (563 km and 610 km)?  It seems like an overall busy period, with earthquakes in/near Indonesia, Venezuela, and Oregon as well in about the last week.  But I do feel like I've seen similar bursts in the past.  However, I'm naively not sure I've ever seen such deep ones reported where they apparently didn't cause much shaking.  I figure that may well be just because such earthquakes having minimal impacts simply weren't as publicized in the past??  But, not knowing nearly enough about the differences in earthquake types and patterns, I'd be interested to know:   Were the minimal impacts indeed a consequence of the depths of the earthquakes?   Are such strong earthquakes at those depths expected at fairly similar regularity to similar earthquakes at shallower depths?  "
1122,Simple numerical model of tide with an elliptic scheme,"I have recently been given the task of developping a coastal model for tides. I have a few requirements, it must not be time stepping in order to be as fast as possible and in finite differences because something as simple as possible is asked.  For a first start, I tried implementing linearized shallow water equations and supposed a time dependancy in the form of a complex exponential. This gave me the following system :  (1) [tex]  (2) [tex]   (3) [tex]   where my unknows are [tex],[tex],[tex], and only two parameters possibly showing spatial variation : [tex] and [tex]. I tried to discretize it with finite differences but I quickly realize that I needed to be very careful with my boundary conditions. Because the 3 variables that I wanted to determined where closely linked to one another and that actually [tex] and [tex] could easily be determined by the derivatives of [tex].  So I modified my system  in order to solve only this variable and came with the following set of equations :  (4) [tex]  (5) [tex]  (6) [tex]  Then I tried to approximate the derivates with centered first order scheme. I tried to reproduce a Kelvin coastal wave on a reduced domain (10*10 cells). However, I am at best able not to crash it and most of the time have very strong oscillations in the center.

1123,The magnetite is in which type of magma,In which type of magma can I find magnetite? Peraluminous or peralkaline? I've been looking and the peraluminous magma have a lot of oxides so I thought it would be reduced magma so it would have magnetite but I'm not pretty sure. 
1124,Can anyone help me identify this rock?,"This is probably just something really common and boring to most people, but I was intrigued so I thought I might as well ask now I can. When I was in Portugal (I don’t know specifically where we were) when I was 6 (I’m now 15) I found some rocks on a beach that I thought were really interesting. They ended up coming home with us after the holiday, and I just rediscovered one in the house. This particular one doesn’t, but some of them I found seemed to have some sort of crystal inside?? It reminded me of those quartz crystal dragon eggs (I don’t know what else they would be called?) except it was only a few tiny bits where you could see into what seemed to be a hollow rock besides the crystal or whatever it was.  "
1125,Seeming correlation between time of day and earthquakes,"I live in a generally geographically active area (Southern California, near the San Andreas fault, if that matters), that has had two relatively minor earthquakes that I have felt in the last week (in the 3-4 range on the Richter Scale, I believe), as well as frequently in the past. I am used to this, being born and raised in the region.  I was talking about these phenomena with a colleague who recently moved to the area from a non-earthquake prone place, and was not used to them. I realized that both of the earthquakes were late at night, when I was in bed, and searching my memory I can only recall encountering these minor earthquakes at similar times.  My question, therefore, is if there is any correlation between time of day and earthquakes? Or to put it another way, is my observation based on anything more than the fact that I am more likely to note and recall a minor earthquake what I am not engaged in another activity? "
1126,Why can't the meteorologists predict for sure if the day would be rainy even on the beginning of the day sometimes?,"Why do the meteorologists still cannot predict if a day would be rainy or cloudy or blizzardy even on the beginning of the day sometimes?  My life circles around weather and an avid weather watcher.  And I noticed the computers still are not advanced enough to get all the variables to predict the weather accurately. The weathermen and women still read the probabilities. For example, there is a 70% chance of rain. I take the umbrella outside and there is no rain. Then the prediction is the day would be cloudy. But then there is rain. I am not saying it happens most of the time. But it happens sometimes.   Do we need a quantum computer then with qubits? Because it can hold a myriad of variables and consider them in the calculation of the weather.  "
1127,How is this crumbly crystal-rich rock formed?,"I found this crumbly rock embedded in the channel walls of a small creek in Everett, WA, USA. (North Creek that flows through McCollum Park.)  If possible, I'd like to know how the rock formed... what process leads to its formation? It's the crumbly part that I'm most curious about.  The shape is ellipsoid, abut 8 cm on a side:   The entire thing is made of different types of 1-3 millimeter (or so) sized crystals.    I would have called it granite or some other relative; to my non-expert eye, I see feldspars, some quartz, and mica. Except that it's very crumbly. Here's a video that shows better the texture and how loosely-bound the crystals are to each other. You can flake them all off with your hand.   [website]How is this formed? Are the minerals dissolved in the creek and they happen to have found a nice place to precipitate out? (If so, what would happen as time goes on? Would the rock grow larger with same crystal size, or larger crystal size but same overall rock size?) "
1128,Carbon Dioxide levels appear to be linked to the Milankovitch cycles according to Ice Core data but what is the mechanism?,"As in ice core data shows that [tex] levels have fluctuated on levels correlating to the temperature and ice levels, but I couldn't think of a mechanism for what might be the link between the release of carbon dioxide and other gases, and presumably orbital geometry?   Is it to do with gases dissolved in the oceans? Or the melting of permafrost? "
1129,Synoptic weather predictibility under climate change scenarios,"Under climate change scenarios, it is quite certain that high latitude regions will experience more warming than at low latitudes. For example, in winter the reduced area of sea ice and snow cover should have the amplifying effect for temperature rising over polar region. Thus the meridional temperature gradient would also be reduced, so as the baroclinicity. Baroclinicity is important in theories concerning synoptic weather forecast in mid-latitudes.  Is there an estimate, and if yes how much climate change will reduce synoptic weather predictability? How will predictability be affected in springtime for mid-latitudes? "
1130,What does it mean when the depth of earthquakes get near the surface over a period of time?,"First of all, I am not expert at this so correct me. My hometown is Shiraz and since last year I can sense the earth is moving. I call them  mini earthquakes. But many people around me can not sense it. Some time ago there was an earthquake it felt like a 5 or even 6 richter earthquake but it was a 4 ricther earthquake but then in news they said that the depth was so close to the surface (4 km). I take a look at the USGS archives for Shiraz with in a 90 km diameter (as back in time as it was available) which I think will cover the major and minor fault lines. If you want to take a look its at a link! usgs archives[a] . And here is a diagram I made in excel.   This is depth diagram (horizontal axis is the time and starts from 1974). What is interesting for me is that the depth of the earthquakes broke the boundary of 10km and stayed there for a much longer than it used to.And here is the magnitude diagram    This is the map of major fault lines of Iran:   This is the same map (only the reverse fault lines):   And again the same map (only the lateral fault lines):   Is this a sign of fault lines building pressure? And why the depth of earthquakes are getting near the surface? Can a geologist make any kind of guess based on the pattern or this is not a pattern at all? "
1131,What is a fault?,"Curious if to what degree it is possible to cluster epicentres as originating from a single formation/fault? Seems like it is possible that apart of the issue might being able to map the hypocentre of a faults slope, but what is not clear is if that is true, or if faults are really more a collections of formations that vary and at a high-level behave as one, but often independently behave when reviewed on a small scale due to the formations local attributes.  Which leads to my real question, what is a fault? "
1132,How do I derive the formula for lithostatic (overburden) pressure?,"The title pretty much says it. I have the formula: [tex] where [tex] is the density, [tex] is how deep the pressure is in the Earth and [tex] is the gravitational acceleration(?).  I don't get the units either. If I substitute the units for each term I get this:   [tex]   Shouldn't it be something like [tex]? As far as I'm concerned that's the unit for pressure.   Where do I get this formula from and how do I derive the unit of measurement? "
1133,"If it rains harder, does it mean the rain's duration will be shorter?","If it rains real hard, is there a chance the rain's duration will be shorter? I think the if the rain in the clouds disperses with such force the rain will be over faster than if it was just a light drizzle. Can anyone confirm/deny this? Is there a percentage or study shown on rain duration relative to the rain's strength? "
1134,The relationship between specific discharge and flux,"How are specific discharge and flux linked?  Is flux simply specific discharge × area? And when we speak of flux of an element eg. N-flux, is that specific discharge × concentration × area? "
1135,Argument for designing an ocean monitoring network based on satellite-derived chlorophyll-a concentration?,"The idea is to design an integrated marine monitoring network by surveying in parallel the chlorophyll-a and the other oceanography parameters, which are either trophically related with the concentration of chlorophyll-a (e.g. nutrients, zooplankton) or topically-related (having the same origin), e.g. nutrients and contaminants have the same land-based point sources of pollution.  The simplest approach is to place the sampling stations at equal distance from the land-based sources of pollution to detect of the pressure from pollution with nutrients and contaminants and its effect on the marine ecosystem. This approach is supported by the fact that the water column parameters have relatively homogeneous distribution, because of the water mixing.  The question is: is there an argument for applying a more sophisticated approach of using the analysis average multi-annual satellite-derived spatial change in the concentration of chlorophyll-a for choosing a sampling location of the monitoring network? And if it is, what method can be used to place the sampling stations (Besides the ArcGIS Sampling Network Design Tool)? "
1136,How are the thickness of ice sheets from previous glaciation periods determined?,"How is the thickness/depth of ice sheets from previous glaciation periods determined? I've for instance often seen statements that the ice sheet over Scandinavia at the last glacial period maximum (i.e. Weichel) was 3-4 km thick, but haven't seen how this is calculated. Is this determined only by the rate of subsequent post-glacial rebound, basically the inferred weight of the ice sheet, or is it based on other information as well (e.g. historical sea levels as an estimate of the amount of water tied up in ice sheets)? "
1137,P wave to S wave conversion,"While passing through layers inside the earth some P waves get converted to S waves and then back to P waves while returning towards the surface.

1138,"Are the elements of an averaging kernel matrix always centered on the diagonal, or can they be exclusively off-diagonal in rare cases?","According to Rodgers (2000) equation 2.80  $$ d_s = \mathrm{tr}(\mathbf{A}) $$  where [tex] is the number of degrees of freedom for the signal, tr denotes the trace, and [tex] is the averaging kernel matrix.  I'm trying to properly understand this.  For example, is it theoretically possible for the averaging kernel to have mainly or even exclusively off-diagonal elements?  In practice, this would mean that the retrieved state at height [tex] would correspond to the true state at height [tex], if we take remote sounding of an atmospheric column as an example.  In such a (admittedly contrived) example, we could get [tex], although we do have information in the measurement — it's just displaced.  Is this situation possible?  If yes, does [tex] tell the whole story as for the information content in the measurement?     Clive D.

1139,What are the implications of the recent discovery that huge oceans exist close to the mantle of the Earth?,"I was of the notion that as we get deeper into the Earth, it gets hotter and hotter. If so, how can there be huge oceans (they seem bigger than our Pacific) exist at such a place? If so, what are the possible implications of this discovery in shaping our understanding of the planet? I'm very curious to find out. "
1140,Probability distribution of fault throw displacement and height limiting mechanisms,"First, what is the probability distribution of fault throw displacement. Uniform distribution seems unlikely, since then small changes would add up to huge huge elevation differences that require a large amount of by erosion to reduce. But the same holds for a Gaussian. Are there any other mechanisms that limits these large differences, like gravity pull-back and pressure from the magma? How can these be described in terms of free-fall, damping etc? "
1141,Natural nuclear explosions,"I'm aware of the Oklo reactor and other natural nuclear fission reactors, in which geological processes can lead to the formation of a sustained, self-regulating uranium fission reactor.  Is it also possible for geological processes (on Earth or elsewhere) to form a critical mass of radioactive elements, leading to a runaway chain reaction and resulting in a nuclear explosion? I realise that nowadays the proportion of [tex] in uranium deposits is too small to achieve criticality, but if it was large enough in the past for the Oklo reactor to form then that seems to imply that it was high enough for uncontrolled fission to occur as well.  Is it likely that such an event has happened on Earth in the past (on the surface or in the interior), and if so is there any known geological evidence that suggests an actual instance of it? "
1142,"Why does Mars' experience an 'ice age' at high axis obliquity, when Earth experiences an ice age at low axis obliquity","This paper here goes into some detail about how Mars' experiences its own form of 'ice ages' on a quasi periodic basis driven by the wobbling of its axis. The main mechanism outlined is that the stability of water ice on the surface increases with increased obliquity. This is in contrast to Earth when at high obliquity there is increased polar summer insolation leading to metling. What is the difference?   On a more discussion based addition to the question, could factors such as ice albedo and other feedback loops play a similar role in Mars' ice ages that they do in Earth's ice ages?  I have also asked this at the Astronomy stack exchange here "
1143,Is Bowen ratio an absolute indicator of land surface type based on the amount of heat transfer from the surface?,"Bowen ratio (BR) is the ratio of sensible heat flux to latent heat flux, i.e.,   [tex] where [tex] is the sensible heat flux and [tex] is the latent heat flux. It is an indicator of the amount of heat lost from the surface to the atmosphere. In water bodies, latent heat of vaporization is higher and hence the bowen ratio is less than one. In dry urban surfaces (e.g., buildings and asphalt roads), evaporation is lower and the bowen ratio is greater than one.  The bowen ratio over different surfaces have different values.   Can we then identify the underlying surface roughness type based on the bowen ratio alone?   I am thinking of the latitudinal and altitudinal dependence of the heat flux regime. For example, assume that there are the same vegetation distribution at 1km above sea level (a.s.l) and 4 km a.s.l at different but relatively closer latitudes, then can they have the same bowen ratio?   My idea is that BR is not the right way of quantifying the type of surface roughness because the lower pressure and temperature at 4 km in the example above favors more sensible heat flux than latent heat flux which increases the bowen ratio and gives wrong signal that the surface type is bare soil or sand. Can someone explain why BR is used as a means of quantifying the surface roughness type?  "
1144,How much garbage goes into the Pacific Ocean every year?,"In this article, they mention that:     More than 4.8 million metric tons [of] plastic waste gets dumped into the world’s oceans from land each year. And this number is just a conservative estimate. Researchers believe the real amount could be as high as 12.7 million metric tons.   How much total garbage is going into the Pacific Ocean every year? and what fraction of the garbage is ""biodegradable"".  In this other article, they point out that the size of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is much larger than previously thought.  They go on to say that they are developing a technology that will clean up some of the garbage:     The organization hopes to deploy its Pacific array in 2020 and says it could remove almost half of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch ― more than 150 million pounds of trash ― in a decade.   This is great news if it actually works out.  However, how much garbage will still be retained at the sea floor (or suspended below the level at which the garbage can be removed)? "
1145,Earth's Internal Heat Engine,"What is the internal heat engine of the Earth?  Doing research, I found out that the external heat engine of the Earth is the Sun.

1148,Do rising CO2 levels change the appearance of the sky in infrared?,"Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have been rising, recently passing 400 parts per million.  CO2 is a greenhouse gas; it absorbs and emits radiation in the thermal infrared range. It is, as far as I know, quite transparent in the visible range.  If we could see in the infrared range that's most affected by CO2, would the increased levels be visible? Would the sky appear darker because more infrared is being absorbed? Or perhaps brighter because more is being emitted and/or reflected? Or just a different color?  Would an infrared photograph of the sky taken, say 100 years ago in an unpopulated area look significantly different from one taken today? "
1149,How can every ton of CO2 cost 3 square meters of summer sea ice per year - quantitatively?,"The Science article The average U.S. family destroys a football field's worth of Arctic sea ice every 30 years states:     Every additional metric ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) puffed into the atmosphere appears to cost the Arctic another 3 square meters of summer sea ice.   which carries a link to the abstract of a peer-reviewed Science paper Observed Arctic sea-ice loss directly follows anthropogenic CO2 emission. However the abstract says (in part):     Since climate-model simulations of the sea-ice loss differ substantially, we here use a robust linear relationship between monthly-mean September sea-ice area and cumulative CO2 emissions to infer the future evolution of Arctic summer sea ice directly from the observational record. The observed linear relationship implies a sustained loss of 3 ± 0.3 m2 of September sea-ice area per metric ton of CO2 emission.   My question is about the simplification of linking tons of CO2 to square meters of ice, and without reference to time. The abstract seems to simply say that there appears to be a linear relationship, and since models disagree, then this is a ""good enough"" way to think about it.   Is it so simple - if in 2017 no CO2 were burned the sea ice would return to normal? No. The summer sea ice would likely continue to decrease for decades. An analogy might be births and deaths of a population. While there might be a rough (or ""robust"") correlation between birth rate and death rate, a cessation of births in a given year would have almost no impact on death rate for perhaps a half-century.   Is there any mathematics that justifies this simple ""robust linear relationship"" to be causal? What does ""directly follows"" mean?  I'm not in any way questioning the causality between CO2 and a wide variety of changes in climate, including reduction in summer sea-ice. I'm only questioning the original quote and the quantitative relationship: 1 metric ton of CO2 costs 3 square meters of summer sea ice.      above x2: Graphics from Science Magazine. "
1150,How does humidity vary with height in the Earth's atmosphere?,"I am busy with the development of an ""environment"" model that can be used for flight simulation of all kinds of flight vehicles — ranging from quad-copters, unmanned aerial vehicles, manned aircraft, up to rocket launchers for satellites.  The model consists of sub-models for terrestrial gravity; the earth's size, shape, and motions; the geomagnetic field; the atmosphere; and so on.    Currently I am using the COSPAR International Reference Atmosphere (CIRA-86) to calculate air pressure and temperature for heights up to 120 km. But, to be able to calculate air density, I also need to model the effects of humidity.  I know that water vapour is only present in varying quantities in the troposhere, and that high humidity is therefore more likely at lower altitudes.    Does anybody have models of the probability of experiencing some value of relative humidity as a function of height above sea level?  Edit. As an example of what I really need, the MIL-F-8785C model for wind speed and turbulence, for example, gives the mean wind speed at a height of 6.1 m above the ground, given the logarithm of the probability of exceeding the wind speed. So, a model of the humidity as a probability of exceeding the the mean humidity as a function of height is what I really need.  Do you know of any models that provide this? "
1151,What factors affect daily temperature range?,I was wondering if the difference between the low temp and the high temp depended on just the humidity content and the altitude of a place. Or are there more factors? What about the time of year? How would the time of year affect diurnal temp variation if it does affect the range? 
1152,Is oxygen spread equally on Earth's surface?,"We know that oxygen comes from trees and plants (photosynthesis), so in the jungle where there are a lot of trees you would expect more oxygen than in the desert where there are no trees. Walking in the desert is tough, but is that also due to there being less oxygen?  I know oxygen averages about 21% of the air.  Diffusion and winds probably means there is at least enough oxygen to live in the deserts and on the poles.  But could the oxygen perhaps be lower in those regions, and what is the minimum percentage that humans need to live? "
1153,Could evidence of a signal from an exocivilization be found in the geologic record?,"We know that the current SETI efforts have not found evidence for the existence of intelligent exo-civilizations (XCIV). There also has not been any evidence found of ancient non-human civilizations in the fossil record. One possibility, among many, is that XCIVs only exist for a geologically short amount of time before collapsing/extinction. Then, it could be possible that, even though none exist now, one or more XCIV could have existed in the past, and it was capable of transmitting electromagnetic (EM) radiation signals.  So, consider the following hypothesis:   In the last 100 million years, at least one XCIV capable of emitting directed EM radiation existed within 100 light-years of our solar system. The CIV sent directed EM beams towards all the planets in the star systems surrounding it. Based on what it could detect about each planet's composition, it designed the beams (frequency, signaling pattern, modulation, etc...) such that they would leave as large of a mark on the targeted planet's geologic record as possible (the mark).   Question: Is there any form of patterned, extra-solar EM radiation that could theoretically leave a mark in the geologic record that could be recognizable to us as such up to 100 million years later? And could a human-level civilization be capable of projecting such beams? "
1154,Dynamic meteorology - calculating air temperature based off falling air,"I'm not sure if this is the correct place to ask this. Basically I have an exercise in dynamic meteorology that is set up like this:     1 kg of dry air is falling with a constant speed of 0.5 cm / s and 0.1   w/kg of heat is extracted. Does the air volume temperature rise, fall   or does it remain unchanged?

1155,How much area in the world is under SemiArid climate?,"I am studying the L.C. King's ""Normal Cycle of Erosion"".   Apparently, he suggests that Davis was incorrect to have assumed Temperate Humid conditions as ""normal conditions"" of the world when suggesting his (Davisain) Normal Cycle of Erosion.   King goes on to suggest that it should be ""semi-arid"" conditions instead which should be assumed to be ""normal conditions"" (representative of the world's climate) and hence, suggested his (King's) ""Normal Cycle of Erosion"".  So my questions are:   How did L.C. King define SemiArid climate? How much area in the world is under SemiArid climate as defined by L.C. King? How much area in the world is under Temperate climate?       P.S.: I suppose if a figure isn't available for Temperate/SemiArid climate, a figure for the 6 Temperate Biomes and the 3 SemiArid Biomes would also do the trick...   6 Temperate Biomes: Warm Temperate Eastern Margin (China/Gulf Type), Warm Temperate Continental (Steppe Grasslands Type), Warm Temperate Western Margin (Mediterranean type), Cool Temperate Eastern Margin (Laurentian type), Cool Temperate Continental (Taiga type), Cool Temperate Western Margin (British type). 3 Semi Arid Biomes: Warm Temperate Continental (Steppe Grasslands Type), Warm Temperate Western Margin (Mediterranean type), Tropical Grasslands (Savanna type)  "
1156,Extraterrestrial Planetary Sky Color: does it have to be blue?,"Earth's sky appears blue, due to the composition of the atmosphere and refraction.  Mars' sky is reddish, due to the high iron-oxide particle content of the air.    If a planet had enough vegetation and humidity to keep the air relatively dust-free, and if the air composition was similar to that of Earth, would that planet necessarily have a blue sky, like ours?  Under what conditions could such a planet have a different color sky (yellow, for example) and still support terrestrial-type life?  "
1157,"If the accuracy of measurement of the earth's volume is not known, how can scientists assert that the earth is not expanding?","Volcanic eruptions, undersea earthquakes, fissures in the crust, meteoroid accumulation could all be seen as empirical evidence of expansion of the earth. Sink holes and other phenomena could be contrary evidence. Subduction of crustal layers and changes in the earth's rate of rotation could be cited as evidence one way or the other. But the net effect, if measurable at all, might well fall within the range of inaccuracy of the earth's volume estimate.  Moreover, nuclear fission produces elements of lesser density. Could this process not produce a reduction of density in the mantle, and hence provide a mechanism for expansion of the earth? I realize that the effect of these factors, although large on a human scale, may well be tiny when compared to the total earth volume. Nonetheless, whatever the measurement or estimate of these factors, how can their effect on the earth's volume, over eons, be considered insignificant, if the accuracy of the total volume of the earth is not known to a degree of certainty? "
1158,When and where is the atmospheric greenhouse effect strongest?,Is the greenhouse effect stronger in the ice covered area or in the equator? Also is it stronger during winter or summer? I am thinking it is stronger in the Ice covered area and during winter because of the bigger temperature difference but I can't fully support my answer.Any ideas? 
1159,Potassum-Argon Dating and Proportions of Daughter Products in Potassium 40 Decay Channel,"So Potassium 40 decays in such a way that roughly 89% of it becomes Calcium 40 and 11% of it becomes Argon 40. When they list these figures are they implying that after 1 half-life, of the 50% of the material that decayed to daughter products, 89% of that 50% is Calcium 40 and 11% is Argon 40?   Furthermore, does this mean that those will be the proportions of the daughter products in any given number of half lives?  Is the partitioning of the decay probability to 89% Calcium and 11% Argon  only observed at half-life intervals? Or is this constant throughout the decay chain, such as in between half-lives as well?  It should be constant (89% and 11%) throughout? Right? I had recently read some confusing literature on the subject and began to doubt my own understanding.  "

1161,What is the Carbon Footprint of not changing car oil?,I am on my second vehicle that I have stopped changing my oil after the car has been broke in or around 90k. The first car I made it 400k miles before the rear end went out. The second car I'm at 130k with no oil change from 90k and runs just as good when I got it.   Does not changing the oil decrease the vehicles carbon footprint then changing it?   I watched the Discovery Channel and a Japanese Engineer said their engines are built efficiently enough not to need an oil change ever. I still add an oil stabilizer like Lucas every 4th quart when I top it off. I am not interested whether it is bad for an engine to do so. I just want to know if it more environmentally friendly not to change the oil?

1163,Climate consequences of very large asteroids striking the Deep Ocean,"For every asteroid or meteorite that hits dry land, two hit the sea. If a Manicouagan-sized asteroid struck the deep ocean (but not above a trench),how would the H2O vapour, chlorine, iodine bromine and other elements affect the climate, and for how long? Also, if it had thousands of feet of water to penetrate, would it leave a large crater on the sea bed? For sure it would create massive tsunamis, so is there any evidence for these in the geological record? The Manicouagan crater is far from being the largest on Earth, but is only slightly smaller than the Chicxulub example. It was caused by an asteroid 5km in diameter traveling at 25km per second, though friction with the atmosphere probably reduced this slightly before it struck the ground.  Manicouagan, however, is just an example, we are talking here about a hypothetical asteroid of this size striking the deep ocean. Don't be misled by the word hypothetical; given the number of large impacts which have happened on land there must have been some which landed in deep ocean. How deep? Let's call it 6,000 feet, which is nowhere near a record depth. "
1164,How Good is The Evidence For Snowball Earth?,"Some geologists say there were times between 770 million years BP and 630 million years BP when ice ages were so profound that the Arctic and Antarctic ice caps met at the equator. This is called the Snowball Earth theory.   Although at the beginning of this period, there were, so far as we know, no advanced invertebrates able to leave easily identifiable fossils, there were by the end of it, so how were they able to thrive and evolve under the ice? There must also have been early marine plants under the ice (there were none on land), so how did they survive?   The main evidence for this glaciation is apparent glacial markings on rocks in S.Africa and Australia, Couldn't there be other explanations for these apparent glacier tracks, apart from Snowball Earth? For example, Australia may have been closer to the S.Pole then, and some of the locations where evidence of glaciers was found might have been much higher above sea level than they are today. "

1167,Relationship between sediment concentration of flow and erosion - streampower equation,"I am trying to understand how the sediment concentration of a flow affects erosion.  I stumbled across this paper by Bagnold (1968) today that uses a form for the stream power equation that I had not seen before, and haven't yet managed to find anywhere else.  Namely:  \Omega = Q g S [\rho + C (\sigma - \rho)]  where \Omega is the streampower, Q volumetric flux of the flow, g is gravity, S slope, \rho is the density of the flow, C is the volumetric sediment concentration of the flow, and \sigma is the density of the sediment.  This implies that the Stream power increases with increasing sediment concentration.  I do not understand why this would be the case.  I also haven't yet been able to find this relationship anywhere else to give me more context.  My (rather uninformed) intuition was that erosion would decrease as the flow is carrying more sediment - basically because at some point there has to be a limit to how much sediment a flow can carry and it's still a flowing river/stream etc.  But if streampower increases with increased sediment then I would expect that erosion would also increase (since that is driven by streampower), which is quite a feedback loop (although obviously deposition would also increase so it's not a simple one).  Can anyone explain what is happening here? Or point me to resources that will help clear up my confusion?  I suspect I'm missing something basic, but not sure. "
1168,What are these underwater structures near 6°N 85°55'W,"While google earth-researching the sea floor near Malpelo and Cocos Islands (Colombian and Costa Rican Pacific Ocean), I came along these strangely geometrical structures in the sea floor, located around 6°N, 85°55'W. I'm fascinated with the look and the geometric perfection they have, and have waited to ask this question for about 3 years, until today that I realized there's a Stack Exchange site dedicated to earth sciences (I'm not an earth scientist, just a maps enthusiast).    At first I thought they could be due to the path the satellite was traveling at the moment the image was captured, but then I realized there are depth differences in excess of 300m. I find the paralelism of the lines that form the ""beams"" surprisingly perfect, and the width of the ""elements"" very consistent (about 7 to 8km, according to google earth's ruler). Near 6°22'N 85°45'W there's a circular ""dent"" of about 4 [tex] that is very perfect regarding ovality.  I found something similar about 670km NE from there, around 11°10'N 82°41'W (160km SW from San Andres Islands, in the Colombian Caribbean). While the structure here is less complex (there's only one ""beam"" and a concentric circular structure), the width of the ""beam"" (6km) seems similar to the one near Cocos (the depth differences range between 300 and 500m from the structures to the normal sea floor).    What are these things?   Are they glitches in the images from the satellite, that coincidentially look like beams? If so, why are depth differences so significative?  Are they rocks or some other kind of geological formations? How did they get that shape, and where else cand I find more similar? "
1169,What topics are we least knowledgeable about within the fields of sustainable agriculture/aquaculture and biodiversity?,"There was a story on slashdot today [website]  In 2006, a Columbia University neuroscientist named Stuart J. Firestein, began teaching a course on scientific ignorance after realizing, to his horror, that many of his students might have believed that we understand nearly everything about the brain. ""This crucial element in science was being left out for the students,"" says Firestein.""The undone part of science that gets us into the lab early and keeps us there late, the thing that ""turns your crank,"" the very driving force of science, the exhilaration of the unknown, all this is missing from our classrooms. In short, we are failing to teach the ignorance, the most critical part of the whole operation."" The time has come to ""view ignorance as 'regular' rather than deviant,"" argue sociologists Matthias Gross and Linsey McGoey. Our students will be more curious — and more intelligently so — if, in addition to facts, they were equipped with theories of ignorance as well as theories of knowledge.   What don't we know about sustainable agriculture/aquaculture and  biodiversity?  Specifically, what topics within these disciplines offer the most opportunity for new research that could significantly change our understanding of the processes involved?  I am interested in unanswered questions, conundrums, and significant discoveries whose potential impacts have yet to be fully realized in mainstream knowledge. "

In the article and video, created from information from NASA it seems, it states that over the last 23 years sea level has risen in some areas and fallen in others.  Now, whilst I am aware that the level of water will vary with tides, how can the general sea level fall in some areas whilst it rises in others?   Surely if I add 9999 million gallons of water to the oceans, then the water level of the whole world should raise by the same amount everywhere?

For example, Mt Everest would no longer be 8,848 metres above sea level. Is there a more stable universal way to measure elevation such as on other celestial objects?  I know that zero altitude on Mars is defined as a specific atmospheric pressure of 610.5 Pascals, about six millibars which is the triple point of water on Mars, where it can exist as gas, liquid or solid.  The zero elevation point of the Moon is the average diameter since it has no atmosphere. So perhaps this is the most universal method to measure elevation? "

The answer mentioned in duplicate-suggestion-question are related to   vertical wind shear.       Plus, my question is which of the following four options would you   pick and why and why not others.   This was an MCQ in a recent exam, with only one option being correct:   Sea surface temperature are low. Inter-tropical Convergence Zone seldom occurs. Coriolis force is too weak. Absence of land in those regions.   I have doubts as:  Sea surface temp are a tad bit lower in those regions. Also, the ITCZ seldom crosses southwards. (Am I wrong?)  Coriolis force is good in 5 degrees to 30-40 degrees. (I think)  Since, there can be only one option true, which one is true? "

Did the consecutive polar vortex years from all this global weirding make the bay's winters colder? It was near-record cold as late as ~2/20/15 here but I'm 10-20° south of the bay, I don't know if the cooling effect of the wavy polar vortex extends that far north. It certainly makes the North Arctic warmer. "
1179,Time relativity relating to Carbon dating?,"Theoretically if in early years the earth was moving at an astronomically different pace (whether in orbit or rotation, whatever sounds better) wouldn't that alter the science of carbon dating? As I understand time relativity, If the speed at which the earth was moving changes, the elements and organisms there-in would experience time at a different rate.  Would we not expect that carbon would decay faster?  I know it's just theory but I'd like to know if this theory could be proven false. And is there any existing research that you are aware of that would support or debunk this theory? "
1180,Does the Sun's oscillation affect Earth's climate?,"Today, discourse on climate change seemingly tends to focus on earthly elements such as pollution and human activity. While I am certainly not well-read on climate change research, after inspiration from a physics teacher's example of a baseball bat's center of gravity, and from reading this Stack Exchange post, I was curious about how the Sun's oscillation might play into our planet's entire climate activity. Have scientists even considered this information in determining the cause of climate change? Due to its elliptical orbit, Earth's distance from the sun changes, but wouldn't the Sun's oscillation affect what parameters this distance shall be over time? "
1181,Have two hurricanes ever merged? And what was the result?,"I was just reading this about how Hurricane Ethel could have merged with Hurricane Dora in 1964.  Has such a merge ever happened before in history? If so, what was the result? Would storms become twice as powerful? Or would they disrupt and dissipate each other?  They don't have to be hurricanes or typhoons per se, just large storms. I would think the low pressure regions of two storms would tend to attract each other if they were nearby, but it's apparently rare or unheard of because a quick google search showed nothing. "
1182,Can volcanos change the climate?,"I have heard politicians claiming that volcanoes are the sole cause of global warming and using so called ""NASA data"" to show that the Earth is actually cooling instead of warming.   While the nature of this site is for specific questions and not for political debate, we all know from the Year Without a Summer that volcanic gases can impact the weather severely making it very cold or hot.   My question is this:  Can a volcanic eruption, either a single or multiple explosions, be the sole cause of global warming at the planetary scale? Can volcanoes really change the climate so fast, relative to the geological timescale, that they produce the abnormal levels that we see today?   I'm aware of the year without summer, but that ended in a nanosecond, geologically speaking.  "
1183,How should I start studying about 'successful transitions in post-drought economies'?,"Accept my apologies for weak formulation of my question. I do not have any background in environmental sciences, but since recently a lot of coverage in the media has been devoted to future droughts in Iran and their socio-economical effects, I got curious enough to investigate the depth of the matter. My main question is that when a drought in a region plagues an agriculture-based economy, what are the options for a fast and flexible transition in the economy of that region? By transition, I mainly mean providing a new source of income for the individuals, such that the drought does not translate to unemployment and/or relocation of people.   I assume that this has been studied, and maybe best practices already exist. However, since I'm not even remotely familiar with environment science, I don't even know which keywords I should search for.   Is there a dedicated field of research investigating this question? Is there a definitive book on this topic? It looks like a question on which a UN-related organization has already published some reports. If I want to find these hypothetical reports, what should I exactly search for?  "
1184,How can this fountain of (hot?) water coming out of the Earth arise?,"In this video from min. 7:00 is after digging in the Earth a fountain created of water. Is this due to the pressure of the water in the Earth, if so how did it get there and how did it get such a high pressure?  [website]"

Pressure gradient Temperature gradient   Examples would be nice; however, not necessary.  Thanks "
1186,What is that spooky humming sound heard in earthquake footages?,"In most of the earthquake footages filmed outside during the earthquake that hit Mexico City on September 9, 2017 there was a distinctive streak of hum in rapid succession that could be heard in the background. It sounded like someone is constantly hitting the tuning forks onto a light tower like 2 times per second.  You can find numerous footages on youtube, but I picked one and fetched the audio portion covering the hums, you can listen to the audio at this link here (sorry I did not know how to upload an audio to SE).  Here is the waveform of the sound    What is that sound? What is causing this sound? If this was buildings or surrounding objects, why is there a pattern? Why is this sound heard in every footage no matter where they are filmed as long as they were filmed outside. "
1187,Centrifugal Force in the Navier Stokes Equations,"The Navier-Stokes equations are a set of nonlinear differential equations that diagnose wind speed and direction. They are (approximately) expressed as [tex]Where [tex], [tex] is the coriolis parameter, [tex] is density, [tex] is pressure, [tex] is gravity, [tex] is the kinematic viscosity, and [tex] is the wind vector.  In synoptic meteorology, it is taught that in jet streaks, the curvature of the jet streak influences the acceleration by the centrifugal force. However, in the equation above, I see no centrifugal component.  Is curvature-based centrifugal motion simply missing, or is it hidden? If it is missing, how would it be expressed (in Cartesian coordinates)? If it is hidden, in which term is it hiding? Could we decompose it into centrifugal and non-centrifugal acceleration? A derivation of cyclostrophic would be sufficient, since it will explicitly say from what part of the equation is curvature. "
1188,How different can microclimates be than their surrounding areas?,"How much different in temperature and pressure can a microclimate be than the surrounding region?  In other words, if you had a dry region but then a valley within a ring of mountains that isolated the local environment could the valley have distinctly different humidity, temperature and pressure and how far much different could it get?   "
1189,Was the Earth's sea-level significantly lower in ancient times?,"A lot of times, ancient artifacts or even whole ancient civilizations are found buried very deep into the ground surface of the earth.  Entire civilizations that had high buildings have been found many meters below the earth.  Does that mean the earth's sea-level was much lower than it is now? If this is true, then are we experiencing a lower level of gravity?  How can just sedimentation of sand, bury big building to such depths?  If lack of habitation by humans eventually results in burying of things, then what about the places like Chernobyl, which has not been inhabited for a long time?  I am not a physics grad or anything, just a curious guy.  Any help is much appreciated. "
1190,Where is the hot air for Australia's record spring heatwave coming from?,"Spring/September temperature records on Australia's East coast are set to tumble in the coming days, due to a heatwave, as described here.  So the hot air is being pulled from the interior of the continent to the coast. That makes sense. But some of the towns in the interior of the country are setting temperature records as well. So what is the explanation for why the air in the interior is the hottest on record? What is the ultimate cause of the hot air? "
1191,"Is there a measure for the ""dominance"" of a city's population?","since there are topological isolation as well as prominence as measures to describe how ""dominant"" a summit is in comparison to the ones surrounding it, I was thinking about a similar measure to describe the dominance of a city in terms of population.  This would be a nice asset for an automatic map labeling system which labels cities on a map, omitting suburbs of a bigger city right next to them and featuring smaller towns which are the biggest cities in a certain radius, though.  I can think of it as a function which takes the population of a city and the distance to the next more populous city and generates some kind of ""dominance score"". The higher it is, the more likely it is to be featured on a map.  So are there already any algorithms covering this? Or maybe just ""best practices"" I can use? "
1192,How are giant sinkholes filled up?,"There are a few impressive photographs of giant sinkholes that appeared in cities, such as this one:    However, followup information (e.g. Guatemalan sinkhole) or photographs on how these kind of sinkholes are filled up is hard to find. What approaches may be taken to ""repair"" or filling up these?  If dumping more earth or materials into them is ineffective due to underground-water, how can they be covered up properly without causing another collapse? "
1193,Does a table summarizing basic details of significant operational weather models exist?,"With all the questions we've had through the years that have tied into weather models, plus all the sites around the web providing weather model data, it got me wondering: is there any table that summarizes the basic details of the major weather models?  Details like calculation methods, spatial resolution, calculation timestep, vertical grid type, regions covered, parameterizations, run hours (and when the output is typically available), operating organizations, perhaps even some basic skill scores.  It would seem such a link would be useful in answering many questions, and be of use to many in trying to better understand how the models work or perform.  I'd think the obvious spot would be Wikipedia, as they seem to have similar collaborative lists for all sorts of useful things, but all I found was the very limited list on the models page.  Likewise searched AMS Journals for NWP summary and similar terms to no avail.  Does such a resource exist!?! "
1194,Guinea Current existence in the Atlantic,Why does the Guinea Current exist at all?  There are no similar currents in the Pacific or Indian Oceans and the Guinea Current also disappear during northern summers.  Why? 
1195,Why does the intensity of sunlight depend on your latitude?,"People at the equator get to bask in more sunlight than Santa Clause and other inhabitants of the arctic regions. Not quite as pronounced, but they get more than me too.  Why is the sunlight more intense closer to the equator and less intense farther away from it?  When I posted this question, I was not thinking about the possible ambiguities, such as ""Are you talking about the exposure across a surface area with some non-perpendicular angle to the sun,"" or ""Are you talking about the light gathered by an optic facing the sun?"" There is a difference. Since ""basking in sunlight"" was the example use case, let us assume exposure across a surface area which is lying on the ground. "
1196,Percentage of dry land surface with sea level elevation lower than 1 km,"Being this my first questions on this .SE I hope that the topic is appropriate.  I've been told that 99% of the living species on earth live in between -200m and 800m above sea level, this made me just wonder how much of earth surface lies in this elevation span, but I couldn't find the answer googling.   1) Does anybody have a source to check what percentage of dry land has sea level elevation lower than 1 km (or 800m, or in between -200m and 800m...)?  2) How should I interpret the information given to me about the number of living species? I would just say for the 99% of the living species the intersection between the ""natural habitat"" and the altitude ""-200m - 800m"" is non empty, is it correct? Is there a source where I can check this information?  Thanks in advance!! "
1197,How good were climate models of the 1990s at predicting the global temperature trends of the 2000s/2010s?,Was there a significant bias between the ensemble of climate models and the long-term temperature trends?  What about spatial patterns? 
1198,Are ice-ages dependent on an un-equal distribution of land-masses?,"Having read this answer about the precession of the equinoxes and how it affects Earth's climate, my understanding was that only because of the differing affect of continental and maritime insolation that precession of the equinoxes was a factor in ice-sheet growth.   So if all the continents magically switched to be reflected in the equator (i.e. now we have a Southern Hemisphere dominated by continents), would we now have ice-ages at the 'opposite' time (i.e. short SOUTHERN hemisphere summers)?   And if all the continents moved to be equally spread out about the globe, precession of the equinoxes would play no factor in the ice-ages at all?   In addition:   What is the mechanism that causes this effect? i.e. Why do continents determine the ice growth, and not the oceans? The response in the previous question that: ""Continents show more seasonal variability"" is a little vague.  "

1201,Why do some planets have lots of $\mathrm{N_2}$ and others none?,"Earth, Titan and Venus all have large amounts of [tex] in their atmospheres. (In the case of Venus it's a small proportion, but Venus' atmosphere is very thick, and the total mass of [tex] is greater than Earth's.) However, other planets and moons, and Mars in particular, have hardly any. Why is this?   [tex] is a relatively light molecule, so I suppose it could be lost to space from smaller bodies. Did Mars start with a thick nitrogen atmosphere and then lose it? Or alternatively, is there some process that produced lots of [tex] on Earth, Titan and Venus, which didn't occur on Mars or the other outer Solar system moons? If so, what is this process likely to be? "

1205,Is the urban heat island effect stronger during a particular season or part of the year?,"It is known that cities tend to be warmer than the surrounding landscapes, and this is known as the ""urban heat island effect"".   In the summer there is greater heat output from air conditioning systems. In the winter there is greater heat output from heating systems (heat pumps aside). Are these a substantial contributor to the effect, or are there other causes?  Summary of question: What are the causes of the urban heat island effect, and are there specific times of the year when the effect is stronger? "
1206,How to determine how long ago a rock was broken?,"I know that there are techniques that help scientists determine the age of a rock.

1207,"How has the relative ratio of igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks changed over Earth's history?","Has the relative ratio of sedimentary over igneous rocks increased, simply as a result of more and more of the Earth's rock being exposed to sedimentary processes?

1208,Is there geological evidence that the moon once collided with the Earth?,"I've seen models in astronomy that show how the Earth-Moon system must have come together after a collision.

Is there geological (or other physical) evidence here on Earth that confirms the moon originated from a collision on Earth?  If so what is that evidence? "
1209,Do fluctuations in radioactive isotope decay rates affect carbon dating techniques?,"In 2010, Purdue University published a research paper[1] stating that their researchers had detected slight fluctuations in radioactive isotope decay rates ""in synch with the rotation of the sun's core."" The article also stated:     The team has not yet examined isotopes used in medical radiation treatments or for dating of ancient artifacts.

Are the fluctuations large enough to call into question currently accepted geological dates?   [website]"
1210,How are CO2 emission effects and high altitude effects of air travel compared to each other?,"The climate impact of air travel is often divided into CO2 emissions and ""high altitude effects"" like that of water vapour and cloud formation. The effect of the emitted CO2 is cummulative, as CO2 has a high retention time in the atmosphere. On the other hand, as I have understood it, the high altitude effects are more short lived. Their impact on temperature are determed by current levels of air travel, and not past.  How can the size of these two effects be compared to each other or to other sectors such as travel by car? Is there any videly accepted method for this? It seems a bit like apples and oranges to me.  I know about GWP, that uses a somewhat arbitrary timeframe of 100 years. Is and can that be used here? I have also heard about RFI, but I am unsure how that works or is applied to this. "
1211,How Can We Establish Precisely What Earth's Core is Made Of?,"The consensus view is that that the Earths core is composed mainly of iron alloyed with about 10 percent nickel and traces of other heavy metals, but I have seen at least one account which says it is partly iron sulphide. Has the iron sulphide theory been discredited, or is it a view still held by some geologists? There is a recent theory that about 5 percent of the core is composed of silicon. How valid is this, and will we ever be able to establish more precisely what the core is made of? "

If so what is an example of a regional scale forcing mechanism?  "
1213,Are sand deserts the greatest natural convection heaters on Earth?,"Ask any climate scientist the question:  ""Why are deserts so hot in the day time and so cold at night"" and generally you will get the same answer, it’s all about the lack of moisture and latent heat and the greenhouse gas effect.  Consider however for example, a simple household convection heater that uses the principles of:  a radiator, conduction and convection to warm a house.  The radiator fins greatly increase the surface area of the heat source to significantly increase the conduction of heat to the air and the basic concept of convection circulated the warm air upward.  Very efficient, and control is simply to turn the element on and off with a thermostat.  A less used method of control however, but still effective, is simply  to block the fins so conduction and convection is reduced.  Enter Mother Nature, with sand deserts covering vast surfaces of the earth.  Any geologist will tell you that Aeolian sand deposits can have porosities upwards of over 45%, permeability is unlimited and finally the surface area of the sand grains (on and below the surface) for heat conduction is hundreds of times greater than just a flat non porous surface.  The Sahara Desert covers 3.5 million square miles of  Aeolian sand deposits.  The sun supplies the heat to the sand both at the surface and below (surface conduction grain to grain), the sand grains are the radiator fins that conduct heat to the air and finally convection looks after the rest.  Shut off the sun every night and the sand cools very quickly because of the increased conduction and convection soon replaces the hot air with cold.  Most of Europe right now is experiencing a massive heat wave coming from the Sahara Desert to the south and of course blames global warming.  The question is ""Are Sand Deserts The Greatest Natural Convection Heaters On Earth"" and can we control them?  We cannot control the sun, but can we not close some of the fins on these ""desert convection heaters"", perhaps by sealing some of the surfaces of the desert sands with tarps or liquid sealers?  Anything that stops the convection will reduce the heat output.  Has Mother Nature in the past, been playing with the Earth's thermostat simply by reducing and increasing the size of our great deserts? "

1216,What is the ratio of energy absorbed by atmospheric CO2 from IR coming from the Earth vs directly from the Sun,"I'm trying to understand the atmospheric greenhouse effect. If CO2 absorbs lots of IR radiation emitted from the Earth's surface, does it not also shield the same wavelength radiation that is coming from the sun? Would this shielding not have a 'cooling' effect. Does CO2 block incoming IR from the sun?

1219,Beta plane approximation: variation of Coriolis parameter,The Beta plane approximation put me in confusion.  Beta plane approximation explain me how the Coriolis parameter changes with latitude.  Beta parameter changes with the cos(latitude) but this is refers to the equator or my latitude (arbitrary point)?  If i go southward latitude decrease so cos(latitude) is max at the equator but the Coriolis parameter is usually minimum at the equator. I made confusion with their relationship.  Beta plane approximation is related at the Beta effect or is it the same? I don't understand its implication on the westward intensification.  Thank you in advance. 
1220,Atmospheric conditions needed that blocks all bright light during sunsets and allows you to stare directly at the sun,"Today (July 5th, 2019 just before 8 pm KST), along the Han River in Seoul, the surface of the sun could be viewed with my naked eye (no protection needed), and this was safe on the eyes. It appeared much redder and it wasn't bright at all. Also, there was no visible ""fog"" that blocked the view of the sun in my vicinity.  I am curious about the conditions needed to create this phenomenon A possible use-case of an answer could mean the possibility to better predict when I should go view the sunset over the Han River in Seoul. It's beautiful!  Past Related Topics  Why can I look directly at the sun during a sunset but not at noon?  This is different from my question as, while you can still look at it, it is still slightly harmful to your eyes. It can still create some visual artifacts in your vision after you stop staring for even a few seconds.  The sun I saw today at sunset was not bright at all. You could stare at the sun for minutes, tens of minutes, etc without any visual impairments. Also, the sun was red in color.   There appears to be at least one more additional condition needed to produce the visual I saw today.  My Thoughts  Just to be clear, this seems to go beyond the physics of the standard sunset. To me, there seem to be 3 atmospheric conditions that are playing their part in this phenomenon. The first 2 will give you the standard sunset with its beautiful colors.    Rayleigh Scattering. The longer distance light travels along the Horizon.   This enhances Rayleigh Scattering and gives the colors of the sunset.  ???   Either this enhances Rayleigh Scattering more along the horizon (enhances #2) Or it's a separate phenomenon completely   When combined with #1 and #2, allows people to view the surface of the sun without protection!     More Background Information   I have seen this phenomenon a few times before in Seoul.    Phenomenon never occurred in the US in my hometown for me   Hometown is farther north than Seoul.  Harbin, China would be a similar latitude.   I have never seen this phenomenon during the winter.   It's possible it has happened, but I didn't see it! It's only occurred in the Spring and Summer for me.  While the afternoon was thicker in air pollution, I believe around sunset the air pollution nearby was much more clear.   Around this time (if UTC conversion were correct), there was a thicker air pollution mass around China and the northern part of the Yellow Sea.   Sun sets in the West, and any air conditions to the west could affect the sunset. Is that in line-of-sight? Did the air pollution reach higher in the atmosphere around China? With line-of-sight, that would be around 10 - 60km in the air over the Yellow Sea and China.     Analysis  With #1 and #2 directly above, the longer distance that light travels along the horizon during (1) the sunset and (2) the winter in the Northern Hemisphere doesn't seem to play a big part. Otherwise, I should see this a lot in the winter around sunset. I don't, and I never have.   Can air pollution be clear nearby, yet block all the bright light rays farther away?  Photo  Here is a photo that can help show the conditions that were present at the time.  Please note that the sun appears much brighter in this picture than it was in-person. The sun was actually really dull red. As you can see, there were clouds, but I am trying to find maps that show the cloud coverage around that time, as I don't believe it was thick.   "
1221,How does agriculture release so much greenhouse gas?,"I recently came over some numbers of GHGs released per energy in food produced, and the result is pretty flooring. I can see how animal-based food production is quite inefficient so let's ignore that for now and just look at plants.  For example rice releases 2 kg carbon =  7.6 kg CO2-equivalents per 1000 kcal. This would actually mean that it is more environmentally friendly to drive a car 10 km than to bike 10 km on a rice-based diet, because biking burns around 300 kcal = ~2.28 kg CO2e, while a normal compact car burns 0.5 liters of gasoline = ~1.9  kg CO2e. Are my numbers wrong? If not, how can this be? "
1222,How does jetstreams lead to formation of heat waves in Europe?,"Jetstreams move at an altitude of roughly 6-9km above the sea level. Since, it is moving at such a great altitude how could it have possible impacts on the land? And how will jetstreams that flow at such a high altitude cause heat waves in regions below it? "
1223,What would the weather patterns on Earth really be like if Earth were tidally locked to the sun?,"This question is different from How would weather change on a tidally-locked terrestrial planet?. None of its answers answer my question. I think it's answer might even have wrong information as I will describe later.  I don't even know very many details of the actual weather patterns on Earth. I would like an answer with a long detailed description of what the whether patterns would be that I can actually understand even if I don't read anything before I read the answer, but not really super long. I would like a summary of what could happen that explains it in a way I can understand. It might be useful because then it will help researchers research whether to look for an Earth like planet in the habitable zone that's tidally locked to its star.  For example, would Earth have any severe weather patterns like a hurricane? According to the YouTube video What If the Earth Was Tidally Locked to the Sun?, the pressure on the day side would be a lot lower than the pressure on the night side and create a huge fast storm. I want to know if the pressure difference would really be anything like as big as the pressure difference between the air outside a hurricane and the air in its center. If the answer is yes, does that mean there would be a storm a lot bigger than a hurricane with winds comparable to those of a hurricane? I suspect the answer is no. Earth is a lot bigger than a hurricane so the rate of change of pressure with respect to position would be a lot lower but there's also resistance to the movement of air so I think the wind speed caused by the differential heating between the center of the day side and the edge of the day side would be low. According to this answer, there would be vigorous storms at the edge of the day side. I believe that's incorrect because the edge of the day side is actually only receiving a tiny amount of sunlight per surface area.  Maybe there would be some differential heating of the ocean over much smaller distances than the size of Earth and the differential heating would cause clouds to form over the parts that are heated less by the sun and the clouds would in turn reinforce the differential heating of the ocean over short distances but I think with Earth's much slower rotation rate, the Coriolis force would be much weaker so no hurricanes would form by that process.

1227,Equator and Hours of Daylight,"Since the equator is closest to the sun, would it have more daylight hours compared to, say, the Tropic of Cancer?  I am using an example, however, would it be true if the farther one is from the equator, the less daylight hours? "
1228,Does organic decay release the same CO2 as burning?,"Does a fallen tree left to decay release essentially all of its stored carbon as CO2 to the atmosphere? Or is the carbon uptaken by termites and bacteria, preventing its release to the atmosphere? "
1229,Sun's Highest Point on June 21,"Where would you have to be for the sun to be highest overhead at noon on June 21?  Since the rays of the Sun are perpendicular to the Tropic of Cancer on June 21, shouldn't the Sun be overhead in this location at noon?  "
1230,Terrestrial Day vs. Venusian Day: Why the Huge Time Difference?,"The diameters of Venus (7,520.8 miles) and Earth (7,917.5 miles) are comparable, but the disparity of the length of the day for each planet - as expressed in terrestrial hours - is enormous; a day on Venus lasts 2802 hours vs. an Earth day lasting 24 hours (its 116.750 times that of Earth).  How can there be such a great difference when the size of the two planets is nearly the same? Does the fact that Venus’ rotation is retrograde to all of the other planets in our solar system affect the length of it's day?  "
1231,"Pangaea, supercontinent formation and fragmentation","Is there a widely accepted model for the supercontinent cycles ?  From the novice point of view, it is not obvious why the continents would be fragmented all over the earth as now, but 300 millions years ago it was the opposite, they were assembled into one single supercontinent : the Pangaea.  Also this list of supercontinents suggests it never stopped oscillating between fragmented and concentrated during earth's history, so that on the long term, the continents don't appear following a random law for their relative position (as the plate tectonics driving forces model would suggest).  So is there an explanation for that, or is it mainly observational with no trustful model behind this oscillation of the lands concentration, from one extremum to the other ? "
1232,The higher value range for the same satellite product (NO2_OMI_TEMIS),"I'm dealing with NO2 column density of troposphere, and my data source is TEMIS.   The NO2 level3 data can be derived from the original information of OMI instrument.    I have downloaded two types of data, .grd and .kml for the same month.   The data I have downloaded are uploaded here1, 2   KML data  I open it in Google Earth, the figure shows like this:         We can see the data range of NO2 trop. column is 0~20 which are idential to the templete figure on the website.   GRD data  I have not found any detailed information about this data.  In the contents of it, -999 is deemed as no_data place.    I use python to read and plot the spatial distribution.   filename  = './CH2O-NO2/no2_201306.grd' def read_grd(filename):     ncols     = np.array(linecache.getline(filename, 1)[6:10]).astype(float)     nrows     = np.array(linecache.getline(filename, 2)[6:10]).astype(float)     xllcorner = np.array(linecache.getline(filename, 3)[10:14]).astype(float)     yllcorner = np.array(linecache.getline(filename, 4)[10:14]).astype(float)     cellsize  = np.array(linecache.getline(filename, 5)[9:14]).astype(float)     nan_value = np.array(linecache.getline(filename, 6)[13:17]).astype(float)     longitude = xllcorner + cellsize * np.arange(ncols)     latitude = yllcorner + cellsize * np.arange(nrows)     value = np.loadtxt(filename, skiprows=7)     value = value[::-1]     return value, longitude, latitude, nan_value  no2,lon_no2, lat_no2, nan_value = read_grd(filename) no2[no2 == nan_value] = np.nan  def isnt_NaN(num):     return num == num  no2[isnt_NaN(no2)].max() &gt; 9999.0      It seems that the high value in grd format data are out of the regular condition which can be learned from previous resarch (Hot spots of NO2 column are about 15~20 10^15 molec/cm2).

1233,Lack of annual slash-and-burn in North America?,"In many areas of South America, Africa, India and Southeast Asia, ""slash-and-burn"" agriculture is employed whereby every year the stubble from the previous year is burned along with other live cuttings.  In North America, this does not seem to have ever happened. It is true that in New England (where I am from) the old-time farmers cut down all the trees and burned them to get pot ash, but this seems to have been a one time event. Once land was cleared of trees, it was not burned over and over again. Also, in many cases land was cleared without burning at all, the trees and stumps simply being hauled away.  Is there some difference in climate that results in tropical areas being subjected to repeated annual burnings whereas lands in North America are not? What causes the difference? "
1234,On what authority are carbon credits issued?,"Carbon Credits are a weird thing. Businesses can buy and sell them, and having enough carbon credits to offset your CO2 output suddenly makes you a Green Business. That being said, who issues Carbon Credits, and on what authority? Is a Carbon Credit a promise to remove an amount of CO2 from the atmosphere?   Last I checked that was a massively expensive technology still in it's infancy, but Carbon Credits have been around for quite some time.  Does it work like a Futures market (""When the tech becomes available I promise to remove 30 bln tons of C02"")? "
1235,"How do they know the 2016 Kaikoura (NZ) Earthquake was 'complex', involved six different faults?","The BBC news article New Zealand quake: The geological impact of a 'complex' tremor says:     The powerful earthquakes which hit New Zealand were some of the most complex ever recorded, say scientists.      Most earthquakes are the result of rupture on a single fault plane. But the twin quakes led to the rupture of at least six faults, including a newly identified one at Waipapa Bay.   The article describes several resulting changes after the 7.8 magnitude 2016 Kaikoura earthquake, including seabeds raised above the surface, a dangerous 150m-high landslide dam has formed on the Hapuku River, and a town completely cut-off by landslides:     Kaikoura itself was completely cut off by landslides. About 1,000 tourists and locals have been evacuated by sea from the small town...   The image below is one of several from the article.  It's hard for me to understand what happened. It seems there were actually two distinct major earthquakes in rapid succession, and a lot of other motion and changes in nearby related faults. Was seismic data alone used to reach this conclusion, or is it a complex analysis of seismic, satellite, and ground-truth data used to ""reconstruct"" what actually happened? Is there some more technical description of the analysis available?   "
1236,Elevation of Atmosphere differ?,Does the atmosphere depth (or how high the air molecules from the ground) of Earth or Mars differ gradually or can there be plumes of atmosphere that reaches into space?

1238,Where'd Summer go?,"So I live in Texas, and it get awfully hot in the summer- like 37°C hot- and yet, when winter rolls around, it can get down to 4° or 5° pretty easily. So, my limited understanding or weather and stuff doesn't understand one thing. Where'd all that heat go? It was so hot in summer but it'll disappear in a week. I know cold is just the absence of heat, so the heat must've gone somewhere, right? "
1239,How will climate change affect planetary waves?,"You can see planetary/rossby waves in the meanders of the jet stream. In short: If an air parcel moves from warm subtropics towards the pole, it will deviate toward the east due to conservation of angular momentum (movement towards the equator will lead to deviation toward the west). That results in a meandering motion.   How will climate change affect planetary wave activity and zonal wavenumber? Does polar amplification reduce planetary activity because of a smaller temperature gradient between subtropics and polar region? Will cooling of the stratosphere influence planetary waves as well? "

1242,Does the global temperature vary daily (hotter and colder days)?,"Earth's current average global temperature (i.e. including hot deserts and cold polar caps) is reported be somewhere between 14°C and 16°C (depending on sources and methods).  This temperature varies on a long-term basis due to climate change.  But does it also vary (substantially) on a daily basis ? I.e. are there hotter and colder days (worldwide) ? Or is it exactly the opposite, namely a zero-sum game: A hotter-than-average day in – say – Australia inevitably goes along with a colder-than-usual day somewhere else on the planet to make up for the difference, so that the global temperature stays the same from one day to the next (because energy is not created but only transferred from one region to another) ?  As an example, below are the relative temperatures (i.e. colder/hotter than expected/average) for 3 Feb 2014. Would the hotter and colder temperature regions balance out (compensate one another), so that the global temperature on 3 feb 2014 is the same as on 2 feb 2014 and 4 feb 2014 ?   source: [website](Please note: The image doesn't exactly illustrate my question, because it doesn't depict the air temperature difference between 3 Feb 2014 and the previous day, but between 3 Feb 2014 and the average for [3 Feb, I assume] 1979-2000. So due to global warming, 3 Feb 2014 was obviously warmer than 3 Feb in previous decades – by 0.45°C to be precise, as the sum of northern hemisphere + southern hemisphere = -0.01°C + 0.45°C = +0.45 °C. But my question is not about global warming or long term trends, but daily variations. I just couldn't find a similar heat map depicting temperature differences between one day and the next, so I just took this image for illustration purposes, although it doesn't perfectly relate to the question asked.).         As Earth surface temperatures don't necessarily  correspond to the air temperature (see below), please distinguish both cases in your answer, i.e.:     Can global average Earth surface temperature vary from one day to the next ? Can global average air temperature vary from one day to the next ?

The best answer would include a diagram or table of global average air and Earth surface temperatures for any given month, since this couldn't be argued with.

1243,Would a Biorock formed buiding be suitable for ocean floor research?,"Electrodeposition of dissolved minerals in seawater has been used to make coral reef repairs for quite some time. WOLF H. HILBERTZ patented the process and trademarked the name Biorock. I do not have access to IEEE, so I have only been able to read a small portion of this paper: [website][website]The author of the article maintained that this process can build a seawall at a third of the cost of concrete, and it was suitable for building underwater constructions. I have only found references to using this process for repairing coral reefs, but none for construction purposes.  If the lower cost and material strength claims are valid, it would seem that this process would make it dramatically cheaper to build buildings at depth that could be used to make oceanic research facilities.  Is this a feasible approach to build ocean floor facilities for research or commercial purposes? Does the material formed have low enough porosity to be used as a building exterior wall? "

1251,Geological feature - what is it?," Hello,  We were walking in Bundoran in Donegal County, Ireland today and we encountered the geological feature shown in the picture (from above from cliffs and from very close up at beach level). We have three questions about it?   How would you call it? It looks to me like the tall rocks on the sides are sea stacks but isn’t the eroded bit in the middle more like a sea stump? Or are they something different altogether? What type of rock is it (in the close-up pics) Our guess is that it is shale, but it could also be limestone. Which one do you think it is? Please notice the ubiquitous fossils in the close-ups. Are we correct to think they are crinoids?

1254,The apparent path of the sun,"An American College Test sample question asks:     Based on the shadow directions in these experiments, which of the following best describes the difference between the apparent path of the Sun as seen from the observation points in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres?   A. The Sun travels a more southerly path in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern Hemisphere.  B. The Sun travels a more northerly path in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern Hemisphere.  C. The Sun rises in the East and sets in the West in the Northern Hemisphere, but the opposite is true in the Southern Hemisphere.  D. The Sun rises in the West and sets in the East in the Northern Hemisphere, but the opposite is true in the Southern Hemisphere.  I've read the explanation for B several times. I don't understand the meaning of ""traveling a more northerly path"" in the southern hemisphere. Does the alignment of the compass and the shadow show the reverse direction in which the sun is traveling? (In this case, since 9 of the 15 directions recorded pointed South, the compass directions were aligned to point North.)  "
1255,Is global warming being moderated by latent heat of melting polar ice?,"I've only had a secondary education in physics, so bear with me, but with the greenhouse effect and all, wouldn't we be much hotter already if the ice melt-rate wasn't increasing, since more (heat) energy goes toward changing state, rather than changing temperature? My understanding of latent heat is that it is the applied heat that does not result in a dramatic temperature increase, rather it is used to change state (i.e. solid ice to liquid water).  The obvious issue would be that once the ice is all melted, or it doesn't melt quick enough, we'll have proper heat problems (not just the 2 or 4 or 6 deg changes being discussed now).  Are there numbers available on this? Or is this effect nonsense? Or am I looking towards a time a few orders of magnitude beyond my years? "

1261,Paper result validation and the scientific method in earth science,"The context of this question is computational earth science specifically meteorology/climatology but I am sure it applies to all the scientific disciplines where numerical methods are used.  Recently I had asked the author of a peer reviewed paper for the software that was used in the publication of his paper. He not only  immediately provided the software but also gave me test data to verify the results of his paper. The same was done by a climate change institute affiliated to NOAA. They gave me their software and asked me to download the relevant data from the NOAA site to validate their conclusions and perhaps reuse their software for solving my problems. In both these cases the only requirement was that the software had to be cited in any paper that I publish in the future.  These two instances are not the problem. In another couple of cases when I asked the authors of the peer reviewed paper for their software to validate their work they refused claiming that is ""private"". My questions are therefore:   Which one of these two  occurrences is more common in meteorology/climatology? As somebody who is originally from a CS background (where code reviews are extremely common) I'm curious what is the current standard of reproducibility in meteorology/climatology?  "

1263,Why do winter temperatures account for most of the increase in global temperature?,"If you examine the detailed temperature records that form the basis for our understanding of global warming, there are some strange anomalies (at least from a naive point of view where warming affects everywhere equally).  For example, by far the largest temperature increases are confined to winter months in the northern hemisphere. As one commentator has it:     Winter months in the Northern Hemisphere are responsible for most of the observed land warming in CRUTEM4.  The summer months (June, July, August, September) essentially show no warming at all from 1850 to 1990. Overall,  NH winters have warmed about twice as much as  NH summers.      ...The same exercise for the southern hemisphere shows very little difference where of course the seasonal months  are inverted.   Is there a sensible explanation of this effect? Is it reproduced, for example, in climate models? "
1264,Does the regional localisation of global temperature trends suggest contamination by urban development?,"Much of the raw data behind the various datasets reporting the average temperature of the world are now available. So it is possible to look for strange patterns in the daily or monthly temperature data. The reported ""average temperature of the world"" is, ultimately, derived from these datasets by various corrections, normalisations and regional aggregations.  Recently I came across a claim that the temperature anomalies are remarkably concentrated geographically. The hypothesis suggested, tentatively, by the author (Clive Best, blog on topic here) suggested that this might reflect contamination of the raw data by rapid urbanisation. NB his argument is very different from the idea that US data is corrupted by the urban heat island effect which is addressed here: [website]He reports (my emphasis):     The anomalies from ~4000 stations all over the globe are then combined to give one  global anomaly, yielding  the familiar graph we know and love which shows ~0.6 deg.C rise since 1850. Looking in more detail however we discover that some parts of the world are not warming at all and some  are  even cooling.   His argument develops:     It immediately becomes obvious  that  the bulk of  observed warming is concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere : Eastern Europe, Russia, central Asia, India, China, Japan, Middle East, North Africa. These are all areas of rapid population increase, development and industrialisation. There is essentially no warming at all in the Southern Hemisphere. Bolivia, Peru, Paraguay and Argentina all appear to be cooling. Even Australia and Zealand are static or  cooling. The US is evenly divided and the UK shows essentially no signal at all.      ...Could much of the observed temperature rise over  the last 6 decades  be simply due to increasing urbanisation and development since ~1960 ?   Climate models don't produce even warming across the world so there could be explanations perfectly consistent with the observations of major regional differences. So my question is: does the large variation in regional temperature anomalies have a straightforward explanation in mainstream warming theory or is it a sign that some regional records are contaminated by urban development?  NB Best used the data from HADCRUT3 released by the UK Met Office, but it is also obvious in the NOAA GSOD dataset which is conveniently available to 2010 in Google's BigQuery as a sample dataset (you can also download it if you have the capacity process it).

1266,Confirmation of historical El Niño events,As this year's boreal summer monsoon draws to a close interest automatically centers around forecasts for next summer's monsoon and the likelihood of possibly another El Niño event.

I am familiar with the European medieval warming period Medieval Warming Period but my current question deals with the period from 1790 AD to 1799 AD as mentioned in the first link. It appears apart from the year 1798 all other years were El Niño years and that would appear to be a extraordinary period. My question is  Are there any references from paleoclimatology that talk of the atmosphere during that period ? Are those confirmed El Niño events ?

1268,What meteorological factors contribute to springtime Trans-Pacific air-pollution events?,"The transport of tropospheric ozone, ozone precursors, carbon monoxide, etc from Asia to North America is an active area of research (see J.L. Ambrose, et al., 2011)  These types of events occur rather dramatically in the springtime, apparently due to meteorological conditions when westerly winds are strong, which carries polluted air across the Pacific.  Stratospheric ozone events can be differentiated because they have low moisture and no associated increase in carbon monoxide.    What meteorological factors contribute to the increased transport of Asia-generated air pollution to North America? What occurs meteorologically in the springtime that leads to more westerly transport than any other season?  The analyses I've seen say that transport can occur anywhere from 2.5 km to 8 km above sea level.    Are there factors that could cause temporal or spatial shifts in how these types of pollution transport events are recepted in North America?    Image from M.

LandSAT, let's say 8, takes roughly bi-weekly images at 30m (100m resampled to 30), and those are then lumped into 32-day composites.

In other words, if you aggregated the Landsat pixels by mean, ought you to get the same value of the corresponding Modis pixel?    Probably not, right?  Could you explain why?  Is it the 16 vs 32 days?  The world changes in two weeks?  Equipment differences?  Resampling algorithms?    Are there any Modis-LandSAT pairs of data that actually would match quite closely?   "
1272,Define components of mineral assemblage?,"Given the a mineral assemblage with the minerals [tex] where cp, bn, mt are in contact, and py, cp, bn, cc are in contact.  What are the components?   I was told #components=#constituents-#reactions -#constraints but I don't know how to define constituents or constraints.  I'm not sure what the number of reactions is either.  I was trying to define constituents based on oxidation states of the metals (assuming S and O are always -2), and I got [tex] where the [tex] and the  [tex] and [tex]  As for the number of reactions, I'm confused because only one of the minerals has oxygen (so can't be part of a reaction with one of the others to produce another), and I was having a hard time balancing reactions between the others.  Can anyone give me any advice on how to figure out what the components are, and in general how I should define components, constituents, and reactions based on assemblages of minerals?  This question is based on a problem from Walther ""Essentials of Geochemistry"" here is a [Link] to the question.  Just to clarify based on the given answers, the components are cc, cp, py, and mt?

1274,Why a stratus cloud does not always reach all the way to the ground?,"The surface of the ground at night cools down because of outgoing long-wave radiation. In my understanding the cooling of the surface also causes cooling of the adjacent air. If the air contains enough water vapor, dropping of the temperature causes condensation of liquid water droplets and formation of fog.  In my region (Central Europe near 50°N) in winter, stratus clouds can be observed much more often than fog. Typically the base of the stratus cloud is 100 meters or higher above ground surface and the thickness of the stratus is several hundred meters. What puzzles me is the ""empty"" layer between the ground surface and the cloud base. Why does the stratus cloud often not reach all the way to the ground? What factors determine the stratus cloud base height? "
1275,Present results as log data,"I'm not sure if this is the right place for this question, but here goes...  I'm reviewing literature regarding effectiveness of wastewater treatment techniques. When considering faecal coliforms concentrations are generally presented in terms of most probable number per volume or per mass, typically MPN/100mL or MPN/g. Due to the scales involved these are often in scientific notation. The reduction in concentration due to treatment is then presented as a log factor, i.e. reduction from [tex] to [tex] is hence [tex].

1281,What was the density and composition of Earth's atmosphere during the Cretaceous warmest period?,"There was time during the age of dinosaurs when the polar regions were ice free.  The earth was obviously much warmer but a run-away greenhouse effect did not occur.  This was most likely because the continents were so configured that ocean currents more adequately transfered heat around the globe. And The particulate dust from volcanic activity (more active back then) accumulated in the stratosphere, reflecting solar heat and light back into space.  One reason creatures of immense size such as dinosaurs were able to evolve is the oxygen requirements for the respiration and metabolism for such massive bodies were present in the atmosphere during this period.  Similarly, the fossil record indicates vegetation size was much greater during this period than today due to the higher amount of CO2.  This atmosphere would have to have greater percentage composition of oxygen (for dinosaurs) and CO2 (for greenhouse affect and greater plant biomass) or a much denser atmosphere or both.  What was the density of the atmosphere back then either in terms of air pressure at today's sea level and standard temperature  Or In kg/square meter at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure)?  What were the percentages of O2 and CO2? "

I would be more than happy if I would be provided with an informed answer, thank you *  Impact of the Geomagnetic Field and Solar Radiation on Climate Change  V. A. Dergacheva, S. S. Vasilieva, O. M. Raspopovb, and H. Jungnerc a Ioffe Physical–Technical Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg  Pushkov Institute of Terrestrial Magnetism, Ionosphere, and Radiowave Propagation, Russian Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg cUniversity of Helsinki, Finland     Abstract—Recent studies have shown that, in addition to the role of   solar variability, past climate changes may have been connected with   variations in the Earth’s magnetic field elements at various   timescales. An analysis of variations in geomagnetic field elements,   such as field intensity, reversals, and excursions, allowed us to   establish a link between climate changes at various timescales over   the last millennia. Of particular interest are sharp changes in the   geomagnetic field intensity and short reversals of the magnetic poles   (excursions). The beginning and termination of the examined   geomagnetic excursions can be attributed to periods of climate change.   In this study, we analyzed the possible link between short-term   geomagnetic variability (jerks) and climate change, as well as the   accelerated drift of the north magnetic pole and surface temperature   variations. The results do not rule out the possibility that   geomagnetic field variations which modulate the cosmic ray flux could   have played a major role in climate change in addition to previously   induced by solar radiation.   Gyre-driven decay of the Earth’s magnetic dipole  Christopher C. Finlay1, Julien Aubert2 &amp; Nicolas Gillet3     Direct observations indicate that the magnitude of the Earth’s   magnetic axial dipole has decreased over the past 175 years; it is now   9% weaker than it was in 1840. Here we show how the rate of dipole   decay may be controlled by a planetary-scale gyre in the liquid metal   outer core. The gyre’s meridional limbs on average transport normal   polarity magnetic flux equatorward and reverse polarity flux poleward.   Asymmetry in the geomagnetic field, due to the South Atlantic Anomaly,   is essential to the proposed mechanism. We find that meridional flux   advection accounts for the majority of the dipole decay since 1840,   especially during times of rapid decline, with magnetic diffusion   making an almost steady contribution generally of smaller magnitude.   Based on the morphology of the present field, and the persistent   nature of the gyre, the current episode of dipole decay looks set to   continue, at least for the next few decades      Mid-Pliocene shifts in ocean overturning circulation and the onset of   Quaternary-style climates     M.

1283,"After days of smoky air, why is it healthier to stay inside?","A large wildfire has been burning for four days some distance from my town. The air is smoky, but not smokier than yesterday or the day before. General wisdom holds that we should all stay indoors.  As I enjoy my relative safety and indoor accommodations, I wonder why the indoor air is safer than the outdoor air. Even buildings that had 12-foot-wide (4-metre-wide) cargo doors open yesterday contain air less smoky than the outdoor air, or at least it smells that way.  Are still there fewer smoke particles per unit volume indoors? Do indoor environments trap the particles better? Why is the air safer indoors? "

1285,"Less pollution: moving hurricane debris to other regions for use, or burning?","When a big hurricane hits, it can create debris on the scale of [tex].  Cities in Florida, Texas, and other affected areas are struggling to hire enough trucks and drivers to pick it up quickly.  But aside from that, I noticed many of the areas have started to burn the debris once it starts building up.  Got to wondering... typically mulch comes in modestly pricey, and when free mulch is offered, it often goes quickly.  So assuming a fair portion of debris is mulchable and is of interest to other areas, and that we can acquire typical transportation resources, then we'll set up transfer from collection sites to those other regions rather than burning it.  What would be the net pollution result?  If removed for mulch and such: trucking pollution + decomposition (- trees saved locally??) If burned: the burning pollution.  Obviously it's about approximation rather than exacts, it's probably hard to appraise the different byproducts from burning versus decomposition, and a lot probably depends upon the way it is burned.  But as a whole, can we get a rough estimate of comparable quantities/damage done... is it less pollution/damage even to truck it an average of 3000 miles?  1000 miles?  100 miles?  10 miles?  Should it be burned on the spot (if done safely)?  Would think there's got to be some way to get a very rough idea.  Certainly the best option if viable might be leaving it in place to decompose.  But considering how upset people are getting at having debris around these parts a month later, exclude that option from the possibilities.  Trucking or burning, how do they compare? "

1290,Is evapotransporation accounted for in climate models?,"Is evapotransporation accounted for in climate models, or is it considered so insignificant that it's not considered?    Could additional crops being planted within the last 100 to 50 years account for additional moisture in the air now?  Sorry, here's some more background.  I recently attended a conference in which there were 2 speakers, one from NOAA and another from the USACE, that both came to the same conclusion that our atmosphere is becoming more 'wet'.  In particular the NOAA scientist compared the last 50 years to the fifty years prior to that.  So by comparing the last fifty years to the 50 years prior to that it looks like the atmosphere is becoming wetter.  I just wonder, if there were more crops in the ground in the last 50 years, what impact that would have on the climate becoming wetter.  I have done some googling on this matter and am finding mostly information on how a changing climate may effect evapotransporation but not vice versa.  I also checked out the USDA website for acres planted over time and I'm not finding much further back that a decade or so.   "

1292,Geomorphology of Mountains With Wind only Erosion,"I am curious what mountains would look like if erosion occurred almost entirely by wind. Specifically, I am curious of how granite mountains would look on a ""snowball"" terrestrial-sized xenoplanet.   On a ""snowball"" world, the planet is earth sized and retains water but it lies outside its sun's ""goldilocks zone"" and is to cold for liquid water. Ocean's freeze over to a deep of several kilometers with only deep pockets kept liquid by concentrated minerals and vulcanism.   With no liquid water there will be no liquid erosion and no ice fracturing. The only moisture at all in the air will come from sublimation so very little ice will be deposited at altitude and it likely won't form glaciers or otherwise contribute to erosion.   At lower altitudes, very slow moving glaciers will probably perform most erosion but at altitude it will be erosion from wind carrying water and CO2 crystals as an abrasive.   On Earth, erosion from water causes convex (wide rock, narrow erosion channel) while glaciers causes concave (narrow rock, wide erosion channel.) Hard brittle rock such as granite suffers ice fracturing leaving a jagged vertical channels with overall angular features.   In dry areas on Earth erosion creates rounded, fluid structures like stones shaped by a stream. But I am unclear of how much that is a feature of wind erosion and how much a feature of softer sedimentary stones. It looks like Mars, where erosion is primarily wind driven, does have more rounded and less jagged mountains than on Earth but I don't know about the suspected composition of the those mountains.   If granite wears from the wind, does it round off or does it's internal structure cause it to fracture even without water?   Thinking about it another way, if the Earth completely froze over, what would the Rockies, Andes or Himalayas look like after a few million years of wind only erosion? "
1293,Is soil a renewable resource?,"My geology textbook tells me that soil is not renewable, and I agree with this, but there was some question in my class as to whether this is true.  Some soils take more than a human lifetime to regenerate.  However, in crop production, it seems as if soil can be regenerated with additives.    In the scientific community of soil scientists, is soil considered a renewable resource by most of those scientists?  Is there strong evidence to support this? "
1294,Why is there no middle ground between tornadoes and hurricanes?,"A tornado has an effective area of destruction about the size of a city block.    A hurricane spans several hundred kilometers.    However, there doesn't seem to be a continuum between the two.  Why are there no vortex windstorms on the scale of a city?  Is it because tornadoes and hurricanes have different formation mechanisms?  Or is there a reason why city-sized vortices would be so weak as to be un-newsworthy? "
1295,Weight vs. Mass of Clouds,"I came across a statement online that said that an average cloud has a weight of 1 million pounds. My main question is, does a cloud actually have weight on Earth or was the term ""weight"" a colloquial expression meaning ""mass""?  From my understanding, weight is a force defined as W = mass × gravity, or essentially F = ma. Because the cloud is not falling, its acceleration is 0 -- that is, the acceleration of -9.8m/s2 exerted by Earth's gravity must be counteracted by another equal and opposite force in order for the cloud to be stationary in mid-air, hence the ""a"" portion of F=ma is 0, so F, and therefore weight, must be 0. Is this thinking correct?  However, when the state changes from gas to liquid -- that is, when it starts raining - the water molecules in the liquid state obviously have weight. So my secondary question is, does a molecule's state change affect its weight? For gases which are ""lighter than air"", is their weight negative? (I suspect yes because of the force equation). "
1296,Why do Volcanoes give out so much Sulphur Dioxide and Carbon Dioxide?,"From my understanding, the mantle is in a highly reduced state, so I can't understand why a volcano would give off a highly oxidised gas such as sulphur dioxide.   Carbon dioxide is too an oxidised gas which is emitted by volcanoes, however I justify it's emission because carbon dioxide is continually being fed into the mantle by the subduction of carbonate sediments, is this correct? If this is true, why is there still carbon dioxide emitted at mid ocean ridges?   Or is this all wrong, and the gases are being emitted because they are still being degassed from the solid mantle in the process if heterogenous seperation which separated the atmosphere from the mantle. If this is the case, why have all other gases been seperated but not the two I have mentioned? "

1299,What are the differences between implicit and explicit methods when applied to modelling Earth systems?,"I am struggling to understand the difference between implicit methods and explicit methods in numerical modelling of Earth processes, particularly when applied to modelling Earth systems in 2 or more dimensions, such as in NWP (Numerical Weather Prediction), for example.  I understand the basic principle for the explicit method: that an explicit model would calculate the new value of each grid square independently for each time step, for example. The application of the implicit method puzzles me though &ndash; it seems to require knowledge of both the current state of a system and the latter  state, before the latter state is even calculated? Is it somehow extrapolating the outcome? "
1300,What are the applications of hydrostatic solvers vs non-hydrostatic solvers in numerical weather prediction?,"In the atmospheric dynamics research community, many colleagues of mine happen to use atmospheric models that have non-hydrostatic equation solvers, e.g. the UK MetOffice model, and WRF-ARW:      The equation set for ARW is fully compressible, Eulerian and nonhydrostatic...   There are another group of models that use a hydrostatic solver by default (e.g. ECMWF), and presumably make the following assumption about the Earth's atmosphere.     Hydrostatic equilibrium describes the atmospheric state in which the upward directed pressure gradient force (the decrease of pressure with height) is balanced by the downward-directed gravitational pull of the Earth. On average the Earth’s atmosphere is always close to hydrostatic equilibrium.   My question is what are the applications of each type of solver, i.e. when would you chose to use a non-hydrostatic model over a hydrostatic one? (which is presumably less computationally expensive?) "
1301,The river or the hills; which came first?,"On the upper Mississippi in Illinois and southern Wisconsin, the river is bounded by hills and bluffs which  define the outer edges of the flood plain. There are similar configurations for some of  its tributaries, specifically the Illinois, the Rock and the Wisconsin Rivers.  My question is whether the hills preexisted the  course of the river or did the river in some way cause the hills  to ""appear"".   Are the hills all glacial deposits which guided the course of river?  I understand  erosion   formed the bluffs  at Wisconsin Dells and Starved Rock, but why did the river flow there in the first place? "
1302,"What would the geology and climate of a supposed landmass near the pole be like, assuming a thoroughly warmer planet?","I am designing a fantasy setting for pen-and-paper role-playing (and potential novel) purposes. I have decided that a continent be situated right on a Pole of some imaginary planet with axial tilt comparable to Earth. My question is: is it possible to achieve environmental conditions in the Continent at least somewhat similar to those of current-day Europe?  My understanding of Earth climate is that the poles, while extremely cold, are also very dry in terms of precipitation. I have understood that this is mostly due to the axial tilt but I'm not sure. I have heard that in a warmer part of Earth's history the poles had vegetation - is this possible even with the ever-present high-pressure zone?  I guess one way the continent could be habitable is to be full of freshwater rivers, originating from glaciers high atop of some mountains. I guess such mountains are plausible near the pole (I don't think the movement and mutual interaction of continental plates are somehow dependent of the latitude, are they?)

1304,Calculating Monthly Accumulation value of the Clearness Index KT,"I have an hourly data file of a particular location which contains the following variables (extracted from the Meteonorm7.0 data base, for a typical one year of data):   GlobHor (W/m2): Horizontal Global Radiation. DiffHor (W/m2): Horizontal Diffuse Radiation. KT: Clearness Index. Tamb (°C): Ambient temperature.   I´ve received the Monthly Accumulation values for each variable and I tried to check such values using just the hourly data. The Monthly Accumulation values of GlobHor and DiffHor are in kWh/m2.month units.  For the radiation variables, I´ve done the following:   I've multiplied each hourly W/m2 value by the number of seconds in an hour (3600). Sum all the values in W/m2 for each month. Divide each monthly value by (3.6×1000000)   It worked! For the ambient temperature, just the monthly average, and it worked too.  However, I do not what has been done with the clearness index KT. It is not an average.   Is there some special way, like with the Radiation data, to obtain the Accumulation Monthly values for the Clearness Index KT?

1315,How long did it take for Earth's magnetic field to first appear?,"Merely what the title states. My knowledge of geography/geology/*logy is limited to high-school, and some snippets, and snatches of conversation.  As I understand Earth's magnetic field is attributed to the bi-layered nature of it's core. Proto-Earth probably did not have a magnetic field. Apparently much later Earth's core cooled enough to separate into two layers - causing the field to appear  How long did it take for Earth's magnetic field to first appear?  As a corollary, did water appear first on Earth, OR did the magnetic field appear first? "
1316,Princples of process (systems) based modeling,"What books are available that address the fundamental principles all processed based modelers should be aware of?    Is there a guide, some holy grail of text books for process based simulation models?   Edit: Process based, or system models such as those used to simulate ecological/biogeochemical/landscape processes.  As Naught101 mentioned: ""process based modelling"" refers to a computational-numerical mode built on a conceptual model that is mostly based on physical laws defined by empirical relationships. As opposed to a purely empirical/statistical model.  "
1317,How far can water wick up above the capillary fringe in sediment or soil?,"The capillary fringe is the area above the water table where the water is held in tension so that the connected pore space is completely saturated, although variation in pore size means that there is variability in the height of capillary rise, and thus, the thickness of the capillary fringe can include a zone where the largest pores are not saturated (a number of workers only consider the zone where all pores are saturated as the capillary fringe). The capillary fringe can be several meters thick in clays. Above the capillary fringe, there is a zone of variable water saturation called the vadose zone where water is held in tension but the pores are not fully saturated.   Can water wick up into the vadose zone from the capillary fringe to any significant distance (say more than a cm or so) and to any significant amount? If a plant has roots in the vadose zone, that do not reach the saturated capillary fringe, perhaps 30 cm to a meter or more above the fringe, could they obtain a significant amount of water from the saturated groundwater? "
1318,Tsunami - Mathematical classification,"I'm interested in knowing which type of wave a tsunami is, in a strictly mathematical sense.    I'm gonna cite from Wikipedia for this:     As the tsunami approaches the coast and the waters become shallow, wave shoaling compresses the wave and its speed decreases below 80 kilometres per hour (50 mph). Its wavelength diminishes to less than 20 kilometres (12 mi) and its amplitude grows enormously – in accord with Green's law.   and also     Except for the very largest tsunamis, the approaching wave does not break, but rather appears like a fast-moving tidal bore.   While the first property strongly hints at a tsunami being a shallow water wave, the latter fact, namely that they usually don't break would rather suggest for the tsunami being a soliton-solution of a Korteveeg-de-Vries-type equation. I thought the latter property would not be inherent to shallow water waves although Wikipedia, again seems to argue differently, however only with a picture.  So maybe someone can clarify:     Which equations govern the surface profile of a tsunami? Has this model been tested against satellite measurments?  "

1321,How long it takes to cool a planet?,"Suppose a planet like Earth or Venus is totally isolated from sunlight. How quick would it cool down?

1322,Prompt gravity signal induced by the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake - could this really be useful for warnings?,"Edit: Two new items may shed more light on this question:   BBC: Gravity signals rapidly show true size of giant quakes links to: Science: Observations and modeling of the elastogravity signals preceding direct seismic waves     The Nature Communications paper Prompt gravity signal induced by the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake presents a ""...report on the search for a prompt gravity signal during the rupture of the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku-Oki earthquake in data recorded by a superconducting gravimeter in the underground Kamioka Observatory and five nearby broadband seismometers from the Japanese network F-net.""  They conclude that with a certainty of about 99% that a prompt gravity signal was detected. The change in position of large masses of crust resulted in a tiny change in gravity even 500 km away and this was within detectable limits of this extremely sensitive instrument.  Since gravity's influence ""travels"" at the speed of light it is suggested this might be an avenue to be explored for a potential early warning system.  Considering that electrical and optical signals (e.g. the internet or radio or a more dedicated communications system) travel about 2/3 the speed of light in wires and fiber, and even conventional internet pings are of the order of 100 milliseconds or better, is there any suggestion or discussion anywhere else besides this paper that super-sensitive gravimeters would be in any way better and/or cheaper than a network of cheap sensors?   In either case the idea is an early warning for something ""big"" rather than accurate measurements. Although the paper and analysis is interesting and elegant - is there any serious discussion or speculation that something like this - a prompt gravity signal - could somehow be actually useful as an early warning system?

1324,Atmospheric Carbon: Whence the discrepancy?,"The news tells us that global carbon emissions are now more or less constant, as in the 2014-16 data points of Global carbon emissions flatline continues.  On the other hand, the Keeling graph of mean global CO2 keeps climbing upwards.   So clearly there is some feedback which continues to put CO2 into the atmosphere, for at least 3 years after the emissions plateau. What is the source of this feedback? Is it one dominant process or a multitude of lesser feedbacks? "
1325,"Evidence for ""earthquake storm"" at the end of the Bronze Age","The decline of the large population centers around the eastern Mediterranean at the end of the Bronze Age has been associated with a set of large earthquakes (""earthquake storm"") occurring between 1300 BCE and 1150 BCE (e.g., late Minoan Crete Earthquakes).

1327,Connections between marine and terrestrial ecosystems,"First I would like to note that I have only very basic understanding of ecology, biology and paleontology so I can easily miss something very simple.  I can envision certain ways marine and terrestrial ecosystems influence each other:   Rivers and surface runoff carries minerals, soil, plants, excrements etc into the oceans. Productive terrestrial ecosystem would mean less minerals, more organic nutrients going into the ocean. Terrestrial animals (like birds) eat marine ones and then excrete and are eaten at the land. Marine and terrestrial ecosystems absorb and produce atmospheric [tex], [tex], [tex] that are redistributed globally by atmospheric movements. That also affects climate and therefore water cycle.   Naively it seems to me that the situation is quite asymmetric. While №2 should be of extreme importance to the coastal ecosystems I suppose it's influence drops quickly as you go deeper into continent aggravated by water currents taking everything back into ocean. So (again naively) it seems to me that marine ecosystems should be much more influenced by the terrestrial ones than the other way around.  So imagine sudden significant drop of primary production for some reason constrained to the oceans. Obviously it would be a catastrophe for island and coastal life but in what ways, how much and at what timescale it will affect inland ecosystems? What if we turn it upside down and consider some significant drop of terrestrial primary production? "
1328,What triggers the formation of channels of ionized air for lightning strikes to occur?,"I apologize for the lack of foundational knowledge underlying this question.  At wikipedia it is stated     Initiation of the outward leaders is not well    understood. The electric field strength within    the thundercloud is not typically large enough    to initiate this process by itself.   The above implies that the initiation of outward leaders (and the process by which a charged region of the cloud would cause stepped channels of ionized air to form and branch out towards the earth) would be explicable if the electric field strength within the thundercloud were larger.  Is that interpretation of the wikipedia article correct? That is, are the physical processes that lead to the formation of outward leaders well understood, providing a sufficiently strong electric field exists?  Secondly, my understanding is that in CG lightning, the thundercloud contains both negatively and positively charged regions, possibly created by the collision of different types of ice particles within the cloud. Why would it be easier for the region to neutralize its excess charge with the ground, rather than with the far more proximate oppositely charged region of the same thundercloud? "
1329,Could this be pyroxene twinning ? (thin section),"I found this beautiful euhedral pyroxene crystal in thin section today. There is one thing that I can´t explain though.    In crossed polarizers, the crystal shows two different interference colors, which do not change as I rotate the table (no color shifting, no extinction).    As far as I know, this happens only in basal sections. But then why are there two different interference colors ? Could it be pyroxene twinning ?  Thanks for all your answers. "
1330,Was there once a glacier over Starcke national park in Queensland Australia?,"I was randomly exploring Google Earth when I came across some sort of rock formation in northern Australia. The location of the rock formation with respect to Australia is shown below. It is in or near Starcke national park.    Of course it seems absurd (to me) to think a glacier could have existed there anytime even remotely recent in geologic history. But there's a rock formation there that looks like it has been carved up by a glacier. Here's a screenshot of google earth satellite data of the rock formation in question:    Notice the clear distinction between the ""carved land"" and the vegetation to the south and west, this is one of the traits I find confusing about this structure.  I tried researching the park to see if there is a scientifically accepted origin for this formation, but all I learned is that it is apparently made from sandstone, and the region is noted for being very rugged.   I'm not a geologist, so I might be missing some important info that could help, but I have at least a basic understanding of geology from a few electives I've taken in college. I know that glaciers carve up the land, and when they retreat, they leave behind a mess of jagged rocks and lakes that are aligned in the direction of flow of the former glacier. The above picture seems to show just that: there is a clear sense of direction of the lakes and rocks.   Additionally, I was able to find one other similar formation about 400km (~250 miles) north east up the Australian coast (measured as a straight line) near the Sir Charles Hardy Islands. I would show a pic of that as well, but I'm limited because I'm new here.  Other than these two formations, I was unable to find any other examples. Both formations highly contrast their surroundings and both seem to be ""smeared"" in roughly the same direction.  For reference, look closely at the land in northern Canada and Europe, where glaciers are known to have existed geologically recently. (Again, I had pics but I can't post them.)  Does anyone know how the formation in question was created? If not does anyone have a strong educated guess about what might have caused it? Thanks in advance. "
1331,"Is this 70km crack in an ice shelf of Antarctica remarkable, or a regular occurrence?","I've just seen the LiveScience article 70-Mile-Long Crack Opens Up in Anatarctica. I'm not sure if the title is a bit sensational or not, the crack is in an ice shelf, not the continent of Antarctica.     An ominous crack in an Antarctic ice shelf as wide as a football field is long takes on an otherworldly beauty in a new aerial image.      Snapped by scientists on NASA's IceBridge mission, the shot shows a rift in Larsen C, an ice shelf that is floating off the Antarctic Peninsula. When the crack eventually spreads across the entire ice shelf, it will create an iceberg the size of the state of Delaware, according to IceBridge. That's around 2,491 square miles (6,451 square kilometers).      As of Nov. 10, when the IceBridge scientists observed this crack, it was 70 miles (112 km) long and more than 300 feet (91 meters) wide. The dark depths of the crack plunge down about a third of a mile (0.5 km), all the way through the ice to the ocean below.      [...] Larsen C is Antarctica's fourth-largest ice shelf, and it holds back the land-based glaciers just behind it: Once the ice shelf goes, those slow-flowing glaciers have one less barrier in their journey toward the sea.   My primary question: is this a remarkable event, or something that over time happens regularly? Isn't this just a natural part of ""those slow-flowing glaciers... journey toward the sea."" ?   I'm also wondering 1) Is an iceberg the size of Delaware actually remarkable, or something that just happens from time-to-time? And 2) how they (actually) know the crack goes all the way to the ocean - can they actually see the water in images, or is this a hypothesis based on understanding of cracks of this length and width? I can ask as a separate questions if it's too much to ask here.    above: Image from here. ""A huge crack can be seen in the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen C ice shelf in this aerial image snapped on Nov. 10, 2016, as part of NASA's IceBridge mission.

1332,What rate of deforestation would be needed until we run out of oxygen?,"I was wondering about how much unchecked deforestation would have to occur before we tipped the balance and started using more oxygen than was being replenished by plants and trees.  Last I heard it was estimated that every day an area the size of Wales was being removed globally which sounds like a very large amount. This could be inaccurate now as it was a long time ago. Many companies now plant trees to offset carbon footprint or whatever but assuming they didn't how long would we have?  My question could be reduced to this - what area of land would need to be covered by forest to sustain life on earth without us all suffocating?  I imagine that this is a very simplistic view, it would probably cause global warming to accelerate first or the ecosystem to collapse and we'd all starve. I should say at this point that I am no scientist! "

1334,"In quasi-geostrophic frontogenesis, what happens if the potential vorticity is negative?","In particular, what happens if the Sawyer–Eliassen equation cannot be solved? I know that a condition for the Sawyer–Eliassen equation to have a solution is [tex], which means that the potential vorticity is positive.  I was wondering what is the physical implication of this condition on frontogenesis? Are there situations where fronts cannot be created, when potential vorticity is negative? Does that occur somewhere?  A secondary question would be the link with symmetric instability, which requires if I am not mistaken that the absolute vorticity (which is more or less potential vorticity) must be negative (in the northern hemisphere). I do not understand, then, how symmetric instability can arise when the Sawyer–Eliassen equation can be solved. Instability should occur in fronts since it is the driving phenomenon for the creation of precipitation bands! "

1337,Can we carbon-date the remains of homo floresiensis found in 2003?,"According to the Wikipedia article on the species Homo floresiensis, the remains discovered in 2003 consist of unfossilized bones. I would assume that means they are still composed of the original organic material left behind when the human specimen died thousands of years ago. Shoudn't that mean radiocarbon dating would be a good method to date the reamains?   Many articles on Homo floresiensis also discuss how the remains were originally dated to ~12,000 years ago, but that this estimate was later revised to 60–100,000 years ago. However, everything I can find indicates that mostly geological dating methods were used, not radiometric dating.  Why not? The Wikipedia entry on carbon dating says that it can only be used reliably to date specimens up to ~50,000 years, but could carbon dating then at least place a lower limit on the age of these remains? And why wouldn't it have been used back when they thought the specimens were only ~12,000 years old? "

1341,Does subduction of continental crust happen at continental-continental convergent boundaries?,"What exactly happens at a continental-continental (cc) convergent boundary? I read myself through the web for the last few days and what I came up with is that such a boundary will start as an oceanic-continental (oc) one until the continental plates meet and then a huge falt mountain range like the Himalaja, Alps or Appalacian Mountains is formed.  At this point the sources I found gave me conflicting information. Either no subduction of the continental plate occurs or the continental plate is subducted and melts somewhere around 90 to 140 km down. Apparently rockes which where once part of the continental plate melt and resurface. I also heard that this is an area of ongoing research and it isn't fully understood what happens at cc convergent boundaries. So...    Does no subduction of the continental plate occur?  Does only a bit of subduction of the continental plate occur, as some of it is pulled down into the deep by the rest of the oceanic plate?  Does subduction occur at cc boundaries as on oo and oc boundaries, just slower and in a more quiet manner and cc boundaries usually don't last long enough?  "
1342,What portion of global warming is caused by radioactive CO2 produced from cosmic rays?,"The Earth's magentic field has been weaking recently, and the sun's magnetic field has been weaking recently, and it is a known fact that when either of these magnetic fields weaken (let alone both of them at the same time) that more cosmic rays reach the Earth - and indeed, throughout the past several decades there has been a continuously-increasing quantity of cosmic rays reaching the Earth - and it is also a known fact that cosmic rays produce C02, and that C02 causes global warming. So how do we know whether or not a huge portion of global warming is being caused by the C02-producing cosmic rays rather than human activitis? Obviously human activities do produce some amount of C02, but has an effort been made to determine how much of a contributor this is, compared to the C02 from cosmic rays?  I tried Googling for stuff like ""do cosmic rays cause global warming"" but the only results I am finding are things which discuss some theory about cosmic rays seeding clouds (Henrik Svensmark's theory), which is not what I am referring to. I could not find a single article that discusses - or tries to debunk - the possibility of global warming being caused by the C02-producing cosmic rays. There might be one somewhere in the search results, but I only have so much time that I am willing to spend digging through Google. Does anyone have an argument against this theory? "

So I was wondering how do they measure these things rigth in the soil itself? The only thing that might be helpful is this but It doesn't say wheter they used prepared soil samples or just a nomral earth right from their garden or somewhere. Does anyone maybe have an Idea how they could've done it? What techniques have they used? "
1344,"I'm still confused about what ""probability of precipitation"" means","I'm trying to understand what weather forecasts mean more precisely. As I understand it from reading Wikipedia, blogs, etc., the percentage value for rain/precipitation that you see in a forecast is technically called the ""probability of precipitation"". To quote the National Weather Service webpage:  ""Mathematically, PoP is defined as follows: PoP = C x A where ""C"" = the confidence that precipitation will occur somewhere in the forecast area, and where ""A"" = the percent of the area that will receive measureable precipitation, if it occurs at all. So... in the case of the forecast above, if the forecaster knows precipitation is sure to occur ( confidence is 100% ), he/she is expressing how much of the area will receive measurable rain. ( PoP = ""C"" x ""A"" or ""1"" times "".4"" which equals .4 or 40%.)""  This definition does not seem well stated to me, for the reason that ""confidence"" is (presumably) not uniform across an area. For instance, the phrase ""how much of the area will receive measurable rain"" seems odd, since a forecast would (presumably) only be able to give a probabilistic estimate for this area.   Let's cook up an example. Consider a town (the forecast area) consisting of two parts of equal area (called north side and south side). Each point in the north side will be rained on with 100% probability tomorrow, and each point in the south side will be rained on with 50% probability (at every point) tomorrow. What is the PoP in this example? At face value, the definition could be interpreted as implying that the PoP is 100%, since precipitation will occur somewhere in the forecast area. However, this value seems intuitively unsatisfying, since some people might not get any rain.    Here's what I might expect a more precise definition to be. If [tex] is the area and [tex] is the ""pointwise confidence function"" depending on a point (location) [tex], then define  [tex] In words, this is just the expected value of [tex], or the probability that a randomly located person would see rain over the specified time interval. In practice, of course the integral would be estimated based on actual measurement sites. If such a formula is indeed an accurate definition, then I'd be satisfied. In the above example, the PoP would be 75%. (The official definition could in essence be viewed as a shorthand that is more useful for those without any background in calculus.) If this definition is not correct, then some explanation would be helpful.  I've read web articles with statements like the following: ""As a student and observer of meteorology, it constantly bums me out that people do not understand what it means when someone says there’s an “X% chance of rain” tomorrow. A 50 percent chance of rain does not mean there’s a 1-in-2 chance that you’re going to get wet.""  It's not clear to me why ""A 50 percent chance of rain means there’s a 1-in-2 chance that you’re going to get wet"" would be an inaccurate interpretation of PoP. If the definition I suggested above is correct, then it is perfectly correct to say that a stationary observer placed at a random location in this scenario would have a 50% chance of getting wet. Am I missing something, or is this author being careless?  I don't have any background in meteorology, and in particular I don't have much of a sense of how PoP is actually computed in practice. "

1347,Why did notosuchians and similar crocodylomorphs thrive in the Jurassic-Cretaceous but fail to compete with adequate mammalian competitors?,"Notosuchia has a long and storied past. They seem to have gotten by just fine with dinosaurs dominating the makeup of mid and late Mesozoic megafauna. Despite dinosaurs having more developed and specialized anatomy, notosuchians thrived with diversity of their own.  Most importantly, many of these are large, terrestrial, cursorial carnivores -- exactly the niche of the more established dinosaurs. This obvious competition does not seem to have fazed notosuchian diversity.  Notosuchians survived the K-Pg extinction event with Sebecosuchia. Together with the unrelated mekosuchines, long-legged terrestrial crocodylomorphs managed to eke out an existence for a few more tens of millions of years. However, they only thrived in areas with no significant mammalian carnivorous megafauna - pre-Interchange South America, Australia and Oceanic islands, mainly.  For some reason, the ecological advantages that allowed terrestrial crocodilians to coexist with dinosaurs and terror birds did not apply in the middle Miocene.  Since this era is also the one where large, competent mammalian predators had evolved, this implies that they were able to confine the notosuchians and mekosuchines to more specific areas and niches until they eventually went extinct.  Of course the climate of the Miocene was much different from that of the Mesozoic, I just don't know how that applies.  Is there something about mammals that made them harder to compete against even dinosaurs? Or is the bigger story more nuanced? "

1349,Why does the salt in the oceans not sink to the bottom?,"This is something that just occurred to me. If heavier elements sink, then how can the entire ocean be salty? Shouldn't the 'salt', because of its density, all sink to the bottom of the ocean? In theory, only the deepest parts of the ocean should be salty, while the top of the ocean is not. Yet, the only water in the world that isn't salty comes from rain and rivers. How can this be? "
1350,How do the different densities of the oceanic and continental crust affect earth's outer shape?,"I am currently reading a textbook and I am slightly confused at a paragraph that deals with some general facts about earth's outer shape.   It mentions that the density of the continental crust is less than the density of the oceanic crust. Then it concludes (somehow?) that the continental lithospheres weigh less than the oceanic lithospheres. Using this then, it says that the continental lithospheres are ""floating more up"" on the asthenosphere  than the oceanic lithospheres. And then it continues with other facts.  I feel like there's something missing here. I understand that the denser material will sink in more. But how does this affect earth's outer shape? I mean sure, it means that the continental crust will appear more higher than the oceanic, but I fail to see this. All pictures I have seen don't show this clearly. Could someone maybe explain this in more detail with an appropriate image or animation? "
1351,"Historically, how did the total amount of salt / NaCl on Earth develop?","After reading this question about the origin of NaCl on Earth, I'm wondering: How did the amount of NaCl develop historically? Is it a more or less linear growth until today? Was it such a linear growth and then reached a level that it maintains until now? Or was that more complex over the billions of years of Earth's existence? "
1352,Are clouds more common at night?,"Clouds obviously have a strong effect on surface temperatures. By blocking sunlight they can decrease the temperature by several degrees. At night they have a blanket effect that traps warm air and can increase nighttime temperatures.  I'm asking about long term averages that would affect climate, rather than transient levels that affect day-to-day weather.   From what I read, the way clouds will be affected by a change in global temperatures is still very much up in the air, if you'll pardon my pun. What I'm wanting to know is whether clouds are more likely to form during daylight hours, when water vapor is rising from the surface, or at night when the temperatures are lower. This might also be different between low altitude and high altitude clouds.   The articles I read are also not clear on whether clouds, currently, have a net warming or cooling effect. Is there any consensus on which is true? Intuitively, to me, it seems that the cooling effect of daytime cloud cover is many times higher than the warming affect of nighttime cloud cover. Am I wrong about this?  "
1353,What would happen to the Earth if there were no seasons?,"If the Earth was in a fixed equinox state, what would the equilibrium temperature be at each pole? Assume daily cycle and convection and so on operate as usual, just that it's permanent sunset at both poles.  Bonus questions: Would the equilibrium temperatures be significantly different if Earth was fixed at solstice?  (Note: I misunderstood this question and wrote an elaborate answer that wasn't the answer to that question. So, to do not throw my answer to the trash, I'm asking here the question I did answer, which I find rather interesting anyway). "
1354,Rocks sparking under water,"I have searched for an answer to this question for years, to verify if it was true.  A man that lived on a river in the rugged part of the northern Washington Cascades told me an interesting story. He actually lived on the upper reaches of the Cascade River, a tributary, which eventually flows into the Skagit River.   The river is a high energy, steep gradient river full of rocks. Fast moving and cascading.   The man told me during a big flood flow, at night, he could hear the rocks and boulders bouncing around and bumping into each other. The most amazing thing is he said in the pitch black of night, he saw muted, periodic, random quick light flashes under water - creating an unusual effect. He and I speculated the flashes were produced by rocks colliding with each other.  The rocks in the area were mostly granitic, perhaps with some gneiss.   I did not see it. Is this possible? I know you can get sparks from some rocks and minerals - but granite boulders - underwater!!? Any comments?  Larry "

1356,Do man-made machines take natural Nitrogen out of the atmosphere and in turn cause global warming?,"I read in Wikipedia that, ""Natural Nitrogen, Dinitrogen forms about 78% of Earth's atmosphere. Dinitrogen is the most abundant uncombined element in the atmosphere.""  Do man-made machines destroy the natural Nitrogen, the extremely strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen (N≡N), turning natural Nitrogen into other compounds, molecules?    Does man-made fractional distillation, Nitrogen gas generators, and membranes take natural Nitrogen out of the atmosphere or ionosphere, causing global warming? "
1357,Does outgassing change the isotopic D/H ratio?,"It is known that the D/H-ratio of Earth's water inventory is very similar to that of asteroids. This is usually interpreted in a way that Earth's water must have come from similar, asteroid-like protoplanetary bodies.  However I find it hard to conceive Earth as a initially dry rock, being bombarded with a bunch of Ceres-like objects and then all the water just sticks.  It seems more plausible to me that asteroids would build the young Earth via classical collisional cascades, retain some water all the while, and degas this water later into the young atmosphere to form Oceans.  This scenario only remains plausible if the degassing process (I'm thinking of volcanism, but maybe there are more?) leaves the D/H ratio as it was in the original asteroids.  So my question: Is that so? Does degassing from a source material usually leave the D/H ratio untouched? "
1358,Conversion of an NWP model into climate model,"I am wondering if anybody has an idea about the difference between regional climate models and numerical weather prediction models that are run at the same domain.   I have a basic idea that the numerical weather prediction models can be run at much higher resolution and due to the time stepping and CFL schemes, it is not always possible to run them for a long time. So I have a general query and I want to infer about the time stepping and CFL criteria used in an RCM and a NWP model. Are they different or they both are similar, it's just that an RCM is run at coarser resolution?  Edit: I want to know if it is possible to get a climate model from a generic NWP model. I have seen the CWRF documentation which illustrates its highlights and mentions some different physical parameterizations corresponding to different processes. I realized that the convergence of model solution is more important even if the time stepping allows to get a long time run. I still have confusions about the new schemes used in CWRF, do they neglect subgrid scale processes like the other climate models? Why are these necessary to be implemented? Here, I also saw the mentioned description about CMM5 but I have the same doubts here. I want to know about the physical parameterizations and numerical schemes used in unified models and how are they different from that of a generic NWP model.  "
1359,To what extent does lightning produced NOx end up in the atmopsheric boundary layer?,Lightning produced NO[tex] (emitted as NO but quickly converted to NO[tex]) can be one of the major sources of atmospheric NO[tex] in the tropics [1]. Estimates of emissions per flash range from 10 - 600 moles NO per flash [2]. I have 2 questions about this phenomenon.  1) What is the exact location where the lightning NO is emitted? Is it in the cloud? Is it over the whole range of the lightning strike? Is there a difference in location between the IC (intra-cloud) and CG (cloud-to-ground) flashes [3]?  and  2) What percentage of the total 2 to 20 Tg N yr[tex] actually ends up in the atmospheric boundary layer where it can be harmful as air pollutant or precursor of surface ozone?

1361,Optical Thickness of the Atmosphere,"Homework question:     Show that the absorption optical thickness of the atmosphere   at pressure [tex] (i.e., between [tex] and the top of the atmosphere) as a function of the mixing ratio   of the absorbing gas [tex] and the absorption coefficient per unit mass [tex] can be expressed as:      [tex].       Assume [tex]       (So we can approximate [tex], where [tex] is the density of the   absorbing gas), and that [tex] and [tex] are vertically uniform, and assume that there is no scattering.       Has the anthropogenic increase in [tex] shifted the emission level to higher or lower altitude? Prove your answer.   Attempt:  Given the equation [tex]  I took the [tex]   [tex]  [tex]  [tex]  We will assume that [tex] and [tex] are constant, so disregard for a moment here.  It is a battle between the mixing ratio [tex] and [tex].    [tex]  If we want to know if peak [tex] moves up or down, I say that [tex] is constant.  If I increase the mixing ratio [tex] (increase [tex] concentration in atmosphere), pressure must decrease in order to keep [tex] constant, and decreased pressure means moving up in altitude.  I conclude that increasing [tex] concentrations shifted the emission level to a higher altitude.  Help  I am unsure how to arrive at the initial given equation.  My understanding of [tex] is minimal, and I just see too many variations and integrals concerning [tex].  I see how the Ideal Gas Law and the Hypsometric Relation will be used to replace variables   [tex] where [tex]  [tex]  (just trying to work backwards and piece the puzzle together, but the vision is unclear), but what was the original equation that was used, and ultimately--why?

1367,"What's the difference between ""loading"" and ""receiving"" in water quality modeling?","I see some models described as simulating 'receiving water quality' and others as 'pollutant loading' models. What is the difference between loading and receiving models in this context?  I am more familiar with the 'pollutant loading' term because of its more widespread use, e.g. predicting pollutant loads, Total Maximum Daily Loads, EMC * flow = load. In this sense, loading is the buildup of pollutants which will flow out of a given area.  Given that my description of loading sounds like 'edge of field' pollution estimates, e.g. the amount of pollutants leaving the field but not necessarily how much pollutant will arrive at a downstream outlet, would receiving water quality models be predicting the 'at the outlet' pollution? Or, what a point downstream will receive based on phenomenon upstream?  If my description of a receiving model is correct, it sounds like loading and receiving is somewhat a matter of perspective. If I model Delaware River Basin and estimate pollution flowing out of it, that's a loading model, but if I have a receiving model of the Delaware Bay, isn't that the same thing? Are receiving models more focused on simulating pollutant transformations and in-river processes? "
1368,Over which surface will the albedo changes due to clear and overcast skies have the greatest impact?,"With respect to climate change, will the changes in albedos due to clear skies and overcast skies have the greatest impact on incoming solar radiation over ocean, sea ice, or land?  My thoughts:  On a scale, the ocean has the lowest albedo, nearing on 0, land is much higher with an average of 0.3, and sea ice has the greatest with average of 0.6.  Since the oceans absorb almost all the incoming radiation, an increase in cloud cover will greatly change the albedo, since clouds tend toward 1, and much less energy will be absorbed.  Looking at sea ice, it already reflects 60%, adding clouds with similar albedos, the change won’t be much.  Note: I picked these crude numbers from the internet for sake of argument.  Is my reasoning correct, or am I missing piece of puzzle?   "

1371,"Deep sea pumps that work on wind power, can they control the weather?","If they used wind power to bring up cold water from far under the ocean in the day time and spray it on prevailing winds going into land, could they make it rain more in arid regions? What weather control can be done by bringing up cold water from the deep sea?  Here are some maths: If 1cm of rain for 1 kilometer is equivalent to a cubic meter of water. 1kwh can lift 1 cubic meter by 100 meters, so an average wind turbine can lift about 6 million square kilometers of 1cm rain every year. Australia is 8 million square kilometers, so 300 wind turbines can logically make Australia rainforest if clouds worked like rivers, without the salt problem? "
1372,Is this a contradiction in Wikipedia's definition of temperate zone?,"Under the Wikipedia article Temperate climate Temperate climate in the introduction is describes:     In geography, the temperate or tepid climates of Earth occur in the   middle latitudes, which span between the tropics and the polar regions   of Earth.     So by this sentence I take the temperate zone to be between the pink shaded area (the tropics, and the uppermost and lowermost broken lines (arctic and antarctic circles. This is simple enough.  Then in the next paragraph it says:     The temperate zones (latitudes from 35° to the polar circles at about   66.5°, north and south) are where the widest seasonal changes occur, with most climates found in it having somewhat balanced influence from   both the tropics and the poles.   Now it says that the temperate zones are between latitudes about 35 degrees from the equator to the polar circles. This is different than the earlier description, which said it was between the tropics and the polar circles, which is about +- 23.5 degrees to the polar circles, not 35 degrees.  A little lower it says:     The north temperate zone extends from (approximately 23.5° north) to   the Arctic Circle (approximately 66.5° north latitude). The south   temperate zone extends from (approximately 23.5° south) to the   Antarctic Circle (at approximately 66.5° south). Zones and   climates   So now it's saying again the temperate zone is between the tropics (23.5 degrees latitude) to the polar circles.  Lower again it specifies that there is a suptropical zone, namely:     Subtropical climates are generally located between 23.5° and 35° north   or south on the eastern or leeward sides of landmasses.   Humid subtropical climates   It's now specifying zones of the subtropics, but it doesn't change the fact that in the first instance it says the the temperate zone is between the tropics, +/- 23.5 degrees, and the polar circles, and then says the temperate zone is between 35 degrees to the polar circles, a definition which excludes the subtropics from the temperate zone.   Which one is correct? Is there a contradiction here? If so, is it a mistake or something more subtle I don't understand? "

1378,How do I convert between different east longitude coordinates?,"I have two datasets that represent longitude in different ways.

Googling finds a number of other sites with the same story. Some identify Dr. Evans as a ""former climate modeler for the Australian Greenhouse Office"", others as an electrical engineer. None seem to provide any skepticism about Dr. Evans' statements.  I'm sure this is a sham, as otherwise it would be an enormously important story that would be reported everywhere. If so, I'm a little surprised that I found no ""boy is this stupid"" responses. Perhaps the real climate experts are tired of playing ""climate conspiracy Whack-A-Mole"".

1388,Is it possible that the recent droughts are signs of epic crust failure?,"The full question is: Is it possible that the recent, successive, long droughts from Australia to the West Coast of both American continents are signs of epic crust failure?  The question is aimed specifically at the possible link between droughts at those specific areas and the weakening/loosening of lateral stress between tectonic plates.  The reasoning is based on the following observations:   The crust is not rooted in the mantle, and is cut in numerous crustal plates. Tectonic plates are held in place like an arch, so the gravity and lateral stress and friction are the main forces holding them up. Mantle flow provides uneven support to continental plates and is actually the main destabilizing force according to current theories. Based on the idea above, if humans dig up too much underground materials around the fault lines, the edges of the fault lines are weakened: there is less material to keep up adequate lateral stress. Then, the soil around the softer/weaker side of the fault will deform and be compacted, or fail and result in earthquake. Deformation/compaction and fault failure do happen naturally too, but humans may have extracted too much underground resources for the natural healing process to catch up with the rate of weakening at the edges. It is known that the fault of the West Coast is lacking stress and the soil is deformed in the Amos et al. (2014) study. If this keeps up, the arch structure of the crust will crumble down catastrophically, and in chain reaction too. And it doesn't take ""much"" edge weakening to fail an arch.   Additional information: The Amos study says that California lost 160 KM^3 of groundwater in the past 150 years. Now, add the amount of oil extracted. Then, add the amount of oil, water, minerals that are extracted along the West Coast of North and South America, Australia, Japan, South East Asian Islands. This should give some idea of how big are the holes human dug underground.   The scenario may correspond with the Pacific plates. There are numerous oil, and water extracting operations all around the Pacific. After decades of intensive and continuous resource extractions, it may be showing terminal signs of  the natural healing process failing to catch up with the rate of weakening at the edges. First, there are quite a few very strong earthquakes concentrated in the last ten years ([website]Droughts alone can be caused by weather patterns. Climate change can cause it too, but it is a global factor, as opposed to more localized factor such as weather patterns. However, I think that underground processes can also cause drought. Aquifers can store a lot of heat, so the lack of underground water means  that the geothermal energy will dissipate into the surrounding soil, basically slowly baking it. Less water also means that the soil is more prone to compression. Compression, especially continuous, even if it's slow, also generates heat. Oil reservoirs are also similar, but since oil is more reactive to heat by transforming into gas, and continuously extracted by humans, their pore pressure varies more. The presence of oil reservoirs around the fault lines may serve as springs. By extracting oil/gas, humans lessen the expansion force of those liquid and gas and reduce the pore pressure, which stabilizes the fault line. But in the long term, as is the case now, the reality is that there will be not enough oil to provide adequate pore pressure/lateral stress/counter-compression force. This may be the cause of the recent frequent strong earthquakes; the plates are loosening. Eventually, all the edges of the Pacific ring will all fail in an epic catastrophe, as the arch structure of the crust crumbles.  Also, by removing oil, it liberates more space for gas to form. Gas is more compressible and heated by compression; it is another source geothermal heat. It is like a bike air pump/air suspension system. The idea is that the excess of geothermal energy causes surface water to dry out faster. Another possibility is that the fault line of the West American continent is already caving in and is dipping deeper/entering into more contact with the mantle. The mantle is a way stronger source of heat, and without adequate of underground heat absorbers, the surface soil becomes baked. I think that it's also the cause of the Blob ([website]In summary, humans have dug up resources around active fault lines of the Pacific for more than a century. The weakened soil/plate edges lead to excessive geothermal energy affecting the surface.  So yeah, in the end, is it possible that the recent droughts are signs of epic crust failure?  Please kindly point out if my observation/logic makes sense and/or may correspond with reality. "

1395,Classification of rivers according to width,"I'm looking for a simple classification of rivers according to their width. In which size categories should I split them? This may usually be done according to catchment area but I'm more interested in the width at one spot of the river. I'm interested in the width at a given spot and point in time, not in the variability in width along the river or in different seasons.  Ideally this classification would make some sense (e.g. rivers smaller than x meter width are usually not used for ship traffic, rivers larger than x meter are commonly not crossed by bridges, etc.) or is commonly used in official documents (preferably in Europe).  Intuitively I would classified them according to the following but without much reasoning behind it:   below 2m (can be jumped) 3-10m (may be used for leisure water sport) 11-25m (smaller commercial vessels?) 26-50m (large commercial vessels?) 51-100m (may still be bridged) over 100m (very large rivers, close to flowing into the sea)  "

1397,Dissolved minerals,"I have a question that I am confused about.   If a mineral (say limestone) was added to a groundwater system, say like an aquifer and is completely dissolved in solution, can it ever be a solid again without evaporation happening? My thinking is if there are other sources of calcium to the system then that might promote oversaturation of the solution and so the mineral calcite would precipitate out again. Am I right?   Thanks.

1398,Lights associated with earthquakes?,"According to the New Madrid, Missouri web site, during the 1811-1812 earthquakes there were reports of lights coming from the ground due to quartz crystals being squeezed.  They call this phenomena “seismoluminescence.”  There are also videos online taken during the 2017 Chiapas, Mexico earthquake showing strange lights in the sky.  Lights have been reported associated with numerous other earthquakes throughout history.  Is there any research that has been done to either prove or disprove that these reported lights are actually being caused by the earthquake, and if so how are the lights created?  "

1400,'River-effect' snow,"Earlier this year 'river-effect' snow was reported in the Quad Cities (Western Illinois) along the Mississippi River.  Per the local news report:     According to Andy Ervin, a Meteorologist with the National Weather   Service, ""You need an environment supporting flurries to get   saturation for the enhanced snow showers. Air gets channeled between   the bluffs and resides over the water at least 45 minutes to pick up   the enhanced instability. Thus, you won't see this if winds increase,   change direction, or we lose the cold air aloft.""   I have only found two other short articles of 'river-effect' snow which occurred along the Missouri River in South Dakota and over the Ohio River in Cincinnati.  Both of these events occurred in 2014.  My question is if there are any other reports of this phenomena world wide and has there been any research published? "

1402,What is the consensus among geologists about climate change being caused by humans?,"I'm terribly frustrated with the way that climate change has been debated in Europe. I live in the Netherlands and members  of one of the biggest parties here, the Party for Freedom (PVV), frequently deny climate change and use terms like ""climate hysteria"" and ""the religion of climate change"". While I'm no climate scientist, geologist or meteorologist I do worry about the climate, simply for the reason that the large majority of experts does! I know that the exact percentage of consensus has been debated, consensus according to Bloomberg, consensus according to the Guardian explaining their methods, but it's pretty hard to argue that there is no consensus in general..   However, one of the arguments that climate change skeptics use is that the 97% (or whatever percentage you feel is right) consensus among climate scientists  is misleading. Misleading, because most climate scientists are meteorologists, and meteorologists tend to have a different view on climate, compared to geologists. The skeptics say that the consensus among geologists is way lower. From what I understand (again I'm  no geologist), is that some geologists support an alternative theory to explain climate change that involves plate tectonics.  Question: What is in fact the consensus among geologists about climate change being caused by humans?   Remark: Please excuse me for the elaborate introduction to my question. I don't want to make this a concealed political statement, but it is something that's bothering me. Why would you, as a layman, choose to believe the small minority on such an important issue? I definitely don't think we should ignore or silence climate change skeptics, obviously accepted scientific beliefs have been proven wrong in the past, but it does feel rather strange to me that so many politicians are of an opinion that is backed by only 3% of the world's leading scientists.     Thanks in advance! "
1403,What control the atmospheric lifetime of different metals in aerosols?,"Background  I'm analysing the metallic elements in [tex] to identify their possible anthropogenic sources for the study area.   A total of 19 metallic elements were investigated including dust-derived elements such as [tex] and pollution-derived elements such as [tex]  To better investigate the characteristics of different elements, their temporal variation (daily samples, collecting once for 6 days at an industrial city in China) during the whole year was analyzed.   I found out the burning of fireworks for celebrating China Spring Festival presented significant contribution to related elements, such as:      [tex]: they are utilized for the fuels of gunpowder.  [tex]: the chemical compounds of [tex] (KClO_4, KClO_3, KNO_3$) are usually utilized for the oxidant of gunpowder.      [tex] : used for generating lighting in different color.   Since the emission of firework burning were centered on the festival night, the influence should be short. We collect the aerosol samples and analyzed their species for the festival, one day after festival and two days after festival.    Observation results   Most of related elements presented the significant levels on the festivity and decreased sharply in the next day (~ 100 times).  However, I found three heavy metals with adverse health effects ([tex]) had increases in concentration levels after the festival. Their concentration levels recovered to their normal level after 3 days.   My thought   Most of the related elements recovered to their normal levels in one day, the accumulation of [tex] should not be blamed on meteorological conditions;  There might not be other important sources leading to the continuous increases of [tex] in 3 days,       Therefore, I though the accumulation of high concentration levels in 3 days should be attributed to firework burning,   This finding would be valuable since a short-time emissions event resulted in a relative long-time exposure to high concentrations if my inference is correct.   My question  Does the atmospheric lifetime differs for specific elements?  I assumed that the elements [tex] presented a long atmospheric lifetime with less deposition?  I still felt confused by the phenomenon. Any advice or comments on my question would be hugely appreciated!  "

They may be present by a result of flooding, logging, bank erosion, forest fires, beavers and many other causes.  I am not sure how they would enhance river or lake environments.  Clearly beavers could use them to build dams but how is this good? Is there any other ways they benefit?    Also, how are they detrimental to humans?  Might they potentially hurt the ecosystem present in the water, which in turn may hurt humans if they are using the ecosystem for resources?  "

1408,A better way to prevent ice shelf from melting and raising ocean levels?,"I just read this article by scientist who propose making giant snow machines to basically move the eroding ice shelf further inland. It’s been described as pretty much cost prohibitive (despite saving the coasts from rising water levels??) and would be on the same level of effort as putting a base on the moon.  Here’s the link: [website]So instead of doing that, why not drill a large hole straight down into one end of a section of the ice shelf (closest to land but still a thick part of ice) and insert a large tap and then use large fresnel lens to melt a slope in the ice and funnel the melted ice into the hole and out the spout to be diverted further inland which would eventually refreeze later?  You would just have to melt the section of the ice shelf at a graded slope so that gravity does all the work. If you look at how water towers work and then consider the thickness of the ice shelf, you could calculate amount of water pressure and will see that it would suffice to move large quantities of water at a very fast pace.  Just a thot "
1409,Isn't a warmer climate better for energy generation?,"Nowadays, everyone talks about it: climate change, and more importantly, how to stop it from happening. Although there's a lot of debate around the topic, the conscensus is that by inventing a way of generating clean energy, we can slow down (and maybe even reverse) the effects global warming has on the planet. Using energy that was created without burning millions of years worth of stored carbon, we can not only power our everyday lives, but also capture the carbon we've been blowing into our atmosphere using the energy-intensive process of carbon capture.  But there are still some problems. Currently, photovoltaic cells are pretty much useless during winter when it comes to fueling the homes of millions (at least where I live). We want to warm our homes, but there's not enough clean energy during those months, so we fall back on nuclear.  Wouldn't it therefore be better to have a small rise in global temperature? I mean, a higher temperature means you don't have to warm your home during winter (as much). During summer, you can use the extra energy generated by the photovoltaic cells to power airconditioners in order to cool buildings and (maybe) use some excess energy to stop the snowball effect that those higher temperatures would have on the climate and keep it at a constant level. Even though cooling requires more energy than heating, might it break even?  I don't have the knowledge nor the means to calculate if this is the case.  I know that climate change is a thing and that it's really, really bad. I'm not a guy that doesn't believe the effects it has on our surroundings. I just don't have the means to investigate this idea, that's why I ask you: will the rise in temperature have a positive effect on our energy production and the ability to satisfy energy demand? "

1411,Relationship Between Ratio of Atmospheric Gases and Ocean Gases,"A version of this question was posted in Chemistry SE and Worldbuilding SE but I've been told it wasn't appropriate to either SE. I was told to give this SE a chance. If you think it doesn't belong on this SE please let me know how to appropriately edit or otherwise another SE to try.    Note: This problem comes from my interest in exoplanet sciences but is applicable to earth sciences.  Something that's unclear to me is the exact relationship between gases within an atmosphere and the concentration of those gases within the bodies of water under that atmosphere (like an ocean).  For example, the solubility of [tex] at [tex] and 1 bar of atmospheric pressure is ≈ 1.496 g/L in water. My understanding is that number indicates how much [tex] can be dissolved within water before the water is saturated with [tex] and won't accept any more. However this doesn't tell me what the concentration of [tex] would be under given conditions, it just sets a maximum cap. So 1.496 g/L of [tex] might be dissolved in water, but it could be much much less.   Key Question: What are the calculations I need to go through to figure out the amount (total and ratios) of gases in both a planet's oceans and atmosphere assuming I know either:   The total amount of gases within the ocean/atmosphere system, or... The amount of gases present in the atmosphere but not the corresponding amount present in the waters.   I want to be able to figure out all the ratios of gases within an atmosphere and dissolved in a planet's waters. Ball-parking is fine if that's the best I can do.  I know this is probably a very complex topic, so if it's helpful you could look at the idealized  earth situation I've outlined (below) and rift off those numbers. Not necessary, but there if you need it.  You could also take the approach of looking at two gases with very different solubility in water, like [tex] than [tex] and look at what would happen to the ratios if there was a heck of a lot more of the less-soluble gas (Methane in this case) in the system than the more soluble gas.   Whatever approach you take, I'd appreciate any insight you can provide. What I really want to learn is both general principles as well as how to establish those principles in actual calculations.    Scenario: If useful refer to these numbers  Assume uniform temperatures at water surface. Assume no minerals dissolved in water.  SURFACE (Idealized Earth)   Total Surface Area: 510 million [tex] Water Surface Area: 361 million [tex] [tex] Uniform Surface Temperature   ATMOSPHERE (Idealized Earth)   By Volume: 79% Nitrogen, 20.95% Oxygen, 0.049% Carbon Dioxide, 0.001% Methane Surface Pressure: [tex]bar   OCEAN (Idealized Earth)   Water Ocean (What should be the corresponding dissolved gases?) Volume: [tex] billion [tex]   Bonus: What would change if we lowered/increased atmospheric pressure and/or lowered/raised temperature? "

1418,is the net amount of CO2 sequestered by trees from the atmosphere simply related to the mass of new growth?,"My simplistic model for the carbon cycle was that plants (or trees in particular) photosynthesise and transpire. The former takes up CO2 and H2O and the latter does the reverse but obviously not netting out. The carbon for the cellular material (in particular wood) comes entirely from atmospheric CO2 (?).  The mass of trees comes mainly from cellulose which is roughly 50% carbon. Therefore the mass of sequestered CO2 is simply related to the mass of trees, with the proportion equal to the ratio of the molecular masses of cellulose and CO2 with balanced carbon content. Wiki says cellulose is some sort of sugar type thing (C6H10O5)n and carbon dioxide is obviously CO2 so the ratio is something like: for each kilo of tree/wood grows 1.62 kg of CO2 is sequestered?  Is this completely wide of the mark? "

University of Hawaii material discussing the root cause of the pattern of formation of the Emperor and Hawaii chain of islands  an excerpt...     Perhaps it is even more amazing that in the past 65 million years   there has been only one such bend. Even more remarkable is the   observation that the straight portions of the chain are straight. As   we shall see below, the configuration of the plate boundaries in the   Pacific have changed dramatically during the lifetime of the Hawaiian   hotspot. If, as many geophysicists believe, subduction drives   tectonics, then how on earth can the straight parts be so straight and   move at constant velocities for tens of millions of years? The answer   to these questions remains a mystery!     ADDED:  Sept 1st.  an excerpt from a link to information in the comment below. thank you MyCarta, good information:     The bend in the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain is a prominent   feature usually attributed to a change in Pacific plate motion approx   47 Myr ago. However, global plate motion reconstructions fail to   predict the bend. Here we show how the geometry of the   Hawaiian-Emperor chain and other hotspot tracks can be explained when   we combine global plate motions with intraplate deformation and   movement of hotspot plumes through distortion by global mantle flow.   Global mantle flow models predict a southward motion of the Hawaiian   hotspot. This, in combination with a plate motion reconstruction   connecting Pacific and African plates through Antarctica, predicts the   Hawaiian track correctly since the date of the bend, but predicts the   chain to be too far west before it. But if a reconstruction through   Australia and Lord Howe rise is used instead, the track is predicted   correctly back to 65 Myr ago, including the bend. The difference   between the two predictions indicates the effect of intraplate   deformation not yet recognized or else not recorded on the ocean   floor. The remaining misfit before 65 Myr ago can be attributed to   additional intraplate deformation of similar magnitude.   I don't know if that is definitive or not?  I have come across this image showing the lately determined ""pattern of expansion"" the earth is undergoing:  perhaps then the quote above is indicating a ""perceived balance caused in the expansion as correctly predicting and matching the movement of the plume and plates relative to the pattern?    ****UPDATE Sept 24th -- Information from MyCarta**   MyCarta ""I think the more recent research leans towards a combination of intraplate deformation and movement of the plume itself, combined with the plate motion, e.g.""  And about Euler plates, and Lord Howe's Rise  [website]as added in a comment below, quoted from the paper's abstract:     if a reconstruction through Australia and Lord Howe rise is used   instead, the track is predicted correctly back to 65 Myr ago,   including the bend.   From the first paragraph in the paper:     Hotspots are frequently assumed to be fixed and used as a reference   frame for plate motions. However, when the Hawaiian hotspot track is   predicted from a global plate motion chain based on relative plate   motion data, and it is assumed that the Hawaiian hotspot is fixed   relative to African hotspots, it does not fit the observed track: the   predicted track is essentially straight, lies south of the Hawaiian   seamount chain, and has no feature corresponding to the   Hawaiian-Emperor bend. Explanation of this misfit requires one of the   following, or a combination of them, to be true: (1) motion of Pacific   plate hotspots, in particular more than 1,000 km south-westward motion   for the Hawaiian hotspot between ,80 Myr ago and the time of the bend   and minor southward motion after this time, (2) motion of hotspots in   the African hemisphere, (3) motion at an additional plate boundary, or   (4) deformation at a diffuse intraplate boundary not included in the   plate motion chain. Palaeomagnetic data from the Emperor chain3 yield   a southward component of Hawaiian hotspot motion more than 1,000 km   relative to the palaeomagnetic axis between ,80 and 49 Myr ago.   In the rest of the paper they used 2 main models (other models were discarded). The first included only hotspot motion which is sufficient to explain discrepancies between predicted and observed hotspot tracks (e.g. Hawaiian-Emperor chain) back to 47 Ma ago, but before 47 Ma ago the predicted hotspot tracks do not include the bend. Their second model added intraplate deformation (in their reference plates Antarctica/New Zealand) to hotspot motion and is able to predict the hotspot track all the way back to 65 Ma ago with good accuracy, including the bend, and with less accuracy (meaning that it is off too far to the west) until 85 My ago.""  Sept 24th MORE QUESTION  I'm getting the feeling tectonic plate heave and settle and patterns of interaction are the current best theory for the resulting relative motion of the Hawaii hotspot.  So we are increasing the scale of the question to ask what is it that drives the schedule of the tectonic plates, such that the result is the ever so slow motion of the Hawaii hotspot.  What is felt to be the root cause of timing of plate and continent shift?? "

The ecliptic is basically the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun, in as much as that can be considered to be a plane. (caveats, details, mumble, mumble J2000.0 mumble...) The inclined plane with the blue line is the Celestial Equator, which basically coincides with the Equator of the Earth (...mumble...).   If I understand correctly then, the North pole of the Earth should point in a direction that is perpendicular to the Earth's equator and celestial equator, but it looks to me like this is drawn with the north pole pointing directly up.  Am I wrong, or confused, or both?   "
1438,Why are climate anomalies calculated relative to 1981-2010 average?,What is the purpose for doing this? Is it inaccurate to calculate anomalies for variables such as sea surface temperature and precipitation based on a different time period? 
1439,Are Indonesian 2018 earthquakes related?,"Indonesia had multiple major earthquakes this year   A series of earthquakes in Lombok between July and August, including a 7.0 mainshock The 7.5 earthquake + tsunami in Sulawesi, September 2018 A 6.0 earthquake near Java, on 11 October 2018   I'm aware that Indonesia sits in an earthquake zone, but historically I don't think so many big ones occur in such a close time. Also, this spread out in different islands (e.g. the epicentres in Java and Sulawesi are ~1,000 km apart) over several months, so it doesn't look (at least to me) like typical mainshock-aftershock relationship. Were they related in some way? e.g. Do they indicate an increase seismic activity in the region? "
1440,What is this rock found in the Illinois Valley of Southern Oregon?,"I found this odd shaped rock along a rocky river bed (dry) near the Illinois river in Cave Junction,  Oregon.  It is shaped like a Club and is super heavy.  It has a distinguishable ring around the base uniform in size,  and makes a dense ringing sound when rubbed?  I see some reflective flakes when turned and grainy but solid material on surface, 18 inches length. any ideas?  "
1441,predicting low tide,"At 18:03 PDT at La Jolla Cove the lifeguard's bulletin board stated predicted low tide at 5:36 (17:36 PDT?). In fact, it was already after 6:00 and the sun had not yet set. The moon was a waxing crescent, about 2 days old. I infer that the moon would be setting in about 2 hours so the tide should be low in about 3 hours, that is, around 21:00 PDT. How can the discrepancy be explained? "
1442,"On what basis are hurricanes,cyclones or typhoons named?",now its well known that common names are used to name weather storms but on what bases are they named ? is it the person who first notices them ? Is it the the most common name in the region where the cyclone/typhoons/hurricanes develop ?or something else entirely ?   
1443,Minimum Surface Water for Plate Tectonics?,"There is good evidence that the presence of water on a planet's surface is necessary for that planet to have plate tectonics. My question is this: Do we know if there is a minimum amount of surface water that is needed to sustain this? How little water could a planet hypothetically have, yet still possess active plate tectonics?  Thanks in advance! "
1444,Will the oceans swallow all of the land?,"I am wondering why, since the oceans could feasibly hold all of the dry land, they in fact do not.  For example, the Mariana Trench drops to -10.9km, while Mount Everest only reaches to +8.8km.  Further, the oceans cover 71% of the surface.  This causes me to suspect that the negative elevation parts of the Earth could easily hold the positive.  Due to erosion, will the oceans eventually consume the mountains?  What is the timescale involved with such a process, and what forces counteract it? "
1445,Hudson Bay Has Low Gravity?,Is there lower gravity at the Hudson Bay? How does this happen? And where exactly is this because I might want to go.  
1446,Probability ( weather tomorrow = weather today)?,"What is the probability that the weather tomorrow will be equal to the weather today (e.g. more specifically, if we know there had been more than 1mm precipitation during one day, what is the conditional probability that there will be more than 1mm precipitation also the next day)? Can you guide me to some references?  I want to use this example in a lecture to illustrate to physics students the concept of probability in forecasting. "
1447,How is the specific heat of a wet bulb determined?,"I am quite new to the psychrometry and the study of humidity, and I'm currently learning about the dry-bulb wet-bulb thermometry. As far as my understanding goes, the wet bulb is connected to a source of water (by a moist cloth or cotton swab) and the evaporation of the water to the air around it lowers the temperature to get the wet bulb.  I can understand the concept here, but I believe I would need the heat capacity of the bulb to know the exact temperature drop in the wet bulb compared to the dry bulb. However, different thermometers may have different heat capacity and may show different wet bulb temperatures. How is this mitigated? How is the wet bulb temperature a constant value for a given relative humidity and dry bulb temperature despite the various heat capacities that may exist for the various thermometers used to measure the temperature? "
1448,How is sea level measured?,"In comments on Earth changes due to global climate change, sea level changes is a common topic. I hear quotes about sea level changes in the centimeter and even millimeter range and wonder how such precision is even possible. The sea moves a lot; way more than a centimeter in a given day. I have no understanding how the sea level is measured, and I also can't even imagine how to do it with that kind of precision. How exactly to oceanographers measure sea level?  Perhaps a different question, I also can't envision a way that a measurement of 1 cm change is pragmatically meaningful, even for just a single beach, never mind a global average. A 1 cm higher tide I don't think would be noticed at most places. Even 10 cm could go unnoticed at many places. Does a 1 cm global average change mean anything useful? I guess rates of change can be alarming. 1 cm per year would add up over the decades. "
1449,"Simple way to understand these narrow frequency peaks in recently published ""ice shelf singing""?","The Earther.Gizmodo.com article Scientists Discover a Weird Noise Coming From Antarctic Ice Shelf links to the American Geophysical Union video (an more importantly audio) (AGU) This is what an Antarctic Ice Shelf sounds like.  It also links to the recently published Geophysical Research Letter (Chaput et al. 2018) Near‐Surface Environmentally Forced Changes in the Ross Ice Shelf Observed With Ambient Seismic Noise (open access) from where the image below is taken.  EDIT: In the same issue there is a commentary: Seismology Gets Under the Skin of the Antarctic Ice Sheet which was written by Douglas MacAyeal, a glaciologist at the University of Chicago who was not connected to the new study which I also do not understand!  Dimensional analysis alone suggests that a length scale of the phenomenon resulting in these slightly sub-sonic oscillations can be obtained from speed divided by frequency (e.g. m/s divided by 1/s) but using the speed of sound in ice or water (roughly 4,000 and 1,500 m/s respectively) and circa 10 Hz suggests a length scale of a few hundred meters.  The paper itself is quite technical and in depth. Somewhere in there, is there a physical distance in water, or in ice that corresponds to this frequency, or are the oscillation frequencies due to a dynamic process like sticking and slipping, rather than to the propagation speed of sound?

1450,What do physical oceanography grad schools look for?,"I'm a junior studying math at a Canadian university and I'm planning on applying to oceanography grad schools. However, I haven't taken much physics or geology courses, and am just starting to swap out some of my math courses for courses like remote sensing and environmental modelling.   What are some good grad schools for physical oceanography and what do they typically look for in an applicant? Will decent math and physics grades and high grades in geology courses look good, along with a decent GRE score? I'm thinking of applying to Canadian and US institutions. If you have any suggestions on where I can apply, I'd appreciate that too!   I'm interested in marine acoustics, ocean engineering, and physical oceanography in general. My top choices right now are Scripps, and the program at the University of New Hampshire. "
1451,Why do anticyclones bring clear skies in summertime?,"It's obvious that in summer anticyclones bring hot weather. But why clear skies?   Heat evaporates the moisture and should lead to the cloud formation, shouldn't it? "
1452,Methane from fracking?,"Methane has spiked sharply since 2014: BBC Methane surge needs 'urgent attention'.  This coincides with a large increase in  fracking. So I'm wondering if there could be a connection? I don't think the target formations could release significant methane because they are generally so deep and pressurized. On the other hand, since the seismic footprint of fracking is so large compared to conventional drilling, could overlying shallow formations be sufficiently disturbed by explosions to release methane from near-surface sources? "
1453,Why are inversion layers so important in meteorology?,"I keep hearing the term ""inversion layer"" when reading about pollution and meteorology.  I know it vaguely amounts to ""some place where the gradient of temperature is inverted"". But why are inversion layers so important in meteorology ? Why do they matter ? Air is colder here ... Big deal ! ? "
1454,Is it typically colder after a storm?,"I've heard that it's colder after a storm. I think this is an interesting question, not least because of the implicit comparison: colder than what? A few different comparisons come to mind, and still others may occur to you.  I have in mind that after a storm means the day after the storm.  I'd love to hear responses to any or all of these. Is it colder after a storm relative to:   how it was right before the storm? how it is the day after the day after the storm? how it would've been without the storm?   I'm interested in statistical answers as well as theory-based answers.  @JeopardyTempest rightly points out that I haven't specified what I mean by storm. I'm not too picky here, I'm thinking of events that are between hours and days. "
1455,Causes and concentration of red rain of Kerala,"The red rain phenomenon in Kerala, India has been reported several times in history (1896, 2001, 2012). The color of the rain seems to be associated with the presence of airborne spores of the algae Trentepohlia annulata. My questions are:   What concentrations of spores are necessary for the rain to achieve this color? What physical and biological mechanisms are involved to achieve those concentrations in suspension?    "

1458,What would the temperature be on Earth without the sun from radio active decay in the Earth?,I once read that about 50% of the emitted temperature of the Earth is due to radio active decay of uranium and pollonium. Is this true and how would this be done as most of the decay energy are gammarays? Do we really get some heat of these particles? 
1459,Reults of the glacials and interglacials of the ice age on the soil,"I have read that the Earth has undergone five ice ages, the latest one is the Quaternary glaciation. I know that in the ice age there are glacial periods and interglacial periods, and we are currently in an interglacial, I want to make sense what is the effect of those succsessive periods on the life on Earth. Because in my text book I read that the soil has grown and become fertile since 20 thousand years ago, since the interglacial period started. But what made this change in the soil? and why it became suitable for farming? And is it a costant thing that the soil become rich and good in the interglacials of all ice ages? "
1460,Are old geophysics textbooks useful?,"I have had much success with old textbooks in mathematics. Generally, for any branch of mathematics that I (as a non-mathematician) would like to learn or re-learn, I can buy a classic textbook from the 1970s, and it will be accurate and cheap.  However, as a computer scientist, I know that this is not a great strategy for all subjects.   I am interested in learning more about the geology of the Earth and the other rocky bodies of the solar system. If I buy old editions of textbooks (such as here, here, or here), what am I going to be missing in terms of up to date theory? Am I likely to purchasing a textbook full of no-longer accepted theories or disproven facts?  As a follow up question, if text books like the one from 1979 are too far out of date, how old can I generally go to get an accurate text? "
1461,Origin of Serious Wildfires,"At a very rough estimate, what proportion of wildfires are caused by natural events like lightning? I am absolutely sure that in Europe, where there are often wildfires, the sun is never hot enough to set fire to vegetation directly, though it obviously makes things tinder dry and easily combustible. The broken bottle theory has been disproved. Experiments involving broken glass among highly combustible straw or hay were unsuccessful in causing combustion, though manual focussing of the suns rays with the lens-shaped bottom of a bottle were on rare occasions and with much difficulty successful. Although lightning undoubtedly causes the occasional wildfire, the majority have no connection with lightning. It should also be remembered that lightning is usually accompanied by torrential rain. These fires often start in several places at once, which is stretching the long arm of coincidence a bit too far.   Apart from the very rare instances of volcanos causing wildfires, what other natural causes could there be? Comparison of wildfire frequency in tinder-dry uninhabited areas, well away from civilisation, versus frequency in or near similar but populated areas should give a good idea of the scale of the problem.   "
1462,Where are the magnetopheres weak points on Earth?,"The picture below shows how a magnetosphere has defined points on the solid magnet and on the moon where cosmic radiation has a window, gap, or focal point. I'm not sure what to call these areas?   Where on Earth are these areas? Is there a map where the magnetosphere or local natural magnetic fields has this same effect?   "
1463,Could we sequester co2 by dumping forests in deep oceans?,"We know that trees are the most efficient ""tool"" we have to get CO2 out of the air, but the problem is that most of their fixated CO2 will naturally reenter the carbon cycle through decomposition. Would it be possible to remove this carbon by sinking the trees deep underwater (and possibly putting some rocks / sand on them)? How effective would this be, if at all? (I was unable to find any studies on this, if there are please point my to them.)  Update: I found a study regarding wood burial on land, for those interested. This might or might not be easier than under water, are there are any field trials either way? [website]"
1464,"If today's Earth becomes warmer, how will it compare to the Earth of the Cretaceous period?","Most pessimistic scenarios about climate change predicts a global rise of temperature of several Celsius degrees over the course of the 21st century if no action is taken. While such a shift in temperature has many implications such as rising seal levels (due to the melting of ice near the poles) and a mass extinction event, the Earth has recordedly had eras warmer than today in the past, such as the Cretaceous period. For reminders, Cretaceous is the last geological period before the extinction of dinosaurs, and it had notably higher sea levels and a warmer global surface temperature (4 °C above today's average surface temperature).  Assume now that the average surface temperature will rise as predicted by the aforementioned pessimistic scenarios, and that the seal levels will rise drastically.  How would tomorrow's Earth (in this scenario) compare to the Earth of the Cretaceous period ? Would it be in a similar state (besides temperature and sea levels), and perhaps share similar climates around the world, or would various factors I didn't mention (such as the ratio of oxygen in the air) make it very different ? "
1465,What is difference between an atmospheric model and a climate model?,"I am wondering the major differences been an Atmospheric model and a Climate model? For example, Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) versus Regional Climate Modeling System (RegCM). I recently use the both for 20 years climate simulations, but didn't find why one is called atmospheric and one is climate? "
1466,What is the most optimal latitude on Earth for the generation of extreme maximum temperatures?,"First question on this StackExchange, so here goes...  Overall, reaching high temperatures is dependent on 2 factors:   The (maximum) solar angle in the day. The greater the solar angle, the more insolation is received by the surface and air, allowing higher maximum temperatures assuming no thermal inertia. The length of the day. The longer the day, the more total solar radiation arrives in one 24-hour span, and the shorter the night is to radiate off excess energy, both of which due to the thermal inertia of the atmosphere and ground bias them towards hot temperatures.   (Again due to thermal inertia, it may be dependent on the day length and solar angle of previous days, though this influence is more minor.)  The first factor explains why even though at the summer solstice the poles accumulate more solar energy over 24 hours than any other place on Earth (I know I had a source on this. I can't find it, though.), they are still extremely cold as the low solar angle prevents reaching higher temperatures. The second factor explains why even though the equatorial region has the highest average maximum solar angles throughout the year, they don't get especially hot (even in rare desert areas) as the day length is nearly constant throughout the year.  Ergo, the outer tropics and the subtropics experience the hottest extreme maximum temperatures on Earth. This can be seen in the records for each continent that has a large stretch in that area:   America (South): 48.9 °C in Rivadavia, Argentina (24.18[3]° S) Africa (South): 50 °C in Dunbrody, South Africa (~33.4° S) Australia: 50.7 °C in Oodnadatta, South Australia (27.54811° S) Africa (North): 51.3/53.5 °C in Ouargla, Algeria (31.95° N) Asia: 53.9 °C in Mitribah, Kuwait (29.81[6]° N) and lastly, America (North): 54.0/54.4/56.7 °C in Furnace Creek, California, USA at a rather high 36.458056° N.   Presumably, the spread in latitudes is due to the geography in those areas being much more suited to the generation of extreme heat than places at the ""absolute ideal latitude"". But what is this absolute ideal latitude? At what point from the equator do the combination of day length and solar angle in summer create the most optimal conditions for extreme heat, other factors being equal?  (My scientific wild ass guess is 30°, but I'd like a more educated answer.) "
1467,Is there evidence to suggest that the release of methane clathrates in permafrost regions will impact climate change?,We can see that there are large buildups of methane clathrates in permafrost regions.   Climate scientist James Hansen has predicted that the release of the permafrost methane clathrates could cause runaway climate change.   We know that some have related the Triassic Extinction event to the release of Permafrost Clathrates.   Do we know how much methane is stored in the permafrost? Do we know at what temperature it will be released? Can we model the release of methane into the atmosphere in the same way we can model the release of carbon dioxide?  My question is: Is there evidence to suggest that the release of methane clathrates in permafrost regions will impact climate change? 
1468,How to Obtain an Accurate Estimate for the Pressure of a Putative H2 and He4 Primordial Atmosphere?,"How can we obtain an accurate estimate of the pressure of the  hydrogen and helium primordial atmosphere of Earth just after it was formed? I was admonished by a user on Astronomy Stack for saying it couldn't be done, especially as H2 and He4 were not the only gases in the primordial atmosphere. My critic refused to say how it could be done, so is there anybody here who can tell me? I emphasise an accurate estimate, not just a wild guess which anybody could make. "
1469,Is there a general equation to know how big of an area is affected by an earthquake?,"If you visit USGS earthquakes listing, you get 3 points of information for each earthquake: Location, depth, magnitude. My question is, is there a way to approximate how big of an area is affected? Like if an earthquake happens 20km from San Francisco, how strong does it have to be for someone in SF to be able to feel it?  "
1470,Impacts of high-altitude emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) compared to sea level GHG emissions,"I often hear that the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) by planes is particularly concerning because the emission of GHGs at high altitudes has an even higher impact on global warming than the emission of GHGs at low altitudes (e.g. sea level). I tried to find scientific evidence (e.g. peer reviewed publications, explanations in scholar books) for this claim on the internet but failed. Is the claim stated in the first sentence of my question true? If yes, could you point me towards respected literature? Thanks! "
1471,Can aerostats be used for fine-grained control of the weather,"Most of the discussed geoengineering ideas aim to change the average temperature of the earth instead of trying to control local weather.  Aerostats can be used to change the local temperature in several ways:   if covered with reflective material they can create shadow; if covered with dark material they can significantly increase the temperature above the cloud potentially dispersing the cloud; if combined into a structure similar to a solar updraft tower, they can transport dust and humidity to the height where they would not be transported by natural winds and by that either condensate the water or create new clouds.   With a large enough number of devices like this it should be possible to guide humid air to deserts, or to prevent hurricanes by removing convective available potential energy on their path.  Is there any research about the possibility of controlling the weather with devices like these, or is there some obvious flaw that would make this completely impossible? (Lack of helium is not a good argument, as these aerostats are not meant to lift any additional weight, and are meant to be as large as possible, so could use air heated by the sun).  If this is possible, what percentage of earth surface would we need to cover with these devices to counteract CO2 effects? From a rough assessment of incoming radiation vs radiation trapped by human released CO2 it seems to be much smaller than 1%. "
1472,Is it possible to know what was the flow direction in a pegmatite dike?,"The following picture (Painted wall cliff in the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, Colorado, USA) shows a pegmatite dike: is it possible to tell what was the flow direction? From thin (see below the printed 1 in the picture) to thick (2) or from thick to thin?   "
1473,does silt form from sand ; does clay form from silt,"I believe that sand, silt, clay are defined by size. But are they also generated by different processes and from different materials? Alternatively do sand particles ultimately weather to make silt, and do silt particles ultimately weather to make clay? "
1474,Climate change research and policy,How impactful is climate change scientific research on climate change policy? Are there any statistics which help to visualise the effectiveness of new scientific findings or new technology innovation inducing a change in government policy to help kerb climate change? Even any papers regarding this will be appreciated. 
1475,Derive Reference Potential Evapotranspiration from Potential Evapotranspiration,"I'm working on a project in Rajasthan, India involving modelling water supply and demand in a catchment. For this, I am working with WEAP which has modules for estimating groundwater recharge using a simple bucket model.  This model needs daily temperature and reference (potential) evapotranspiration values. The reference evapotranspiration is calculated according to the modified Penman-Monteith equation as described in the FAO56-Paper. As part of the project, I'd like to use climate models. One with a sufficient resolution is the HAR model, which has values for potential evapotranspiration. Is there a way to get from potential evapotranspiration to the reference evapotranspiration?  EDIT: I am not sure whether the model Potential Evapotranspiration values implicitly contain information about the surface, or if they are a spatially comparable, independent of the surface.  Since I am modeling the catchment disaggregated by landuse types with a uniform climate, I need a value that is independent of the surface properties and can be transferred to the landuse types via the surface coefficients as described in the FAO paper. "
1476,Why does Australia have no chrome?,"I've been trying to collect resource data about Australia for a few years. Some good reference sites are AustraliaMinerals.gov.au and AustralianMinesAtlas.gov.au  Australia seems to be pretty rich in minerals, including iron, copper, nickel, gold, titanium, uranium, and I think lithium and Rare-Earth elements too. But one thing I have never found is chromium. Chrome is essential in the steel industry.  So I'd like to know why. What geological features does Australia lack that make it lacking in chrome? Or do geologists believe that there's a realistic chance that a good chrome deposit is hidden somewhere? And where could that be? "
1477,"Were there any plans or proposals for ""unilateral geoengineering deployments"" before this paper was publsihed?","I saw the catchy Phys.org news title Artificially cooling planet 'risky strategy,' new research shows and then looked at the open access article, in Nature Communications (14-Nov-2017 online) Impacts of hemispheric solar geoengineering on tropical cyclone frequency, Jones et al. doi:10.1038/s41467-017-01606-0     Abstract:      Solar geoengineering refers to a range of proposed methods for counteracting global warming by artificially reducing sunlight at Earth’s surface. The most widely known solar geoengineering proposal is stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), which has impacts analogous to those from volcanic eruptions. Observations following major volcanic eruptions indicate that aerosol enhancements confined to a single hemisphere effectively modulate North Atlantic tropical cyclone (TC) activity in the following years. Here we investigate the effects of both single-hemisphere and global SAI scenarios on North Atlantic TC activity using the HadGEM2-ES general circulation model and various TC identification methods. We show that a robust result from all of the methods is that SAI applied to the southern hemisphere would enhance TC frequency relative to a global SAI application, and vice versa for SAI in the northern hemisphere. Our results reemphasise concerns regarding regional geoengineering and should motivate policymakers to regulate large-scale unilateral geoengineering deployments. (emphasis added)   The paper seems to warn against single-hemisphere solar geoengineering. Was that the plan to begin with, and nobody until now thought that cooling one hemisphere but not the other one might be problematic?  Or is this paper simply stating something more common-sense, for example ""if you do it wrong, it won't work right"".  Was there in fact any plan for unilateral geoengineering deployments before this was published, or is there a bit of grandstanding along with the science? "
1478,Gypsum saturation index,"I did some geochemical modelling and found groundwater samples I have are saturated with respect to the mineral gypsum. I need some help with interpretation, more information is given below.   The groundwater comes from an engineered aquifer that is comprised of sand. Prior to construction, the sand was in contact with water containing high sulfate and calcium concentrations (dissolved gypsum). There was also some pyrite oxidation occurring which undoubtedly lead to increased sulfate concentrations.   Does my geochemical modelling work give evidence that the groundwater dissolved [tex] and [tex] concentrations are in equilibrium with solid phase gypsum? meaning the mineral is present even though it was completely dissolved initially?  thanks "
1479,What is the global distribution of oil filled geodes?,"In a general 40 mile radius of Keokuk, Iowa many sedimentary geodes can be found.  They are abundant in the Warsaw Formation with the type section at Geode Glenn in Warsaw, Illinois.  In one specific area in Hancock County, Illinois geodes filled with oil can be found.        According to the source of these images:     Research indicates that nearby oil deposits from Pennsylvanian-age   rocks may somehow be linked to these interesting geodes.  Oil is able   to migrate quite readily through certain soils and rock, and the   conditions at the oil geode location may indicate a favorable   environment for oil to reach the surface as the host rock that   contains the geodes at this location is also frequently covered with a   slick of oil.   Unfortunately, I'm not able to find the source of the research backing this statement.  It seems plausible that oil from an overlying formation could be the source of the oil in the geodes and enter the geode via the pore space or any cracks.  Please correct me if this supposition is off base.    I've also heard that oil filled geodes have been found in quarries in eastern Iowa.  However, I have not seen evidence of these geodes myself or seen anything written about them.  My question is if anybody could provide any information about oil filled geodes from any other locations globally?  Revision:  I discovered another location associated with the New Albany Shale in Kentucky where geodes containing bitumen have been found.  There is also a geochemical report investigating the source of the bitumen included with this publication.  Hopefully there are still more sites out there or are the conditions that create these geodes really this rare? "
1480,In which ways is soot the perfect absober of infrared and the absorber of ultraviolet?,"In other question we've been discussing factors of the nuclear winter effect, soot among them. In this one I'd like to narrow the list down to soot, more precisely to ask about its ability to absorb ultraviolet and re-radiate infrared.  An argument by the other member goes like this:     Nuclear winter (solar radiation blocked by soot) wouldn’t be that   troublesome. High altitude soot is the “perfect” absorber and   reradiator of infrared energy. Nights would be warmer –as are normal   cloudy nights- and days a bit cooler. Some energy would be lost by   reradiation to space but most conserved by earthward reradiation of   ultraviolet converted to infrared by soot absorption. – TomO   It is not clear to me in what ways can this property of soot contribute to the nuclear winter effect or have an impact on climate. Especially I had hard time in understanding the last part of the argument, bolded (by me) Can anyone explain this mechanism and elaborate on it? Are there studies/sources that back the statement or challenge it?  Thanks in advance. "

1482,Limitations on mineral precipitation from solution,"If the solubility constant for a mineral is exceeded and, thermodynamically, a mineral is favored to precipitate in solution, are there any factors that may limit this from happening? Perhaps kinetics? Is it known if calcite precipitates out faster than dolomite does?   Also what will happen once a mineral precipitates out? Will concentrations decrease until the solution is saturated with respect to the mineral?   Thank you "
1483,Was the small Vanuatu Tsunami detected by remote monitors in the ocean before it reached land?,"The 20-Nov-2017 Reuters News item Small tsunamis detected in New Caledonia and Vanuatu after magnitude 7 undersea quake says:     Small tsunamis were detected and waves may have reached up to one meter (three feet) above the high tide level in parts of New Caledonia and smaller in Vanuatu, the PTWC said.   The PTWC is the The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center.   Were Tsunami-like changes in sea level detected automatically and forwarded to some center before they reached any shoreline, or does ""detected"" refer to the relatively small tsunami wave shown in (for example) this or this YouTube video?

1484,High resolution global land use projections,"I am looking for global land use projections for a large scale hydrological analysis. The most widely used datasets are the LUH (v1) Products used for CMIP5 based on Hurtt et al 2011. These products have been recently updated for the preparation of the CMIP6 climate experiments (LUH v2).  LUH v1 products are available at a spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees. I am looking for something a little more detailed.   I am aware of a downscaling project implemented by researchers at CSIRO (Hoskins et al 2016). The output of this exercise is available as Global 30s (~1km) resolution land use for 2005. Unfortunately, this dataset is available only for the year 2005.   Could anyone suggest a similar product, even a bit coarser (&lt;=10 km resolution), for the future projections?  EDIT: the kind of data I'm looking for has to be based on CMIP5 LU projections (LUH v1) to ensure consistency with the Land Cover used for the climate projections (from the General Circulation of Earth System Models). In case this does not exist, does anyone know an efficient algorithm I can use to downscale LUH v1?     Thank you.   "
1485,Dolomite and calcite precipitation,"In an engineered wetland,  there is groundwater flow from an aquifer with a chemical composition that is rich in magnesium, calcium and sulfate. We are finding that the aquifer is consistently saturated with respect to dolomite and calcite. Similarily, the wetland is also saturated and slightly oversaturated with respect to those minerals, however concentrations of both mg and ca are higher in the wetland than the aquifer. We were expecting concentrations to be similar given saturation with respect to the carbonate minerals. So we are hypothesizing the following:   Alkalinity is much higher in the wetland than in the aquifer, probably due to more extensive CO2 production. Given there is more CO2 in this region, this would enhance the dissolution of dolomite and calcite and therefore cause the increase in both magneaium and calcium. However, we are not sure if those minerals can form in a short period? The system was constructed about one year ago. If the minerals are unlikely to be present and it is by chance that groundwater is oversaturated, then what can be causing the increase in both magnesium and calcium? I know cation exchange should remove those ions from solution and not the other way around.   Any help is greatly appreciated.  "
1486,Understanding the sunshine duration metric,"I am trying to create a program that calculates the ideal climate based on a set of inputs and weights. Something similar to 400 cities but based on more climate based options that the user can configure. Some example questions;   What is your ideal daily mean temperature, answer must be between 0-40(celsius) ? how important is this, answer 1-5 with 5 being the most important ? How important is it for you to be near the mountains, answer 1-5 with 5 being the most important ?   One of the problems I am having is with the sunshine duration metric as calculated by the Campbell–Stokes recorder.  DISCLAIMER 1: All stats below are approximations / anecdotal DISCLAIMER 2: I may need some statistical calculations explained.  Taking some rough figures from wiki, Los Angeles has 3254 hours of sunshine and London has 1633 hours per year. Maximum sunshine duration in a day is approximately 4380 hours giving LA a sunshine 74% of the days on average and London sunshine 37% of the day on average so we could roughly say that LA has 2x the sunshine hours of London  This does not make sense to me. I want to initially create a metric that more accurately represents the quality of weather. I would then like to refine it to give a metric (configurable) like 'good days' that may need to pass params like > 25C, sunny > 70% of day, cloud coverage &lt; 20%, UV strength > 4.   For example (my brother lives in LA) in August this year there were 25 days in LA that were 'sunny days', lets say sunny for > 70% of the day. In London there were 4, giving values of 83% and 13% approx so we could roughly say that LA has 6X more sunny days per month than London.   My questions are;   Why do the number of sun hours in London seem so high when anecdotally the difference is much much larger.  Where can I find data that is more suitable for my project or alter the data on sunshine hour to suit it.   Many thanks. "

1488,To what extent is hydroelectric power really renewable?,"One of the more widespread ""renewable"" ways of generating power is by harnessing hydropower, i.e. by exploiting the movement of falling or flowing water. Some of the most commonly seen implementations are river dams and tidal power stations.   All hydroelectric power stations obviously remove some kinetic energy from the water, usually by requiring it to turn a turbine. What I'm curious about is whether the removal of this energy is actually sustainable, i.e. whether energy is introduced back into these bodies of water at such a rate that we don't need to worry about depleting our bodies of water of kinetic energy.  Some might say that removing kinetic energy from the oceans on that scale is an obvious impossibility, but this strikes me as a foolish assumption in light of the dilution hypothesis, which clearly turned out false. Two-hundred years ago, people assumed that the oceans were so incredibly vast that man could never have an environmental impact on them. Today, here we stand, with oceanic acidification, warming, and overfishing being prime environmental concerns.   The exact same question and argument can be repeated for wind energy.   Do we have any idea exactly what the patterns and rates of energy transfer into our planet's water (and wind) systems are?   What are the potential environmental impacts of the large-scale removal of kinetic energy from our bodies of water?   (Note: among these environmental impacts, please don't focus on well-known impacts like damage to local ecosystems, loss of land, noise pollution, etc. I am chiefly interested in how this way of generating power affects our natural systems of energy storage and circulation, like oceanic and wind currents.)  The following question is off-topic, but it's a good follow-up: how is energy even introduced into our oceanic and wind current-systems? For example, I assume the moon's push-pull is responsible for the tidal movement of the oceans. What impact does the sun play? How fast is this entire system of energy transfer?  Comment: I strongly endorse the use of wind and hydropower as sources of energy over the further use of fossil fuels. However, I still think it is important to do research into the actual renewability of presumed-renewable energy sources, as we don't want to end up with another fossil fuel-type situation, in which we become aware of dependency on these energy sources and their malignant environmental side-effects long after widespread enthusiastic adoption.

1489,Does the long-term ice-core temperature record provide reasonable evidence that the current temperature trend is not anthropogenic?,"When looking at the long term ice-core temperature record, it very clearly shows a ~100,000 year cyclical trend with warming spikes and gradual cooling. To the untrained eye, it seems that such a trend has not been significantly deviated from so far (in the present day). This would indicate to me that the current upward temperature trend is not human-caused. What refutes that idea?  Also a relevant question: what is the confidence of this temperature record and what are the probable deviations from the temperatures indicated in that graph? "
1490,Are there measurement techniques that can help determine the exact geometry of a volcanic vent?,"In a previous question What happens to the higher frequency content of the tremors associated with a volcanic eruption?, I asked about the high(er) frequency content of a volcanic eruption.  In the same vein, I'm interested to know more about the influence of the geometry of the magma column on this particular frequency content and the methodologies that researchers use to take measurements of circular vents.  Assuming a uniform cylinder all the way to the magma chamber would aid in the mechanical modeling, but I'm sure this betrays quite a bit of the changes in diameter that take place along the way.  Are precise measurements of the vents/magma conduits of volcanoes currently possible, or is this too big of a risk to personnel and equipment?  Which particular techniques (e.g., radar/sonar) would work without having to actually enter the chamber? "
1491,Paleogeographic atlas software,"I am looking for a paleogeographic atlas software, like the one used here at min 10:15: you can navigate through the ages with an arrow and visualize a reconstruction of the geographic features of any area of the world in a certain age:    Has anyone got any suggestion?

1492,How much have global GPP and biomass changed over Earth's history?,"I'm curious about how much is known about this topic: how much has the total amount of life on Earth changed over the 4 billion years or so that it has existed on this planet?   Are there estimates of global Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), or biomass, or both, for previous geological epochs? If so, how certain are these estimates, and what assumptions are they based on?   If the total figures are thought to have changed much in the past, what are the main factors thought to cause these changes? Conversely, if the totals are thought to have been relatively stable, what are the main feedbacks that are thought to have ensured this? "
1493,Why are titanium oxides lumped in with magnetite for the purposes of analyzing water bubble nucleation?,"I was reading a bit about the fluid mechanics of volcanoes to further understand some of the dynamics of ""magma wagging"" from my earlier question.  From [2]:     Heterogeneous nucleation, in which the presence of certain crystals (e.g., Fe-Ti oxides) provides nucleation substrates because they lower surface tension, can greatly   reduce [tex] to less than a few megaPascals (Gardner &amp; Denis 2004, Hurwitz &amp; Navon 1994).    I became curious as to what was so special about the Fe-Ti oxides that makes them good nucleation sites, so I looked up [1].  I stumbled upon a different problem, though.  In their procedure, they claimed:      Fe-Ti oxides are either blocky or needle-shaped. Blocky ones   are 0.5–5[tex]m in size and those large enough were identified   with an electron microprobe as titano-magnetite, here after   referred to as magnetite.   Do mixed Fe-Ti oxides essentially have the same physical properties as magnetite?  If the physical properties are in fact even slightly different, why would they be lumped together for analysis in these nucleation studies?     References:         Gardner, J.E. and Denis, M-H.

1494,"Why are alkali basalts found at rifting centres and on top of 'plumes', whereas MORBs are generally tholeiitic?","So I was essentially wondering why it was that the basalts on top of 'plumes' at 'hotspots' (sometimes called OIBs, ocean island basalts) and at continental rifting centres are enriched in alkaline metals (Na and K) compared to the tholeiitic MORBs.   Also, I was wondering if someone could explain to me chemically why it is that alkali basalts are more 'mature' than tholeiites? I.e. Is it that the ions are more incompatible than the calcium ions found in the tholeiites? Why is this?  "
1495,Why is aerodynamic resistance defined inversely?,"When I think of wind resistance, I always think of the friction co-efficient, in [tex], because that's always the way that it was presented in highschool and undergraduate physics.  But in land surface modelling, aerodynamic resistance (basically, how much the roughness of the surface slows air movement down), is defined inversely. For example, this presentation states on page 18 that:        [tex] = [tex]wind speed, atmospheric stability, surface roughness[tex]   [tex] decreases with increasing wind speed   [tex] increases with increasing stability   [tex] decreases with increasing surface roughness      and then gives a bunch of examples in [tex]:  Surface type   ra (s.m^-1) Ocean          200 Grass          70 Crops          20-50 Forest         5-10   To me, it seems really counter intuitive (""resistance is higher over grass than over a forest""?). Is the some benefit to defining resistances this way, or is this just some annoying historical mistake? "
1496,How does the composition of volcanic rock change as it makes its ascent towards the surface?,"A schematic for the fluid mechanics of a volcano is represented below.    Graciously borrowed from Figure 1 of the reference cited below   From the caption of that figure:     During explosive eruptions, bubble walls rupture catastrophically at the   fragmentation surface. The released gas expands rapidly and magma ascent changes from a viscous melt with suspended bubbles to a gas flow with suspended magma fragments.   My assumption is that this boundary between the magma column and the steam above it is critical to the crystallization of the minerals to form the volcanic rock.    Does the composition of the volcanic rock change drastically according to the distance between the magma column and the mouth of the volcano at the time the rock is formed?  (Or) do the rocks melt and recrystallize frequently as the boundary moves, only attaining their final composition before they are ejected into the air?   How important is the steam/air interface at the top of the volcano to the rock's formation?     I realize this is going to change based on the composition of the magma itself, but I'm looking for the behavior of an ""average"" rock species, though specific examples are great, too.

1497,What makes the conditions at the core/mantle boundary ideal for aluminum to combine with other elements besides oxygen?,"Recently, steinhardite was accepted as a new mineral by the International Mineralogical Association.  It's quite an interesting story in its own right. There's an interesting article in New Scientist about it, but it's paywalled.  The formula for steinhardite is [tex].  It's an ultra-rare quasicrystal, at least partially because of the mixture of aluminum without oxygen, as I understand it.  One of the critics (as quoted in the article)     ... who promptly declared the possibility   of the sample being natural as ‘‘impossible’’. His   concern was not the degree of perfection but,   rather, the baffling presence of metallic Al in   cupalite, khatyrkite and in the icosahedral   quasicrystal phase. Metallic Al has a remarkably   strong affinity for O, such that it could not   possibly form naturally on the surface of the   Earth, he argued ... he amended the conclusion to allow for the   improbable possibility that it could have formed   under the intense heat and pressure that exist near   the core mantle boundary or in a high impact   collision of meteors in space. [1]   The core/mantle boundary is obviously rife with lots of chemical interactions, but what is it exactly about the conditions that prevents aluminum from oxidizing?  Is it just physical pressure or the presence of other gases?    There's the obvious fact that the aluminum isn't exposed to the atmosphere, but my (limited) understanding is that oxygen is plentiful in combination with other elements like silicon.

1498,"Zeolites, odor control, and the witchcraft of sunlight","Various companies offer ""volcanic crystals"" or ""volcanic rock"" available in small mesh bags for odor control.  The best description I have found is that these are made up largely of Zeolites.  All of these manufacturers suggest that the rocks will trap odors and to just recharge the rocks every 6 months by putting it out in direct sunlight.  This sounds like witchcraft!  Can someone explain why putting the rocks in sunlight (versus other light) recharges them and makes them effective at trapping odors again?  How does the light ""release"" the odor?  Is it the heat of the sunlight, or could this be used in the winter as well? "
1499,What are the factors that dictate a given topology for seismometer placement around a volcano?,"The image below (borrowed from [#1]) shows the topology of the seismometers around the volcano Stromboli.    In the text, they explain the following:     The seimometers were set on the   flanks of the volcano, forming three rings around the crater   area at different altitudes (top, middle and bottom ring indicated   on the map with the letters T, M, B, respectively). The   distances of the stations from the crater zone ranged from 0.3   to 2.2 km.    What are the factors that dictate a given topology for seismometer placement around a volcano?  There are probably some obvious rules of thumb in terms of placing them at different elevations and placing them outside of any lava paths or areas showered with debris.   Is the soil around the volcano homogeneous enough to produce a response that radiates outward at the same rate?  If not, shouldn't the sensors be placed in concentric circles to capture the arrival times for the waves?      Reference:         De Lauro, E,De Martino, S, Falanga, M, and Palo, M. (2006).

1503,Can a 99.9% probability of an M≥ 5 earthquake within a 3-year period be verified?,"Paper:  Potential for a large earthquake near Los Angeles inferred from the 2014 La Habra earthquake (2015)  Obviously there has been much discussion on  the viability of earthquake prediction. This recent paper presents some rather bold claims:     The calculated probability for a M ≥ 6 earthquake within a circle of   radius 100 km, and over the 3 years following 1 April 2015, is 35%.   For a M ≥ 5 earthquake within a circle of radius 100 km, and over the   3 years following 1 April 2015, the probability is 99.9%   On the other hand, the USGS is saying those figures are too high:     The USGS conducts its own look at quake risk in California — the most   recent version is called Uniform California Earthquake Rupture   Forecast, Version 3. Jones said that, according to those models, there is only an 85   percent chance of a magnitude 5 or 6 quake in the same region over a   three-year period. ""It's nowhere near a 99.9 percent number,"" Jones said.   USGS released a statement on its Facebook page saying that the lack of   details on how this number was reached ""makes a critical assessment of   this approach very difficult.""   The LA Times has it reported here: [website]  The study’s lead author, Jet Propulsion Laboratory principal research scientist Andrea Donnellan, said in an interview that the 99.9% figure was not a central conclusion of the paper and should not be viewed as an official forecast.   “As scientists, we were not putting out an official forecast. We were putting out something in a paper to test,” Donnellan said.   Donnellan said she considers the 99.9% number a test of a model, or algorithm, on the probability of future earthquakes.    “We never said in this paper we were predicting an earthquake. And we said that's the probability of an event,"" Donnellan said. ""There is still a 0.1% chance it won't happen. So we need to test it. And that's what we are doing as scientists.""

As a corollary are there any rivers today which contain evidence of an opposite flow direction in the past, as a consequence of the above? Such cases, if they exist, would be interesting mirrors to the idea of continental rifting's contribution to river flow reversal (I'm thinking of the extraordinary discovery of the River Amazon's former east-to-west flow before South America rifted away from Africa: [website]Reference: Continental collision Continental drift "
1506,Is this scientific explanation of The Bible flood accurate?,"I googled ""the flood and freshwater fish"" and came up with this question Christianity StackExchange: How did Noah preserve fresh water fish?.

My questions are:   What was the ocean salinity around 2500 BC, and could freshwater fish tolerate that level of salinity? If the ocean was much less saline, is it possible to have increased to present day levels in 4500 years?  "
1507,How accurate is the law of superposition?,"Recently I started being more interested in the rational details of the sciences (... being often challenged about them by a creationist friend) and one of the creationist 'theories' I've encountered is how the law of superposition - i.e. the claim that layers of rocks form with the top layer being younger than the bottom - can be falsified. They mentioned some creationist experiments where layers formed 'sideways' and used it as one of the arguments to 'prove' that Earth does not have to be millions of years old.  Now I do not want to engage in a theological discussion, but I was wondering how accurate law of superposition is. Most articles I've read refer to it as an axiom of geology - i.e. something that is assumed, rather than proved. At the same time I am aware of the fact that it's a ""first level big picture axiom"", in that everyone is aware of the fact that under special circumstances the details get a bit foggy, but looking at the whole world it is correct ""often enough"" to warrant making it an axiom to simplify the theory for beginning geologists.  Thus my question is: In the global scope, how significant are the deviations from law of superposition in the structure of Earth's strata? Would you say less than 1% of the world show any significant deviation from the law?  I apologise for any jargon misunderstandings I may have committed. "

1515,What are the environmental effects of leaking hydrogen from large-scale energy storage mechanisms?,"I recently have calculated the total cost of an energy system that is based on wind power as the primary power source and hydrogen as the energy storage mechanism. The total system costs are approximately similar to a system based only on new nuclear power plants built according to current regulations in the current market conditions. All of this is somewhat roughly estimated, as we don't know how much electrolyzers, hydrogen storage solutions, and hydrogen to electricity conversion in turbines or fuel cells costs in very large scales.  However, hydrogen needs to be stored somewhere. Its energy density by weight is extremely high, but energy density by volume is very low, even when compressed or liquefied. There are several solutions:   Liquid hydrogen. Unfortunately, the energy efficiency of liquid hydrogen is low. Also, even with thermally isolated containers, the hydrogen needs to gradually leak away. Compressed hydrogen stored in pipelines. Unfortunately, hydrogen causes embrittlement of steel, possibly leading to hydrogen leaks. Storage in old mines, old depleted oil/gas fields, etc. However, hydrogen could theoretically leak.   All of these solutions have the possibility that hydrogen will leak away.  Therefore, my questions are:   What are the environmental effects of hydrogen leaked to the atmosphere? What is the atmospheric lifetime of hydrogen? What is the global warming potential of hydrogen on timescales that matter (let's say 20 years or 100 years)? What is the mechanism of removal from the atmosphere? Oxidation to water, or similar to helium: escaping to space? Is the usage of hydrogen as an energy storage mechanism even justified based on the environmental effects, or are the effects so bad that it makes sense to continue burning of fossil fuels or reconsider nuclear energy?

Searching online I have found mostly articles on theoreticly based studies on tipping point theory and some speculating on the consequences that may occur due to global warming.    I am wondering if these tipping point theories are still all theoretical or are there any historical examples that provide as a base for these anticipated changes? For example, area the transitions between Eras and Periods also caused by tipping points or are they more gradual changes of the system because they occur on a very large timescale? "
1518,Why do we consider hydrostatic pressure and lithostatic pressure separately?,"In petroleum geology, why do we consider hydrostatic pressure and lithostatic pressure separately?  Surely the pressure at any point, whether fluid or rock, at depth is simply equal the weight of all the fluid and rock overlying it? Hence why isn't pressure for fluids and solids equal at a particular depth?  "
1519,"California length, source, and mouth of rivers","How can I find out / where can I find the length, ""source"" (beginning point), ""mouth"" (ending point) of the California portion of rivers?  For example, it's easy to find the length, source, and mouth of the Colorado River, which runs partly through California, but I'm just interested in the California part.  True, I can, through somewhat meticulous research, find the California beginning and ending of the Colorado River on a map, but where can I find the length?  ""Googling"" provides a plethora of info about the river as a whole, but no so much about just the California portion...  I have the same question for the Klamath (partly in Oregon) and Amargosa (partly in Nevada) rivers. "
1520,"Why exactly is the feature on Io called a volcano, and the feature on Enceladus called a geyser?","News of the long-lived and not unusual cloud on Mars associated with 21 km tall Olympus Mons has people commenting. This tweet by planetary scientist Dr. Tanya Harrison says     I don't understand the conspiracy theory contingent that's going off re: the clouds over Arsia Mons.       What possible reason would we have to hide volcanic eruptions on Mars? Heck, NASA has shared plenty of pics of volcanoes erupting on Io (shown here) &amp; geysers on Enceladus!   (see the tweet for the video)  Why exactly is the feature on Io called a volcano, and the feature on Enceladus called a geyser? I understand they are substantially different, but I'm asking about how the geological classification works on bodies with different materials and temperatures than those on Earth. "
1521,"Given a 3 box model of the atmosphere,determine fraction of mass transport from lower layer","  P = 300mb, Pot. Equiv. Temp = 375K     P = 600mb, Pot. Equiv. Temp = 325K    P = 900mb, Pot. Equiv. Temp = 350K      (surface)  Given that a deep convective plume sends a portion of the bottom layer to the top:  What fraction of the mass of the lower layer must rise in order to just barely stabilize the lower layer with respect to the middle layer?  How many millibars of environmental subsidence does this imply?  I need direction on how to begin this.  Which equation will assist with this answer.  My attempt:  If I remove a chuck sized [tex] from the bottom layer, it will contain [tex] the mass of the middle layer of same size.  So, is the answer simply [tex] of the mass must move out of the lower layer?  I believe I am wrong, it seems to be more involved than this, but I cannot grasp this concept.   "
1522,Judging wind speed based on flags and inland-water observations,"About a year ago, I took this video along the Hudson river in NY, and I'm trying to figure out the Beaufort number based on the water and the flags.  [website]The problem is that the Beaufort scale is based primarily on open sea waters (not protected/inland waters like the Hudson river).  The only mention in the scale relating to inland waters is force 5 (""crested wavelets (whitecaps) form on inland waters"") - but nothing related to the higher force numbers.  In this video, there are definitely lots of whitecaps, which leads me to believe that the wind was force 5 or higher.  Possibly even a 6.  Flags are another indicator; but here it is kind of vague.  At force 5, flags start rippling and flapping hard, and as the wind gets stronger, they start beating/snapping, until finally they are fully extended with only the very end flapping (force 7).  So looking at the flag in the video makes me think it's a 6.  What steady force/speed is the wind really blowing here?  What about gusts? "
1523,How was Venice flooded?,"If I understand this correctly, Venice was not flooded due to sudden rainfall causing rivers to overflow, but due to the high tides. These high tides were caused by an alignment of sun, which was expanding the waters of the oceans disproportionately on one hemisphere and moon, which shifted the center of gravity of the moon-earth system in such a way that water rose on the same hemisphere.  In the news articles that I see, they also mention strong winds. This would make sense. High baseline + waves = a lot of water in the city. But in these photos everything seems to be calm. No waves, no wind, just an abnormally high level of water:  [website]For me this doesn't make any sense. If the winds subsided and the flooding was caused purely by tidal effects, which are astronomical events, shouldn't it have been predictable months, if not years in advance? "
1524,Global Gridded Daily Temperature (at 2m): difference between GEFS Reforcast and NCEP Reanalysis,"I am looking for gridded/raster estimates of daily mean temperature (ideally ambient/at 2 meter) for a public health analysis. Specifically, I want to correlate daily mortality counts with daily mean ambient temperature (globally, between the years 1990-2016). I want to use gridded data rather than nearby temperature stations to allow for some extrapolation to areas without stations with long time series (e.g. large swaths of sub-Saharan Africa).  The accuracy of temperature in terms of degrees is somewhat less important relative to the accuracy of day-to-day variability for this project.  It seems like the GEFS Reforcast and NCEP Reanalysis products both provide daily mean temperature at a global extent, albeit at different spatial resolutions. I've looked at the documentation and underlying papers, but my earth science background is weak and I can't really suss out the difference between the two products.  Is one product substantially better than the other for global mean ambient temperature estimates? Is there a simple difference between the two products that I've missed?  Parameters I care about (roughly in order):   Daily measurement of mean temperature with global coverage High spatial resolution Accuracy of day to day variation (e.g. if day 1 was X degrees hotter than day 2, is that reflected?) Accuracy of daily mean estimate  "
1525,How does quartz form in calcite veins?,"This question might be a bit silly, but I have to ask since I am very curious and I did not find any good answer. I visited two places, where quartz crystals (var. smoky quartz) occurs - and both sites are pretty similar and could host the same formation process.    My question is - could you explain how exactly these crystals of quartz could form in calcite veins in limestone ? Hydrothermal fluids ? What does it mean, could it be easily described ? Where did the SiO2 come from ? Was there any radiation, too ? "
1526,How to identify low or high pressure area,"If rain is due to the flow of humid air from a high pressure area to a low pressure area, without the use of devices, technology or mass media is it possible to detect regions of high or low atmospheric pressure and know their locations?  For example: from my terrace or open land - and how do I spot regions of low or high atmospheric pressure? "
1527,Computing Isentropic Potential Vorticity from Hybrid Sigma Pressure levels,"My task is to compute isentropic potential vorticity on a grid. All data (ECMWF ens) are given on a hybrid sigma pressure grid. Since I really cannot find reference, I assume (!) that relative vorticity (vo, id=138) is evaluated on model levels and therefore is useless for me.  My approach (for each grid point):   Compute theta-gradient, using the three model dimensions, converting vertical and horizontal distances to meters. Define two vectors using three constraints each:   Scalar product with theta gradient vanishes. First vector has no meridional, second one no zonal component. Distance to adjacent horizontal grid point defines magnitude of  meridional/zonal component.  These two vectors now span a plane tangential to the isentropic surface at the current grid point. They point to positions only vertically displaced from the horizontal neighbours of the current grid point. Values of u and v are interpolated - again, using meters (geopotential height) - to the locations given by the tangent vectors. The geometrical length of these tangent vectors is determined and used together with the interpolated values of u and v to compute isentropic relative vorticity. Static stability is computed using values of pressure and theta at current point and vertical neighbour. Using gravitational acceleration and the conversion factor of 10^-6, I use the equation given in the famous book by Wallace &amp; Hobbs for Potential Vorticity: [tex]   My problem:  The result does not look like what I expect. Values range from around -30 to +50 pvu throughout the atmosphere, while the 1.5pvu surface clearly does not depict the tropopause. It looks more like an accident. I am using ""omp"" to increase computation speed, but things look the same if I don't use it, too, so it cannot be index confusion.  My question:  What could be wrong? Can you spot systematic errors? Maybe I got blind with time. Do you know reference for how relative vorticity is evaluated in the ECMWF model? (I tried, really...)  To be more specific: My method is to be implemented in C++ into an already existing environment to visualize NWP data in 3D in realtime. The basic datafields - given in hybrid sigma coordinates - are read, processed, written into a derived data field, interpolated to and rendered on pressure levels as triggered by user interaction. The program should possess the processing methods on its own, which is why I cannot use Python packages, for example.  Here is the source code of my approach.  If something is unclear, please ask! Maybe somebody will spot an error.   // ISENTROPIC POTENTIAL VORTICITY // Input grids : 0 t, 1 q, 2 u, 3 v, 4 sfcPhi, 5 sfc t_d, 6 sfc t, 7 sfc p, 8 sfc u, 9 sfc v else if ( (derivedVarName == ""Isentropic PV (an)"")      || (derivedVarName == ""Isentropic PV (fc)"")      || (derivedVarName == ""Isentropic PV (ens)"") ) {     unsigned int k, j, i;

1529,Snow thunderstorms,So why are snow thunderstorms so rare? I researched a bit and it said that it is because there is less moisture in the air. But the percentage of thunderstorms while raining seems much higher than the the percentage of thunderstorms while snowing. Less moisture would only prove why there are less snowstorms correct? 
1530,Rising sea level: flooding of iconic buildings,"I realize that this question may be arguably off-topic, but there doesn't seem to be a stack exchange specific to oceanography, geography, or architecture.   With rising sea level in mind, how high above sea level are the front doors of 'at risk' iconic structures, such as the One World Trade Center in New York, the Opera House in Sydney, and the Shanghai Tower? If it is true that sea level will ultimately rise not less than six metres (albeit not for several centuries hence), then will these buildings all become islands?  "
1531,Are Helium 3 and 4 being produced by earth's core?,"J. Marvin Herndon claims that the evidence of the georeactor comes from 3He/4He ratios released to the oceans at the mid oceanic ridges. Georeactor-produced 3He/4He ratios are related to the extent of actinide fuel consumption at time of production and are high near the end of the georeactor lifetime. Georeactor numerical simulation results and the observed high 3He/4He ratios measured in Icelandic and Hawaiian oceanic basalts indicate that the demise of the georeactor is approaching. Is Herndon correct in claiming that the 3He and 4He in oceanic basalt are being produced by a georeactor in the Earth's core? If not, what is their origin?  Reference: Nuclear georeactor origin of oceanic basalt 3He/4He, evidence, and implications (or as PDF). "
1532,What kind of storm tracks produce snow in the eastern United States?,"What storm tracks are favorable for snow in the eastern United States? Articles like this one on a winter storm in the Northeast in 2011 indicate that storm tracks are important in snowfall amounts. But other winter storm tracks seem to produce more maritime tropical weather.   I know the heaviest snow usually falls to the west of the storm track where the cold air is located, but why do some storm tracks not produce any snow at all?  What influences the storm tracks that causes them to be prolific sometimes and duds other times? "
1533,Are there rules to estimate average temperature,"I have temperature data from a weather station, but there are missing data (not more than 80% of the daily temperature observations). The World Meteorological Organization has some rules to validate estimations of monthly temperatures, etc. (for example to have 80% of the data). But since my periods of time are related to the lifecycle of the migratory species I am studying, for example: 1) arrival to the breeding ground and egg laying is from 20-May to 20-Jun (31 days) 2) incubation is from 21-Jun to 15 July (24 days) 3) brood rearing is from 16-July to 15-Aug (30 days)  Do you know if there are some other rules? for example when my period of time is &lt;30 days? Does the same rule would apply for the incubation period, even if it is shorter than one month?   thanks a lot for your advice/suggestions "

1535,"How is it determined whether an air pollutant is ""hazardous""?","The US EPA has a list of 187 air pollutants that they consider ""hazardous"".  These toxic pollutants are known or suspected to cause cancer or other serious health conditions.  How is it determined whether an air pollutant is hazardous? I'm mainly curious how the list of 187 pollutants was determined. Is there a testing process to determine toxicity that is used? or some other method that distinguishes a pollutant's toxicity?  I suspect it could've been done with just literature review, but then I would expect the list to be revised regularly based on health studies. "
1536,How much of the Earth's heat is caused by the hot centre?,What is the percentage of the Earth's warmth that the Earth's hot centre is responsible for? What would be the temperature of the atmosphere if the Earth's centre was 18° C (average temperature on the surface)? 
1537,"When metamorphic rocks undergo pressure, how are they changed?","When metamorphic rocks undergo pressure they are changed, but how are they changed? Do they become fragments of rocks? Doesn't that mean that the difference between sedimentary rocks and metamorphic rocks (when talking about fragment rocks) is that sedimentary rocks undergo weathering, which makes them fragments and metamorphic rocks undergo immense pressure which makes it into fragments? "
1538,How to convert soil moisture units from meteorological model?,"I am using the outputs of the ALADIN meteorological model, in particular I need volumetric soil moisture. However, the output from ALADIN is in ""funny"" units - [tex] per top 1 cm. Is it acceptable to assume water density [tex] and calculate as follows: [tex]? So basically just take the values and divide them by 10? I don't need to be extra scientific, but I don't want to miss anything crucial. "
1539,Can a sonar used to graph the ocean floors detect through polluted and highly populated waters?,"So graphing the ocean floors using sonar is not anything new. But what are the limits to sonar?  Would it be possible for a regular sonar device to emit sounds that are strong enough to penetrate through polluted waters? And if they can, how much pollution is needed to block the sonar completely? And by pollution I mean plastic waste (bottles, bags, etc).  Also, would highly populated waters be a problem? I'm talking about corals, fish, algae, and others. I'm pretty sure just one fish wouldn't do much, but what about a whale? Or a swarm of fish? "
1540,"If two adjacent tectonic plates are moving in the same direction, is there significant interaction at the boundary?","If two adjacent tectonic plates are moving in the same direction, is there significant interaction at the boundary? Is it just a convergent boundary if one moves faster and ""catches up"" with the other?

1544,Is the rainforest too wet to burn?,"I want to know if a living rainforest in the Amazon, completely untouched by humans, is too wet for the fire to spread, even in the dryer months around July?  I.e. if somebody dropped 5000 gallons of gasoline there, put it on fire, would the fire spread, or would it die out after the gas has burned, because it is still too wet there?  Or is it that the only areas that burn are those where the trees have been cut down (deforestation), the dead trees and remaining vegetation then have to dry out during the (relatively, for a rainforest) dryer months, and only then are they able to burn? Or does the fire spread into the actual living rainforest? "
1545,Stop earth rotation around its axis,"I have a theoretical question. I have been reading on what would happen if the earth suddenly stopped rotating around its axis, and I have learned that would result in the annihilation of all life on the planet.

What is the optimal deceleration factor that would allow the earth to stop over time (and not suddenly), while allowing live to continue? How do I build a machine to slow down the earth to a complete stop, without destroying all life on planet?  Thanks. "
1546,Q: Is the crust getting thinner or is the mantle getting smaller,"Volcanoes spit out magma onto the surface of the crust or crevices on the surface, but the magma comes (in effect) from the mantle right? If that's the case, isn't the mantle turning into the crust by the mantle hardening into mountains and volcanoes? Or maybe the mantle doesn't change size, it just melts more of the crust to suit its size needs. If that was the case, the areas of Earth that aren't constantly spitting magma onto the surface would eventually be thinned out to the point that a hole or giant crack would appear leading straight to the mantle and that would be bad.

1567,Does seismic anisotropy follow stratigraphy?,"This question is in the context of velocity model building for reflection seismic imaging (between 0km and 10km in a sedimentary basin).  This is really a rock physics question disguised as an imaging question.  A brief description of what I am trying to do:  In order to perform seismic imaging (aka seismic migration), we assume that the velocity structure of the earth is known. This allows us to place the recorded reflection amplitudes in the correct location in 3D space to give us a real representation of the underlying geology (including depth, dips, and scaled reflection coefficients).  We can obtain this laterally varying velocity model from iterative traveltime tomography of the same data. We typically account for the polar velocity anisotropy (i.e. difference in velocity of the same rock when measured parallel vs perpendicular to bedding planes) in the form of Thomsen parameters, in a symmetry model usually called TTI (tilted transverse isotropy). The final model consists of 5 spatially varying parameters:   Theta (angle of structural dip, the axis of symmetry is assumed perpendicular to bedding) Phi (angle of structural strike, the axis of symmetry is assumed perpendicular to bedding)  V0 (velocity along this axis of symmetry) Epsilon (Thomsen parameter describing the magnitude of large angle anisotropy) Delta (Thomsen parameter describing the magnitude of small angle anisotropy)   Theta and Phi are easy to obtain directly from the seismic image (this is in part why this process is iterative).  An initial model for V0, epsilon, and delta is created from sparse well data and further detail is obtained between control points by using tomography. In practice, epsilon and delta are assumed to be linearly related and that the linear relation holds throughout the dataset (this is usually a good assumption).  This leaves us solving for really just two things in tomography: V0 and delta. However, there is an intrinsic non-uniqueness, made worse by noise, in which different combinations of V0 and delta explain the data equally well (i.e. image gather flatness).  So the motivation for my question is this: How can I use a priori geologic data to guide the solution of this ill-posed inverse problem?  I am very skeptical about having the geologic structure guide V0 since my dataset is in an active foreland basin with strong active deltaic deposition. This means that my sediments (structurally deformed progradational sand-shale sequences) are very unconsolidated and compaction (therefore, depth) is the main driver of velocity rather than stratigraphy. In other words, I expect velocity contours to cross structural ones in areas of high dip (and I have evidence of these normal compaction trends from well data).  Which now leads to my question: Can I use the geologic structure to guide my Thomsen delta (i.e. the degree of anisotropy)? Does it make sense to assume that even though compaction is the main driver for velocity in unconsolidated sediments, stratigraphy is the main driver of anisotropy?  Maybe a more useful question: What other measurements or observations would I need to make to validate or reject this assumption?  If this assumption makes sense, I can add the additional constraint (as a regularization term) to the tomographic inverse problem such that the solution for delta must (at least somewhat) follow the structural dip (i.e. theta and phi).  Thanks! "

1569,How is the distribution of Argo floats managed over the Earth's oceans?,"The BBC News article Climate change: Oceans 'soaking up more heat than estimated' mentions Argo floats as one technology to measure the temperature of the oceans, and links to argo.ucsd.edu where there is the map below that looks surprisingly uniform.  I had thought that an initial distribution of floating objects would, over the course of years, end up clumpy and gyre-bound. Is there something that is actively managing this uniformity, or at least passively maintaining it?  From the UCSD link:     What is Argo?      Argo is a global array of 3,800 free-drifting profiling floats that measures thetemperature and salinity of the upper 2000 m of the ocean.  This allows, for the first time, continuous monitoring of the temperature, salinity, and velocity of the upper ocean, with all data being relayed and made publicly available within hours after collection.

1570,Is there an atmospheric hydrogen cycle?,"There are various physical, chemical and biological processes that free up hydrogen from molecules (often hydrocarbons or water).  Once in the atmosphere, the hydrogen is lost to space (the Earth's gravity is too weak to hold onto it). So the Earth is losing hydrogen to space (perhaps at a very slow rate).  Is there any interaction between the Earth's atmosphere and high velocity protons in the solar wind (e.g. protons combining with atmospheric oxygen to form hydroxide) which is capable of balancing the hydrogen loss? How big is the hydrogen loss? Is the amount of hydrogen on Earth in equilibrium? "
1571,Why do tethered aerostats have lower persistence than stratospheric balloons?,"We have been thinking of using Aerostats/Balloons for an environmental monitoring project in our university. We have been considering 2 options: Tethered Aerostats (which fly upto 1 km) and Stratospheric Aerostats (upto 20 - 30 km).  As I was exploring the available options, I was surprised to find that Tethered Aerostats (i.e. low-altitude balloons, within 1km) have much less persistence in air than Stratospheric Balloons. E.g. Airstar's tethered balloons have maximum persistence of 15 days while their stratospheric versions can hover for upto 6 months.  What is the reason? Is it the wind speed? Or less density (but how would it affect)? Or maybe it's just they are designing the stratospheric balloons to last longer? "

1575,What formations are to be expected to develop between the transform boundaries of oceanic and continental plates?,"This could be needed in the Worldbuilding stack exchange instead of here, but when I was mapping out the movements of the tectonic plates, then there's a few locations where oceanic and continental plates are moving parallel to one another in opposite directions, creating transform boundaries.  I can't find anything regarding the formations that would arise from this, though I expect that something along the lines of cliffs might form, though this is pure speculation. What formations should I expect?  And as a side-note, I also found many cases of when one plate is moving parallel to the boundary, but the other plate is moving either convergent or divergent of that boundary. What formations should I expect from these as well? "
1576,Environmenal flow in the context of global gridded hydrological analyses,"Environmental flow (EF) is a widely used concept in river basin management and river ecology. There are more than 200 methods to estimate the flow that should be left to the rivers to ensure a sustainable resource management, and it is almost impossible to standardize a methodology that could be applied for each stream everywhere in the world.   Although some global exercises have been performed (IWMI for instance), in fact, the EF is extremely site and season specific: it depends on the natural conditions of the river, its hydrological, geo-morphological, and biological features, and its natural ecosystem. That for, the use of specific methodologies makes sense in the management of a specific river basin or a portion of it, but what about global hydrological analyses?   I am setting up a global gridded hydrological analysis and, while accounting for water uses, I would like to set up a threshold under which the water withdrawal is not allowed. I am thinking of using a percentile of the historical modeled monthly time series of discharge spanning a period of about 30 years. This would allow to set the threshold to a value for each month that is a percentile of the historical undisturbed (natural, with no fragmentation or withdrawal) discharge, for each of the grid-cells. Is this an acceptable approximation?  "

1579,How to obtain the correlation between monthly streamflows based on physical concepts?,"I've been tasked with generating synthetic streamflow scenarios through disaggregation.  First, I will generate 50 years of streamflow data. For that, I will probably use a simple model as AR(1) or an ARMA(1,1) and am adopting some probabilistic parameters based on streamflow data I have. These data come from the historical record a gauge station.  From my yearly flow, I have to generate monthly streamflows. In the end, instead of 50 streamflow realizations, each one representing an annual flow; I'll have 600 streamflow realizations, each representing a monthly stream flow.  Now, to get from annual to monthly stream flow, I will need a correlation matrix.  I could simply estimate the monthly correlation from January to December by calculating the correlation among monthly streamflows from a set of historical streamflow.  One could say that the physical aspects involving the (auto)correlation are implicit in the data itself. However, the data I have for this gauge station - as for any other - is only one realization of the stochastic process from which the observed streamflows were generated.  How, then, could I enrich this monthly (auto)correlation with physical concepts stemming from the river where the gauge station is located? I should add that my question also applies to cross-correlation between two different time-series. How, in that case, could I enrich the cross-correlation matrix employing physical aspects between 2 observed time-series? "
1580,Is the atmosphere becoming thicker?,"Is the atmosphere getting more dense with various gases, car pollution (200 million cars just in North America), factory pollution, more water vapor and denser cloud cover?

1581,What efforts have been made to separate the microseismic events related to wind-related ocean waves from the components of volcanic origin?,"I have read the question What generates the microseism? and it's accompanying answer.  In [#1, cited below], they use the azimuth values of seismographic activity on the flanks of the volcano Stromboli to discern where this microseismic ""noise"" is coming from:     The behaviour of polarisation at the east flank lets us suppose   that the microseismic noise comes from this direction.   This is the direction of the Scirocco wind (south, southeast   direction) that blows on Stromboli during summer season.   So, according the other answer on the site, these low frequency oscillations are due to the wind's effect on the waves of the ocean.  In the initial question that sparked the answer, it was cited the frequency of these ocean waves was 0.2 Hz, which is in the 0.1-0.5 Hz region that the Stromboli researchers were looking at.  The whole crux of the Stromboli paper was that the microseismic events (volcanic and non-volcanic) were enough to confound the separation of the tremor signals into independent components  These researchers were using independent component analysis (ICA) and were able to pull a 0.2 Hz and a 0.4 Hz component out of the mixture (likely corresponding to the 0.2 Hz ocean wave energy mentioned in the other question).      The remaining energy in the microseismic range (which can be seen in the first two components) is preventing further separation of the other components of the microseismic activity .  Stromboli has a constant tremor due to its ongoing activity, but have there been efforts elsewhere to suss out which of the microseismic activities are from sources in the ocean versus those coming from intermittent volcanic tremors?  Could this be achieved by using a combination of sensors, some in the ocean and some on land, or is this type of analysis not really useful?

1582,Equinoxes and solstices: start of the season or mid-season?,"In the United States, the upcoming autumnal equinox is marked on most calendars as the ""first day of autumn."" Similarly the solstices are commonly called the ""first day of summer"" and ""first day of winter."" However in most other languages -- and even in older discussions in English -- the solstices have names like ""Midsummer's Day"" and ""Midwinter's Day.""  Is there some sound reason (e.g. typical temperatures, asymmetrical sunrise/sunset times, thermal inertia, etc.) to consider a solstice as the first day of a new season, rather than the middle?   Also (perhaps less on-topic) is there any record of when the change in nomenclature took place in the U.S.? Are there similar discrepancies in other English-speaking countries or in other cultures? "
1583,"What is the mechanism behind changes in oxidation state (of iron, for example) as magma rises?","From this answer, I learned that rising magma may change oxidation state, which I wasn't aware of.   In [#1], the authors state in the abstract     The conventional view holds that the oxidation state of a mantle-derived degassed magma reflects its source   From other research that has been conducted, the authors discussed that the oxygen fugacity (the partial pressure of the ""non-ideal"" oxygen in the presence of the high pressures and temperatures, presumably of the magma itself) was controlled by a pair of redox reactions (their equations 11 and 12):  [tex] [tex]  Their claim is that the change in the [tex] to [tex] ratio is due to the top reaction being favored during decompression (due to the equilibrium shift from the changes in pressure).  I get all of that so far, I think.  My question is a more fundamental one, being, if this equilibrium (#11) governing the changes in oxidation states becomes more prevalent as the pressure decreases rapidly, what are the governing equations for when the magma is deeper in the earth?  Do they favor the bottom equation (#12) instead, or are the reactions at that temperature and pressure completely different?  It's possible I'm missing what the ""changing oxidation states"" aspect really means. A clarification of that would certainly be appreciated.

1584,How much fossil fuel came from the Carboniferous?,"It is said that most of the fossil fuels in existence today (coal, oil, gas) came from the Carboniferous period. A unique set of circumstances lead to the creation of fossil fuels, which depends on anaerobic decomposition:   Plants evolved bark as an effective defense against insect herbivores Very few organisms at the time could digest or decompose the bark fiber lignin   Suppose that the Carboniferous period never happened, or for whatever reason the period never produced fossil fuels. How much fossil fuel would we have today instead? How much of today's fossil fuel deposits were created during the Carboniferous? "

1586,Why are alpine river water green - blue?,"I recently visited Slovenia where I saw several rivers with a strong blue-green color. Here is an example from one of the tributaries of the Soča river near Kobarid. The locals refer to it as an ""emerald"" color.    Notice how the color gets more intense at the deeper waters. What causes this color? A web search shows that the two most cited reasons are blue-green algae and ""limestone particles"". I'm guessing that the more plausible explanation in this case is the limestone one, because this area is dominated by limestone. But, is it really ""particles""? I would think that the calcium carbonate would dissolve in the water, instead of being suspended as solids. "

1589,How much would the Greenland landmass isostatic rebound contribute to long term climate change?,"In reading the question What would the geology and climate of a supposed landmass near the pole be like, assuming a thoroughly warmer planet?, it came to mind that another factor may cause a shift in the long term climatic patterns should the Greenland Ice sheet continue melt - the effects of a 'taller' Greenland, due to its isostatic rebound.  According to the Polar Field Services website,      The enormous weight of the ice down-warped the land surface, causing the material underlying these land masses to slowly flow away. The physics are similar to the reasons a balloon deforms when you press down on it. In the same way that the balloon reshapes itself when you remove your hand, the land actually pops back up over several thousand years when the weight of expansive ice sheets no longer weighs down the underlying area. In Greenland, where the ice sheet is currently receding, the island is actively rebounding.   Given that there are already peaks of up to about 3.7km in altitude, my related questions are:   How high would these peaks go? What effect would a 'taller' Greenland have on climatic patterns?  "
1590,How much energy is needed to alter the path of a hurricane?,"Suppose we spot an Atlantic hurricane very early. How much energy should we expend to alter its track:   with nuclear detonations (let's forget about the side effects for the moment)? with a large orbital geostationary mirror illuminating say, the subtropical ridge? by any other means (microwave heating in the troposphere?)   References on these and other methods from the NOAA Hurricane FAQ:   Silver iodide Aerosols/surface modification Nukes, specifically:     A fully developed hurricane can release heat energy at a rate of  [tex] watts and converts less than 10% of the heat into the mechanical energy of the wind. The heat release is equivalent to a 10-megaton nuclear bomb exploding every 20 minutes.

1591,Why would volcano eruption cause cardiac arrest?,"Following recent eruption of Mt Ontake and the sad news of over 30 people found in 'cardiac arrest', why would the eruption cause it?  My initial thought would be that the cause of death would normally be suffocation or burns from the hot ash. Is it to do with elements/compounds present in volcanic ash? "
1592,"Is there a standard definition of a ""dry-down"" event in hydrology?","When studying the land surface, dry-down periods - periods after rain where the soil moisture is decreasing due to evapotranspiration and drainage - are of great interested, because soil moisture has such a strong effect on nearly every aspect of the land surface (carbon uptake, heat distribution, albedo, etc. etc.).  Obviously dry-downs at different time-scales (and different soil depths) are of interest for different processes. But I was wondering if there was any kind of standardised method for defining dry-down periods. e.g. is it relevant how much rain happened before the event? Or does a small shower in the middle of a long dry-down nullify the event? Or is it all arbitrary and defined differently for each individual piece of research? "
1593,What happens to sea level when a ship sinks?,"Let's assume that a ship is traveling on the ocean and it sinks, what is the effect on the sea level? Even if the effect is small, would it go up, down or remain the same? "
1594,What is the importance of mixing caused by outgassing in the ocean?,"I have been asked the following question for which I have no clear answer: What is the relative importance on mixing of the vertical flow of gases (e.g., Oxygen produced by photosynthesis, CO2 produced in respiration, methane produce from hydrates) in the ocean water column? How does the mixing compare with physical mixing (e.g., wind, internal wave breaking) and molecular diffusion?  My first thought is that the ocean tends to not be saturated in oxygen and CO2, but is there some outgassing as a result of those processes? The question of methane hydrates is probably more complex and likely has links to climate change. "
1595,Are there secondary causes of sea level change?,"Aside from the fraction of water stored as ice on land and temperature of the water, are there other factors that change sea level, and if so what are is the magnitudes of the these changes?   For example, by how much does sediment and soluble matter entering the ocean change sea level? What about volcanoes and tectonic activity? Is there a tendency toward hydrostatic equilibrium where the Earth is entirely covered by an ocean of uniform depth? "
1596,How long does one touch on a stalagmite/stalactite lasts?,"There is a discussion about whether touching a stalagmite or a stalactite would stop it from growing or not: [website]The results are that the oil on human body does prevent a stalagmite or a stalactite from growing, a short while though.   My question is, how long does it takes for the oil to completely vanish and allow the stalagmite or stalactite to resume growing.  "
1597,Temperature rise when snowing,"Why does the temperature rise when it is snowing? Is it due to:   cloud cover snow requires humid air and warmer air can carry more humidity (so in this case it would be the other way around, i.e. it snows because it is warmer) something else?  "
1598,"Changes in rainfalls, sea level and tropical cyclones","Is there any scientific evidence that exploitation of natural resources (fossil energies, forests etc.) affects rainfalls or sea level, which can represent extreme events?  I read IPCC 2014 report and I see some claims like not all climate scientists agree on a variable catastrophic event probability.  They wrote the following sentences :     In the future, it is likely that the frequency of tropical cyclones   globally will either decrease or remain unchanged, but there will be a   likely increase in global mean tropical cyclone precipitation rates   and maximum wind speed.   Is there any scientific references that justify this kind of claim ? "
1599,Plate Tectonics: Is it possible to have an ocean-continent divergent boundary,"I am procedurally generating planets for an open world space sandbox game. I am using a rough simulation of tectonic plates to create mountain ranges and other geological features.  A planet surface consists of several plates, which consists of tiles. The continental plates are randomly generated, with random initial elevation and drift velocities assigned.  Tile elevations are generated by multiplying an envelope ( e^{ -d^2 } ) with a function for different types of plate boundaries and relative drift velocities.  For the sake of realism, is it possible to have a land-ocean divergent plate boundary? I could not find anything online. There also doesn't seem to be any examples on Earth from what I could find. Is it safe to assume that divergent boundaries only occur between land-land and ocean-ocean plate boundaries?  Update  Here is a rendering from the project. Red and green lines depict convergent boundaries. Land-land convergent boundaries produce mountains. Land-sea or sea-sea boundaries produces subduction zones. Blue lines denote a divergent boundary.    I'm going to change the simulation so that divergent boundaries happen only at land-land and ocean-ocean boundaries.  Sorry for my ignorance about geology. I know this is a crude way to simulate plate tectonics. "
1600,Does hydroxyl radical chemistry in air quality models create numerical stability problems?,"Atmospheric mixing ratios of the hydroxyl radical have relatively short lifespans (on the order of microseconds). When modeling air quality or the weather, the time step is usually much larger than the the half life of hydroxyl. How is this computation numerically stable? Is the problem of numerical stability simply ignored? "
1601,The position of magma chambers,Where do magma chambers exist? Is it necessary that they exist in the asthenosphere where the circumstances of temperature and pressure are suitable for the rocks to be molten? Or they exist in places of shallow depth? 
1602,"What, exactly, is angle of repose, and where is it in this image?","I'm a little mystified by ""angle of repose"" and the relationship to deposition and transport. In the following image, I detect 2 different angles of repose for the same material. How can this be?    Clearly, the alluvial fan has a very shallow angle to it, not to mention the much steeper alluvial fans to the left. However, an intermittent stream has cut erosional channels through it and exposed a much steeper ""angle of repose"", which, is likely more reflective of the true angle of repose for this material. So, how is the shallow angle of the alluvial fan possible? "
1603,Yellowstone Eruption Possibility?,"What is the probability of the Yellowstone supervolcano erupting during any given year? I had heard that it erupts once every 100,000 years. Does that mean there is a .001% chance of it erupting during any given year? "
1604,1950's - 60's Earth Science,"I'm writing some lore for a fictional world, which is set in the 50's early 60's roughly.  One thing I'd like to bring is a fairly grounded explanation for the creation of the planet and the universe, as understood by scientists in the fictional setting.  What did we know about these topics back in the 50's? How did we used to believe the planet were formed? "
1605,Have the seasons always been?,Has the Earth had it's wobble that causes the seasonal variation in solar energy in the northern and southern hemispheres for it's entire history? Is this variation evident in the geologic record or is it an open question? Could a meteor impact like that which killed the dinosaurs 66 million years ago have altered or created the wobble? Are there any factors dampening or increasing the seasonal wobble over time? 
1606,How can I learn to make mesoscale/synoptic analyses of major weather events?,"With the tornado outbreak in southern Georgia and northern/central Florida on Sunday that has tragically resulted in significant loss of life, eyes are once again on the weather. I was particularly impressed by the synoptic analysis done by the Capital Weather Gang over at the Washington Post.  I've always found this kind of mesoscale ""tale of the tape"" analysis to be interesting. Accuweather has made these kinds of analyses/maps, see 3/2/12.   I would like to be able to look at upper-air and surface charts, and be able to explain the weather. How can I do that? What would I have to learn?  Through lots of studying of NWS upper air and surface charts, nullschool.net maps, and reading Cliff Mass's blog, I was able to draw some crude Microsoft Paint renditions of the basic summer weather pattern in the Pacific Northwest:      Furthermore, I was also to depict a map of the atmospheric conditions during the 4/27/2011 tornado outbreak, utilizing William Smith's excellent analysis (you'll want to click on the image for a larger resolution):    But I want to learn how to do this on my own. I want to be able to look at charts, and use the charts to make an analysis of a weather event. I'll give you a good example of what I want to do:  During the early morning hours of July 7th, 1999, thunderstorms erupted over southwestern British Columbia and interior sections of WA near the Strait of Juan de Fuca. I know this because I lived through them, I was 7 years old at the time and they kept me up all night. NWS radar archives did not register any precipitation, but Plymouth State University's archives did. Plymouth State's archives also have upper-air analyses; the 00Z 7 Jul 99 analysis shows the shortwave trough draped from the Puget Sound up to southern Vancouver Island. What I want to do is to learn how to forecast the weather at a basic level, then apply this knowledge and look at the upper air, mid-level, and surface analyses, then be able to put them all together to understand this event occurred. I then want to apply this knowledge to be able to predict or analyze other convective thunderstorm events or other major weather events. Other people have recommended reading the content at theweatherprediction.com.  Thank you. "
1607,Need help understanding this satellite image of Larson C ice shelf,"The false color image below shows synthetic aperture radar imaging from ESA's Sentinel-1 satellite. The map from the 20-Jan-2017 BBC article Larsen ice crack continues to open up illustrates the same general area.  The Larson C Ice Shelf is the large blue-ish region in the middle of the false-color radar image, and is labeled as such. The crack is the thin lighter line just above the red arrow.  Moving diagonally upwards to the right, the gray region is labeled ""Sea Ice"". Is this just much thinner but mostly solid ice, or water with pieces of ice in it? While the ice shelf seems relatively uniform in tone, the gray sea ice area has a mottled pattern.  Also the boundary between the two regions has what looks to me like some kind of 3D effect - the black, ribbon-like variable width region separating the two. Is this an effect of shadowing from oblique incidence? Is this actually the sidewall height of the ice shelf?  There is also some discussion of radar imaging of sea ice in this answer.    above: Cropped and enlarged highlight from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar image of the Larson C ice shelf, beginning of January 2017, found here.

1609,What is the technical term for spatially aggregated measures?,"Is there an adjective to describe data that has areal weight, like area, biomass, population, etc. — data that has to be aggregated by sum for example — vs. data that doesn't, such as landcover classification? Categorical for the latter, perhaps, but what for the former?   To illustrate aggregation by sum: if you had rasters of biomass and elevation on 200 m [tex] 200 m cells, and you wanted to re-scale it to 400 m [tex] 400 m, you'd give each new, larger cell the average elevation on the 4 smaller cells that comprise it, but the sum of the 4 biomass values.

Using animations of these over the last year I feel the runoff of freshwater from Hudson Bay, into the Labrador current, and in turn into the Gulf Stream component of the AMOC, has been a cause of the disruption of heat transfer to the North Atlantic Drift.  Would this be correct? Has the runoff into Hudson Bay increased since September last year compared to a 10 year average? "

1617,"How are natural specimens, such as ‘Moqui Marbles’, distinguished from man-made artifacts?","  If a particular type of rock specimen is found throughout Earth and is made entirely of natural minerals, but the individual specimens differ minutely from another in size and shape and look to be manufactured by intelligence, does science have to conclude it’s just a rock because the composition is entirely from earth minerals? Or is it because these specimens are also found on Mars? If only Earth had them, would science say that they are ancient artifacts from a past civilization?  Here are photos of Moqui Marbles from Earth, and similar formations on Mars. I've held some that are hollow and some that were filled. They even have a negative pole effect on each other as though intended to keep a distance from the next one.       "
1618,What was the likely composition of Earth's early crust (how did crustal composition evolve)?,Was the first crust entirely mafic (oceanic) crust which was later distilled via volcanic arcs along subduction zones to make felsic rocks or did the earth start with bits of felsic crust?  Are the ancient zircons most likely from felsic or mafic rocks?

1620,Estimation on how cold will my pond get - intent is to know if certain fish can survive in it,"I want to get an estimate on how cold my pond will get.  It is a 1 acre pond in Central Florida USA. It has an average depth of 4 feet. There is not much circulation in the pond. It gets direct sunlight during these cold months.   These are the average temperatures (high + low)/2 in Farenheit.                °F       °C November      65      18.3  December      60      15.6 January       57.5    14.2 February      60      15.6 March         65.5    18.6   What is the warmest temperature the water will remain? Its not as simple as looking at the numbers and will take some judgement. The top half of the water will certainly be warmer than the bottom, and the 1 foot shallows near the bank will be even warmer due to the direct sun.   The fish I am considering putting into this pond will have normal feeding behaviors recommended at 68 degrees but I estimate that it will go into conservation mode and not eat at around 60 degrees or possibly die.  Is it likely that the fish will be able to find water at or above 68 degrees during these months (on the bank or near the surface for the greater part of the day?)   I don't have tools to measure the temperature of different parts of the water, and with the large amount of rain we have had lately the temp would be off.  Thank you for any insight. "
1621,Geode-like rock but it's empty inside. Why does this happen?,"I found this geode-like rock (spheroidal shaped with empty spheroidal cavity inside) near Dickson Tennessee, USA. Comments suggest that this is in fact geode, but it is empty and featureless inside.   The white on the outer part is soft and can be flaked off.   Can this still be a geode? Assuming it is, why might this one be empty inside instead of being full of crystals? Would this be indicative that most geodes in this area are likely to be empty as well, or would there be no correlation between one and another?

1622,where are the poles of rotation of the tectonic plates located?,"Euler's ""fixed point"" theorem ... can be stated as:     The most general displacement of a rigid body over the surface of a   sphere can be regarded as a rotation about a suitable axis which   passes through the centre of that sphere.   Thus all plate motions can be described by a rotation axis, which passes through the centre of the Earth and cuts the surface at two points, called the poles of rotation. The relative motion of two plates then needs a pole of rotation and an angular velocity to be defined.  So where are those poles located?  Is there any map or resource indicating where those are 'poles' are? "
1623,Why does haze and poor visibility present in stable air?,"Haze is not considered to be a cloud or mist, and it also is not fog.  What is the ultimate reason that haze and general poor visibility ranges prevail in stable atmospheric conditions?  Is the cause concentration of pollutants, some other effect caused by the presence of moisture/humidity, a combination of both, or something else completely? "
1624,Question about the physics of hurricanes,"I've a basic misunderstanding about the formation of tropic cyclones. From the absolute point of view, cyclones form in order to conserve total angular momentum - air masses at different latitudes have different specific angular momentum due to earth rotation (their distance from the earth's axis of rotation is different), so when a low pressure system forms, radial air flow towards the center has to rotate (in the rotating-earth frame of reference) cyclonicaly in order to conserve angular momentum. Putting it in a different point of view, the Coriolis force deflects the radial  winds to create the ""tropic cyclone"" system.  What i don't understand is this: one can say that the circulation system has angular momentum in the direction of the local vertical at the eye of the storm (it's local zenith direction). But such angular momentum vector has component in a direction perpendicular to the earth rotation axis! so it cannot conserve angular momentum. So what am i missing here? is it something in my basic understanding of the Coriolic force? or maybe my knowledge of the physical structure of the storm is lacking something.  I'd also like to know if there are models that predict maximal tropic storm size as function of latitude. I read the thermodynamic model in wikipedia excellent article on tropic storm, but this model gives upper bound about wind speed and specific rate of energy production (rate of energy production per unit area of sea surface), and doesn't give information about the size of the storm. I think that for estimating sizes one needs to use mechanical conceptions. "

1628,The origin of permafrost,"Old permafrost is loaded with frozen vegetation.  As it now melts, it is rotting and releasing methane.    Doesn't that mean that it froze quickly, centuries ago, and stayed frozen until now?    What process caused such a sudden, centuries-long freeze?

1629,How can radiometric dating of meteorites determine the age of the earth? Wouldn't this only determine the age of the decaying nuclide in each rock?,"How can the radiometric dating of different meteorites determine the age of the earth? Wouldn't radioactive decay have already been occurring in all of those  meteorites long before they hit earth? Wouldn't dating only show when the unstable nuclides in that meteorite were created, not when the earth was created? If you went and measured a decaying nuclide in a metiorite which had traveled for 500 million years before striking earth, then the dating of that metiorite would not tell us the age of the earth it would instead give us an age measurement at least 500 million years older then the earth actually is because that nuclide was decaying long before it managed to hit earth's surface.  Also assuming this does somehow get accounted for, how would determining the age of all these various meteorites allow us to estimate the earth's age? Wouldn't this only give us a lower bound on the earth's age? How do we know there doesn't exist some older meteorite out there indicating the earth is older then 4.5 billion years?    This is not a duplicate of the question asking about why measure meteorites not rocks, I am talking about meteorites and my question is regarding how dating can take into account when the rocks became part of earth as opposed to when the nuclides being dated first came into existence. Its not like the unstable nuclides within a metiorite suddenly decided to start decaying when they hit earth. They started decaying the minute they came into existence, including the time before they hit earth. "

1631,How to prepare sulfur crystal specimens?,"I mined sulfur crystals last week and I read the following on this guide:     To prepare the specimens [...] it is necessary to soak them in   water to which ammonium hydroxide has been added. This neutralizes the   acidic component of the matrix, and thus prevents the specimens from   eating up any paper or cardboard that they might come in contact with.   A small amount of sodium bifluoride is added in order to complex iron.   Without this treatment, the matrix of many specimens would gradually   turn a pale brown.   A quick Google search tells me that I can buy both products on the internet.   Does anyone know the concentration of ammonium hydroxide and sodium bifluoride necessary? Also, how long should one soak the specimen in the solution? "
1632,How do thunderstorms generate ionospheric potential?,"In all the explanations of how global electric circuit on Earth works, I've always encountered statements like ""thunderstorms generate ionospheric potential"" (which is about 250 kV).  E.g. here: [website]But how is that possible? Thunderstorm (or, more specifically, a lightning strike) is inherently a discharge rather than a generator. It's the breakdown of an abstract capacitor rather than the charging of it. For all intents and purposes, thunderstorms should reduce any potential difference that exists around them rather than sustain it.   Can somebody explain, what actually drives the upward current that is observed above thunderstorms? Surely it cannot be lightning itself, so what then?   (I'm perfectly aware that there is also a downward current in fair weather; but the same question remains - where is the generator that causes it?) "
1633,How reanalysis data influence our research/results?,"I am a student and I have a very simple and yet important question about reanalysis data. Recently, I attended a workshop where various other students discussing the use of ERA5 reanalysis data on their research and at some point, there was the question : ""what does the use of reanalysis data means for your research and how this type of data can impact your results?"" Nobody had a satisfying answer and now, I am trying to find papers discussing this issue.   For example, can someone use ERA5 parameters on a random forest model as explanatory variables and if so, what does it means for the results?  Apologies if it is a very basic question, I am new in this area.  "
1634,"If planting trees is ineffective to tackle climate change, why do people plant them?","I've read answers that outline how if we afforested large (continental-scale) masses of land, it would do little in the way of tackling climate change. While it would sequester CO2 for about a century after it was planted (while growing) before reaching equilibrium, the planting of large quantities of trees would also sufficiently decrease the albedo of the land in which it was planted, that it would hold in a lot more heat than the land it replaced (likely desert or otherwise barren land). This means that, all things considered, it would make a negligible, if not negative impact, in tackling global warming.   If this is the case, why do we associate ""planting trees"" as a good thing, on the scale of individuals planting individual trees? Is it because generally, these trees improve ecosystem vitality/diversity, or for some similar reason unrelated to climate?  "
1635,Why rely on climate models as opposed to paleoclimate data?,"Something I hear often from climate scientists, and indeed even politicians, is that we ""don't understand climate change very well"". And, I'm sure this is true since the climate is a complex adaptive system with thousands of dependent variables, one that we don't yet have the computational sophistication to accurately model. But that doesn't mean we don't know, to a high degree of accuracy, what is going to happen if we make certain changes to the atmospheric composition or take certain actions. We have paleoclimate data ranging extensively far back many hundreds of thousands of years, encompassing global temperature, climate cycling, atmospheric composition, and more.   Sure, the global temperature 100,000 years ago wasn't measured using a thermometer, but we've used various independent proxy methods that all agree with each other to a reasonable degree, right? And so do we not then have a reasonably accurate idea of Earth's climate sensitivity by simply looking at precedent? And paleoclimate will be close to exactly right since it takes all the variables into account exactly in the amount they're needed to be accounted for. Why are we still ""uncertain"" about the realities of climate change? Why are we not moving on and taking decisive action based on this--what seems to me--reliable, accurate data? "
1636,Ice cores: how is Oxygen-18 isotopic variation converted to temperature changes?,"The Dansgaard paper I've seen shows a roughly linear relationship between the delta-O18 in precipitation and mean annual temperature (at a given location). See Figure 3 in the paper.  When converting delta-O18 into a corresponding delta-temperature, is this simple linear relationship assumed? Or is it more complex than that? What caveats or assumptions go into such a conversion? "
1637,Are there any differences between the subalkali and alkali rock occuring tectonic environments?,"Here question ends. Beyond details exist  Do they occur on the same tectonic regime? For a start to distinguish Subalkali rocks froms Alkali rocks,  my knowledge says that mantle is the source of Alkali rocks. Ocean Island Basalts are Hawaii, Reunion etc are all Alkali rocks. Large ignous provinces are also sourced from mantle by the mantle plumes. Such as Deccan, Siberian traps.  But in Robil Gill's ((Gill, R. (2010). Igneous rocks and processes: a practical guide. John Wiley &amp; Sons.)) book on page 291, (chapter 9-Alkali rocks) says that Most of the large igneous provinces are subalkaline and they are much bigger and more frequent than the Alkaline Large igneous province. From this i derive that LIP's can be subalkaline.   So are there any difference between subalkali and alkali rock occuring tectonic environments ? "
1638,Can planes damage the ozone layer?,"So I heard that the Ozone Layer is a layer of gas in Earth's atmosphere. And I also heard once that the Ozone Layer is crucial in protecting life on Earth, as it blocks out harmful rays emitted by the Sun. But over the years, the Ozone layer is slowly degrading due to the constant emission of chemicals. That's straight forward stuff...  But I once heard that super sonic jets can also contribute to the degradation of the Ozone Layer. What!? I didn't know jets could do that! This is what I would like to know:   Is this claim true? And if it is, how high up and fast do the jets have to be? Also, how is this even possible?   Does the jet create strong winds to blow the Ozone Layer away or something? Any feedback would be highly appreciated, thanks! "
1639,How does nature dilute Ocean and Seas so that we can swim in them?,"I have a question about the seas and ocean we swim in. How does the Ocean get rid off all the natural pollutants (for example dead animal debris) and man-made pollutants (human waste, garbage, etc)? I know that there's salt in the water, which helps to kill bacteria, but does salt really do that much? And also, I heard that the Ocean is so big, that pollutants are naturally diluted through the waters, making it safe. Is this true?  Oh, and I don't mean those giant plastic garbage deposits out in the middle of the ocean, I'm talking about our beaches and seas.  I'm asking this because I never see any brownish murky water whenever I go swimming. Any feedback would be highly appreciated. Thanks! "
1640,Question about the sign of the shearing deformation terms,"I have the following equation for the shearing term of the deformation zone in meteorology.

1644,What is the most cost-effective solution to climate change based on scientific evidence?,"Please don't answer without citing scientific research which has a general consensus or article from a reputable source based on verifiable research citations.  I recently read this article about a 2017 PNAS study from Griscom et al (link below) that ""estimated natural carbon solutions (NCS) (essentially ecosystem regeneration) have the potential to provide up to 37 percent of the CO2 mitigation that we'd need through 2030, for a 66 percent chance of holding warming to below 2°C.""  More specifically, what is the most cost-effective solution? Most geoengineering solutions have significant risks or unknowns which greatly reduce their benefit. Reducing fossil fuel use immediately will reduce short-term economic output with replacing with renewables and alternatives. Maybe simply paying drivers incentives to use alternative vehicles is most-cost effective, as transportation is the largest percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in the US (EPA).   So what is the most cost-effective and how much money would it take to get it done? Global energy-related CO2 emissions were 33.1 Gt CO2 in 2018 according the [IEA report][6]. Apparently from the Griscom study, 10 USD MgCO2e−1 is the ""current cost of emission reduction efforts underway and current prices on existing carbon markets"" from 2017. 1Gt = 1Pg = 1000Mt = 1000Tg = 10^9 tonnes metric, and 1Mg = 1 tonne, so our CO2 emissions cost us 10*10^9 or 10 billion USD per year. For reference, global GDP is at US$84.84 trillion for 2018, meaning reducing our entire emissions to zero would cost all of 0.0001% of global GDP.  As as corollary, if all benefits of NCS to uncalculated ecosystem services were included, would they be the most cost-effective, and what is the average ROI on research investment to calculate them?  To the Mods: I've changed the title to match the narrow question specified in the body of the question. I've provided an answer that is very specific using calculated figures from cited references. What else would you like to make the question more narrow?  Griscom et al, [website]"
1645,Software to draw maps based on Earth,"I am looking for a tool to sketch changes to Earth. It should start with a geoid or an Earth model, rise/lower/flood selected areas. ""Heal"" boardersk: if an island is added in an ocean height shouldn't abruptly change from 0 [tex] to [tex]1000 [tex]. It should also measure distances between points, allow labeling and export maps of selected images as raster graphics (jpg image).   So far I could do two things:     Start with Google Earth, prepare necessary shapes using flooding, paste results as layers in Gimp/Photoshop [fast and ugly] Import data in Matlab, define rules for modified regions, export [manual rule definitions is slow, no way to smart select, drag and drop regions]    What is the standard approach to do this? For instance, how people display flood plains, draft a channel or a new island project?    Windows/Mac/Linux/doesn't_matter? Windows preferred, Linux is OK.  GUI or also command line? GUI, or GUI+CLI batching. CLI only is undesired. Go you want to use a GIS? I didn't know about GIS. Looking into in. "
1646,Why are there no wild fires in New England?,"I used to live in San Diego and I remember the occasional wild fire; My dad standing on the roof, watering it with a garden hose.  I have lived in New England, however, for the last 40 years and have not seen a wild fire yet. Why not? Just too wet here? "
1647,"How could this ""aztec temple"" mountain (or volcano) have been formed on Antarctica?","[Update: This was not a duplicate of the other question since the mountain shape is rather different. This was already stated in my question below.]  This question is a bit similar to this other question about pyramid-shaped mountains.  In this case though the mountain is also in Antarctica but it looks as shown in below picture.    (This picture is taken at Princess Elisabeth station)  So I was curious on if this mountain in the foreground, and the one behind it, could be volcanoes? Or are there examples where non-volcano mountains form into these shapes? "
1648,Can we call the Precambrian eons (i.e. Archaic and Proterozoic) eras?,"A diagram in a book I have places Archaic and Proterozoic under ""eras"".    Is such naming correct? ICS says they are eons, so do most sources I could find, but a 1979 volume of ""Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology"" seems to name at least Proterozoic as an era.  Is applying the term ""era"" here en error? Obsolete usage, once popular, but now generally abandoned? Or perhaps a rare, but correct and accepted, convention? "
1649,Severe storm predictions: What meteorological considerations go into hazard assessments?,"In the United States the National Weather Service (NWS) Storm Prediction Center (SPC) now has 5 categories for the threat of severe storms.  These five categories replaced the previous three categories of slight, moderate, and high risk in October 2014.      Source: [website]The first time I heard our local station talking about slight, marginal, and enhanced risk I had no idea which was worse- nor did anybody else around me at the time.  After doing some research I understand the differences but still don't necessarily remember which is worse, whereas the previous slight, moderate, and high risk categories were pretty much self explanatory.  What additional meteorological information is presented in the additional categories that may affect how the general public reacts to the threat?  I'm also wondering how these categories compare to the information given in other countries? "
1650,Earth and moon have different mantle compositions. Is this a fatal flaw in the 'Giant Impact hypothesis'?,"Deep impact ejecta on the moon seem to indicate that the moon's mantle is predominantly 'low-calcium pyroxene' (recent letter to Nature), whereas the Earth's mantle (or at least the upper mantle) is dominantly olivine with only ~15% pyroxenes. So how can this discrepancy arise if the Earth and moon have a common origin? The only possibility I can think of is if partial fractionation of magnesium silicates actually took place in space, before falling to either Earth or moon, with the slightly denser olivine falling to the higher gravity of Earth, and less dense pyroxene falling to the lower gravity proto-moon. Is this possible? Is there any isotopic evidence of Earth-moon mantle commonality? "
1651,Aspiring Geophysicist,"I am interested in becoming a geophysicist. I am currently doing my undergraduate degree in the UK but have not chosen a specialisation. Is it better to specialise in Earth Sciences as an undergrad or go with Physics?  I like quantitative fields but I feel that undergraduate Earth Sciences does not offer such quantitative aspects. I also really like physics but feel that applying it in the context of the earth is really interesting. As becoming a geophysicist would probably require me to go to grad school, would an undergrad degree in Earth Sciences or Physics better prepare me to study Geophysics in grad school? "
1652,How do spectral methods work in the context of numerical weather prediction models?,"I am broadly familiar with the concept of numerical weather prediction models using various finite methods to solve the primitive equations used in these models, but how do spectral methods work, generally speaking?   What are the basic differences between NWP models using ""traditional"" finite-difference or finite volume methods and those that employ spectral method approaches? "
1653,Why is carbon pollution given more importance than Sulfur pollution or Nitrogen pollution?," Nitrous oxide ([tex]) - primary greenhouse gas Carbon dioxide ([tex]) - primary greenhouse gas Methane ([tex]) - primary greenhouse gas, explosive Nitrogen monoxide ([tex]) - secondary greenhouse gas, toxic Nitrogen dioxide ([tex]) - secondary greenhouse gas, toxic Sulfur dioxide ([tex]) - secondary greenhouse gas, toxic Carbon monoxide ([tex]) - secondary greenhouse gas, toxic   So, why is Carbon Dioxide pollution  given more importance in ""pollution measurement""(Carbon-Footprints), when Sulfur Dioxide and Nitrogen Dioxide are much more dangerous to Land dwellers, including Humans ?   At this rate, the Oceans will die from Nitrogen pollution or acidify from Plastic pollution; before the ocean level can even threaten us. So, why are we focusing on Carbon dioxide at the cost of the toxic compounds ?  "
1654,Which geothermal power plant type is most effecient?,"There are three geothermal systems that are commonly used: dry steam, flash steam, and binary cycle[1]. What are the efficiencies of the plants from best to least efficient?   I did a moderate amount of research on all three systems, but the only thing that I found on Google is the efficiency of geothermal as a whole.  I could not find anything regarding the the efficiency of each individual one.  "
1655,Are pumps used in geothermal systems?,The water held underground in a geothermal system is under high temperature and pressure. Are pumps used to raise the very hot underground water to the surface or does the water rise under its own pressure? One source says that the water is pumped up[1] while another says that it rises on its own[2]. I am not sure if I just misunderstand the wording. Does anyone know which is correct?

1656,Fault Lines in North America,"I was trying to figure out what areas in North America would be most likely to have earthquakes, but I couldn't come across a good map for this. It's easy to find the areas with the highest incidence of hurricanes and tornadoes, and I know California has a high rate of earthquakes. What fault lines are there in North America (besides the obvious San Andreas fault)? Are there any maps that clearly show this? "
1657,What controls the acidity of the ocean?,"I have learned that:        coral reefs are made up mostly of calcium carbonate  coral reefs are mainly distributed in the tropical zone The calcium carbonate will be decomposed in the reaction as follows: [tex]    Thus this reaction will be promoted in the environment with low pH.   The ocean in the tropic zone should have lower acidity (higher pH) for the coral reef to exist.  But in my opinion, the pH in the ocean is determined by the dissolution of CO2, and this process might be promoted in higher temperature?  How to explain this issue? "
1658,What factors influence cloud height and type?,"For example, why do altocumulus clouds fail to form at 6400m in high latitude locations, but will form at this height at a lower latitude? Is it simply an issue of temperature? "
1659,Can the Bering Sea Rule be used to predict the weather?,"Recently, a colleague explained that the recent cold spell in the eastern United States could have been predicted using the Bering Sea Rule. The idea is that 17-21 days after a storm appears in the Bering Sea, a storm will appear in the United States.    Is this rule reliable?  What is the explanation for it? What is the skill of a forecast using the Bering Sea Rule?   Here is a news report that mentions it for the recent weather pattern. "

1662,Building massive seawall around endangered Islands like Mauritius to save from climate change,"Would it be possible to build a massive seawall, say maybe even made from metal that could rise as the sea level rises to prevent being erased?   I am not considering costs here, nor beauty, only if such a wall would be able to resist the force of the entire ocean trying to get into the ""empty"" pool.    Is it feasible? What kind of material would be required? How high could one go?  In the event of a leak, ""terrorist"" assault, what kind of disasters and how quickly would the Island become ""erased""   You can give an example approximation on the size of the Island.   Just theoretical. "
1663,Would a Yellowstone eruption destroy global agriculture?,"Someone recently claimed in my hearing that if the Yellowstone caldera were to erupt, the resulting ash cloud would end all agriculture for a year or two. (The speaker is not a scientist, and neither am I.)    Is that accurate? Are there reasonable scenarios (i.e., not this) worked out for the effects of a supervolcano eruption?   I did see this question, where one of the commenters points out that such an event would be unprecedented, so our ability to predict is limited, but I'm still curious about whatever we do know at this stage. "
1664,Sulfate salts of magnesium and sodium,"What concentrations of magnesium, sodium and sulfate are needed to precipitate solid MgSO4 and Na2SO4 (let's say evaporation is occurring in a system) I'm assuming probably really high because they are soluble salts? But can someone tell me in mg/L how much?   I'm asking because in this paper I read the authors are claiming magnesium and sodium in solution are coming from dissolution of MgSO4 and Na2SO4 but the concentrations are really low... like 20 mg/L of each. If those minerals were present wouldn't concentrations of Mg and Na be much higher? "
1665,Acoustic impedance in geophysical context,"What is the intuition behind acoustic impedance? Yes, I know that it is the opposition to a seismic wave travelling in the medium. But why it is defined as density &times; velocity?  The velocity of a seismic wave depends on density, so why not use only the velocity contrast or density contrast between layers instead of the impedance contrast? "
1666,"What is a ""tar shower?""","I'm reading about Sodom and Gomorrah on Wikipedia when I come across this: ""One such idea is that the Dead Sea was devastated by an earthquake between 2100 and 1900 BCE.

When I googled this, it went to the visual dictionary referenced in the Wikipedia article, which didn't explain the concept either. "
1667,Why are earthquake considered spot things?,As far as i know earthquake is result of movement of earth crust layers and release of energy at these locations and movements at faults.  So i think its happens somehow along a line or in a wide almost flat layer.  But each earthquake is given a coordination and a depth as if its like a spot explosion.  Why is it like this? Are my assumptions wrong? 
1668,Are weather forecast models more accurate for either high or low temperatures?,"The other day our low temperature for the day was ~10 degrees F below our forecast low.  I've noticed this before in the winter, especially when temperatures start to go below 0 degrees F (-18 degrees C).  This made me wonder if the models used to forecast high and low temperature are different, and if so is one indeed more accurate?  Conversely, if the same model is used, is it as accurate for both high and low temperatures?   I was able to find one student project from Dartmouth College in which a statistical analysis of forecast high and low temperatures were compared from three five years sets (1970-4, 1980-4, and 1990-4) of data from 15 different United States cities representing different influences such as latitude, water, and land influences.  One of the findings of this dataset of 5,269 records was that the forecasts where more accurate in the summer than in the fall and winter.  This seems to hint that warmer temperatures are forecasted more accurately than colder temperatures, at least on a seasonal basis.  I'm hoping there's more information out there that can either confirm or deny this conclusion without the seasonal bias.    "
1669,What is lava called if it has 56% to 64% silica?,"We've learnt in science at school that ""Mafic"" lava forms rocks with 45% to 55% silica, meanwhile ""Felsic"" lava forms rocks with >=65% silica. So what is lava called in between? Or is it impossible for any lava to cool into rocks with that range of silica? Why? "
1670,Would there have been a stratosphere in the Archean before the Great Oxygenation Event?,In today's world the presence of ozone in the stratosphere is the reason for the stratospheric temperature inversion which keeps a lid on the troposphere.  But before the Great Oxygenation Event there wouldn't have been enough oxygen to create ozone in the stratosphere. Which leads two questions  1) Would the top of the troposphere have been much higher?  2) If there's no stratosphere to keep wet air down in the troposphere would more water have got into the upper atmosphere where it can be dissociated by UV light and the hydrogen lost into space? 
1671,Why Do Supercontinents Form?,"It would seem, on the face of it, improbable that the continental land-masses would accumulate into a single composite, yet it has happened numerous times, and is expected to again in the future.    There must likely then be some aspect of plate tectonics which favors these arrangements.  Can anyone provide an explanation?  EDIT:  This is not, as I see it, a duplicate of the 'What are the causes of the supercontinent cycle?' question.  This question goes to what process drives the formation of any &amp; all supercontinent formations, which I assert should be improbable, made more improbable by their recurrence, not so much the cycle itself.  The other question did not address this more fundamental aspect, or in any case receive a pertinent account of its resolution.  If anyone wants to engage on this, or doesn't see the distinction, please do so in the comments or a chat. "

1673,Formation of Hematite on Mars via Perchlorates as an Oxidizer,"Hematite on Mars is generally thought to have formed either in pools of water or from volcanic activity.  A comment to the answer to the question: How do hematite and magnetite form? states that sodium hypochlorite can act as an oxidizer to help form hematite.  I know hypochlorite is different from perchlorate, but Mars contains so much perchlorate that its soils are considered to be toxic to life.  Could the perchlorates on Mars have been influential in the formation of hematite? "

1675,What is are the benefits of map 500 hPa geopotential for weather forecasting?,"From the weather forecasting perspective: what is the main reason for showing just map of 500 hPa geopotential? Are there any practical or theoretical reasons? Why do not show 600 hPa geopotential or 400 hPa instead? I understand that forecast model usually operates at pressure levels, so this is the reason why choose pressure level instead of quantity at some altitude.   Let us take e.g.:  [website]"
1676,What is the relationship between net primary productivity and emergy?,"Looking at the Earth system as a whole and considering ecological economics, net primary productivity and emergy are two concepts that strike me as fundamental and likely related. I'm not sure what the relationship is though.  I'd define emergy as embodied energy, or how much total gross joules are embodied in a given process or material (or organism).  I'd define net primary production as the total mass of organic compounds synthesized from ""inorganic carbon"" (primarily atmospheric carbon dioxide). While this metric is a mass, it also sheds light on how relatively efficiently solar energy is used to generate life (or at least the ingredients of life, ""organic"" carbon compounds).   At first these two metrics seem quite different: one is a measure of energy, one is a mass. However, both metrics clarify the relationship between our relatively open-system energy resource and our closed-system nutrient cycles. For example, I in comparing different agroecosystems growing an apple, emergy can help show the energetic efficiency of each system and net primary production can help show the life-generating efficiency of each system. My word choices there seem a little ambiguous, for example, what's the difference between ""energetic efficiency"" and ""life-generating efficiency""? That's what spurs the main question, which is: what, if any, is the relationship between net primary productivity and emergy?   Clarification about the qualitative relationship between the two metrics would be helpful, I understand it may be overly complex to quantify it though the two terms are very much quantitative. Researching this I've found plenty of resources about each metric but none yet comparing the two, so any resources simply comparing the two would be an answer/step in the right direction. "

1681,How is heavy rainfall determined in National Climate Assessment,"I'm trying to understand/reproduce/revise this chart in the Southeast section of the United States National Climate Assessment. The truncated scale for the bars is what caught by eye as a classic chart lie, but I'm also wondering about other features: different thresholds (besides 3 inches) and different aggregations (besides decades).    Original caption for this chart plus a map next to it:     Figure 19.3: The figure shows variability and change in (left) the   annual number of days with precipitation greater than 3 inches   (1900–2016) averaged over the Southeast by decade and (right)   individual station trends (1950–2016). The number of days with heavy   precipitation has increased at most stations, particularly since the   1980s. Sources: NOAA NCEI and CICS-NC.   The vague source citations are not particularly helpful, but I did find NOAA's Global Historical Climatology Network Daily downloadable data. That has daily precipitation data for 100,000 stations around the world, with about 12,000 in the Southeast. However, in a given year, I'm seeing 100 to 200 days with precipitation above 3 inches, but the chart indicates a different order of magnitude.  What does ""days with precipitation greater than 3 inches"" mean in this context?  I'm guessing there must be a ""per station"" part to it, but I still can't guess the exact math. The simplest treatment, a weighted average of each stations rate of heavy rain, produces the chart below.    It's close (same order of magnitude and peaks in 40s, 70s and recent), but not quite the same. Is there a different data source? Or a different treatment for irregular samples? Or a way to account for increasing number of stations?  Update after comments: If I filter on stations with at least 110 years of data and use only years with 200+ days of data, I get the following, which is closer. (Using the same scale as the original, but avoiding bar truncation by just showing the tops.)    Most decades have lower values than the original. "
1682,why igneous phosphate rocks contain less uranium than sedimentary rocks?,"Sedimentary rock phosphates contain much higher concentrations of potentially hazardous elements (As, Cd, Cr,Pb, Se and U)than igneous rock phosphates.

1684,What was the Amazon like during Green Sahara?,"It is said that the Amazon rainforest receives up to half of its nutrients via mineral dust from the Sahara desert. But a few thousand years ago, the Sahara desert was much more fertile, having a savannah-like environment.  Did this mean that the nutrient transfer to the Amazon did not take place during this time? If so, what did the Amazon look like? "
1685,How do urban areas affect rain?,"Urban areas these days can be quite large, and they can have strong effects on the environment: the urban heat island effect being the most obvious, but there may be other, more subtle effects. The relative lack of vegetation and drainage might make them drier, the concentration of high-rise buildings might approximate the effect of small hills, and there's also the air pollution they produce.  Thus I suspect that large urban areas might have an effect on rain, but exactly how? Do they cause more rain or less around them? What about any effects downwind? "

New York and Boston are on the water and would be in danger from a tsunami of any size, Philadelphia is 39 feet above sea level and 50 miles inland. Atlanta is over 200 miles inland and between 750 and 1100 feet above sea level. Would an impact event of the size imagined in the movie actually send a wave that far inland and that far up?

1687,How are Earth's rotational changes due to large earthquakes calculated?,"According to NASA (and many other sources), Japan Quake May Have Shortened Earth Days, Moved Axis and in the answers to the question here What geophysical events can (temporarily) increase the Earth's rate of rotation?, that major earthquakes result in a slight shift in the length of the day, from NASA:     calculations indicate that by changing the distribution of Earth's mass, the Japanese earthquake should have caused Earth to rotate a bit faster, shortening the length of the day by about 1.8 microseconds (a microsecond is one millionth of a second).   Past great earthquakes, such as the 8.8 in Chile in 2010 and the 9.1 Sumatra in 2004 have caused similar rotational 'wobbles'.  The NASA article states that the earthquake's magnitude, location and dynamics result in the orbital 'wobbles'.

1692,Could the extraction of energy by wind turbines be harmful to the environment?,"Wind turbines work by converting some of the energy from wind to electrical energy. Is it possible to have too many turbines, leading to them removing too much energy from the wind?  I'm not an environmental scientist, but I'm guessing the energy in wind plays some vital role in the environment.  So what would happen if we removed too much of that energy? "
1693,Is it known what determines the rate with which plate tectonics occur?,"When investigating the rate of the move of the Hawaii hotspot, from information provided here on Stack Exchange Earth Science, I cannot find a determination of cause for the rate, that does not point back to plate tectonics as the reason for the rate, but I am unable to determine if there is a known cause for the rate of plate tectonics.  Is it:   Random? Natural sphere dynamics and nothing else? The angles between the milky way, the ""great attractor"", the CMB, and earth's place between the three? Other geological processes of which I am unaware??   Speaking to the possibility of it being #3, as far as I can determine, the sun seems to orbit around the Milky Way with a similar periodicity as many geological functions I am aware of on Earth.  And the formation then spread of Pangea and recollection into Pangea Ultima if correctly predicted, would seem to further bolster this thought.  And the rate of orbit around the Milky Way would seem to approximate (or match) the rate of the hotspots movement, which other than ""driven by plate tectonics"" would seem to be a global mystery.  So ""little help over here""?  ADDED Oct 12, an excerpt from an article provided by Omen.  Please ignore the part about evolutionary pressure.     The amount of radioactive material in the Core was certainly greater   in the distant past. That greater amount proportionally created   greater heat amounts which had to get to the Earth's surface to be   able to be radiated away. One result of this was certainly that the   materials of the Core and Mantle were hotter than today, and therefore   more fluid. That situation was enhanced by the remaining presence of a   substantial amount of heat remaining from the original formation of   the Earth. Finally, convection cell flow rates are driven by the   amount of heat that is present, so that also would make the Core   convective cells and the Mantle convective cells much more active and   much more dynamically unstable than today.      The result of all this was more heat driving convective cells in   materials which were more fluid. This necessarily caused more rapid   movements of those materials. This would have created substantially   greater geomagnetic field strengths in the distant past. It would also   have caused far more rapid lateral flow velocities in the Mantle   convection cell tops.      Depending on the 'grip' (or static / dynamic coefficient of friction)   between Mantle and Crust, this could enable very rapid tectonic plate   movements in the distant past. When that caused substantial   north-south movement in the continental plates, strong evolutionary   pressure would suddenly exist.   ADDED OCT 20th, 2014  Sorry for the delay, I waited a little to compose my words correctly, and to see if any alternate theories were strongly supported, to explain the 200+ million year rate of movement of the Emperor chain.    To the best of my ability to understand the answers so far, the ""RATE"" of  churn"" within the mantle, and resulting heaving and swirling of plate movement are derivatives of:   the amount of heat within the earth,  primordial,   gravity pressure, radioactive decay,   tidal friction),  combined with  the gravitational tugs of the Sun and Moon on Earth, the resulting ""jitter"" within the earth caused by the Milankovitch cycles and the physical dynamics, properties and characteristics of  heat generation rates, and transfer rates through varied mediums, sphere dynamics, the patterns within the movements caused by existing physical geographical patterns   plus the random interaction between the Earth and various celestial bodies that have happened into our path over time, creating such geological features as the gulf of Mexico, the pool of nickel under Sudbury, etc. .     And therefor the shape of mountains and valleys, continent and ice cap are existential in nature.  Random compared to other regards, such as other universal interaction to the Milky Way, or the shape and position and relative density of the various parts of the superclusters Laniakea and Perseus.  This is I believe accepted as the depth to which the situation has been considered?  Or it has been considered further with less information and been decided non-consequential, perhaps (ie declining influence of gravitational force over distance)?  Some of the things within this frame-work of cumulative understandings, that I see as ""unknown"", ""not clearly known"", ""potential factors"", ""assumptions"", ""theories"" that are in contention"", or ""flat out Scooby Doo mysteries"" are many and of significant value in consideration:   the nature of the insides of an atom (now believed filled with Quanta energy field, the ratio of this energy to the mass energy of the sub components of the atom are massive),  the nature of the insides of space (now believed ""filled"" with Dark Matter and Dark Energy equalling 95-96 percent of existence, squishing the 4% we see, know, and understand, into a pretty small corner. the nature of the ""shape"" of gravity, sought by IBEX, being re-sought by the Planck mission the nature of the ""shape"" of the Universe, (we have only in the past decade ""perceived documented and published"" details of the super-clusters existence.  It is built on current understanding which include above noted lack of understanding. the nature of the origins of the Universe (the existence of the superclusters pretty much rule out the ""viability of the truth of the Big Bang Theory (R.I.P.) the cause of the Milankovitch cycles ranges, parameters, timing, (causes I think)?? the rate of disassembly of Pangea and recreation into the predicted PangeaUltima.   And so it is recognition of these conditions combined that begged me to ask the question...Is it known what determines the RATE with which plate tectonics occur?  The true underlying cause of the timing.  And as far as I can tell the best answer is circumstantial existence combined with the Sun and the moon.  Creating ""It Is, What It Is.""  I'll post this as an answer but I hope it get's down voted.  And some latitude to explore hypothetically will be granted.  :-) "
1694,What is the total Earth's interior energy budget?,What is the total Earth's interior energy budget?    What is the heat flux per m2 that warms the Earth surface because of the Earthy's internal heat.  How much of that heat is replenished from the radioactive decay?  How much of that heat is replenished from Moon's tidal forces?  
1695,Resources to determine temperature probability for a given location on a given date,"What tools or resources are available (free) on the web to determine the probability of a given point on the earth to be at or above (or below) a specific temperature on a specific date.  Some [extreme] examples:  At the South Pole, the probability of it being > 90-F on June 1 approaches 0% (I'm guessing).  Conversely, the probability of it being &lt; 32-F on the equator (at or near sea level) on Dec 1 approaches 0%, as well.  Another way to phrase what I'm looking for:  On what date in the calendar year does the probability of the air temperature being above (or below) X approach 0% for a given location/city?    So, say, for Washington, D.C.-- after (or before) what date in the year is it virtually impossible for the temperature to be above, say... 80-F? "
1696,Is everything affecting everything on Earth?,"If a single butterfly can alter the future, then can't every single action keep the future in chaos? According to the question about butterfly effects, this must be so, is it not?  If this is an accurate description of the physical world, if so many things act continuously on other things, is there a way to predict anything or action at all?  If so, why are we worrying about it?  "
1697,To what accuracy and precision do we know the volume of the Earth?,"Satellites such as GOCE and GRACE measure the geoid with unprecedented accuracy.  Altimeters can determine local surface elevation with millimetre-precision.  This makes me wonder: to what precision and accuracy can we measure (or calculate) the volume of the Earth?  I'm a lay when it comes to solid Earth, and I find it surprisingly hard to find even the order of magnitude of an answer ([tex] metre?  [tex] metre?  [tex] metre?).  Wikipedia is extremely limited on the question and links to a surprisingly poor NASA factsheet that doesn't include any error estimates, cites no sources, and is imprecise in providing context or defining what it's talking about.    One can calculate the volume of Earth using semi-major and minor axes obtained from reference ellipsoids, but I have no idea how large an error is introduced by this approximation.  What are the precision and accuracy do we know the shape of the Earth? "
1698,How to calculate flow duration curve for a set of 12 year data?,"Given, discharge data alone for each month in each year, is it possible to calculate the flow duration curve? Some of the discharge values in some months were found to be 0. Do we need to consider those values? "

What diameter of weather balloon do I need? I'm planning to take upto around 1-2 kg of payload consisting of cameras, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, GPS, parachute etc.  "
1700,How many trees would I have to plant to solve Global Warming?,"According to Nasa, causes of the Earth's greenhouse effect include water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and CFCs.  Carbon dioxide gets the most press, and NASA's page says:     Carbon dioxide (CO2). A minor but very important component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide is released through natural processes such as respiration and volcano eruptions and through human activities such as deforestation, land use changes, and burning fossil fuels. Humans have increased atmospheric CO2 concentration by a third since the Industrial Revolution began. This is the most important long-lived ""forcing"" of climate change.   An article by NC State University says that a healthy tree can store 13 pounds of carbon per year.  As I understand it, carbon dioxide is processed by the tree: the carbon is stored, and the oxygen released.  Given that, how many trees would I need to plant to solve the global climate change crisis?  Should I optimize for a specific type of tree, or would pine work as well as oak or black walnut? "
1701,At what altitude do winds exert the most force?,"Imagine I want to make a floating wind turbine like the Altaeros BAT, which is tethered and uses helium. What would be the best height to keep such a device deployed? I know that wind velocity decreases near the ground due to friction with the Earth's surface. Though, the density of air decreases with height, so the force of high winds aloft are lessened.  Considering these issues, at what altitudes do the winds exert the most force for a tethered wind turbine to produce the most energy?  Please disregard the energy required to keep the turbine afloat. "
1702,upper air data(observation) and analysis step for GFS model,"Global forecast systems(GFS)  gives analysis and forecasts at different time steps. Their main source of input is upper air data which is recorded only twice in a day(observation comes at 00 and 12). But analysis step which incorporates the observations is done at 00,06,12,18 hrs. How is that ?Is my basic understanding understanding completely wrong? "
1703,Does the Antarctic Ozone Hole affect the rest of the world?,"Sometimes you read about skin cancer and the ozone hole in Australia. But when you look it up the ozone hole is basically just near the South Pole, and maybe a bit above the North Pole (because that’s where it’s really cold).  But has the rest of the world even been really affected? Looking at this NASA graphic it doesn’t seem there were significant changes for most people.  Perhaps the average ozone levels in Europe or Australia even increased? "
1704,Units of wave spectrum,"In ocean spectra such as the Pierson Moskowitz or the JONSWAP models, the units of [tex] are [tex] (or whatever unit of measurement you are working in). Where does the [tex] come from and what does it mean physically?  I understand that the integral of the spectrum over all frequencies, i.e. [tex], is the variance which means that the integral should have [tex] units? Please correct me if I am wrong. "
1705,Can El Niño and La Niña occur at the same time?,"We often read that El Nino and La Niña occur alternatively. Are they the exact opposite of each other? Or, in other words, can they happen at the same time? (i.e. the whole Pacific Ocean has a higher temperature than normal).  If so, what is the common name of them? "
1706,What causes lava eruptions (and shutoffs)?,"I understand the process of volcanism and the reason for magma deposition on the surface of the earth.  What is not clear to me, or what seems to be less well explained is why eruptions occur and then stop. What is the operative cause or causes of a flow to start or stop?  As far as my understanding goes there would seem to be two possible obvious explanations:  (1) The magma rises in bubbles, like a lava lamp, through the earth, so the flow begins when the bubble reaches the surface and stops when the bubble is exhausted.  (2) The magma rises as a constant stream, but causes earth to build up around the stream, eventually snuffing it out by mass accumulation. In this explanation, the lava constantly searches for thin spots where it erupts until it blocks itself off, then the pressure forces its way through some new location.  Are either or both of these explanations correct or incorrect? Is there a mechanism I have not considered?    Lava eruption in Iceland the size of Manhatten that began in 2014. "
1707,How did natural processes as we know them develop around effects of winter?,"Everything on earth evolved around changing seasons and the different versions of resources they bring with them, so I'm curious, how did natural processes take advantage of winter qualities to shape earth as we know it? It seems like the advantages captured from other seasons are more obvious, specifically to plant life (spring- showers, summer- direct sunlight) so what's the unique aspect of winter that helps continue the process? "
1708,Will we even be burning fossil fuels in approx. 100 years? Worry about climate effects?,Do we really need to worry about the effects of burning fossil fuels when in all likelihood we won’t be burning fossil fuels in about a 100 years or maybe a little more?   We will have technologies in about 100 years where burning fossil fuels will seem like using a steam engine today. I think it will be laughable / primitive to burn fossil fuels.   It will be rare to burn fossil fuels for power and not of consequence to the environment any longer.   What are we really worried about when we are just going to be burning them for a little bit longer?   Can we really do that much damage over the next hundred years if we are somewhat reasonable? 
1709,How straight is the Kola superdeep borehole?,"The legendary Kola superdeep borehole is about 12 km deep. To achieve such depth, a major difficulty is to make sure the borehole is vertical straight.   Intuitively, when the borehole is deep enough, it is very hard to make sure that the drilling bit is still moving downwards.  Suppose it hits some hard rock, it can be easily deflected.   So, how straight is the Kola borehole? What technique is invoked in drilling straight downwards?  "
1710,Need help understanding rain rate formulas from drop sizes,"I have come across different formulas by which the rain rate [mm/s] or [mm/h] can be computed from the drop size distribution. I'm somehow unable to convert the different formulas into each other. It is maybe a stupid question with some unit error, but I cannot find it.  A well-known formula seems: \begin{equation}R_1 = \frac{\pi}{6} \int_0^{\infty} v(D) D^3 N(D) dD \end{equation} This should be the instantaneous rain rate in [mm/s]?? Unfortunately most publications just quote the formula without units...  I'm supposing that [tex] is in [mm], [tex] in [mm[tex] m[tex]], and [tex] in [m s[tex]].  [tex] is usually approximated as [tex].  Another formula I have come across is  \begin{equation} R_2 = 6\pi \cdot 10^{-4} \int_0^{\infty} v(D) D^3 N(D) dD, \end{equation} which is said to be [mm/h], then. Also for [tex] in [mm], [tex] in [mm[tex] m[tex]], and [tex] in [m s[tex]].  Now apparently [tex]. But why?  If [tex] is in [mm/s], then we should multiply by 3600 to get to [mm/h]. Can someone spot where I am wrong? Is it right that [tex] is in [mm/s]? (given the units of D, N(D) as above) "
1711,Does grade of metamorphism apply to igneous and sedimentary rocks?,Does grade of metamorphism apply to igneous and sedimentary rocks?  I know that grade of metamorphism applies to the scale in which a rock becomes crystallized. Or is it?  Please also define grade of metamorphism as a clarification. 
1712,Does climate change cause increase in co2?,"My main question is how do we know that increase in global temperature does not CAUSE an increase in co2 concentration?  I am trying to develop my mental model of what's going on for the climate change issue.  There is definitely a correlation between global temperature and co2 concentration, this is not disputed.  The general consensus is that co2 increase causes temperature increase, why is the reverse situation not studied (if it is I could not find any studies).  This thought comes from the statement I've seen that water vapor concentration is more correlated to global temperature  than co2, but this is intuitive since warmer air holds more water vapor than colder air.  Does the same intuition hold for co2?  I am not an expert on the subject; so I understand that I may be way off base with my reasoning.  I also openly accept  edits to my question if it is not structured or presented properly. "
1713,"What is the white coating ""patina"" we often see on deposited chalcedony/agate?","Me and some of my friends were wondering what exactly is the white coating we can see on chalcedony that has been deposited by a river during quartenary (and so the original material is damaged and has a lot of cracks in it). This is an example:      What is the white coating ? Is it opal ? Cacholong ?  So far everything I found was this link: [website]These people describe it as ""patina"" or ""chalcedony weathering"". I am wodering what is the process and how can we easily chemically or physically explain it ?   I think it must be some kind of weathering.. similar to oxidation. I believe that it is opalization. What do you think ? I saw this forming on many agates all over the world, but only at these, that were eroded from the mother rock, transported and deposited. It is especiially common on deposited chalcedony.  Thank you. "
1714,Do you have any informations about fossil-rich cherts from Scandinavia?,"Me and some of my friends have found many rocks similar to these in central Europe - we believe that it is fossil-rich chert that originally comes from Scandinavia.    There are many interesting fossils like brachiopods and sea urchins.  We find many of them in southern Moravia - there are many sandpits with quartenary sediments (mostly sands and gravel) that were deposited by river Svitava. We think that these stones must had been transported by glaciers from Scandinavia and then deposited by rivers.  I have searched for this material on the internet and could not find any informations about its formation or deposition. Do you have any informations please ? Could you provide me some links, pdf-thesis or an explanation  ?  Thank you. "

The first shows data from two sources, while the second only shows data from one source.  What is the difference between the two data sources used? Where does it come from, and what is the accuracy?  What is the reason the first map has data the second one doesn't? The most reasonable conclusion is that it comes from the ERSST data that's not in the second map, but it would be nice to know why there is a difference.        A question was posted on the Skeptics site regarding the claims made in the linked blog post. However, the existing answer currently does not provide much detail and comments were posted suggesting that this site may be able to provide more information about the NOAA data and the science behind it.

1716,Climatology Career,"I am a high school Biology teacher with a crazy passion for climate and environmental changes. I wish I had known this before I started college. I have been out of college for a year and have been teaching ever since. I would really love to learn more about climate, weather, atmosphere and maybe even go back to school for this. What would be the best approach? I have a B.A. in Biological Science. Would I go back for a B.A. in Atmospheric sciences or just jump into a Masters?   Are there any books on the topic of climate/climatology that you would recommend?    "
1717,How accurate are climate models?,"""All models are wrong but some are useful"". I am not against the concept of anthropogenic climate change because climate models may not be strong source of information for climate change. Observation data in the last 30 years or more are enough to prove that human related emissions are affecting the radiative and thermal properties of land, ocean and atmosphere. This question is about climate models which are based on approximations in so many ways.  I am deeply concerned that most modelers tune their models for the right or wrong reasons to produce ""quality"" publications on peer-reviewed journals. They seem to say, ""look at my model, it perfectly reproduced what is observed"". But we know that, there are so many approximations for turbulence, micro-physics, land surface fluxes, and so forth. The numerical solution approximation by itself imposes serious limit to the accuracy of climate models. Some manuscripts that I found are ""too accurate to be true"". Then my question is how accurate can a climate model be? Are there methods to check the accuracy of those publications claiming to be true?     Edit: This question is broad and it requires broad answer based on  uncertainties imposed on climate models by approximations at each level of the model development and indicate the maximum  achievable accuracy level. In my mind something like the following conceptual figure.  Warning: The following figure is not based on any study or realistic data. It is just something I have produced for something the answer to my questions may look like.   "
1718,Increase in Stratification late monsoon in Bay of Bengal,"I am involved in an experiment in the Bay of Bengal, letting moorings for a year long period and doing ship cruises. We have observed (from mooring CTDs) that the Brunt Vaisala frequency has increased almost by a magnitude of 10^1 during the late Indian monsoon period (September-December). The depth of measurement is 0-100 metres. Year 2016.  Possibility 1: Drifting of instruments and hence wrong measurements? Possibility 2: Any process which can create such an increase in stratification.  Possibility 2 is my question. The whole water column shows a similar increasing trend in stratification which kind of negates Possibility 1. So, could you please help with some process insight on the kind of ways this can happen? For some inputs: Bay of Bengal gets very huge amount of fresh water during Monsoons.  "
1719,Would there still be wind if Earth had no water?,"If there was no water on the earth would there still be wind? If the planet was basically a desert from pole to pole, east to west, would the wind still blow? I understand that wind is a result of a difference in pressure, but is it true that water being naturally cooler is what creates that pressure difference?    I don't find any answers that clearly state whether or not wind would still exist without water and whether or not water is the originating source of wind. I see that most of the answers that talk about the source of wind say that cooler air moves in as warmer air rises, but wouldn't all the air in the world be warm/hot without water to cool it?  The pressure difference seems to be cool versus warm.   "
1720,"Do the rocks below an active sill go down, or those above go up, or both?","Having read a little about sill formations like the Palisades Sill (eastern USA) and Whin Sill (UK), I understand that strata became separated by the injected layer of magma, with monumental thicknesses achieved in the two examples mentioned.  However, when one considers the weight of the overlying rock, especially if a sill has formed up to several kilometres below the surface, is it the case that the strata and rocks immediately beneath the growing, injected magma layer were sinking, i.e. a descent of the lower solid layer(s) — with magma being injected from somewhere via fissures, etc., to form the sill above — until static equilibrium was achieved? Or did the pressure from the injected magma layer cause the overlying rocks — and therefore the ground surface — to be forced up?  Are there studies that have shown what occurs, for old sills or even ones that have been monitored whilst actively forming? "
1721,"In hydrology, what's the difference between specific and total catchment area?","I am getting stuck on the concepts of Total Catchment Area (TCA) and Specific Catchment Area (SCA) as I try to learn more about TOPMODEL and hydrology modeling. What do these metrics mean in hydrology? The context I encounter these in is in calculating Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) values.   My understanding so far is that: TCA is basically equivalent to a watershed for any given pour point; SCA helps determine saturation and saturation excess flow and it is the ratio of a local catchment area for a pour point divided by the width of the contour where that pour point is. I'm especially uncertain about SCA because it's unclear to me how the width of the contour is involved in a catchment area (based on my conceptual framework of a watershed a/k/a catchment area being defined by a single pour point). So, maybe I also need ""Flow Width"" (a term I think I've seen used to describe that contour width used in SCA) to be explained in order to understand SCA.  To give some context to what I'm referring to, here's a passage which references both TCA and SCA:     ""Upslope area is the total catchment area above a point or length of contour and the specific catchment area is the upslope area per width of contour or cell size, L (Moore et al., 1991). Specific catchment area is used to calculate saturation and saturation excess overland flow in hydrological models such as TOPMODEL (Beven and Kirkby, 1979) and, along with other topographic indices, to calculate erosion and landsliding in many other models. Upslope area is commonly used for mapping channels on the basis of threshold upslope areas for channel initiation.   J. Wainwright &amp; M. Mulligan.

1723,Does rain (temporarily) deplete the surrounding atmosphere of carbon dioxide?,"CO2 in the air dissolves into rain water, making them slightly acidic. Is that enough to deplete the surrounding air out of CO2? If yes, how fast does this occur? Is it only with the first drops of rain or do you need several hours?

1725,How much of Earth's forested land is currently protected from logging/deforestation?,"Deforestation is an ongoing global problem. From this National Geographic webpage:     The quickest solution to deforestation would be to simply stop cutting down trees. [However], financial realities make this unlikely to occur. ... A more workable solution is to carefully manage forest resources by eliminating clear-cutting to make sure that forest environments remain intact. ... The number of new tree plantations is growing each year, but their total still equals a tiny fraction of the Earth’s forested land.   How much forested land is currently protected from logging/deforestation?  How much is currently at risk?  How do tree plantations compare in overall size?  I'm hoping someone could answer these questions in terms of the main countries involved.  Here is what I have found thus far:  From [website]  Forests cover 31 percent of the world's land surface, just over 4 billion hectares. This is down from the pre-industrial area of 5.9 billion hectares. ... According to data from the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization [below], deforestation was at its highest rate in the 1990s, when each year the world lost on average 16 million hectares of forest—roughly the size of the state of Michigan. At the same time, forest area expanded in some places, either through planting or natural processes, bringing the global net loss of forest to 8.3 million hectares per year.  In the first decade of this century, the rate of deforestation was slightly lower, but still, a disturbingly high 13 million hectares were destroyed annually. As forest expansion remained stable, the global net forest loss between 2000 and 2010 was 5.2 million hectares per year.      South America and Africa are clearly the biggest area of concerns due to illegal logging and corrupt governance.  Should we expect the rates of deforestation in those continents to continue ""as-is""?  Or is there some percentage of forested areas that can be expected to last (e.g. perhaps some countries are less corrupt)? Furthermore, if the size of forested land on N. America, Asia, and Europe remains constant or grows, how much of that is due to tree plantations? "

1728,Need help understanding variables that relate to meterology terminology,"I am working on a project in predicting the weather and I had a few brief questions.   I understand that radar works by bouncing waves off of precipitation and measuring reflectivity.

I am guessing that this means it measures the strength of the signal returning from a 5x5 area around the measuring gauge? Is this correct? What does it mean that it is in the 10th percentile? The 50th percentile? The 90th? The next variable is, ""Maximum reflectivity values in the vertical column above gauge in dBZ"". I know that dBZ is used to measure reflectivity, but what does it mean in the vertical column above the gauge? I understand Correlation Coefficient to be the measure of how similarly the horizontally and vertically polarized pulses are behaving within a pulse volume. Can someone please tell me what a pulse volume is?   I really appreciate any help. Most answers I found through my own digging, but I really need help to understand these few questions. "
1729,Does this optical phenomenon have a name?,"Last summer, I snuck out with a row boat around 4am. Eventually with the sun risen but still quite low in the horizon, I was rowing in the middle of the absolutely still lake when I witnessed an optical phenomenon unlike anything that I've ever seen before: I found myself enclosed in a triangle in which, the sun was in one corner, and in the other corners, the surface of the lake had turned rainbow-colored.   As a photographer I technically understand what happens there, i.e. even though it looked clear to the eye, there obviously must've been some nocturnal mist left on the water surface to act as a medium, and, had there been more moisture particles higher up in the air, I should've seen an entire rainbow connecting these two reflections. But due to the conditions, apparently all I saw was the ends of the rainbow, on their own.   I tried to search for instances or info on this, but found none. Does this specific phenomenon have a name? Under what conditions might one expect to possibly witness this phenomenon?  Here's a quick illustration of the setting, as perceived subjectively. I made a quick simulation of the sun in that time and location using Stellarium , and the sun was about 11° above the horizon (actual bald horizon, not including trees, hills etc.)   "
1730,What causes the counter-intuitive presence of CO2 in the atmosphere during spring and summer months?,"Recently, I stumbled upon this NASA map of the Earth from the OCO-2, a satellite that measures CO2 density in the atmosphere. [website]As you can see during the spring, there is less CO2 over open ocean and higher CO2 over landmasses. During the summer, (by the naked eye) there seems to be a higher CO2 density across the path the satellite took. I'm curious the reason for the differences we see.  I would expect that during the summer months, when there is a higher density of CO2 , that there would be a lower density of CO2 because of an overall increase in vegetation. During the spring, there would be more CO2 because of a significant decrease in vegetation and increase in energy consumption in the Northern Hemisphere (but not as much as during heavy winter).   Am I making a wrong assumption? What am I missing?  I think this is a distinct question from this one because I'm asking only in the scope of one year or across consecutive seasons. "
1731,"When was it ever considered that the desert might be ""man-made"", or otherwise anthropocenically-induced?","This answer pointed me to the Wikipedia page for Farouk El-Baz in which the desert research and theories subsection says:     During the past 20 years in his research at Boston University, El-Baz has utilized satellite images to better understand the origin and evolution of desert landforms. He is credited with providing evidence that the desert is not man-made, but the result of major climatic variations. His research uncovered numerous sand-buried rivers and streams in the Sahara based on the interpretation of radar images.      These former water courses lead into depressions in the terrain, which he theorized must contain groundwater. His analysis of these data resulted in the location of groundwater in the arid terrains of Egypt, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.), and perhaps Darfur in Sudan (unless it dried up).   I was surprised to read that the ""origin and evolution of desert landforms"" was ever considered to have an anthropocenic component.  Question: When was it ever considered that the desert might be ""man-made"", or otherwise anthropocenically-induced? Is it possible to know which desert was thought to be man-made that El-Baz proved wasn't? Or does the passage refer to all deserts? "
1732,WRF/Chem: Editing NetCDF (wrfchemi files) for own emissions,"Does anybody here have any experience with editing wrfchemi outputs from the prep_chem utility so that I overwrite the file with my own emissions?  I am knowledgeable in python, but I am not that well oriented with the manipulation of NetCDF files.   What I want to do, basically, is to use my own emissions inside the WRF/Chem model   I have a shapefile of emissions (gridded) with each grid having a value for the emissions. I want to convert this to a readable format for the WRF/Chem; however, I think editing the wrfchemi files by prep_chem would be easier? (Tell me if not)   I have read the emissions guide of the WRF/Chem, but it does not really expound on details about this especially about the following   How to deal with the speciation (my shapefile has only PM10 and PM2.5). where exactly do I place this in the new emissions file (the edited wrfchemi)I want. There are many pm species there (like pm2.5 nucleation mode, pm, etc). I am not sure what weights to put on these. My emissions are not time dependent, and what do I do when I edit the wrfchemi file for this. (the wrfchemi files I have now are also not time dependent)   Hoping someone could help out with this.  Thanks! "

1736,"What does ""glacier collapse"" mean?","CNN's Mont Blanc glacier could collapse at any moment, Italy warns says:     A staggering 250,000 cubic meters (8.8 million cubic feet) of ice could break away from the Planpincieux glacier on the Grandes Jorasses mountain in the Mont Blanc massif, experts at the Valle d'Aosta regional government and the Fondazione Montagna Sicura (Safe Mountain Foundation) reported in an analysis published this week.      While it's impossible to predict the exact timing of the collapse, observations in August and September showed that the glacier was shifting at a speed of 50 to 60 centimeters (20 to 24 inches) a day, experts said.      ""These phenomena once again show that the mountain is going through a phase of strong change due to climatic factors, therefore it is particularly vulnerable,"" Stefano Miserocchi, mayor of nearby Courmayeur, said in a statement. ""In this case, it's a temperate glacier particularly sensitive to high temperatures.""As a precautionary measure, Miserocchi ordered the closure of roads in the Val Ferret valley and the evacuation of mountain huts in the Rochefort area.   The caption of the image in the link (shown below) is labeled Figure 22, so presumably it's from some much larger report.  I'm curious about the choice of the word ""collapse"". What is it exactly that the glacier might do? Will it collapse in the same way that a Soufflé collapses, or is this more like an avalanche, or does the whole glacier just start sliding much faster, like several meters per day instead of several tens of centimeters currently?

1739,Are there models of mortality due to sea level increases (via climate change)?,"In a self-answer of mine on Skeptics, one of the comments rightly pointed out that the model in question (from Impact Lab) does not explicitly account for mortality due to sea level changes.

1740,Can we see the circulation cells in wind maps?,"Earth famously possesses three distinct circulation cells per hemisphere.  Now out of curiosity one could use a weather app, like windy, to display the wind structures at ground level globally, and the supposed return winds at around 250 hPa height.  When I do that, the picture is very messy and I cannot see any clear circulation cells.  I suppose, that all the other messy physics of the Earths atmosphere will overlap with the cells, but is there a time in the year or variable I can use to see the circulation cells in wind maps? Or are they in the end just an idealised time-average, that we use to model the winds / (trade winds, famously..) and don't exist at any given time? "

1742,How much water do aquifers contain? How much does it take to deplete them?,"How much water does a typical aquifer contain, and is casual well use is likely to deplete them?  Your answer can take many forms, but an ideal question would cover these sort of areas- would a single well that someone took 50 liters from a day deplete one? Do you need industrial use of hundreds of meters cubed? Typically how vulnerable are they to depletion by people. Is there a lot of variability in size, or are they usually fairly large? Does it take months, years, decades?  Inspired by Mad Max, where there is a large mountain aquifer supplying a couple hundred people and I have no idea how long it would take to deplete.  Previous questions have covered this in vague terms but haven't given a general picture of what it's like for people in general, especially in more remote areas where they may not have access to the largest of aquifers, which apparently can last decades. I'm more curious what it's like for a random farmer. "

1744,How is climate change today different than the climate change that ended the ice age(s)?,"Someone I know posted a question about climate change that I do not know how to answer. While I do believe (for lack of better word) in climate change, I do not know how to answer this persons question. The tl;dr of the question is:     If climate change is not a natural phenomenon, then how did the last   ice age end?   The person is implying that warming/cooling reoccurs periodically on the Earth, and that the current climate change threat is overblown.  I have searched online for answers, but cannot find anything concise on this specific subject. According to this wikipedia article,      There is evidence that greenhouse gas levels fell at the start of ice   ages and rose during the retreat of the ice sheets, but it is   difficult to establish cause and effect (see the notes above on the   role of weathering). Greenhouse gas levels may also have been affected   by other factors which have been proposed as causes of ice ages, such   as the movement of continents and volcanism.   In short, how and why did the last ice ages end? I am assuming that the carbon dioxide concentration during these ice ages is much lower than the current estimate of ~410 ppm. Aside from the difference in carbon dioxide levels, what evidence suggests that the climate change of today is different than the climate change that ended the ice age(s)? "
1745,"With so many positive feedbacks accelerating global warming, how did the earth ever re-enter ice ages after it came out of one?","We hear a lot about positive feedbacks when it comes to global warming. For example: ice reflects solar radiation, so as the ice melts more solar radiation is absorbed which accelerates warming; rising temperatures create more deserts; release of stored methane; water-vapour feedback; etc.  With so many positive feedbacks it would seem that once the earth has flipped out of an ice age it would take an absolutely tremendous amount of change to get us back into one. Yet the explanations given for the onset and offset of ice ages (subtle orbital variations, continental movements) do not seem that great.  So how can these subtle changes ever be enough to flip us back into an ice age?   Do we have long time span climate-models to validate our theories? "
1746,Deserts and Humidity,How is that a general rule of thumb that less humidity equals more rain? Deserts don’t get much rain and humidity is also very low. Rainforests get a lot of rain when the humidity is very high so how is that that less humidity equals more rain? 
1747,Precipitation and Elevation,Does precipitation increase or decrease as elevation increases? Because I heard that in the mountains they get more precipitation due to the orographic effect and how the mountains drain the moisture from the clouds but in 8th grade my science teacher told me that precipitation actually decreases as elevation increases so I’m just confused? 
1748,Is this classification of mineral formation environments correct?,"I am writing an app for students that consist in 180 sheets of the most common minerals on Earth's Crust.   One of the fields of the sheets is environment of formation.  It is important to me to correctly classify environments because I generate with code thousands of questions for a quiz type:     In wich environment would you found calcopyrite?      a) Sedimentary      b) ....     This is my classification of environments of formation of minerals:   Sedimentary: diagenesys minerals etc (calcite, halite...). Magmatic: sensu stricto igneous minerals (quartz, plagioclase...). Metamorphic: minerals formed on metamorphism (muscovite, clorite...). Tardimagmatic: stockworcks, IOCG, VMS, etc, derivatived from magma.(copper, pyrite...). Hydrothermal: basin fluids, veins of hig-medium-low grade (quartz, serpentinite...). Exogenous: neoformation minerals on surface by (alteration clays...).     My question is: is this classification correct?  I am particullary worried about tardimagmatic environment. I am sure the term is used at Spain, but it migth not be very accurate at anglo saxon Universities, for the english version of my app.    Update from answers  Thank you very much for answers. Exogenous was totally an inaccurated term and I suspected tardimagmatic was not a very used term, so my clasification will be:   Sedimentary Magmatic Metamorphic Hydrothermal Supergenic   My users will thank it.   As answering Gimelist yes the sheets have multiple environments as you can see for pyrite. This is taken in count when I generate the questions (not to show two correct options).    I know to memorize is not a good way to learn, but for first courses they should associate quickly eg heidenbergite as inosilicate. I add a description of the environment so I think the quiz has some pedagocical value for first courses students.    "
1749,Are there natural-forcings climate projections over the 21st century?,"CMIP5 offers natural-forcings-only simulations over 1850-2005, which allows comparison with the historical simulations, which allows us to show how anthropogenic forcings have affected the climate over that time.  CMIP5 also offers projections over the 21st century, with a range of RCPs allowing for different emissions scenarios.  However, CMIP5 doesn't include a 21st century natural forcing for comparison, even though this would be useful. Do such simulations exist anywhere else?  I realise that these would not be perfectly possible, since data for natural forcings like volcanoes are not available. However, these might be reasonably simulated using a stochastic model. Other natural forcings, such as orbital forcings, can be calculated fairly easily over the next century. Solar irradiance probably falls somewhere in between the two.  If such simulations do not exist, would it be unreasonable to use the 1850-2005 natural forcings simulations as the basis for a statistical model of the 21st century? Or are some of the natural forcings likely to change substantially (e.g. are 20th century volcanoes unrepresentative of the background, or is the orbital forcing likely to change substantially over the coming century?).

1750,Aren't fresh water deposits renewed by water cycle?,"I have recently watched ""How Many People Can Live on Planet Earth?"" documentary with David Attenborough. In it, in the main factors that will limit total human population Earth can support the limited amount of fresh water was named. There also was a part where it described how on International Space Station fresh water is distilled from astronaut urine.  My current understanding is that all the water (fresh or not) in nature (i.e. on planet Earth) is infinitely going through water cycle, and thus non-fresh water is sort of distilled into fresh, by this natural process.  My questions are:   Where am I wrong in my assumption about natural water distillation (i.e. is rain water not as clean as it should be in theory)? Why don't we collect rain water (at least for plant watering, if it is not suitable for drinking)? Theoretically: after an animal consumed some amount of water, say a glass, how long will it take, given that animal just urinated on the ground, for that water to go through water cycle and become ready for drinking again?

1752,Are nutrient cycles described in terms of a level of health or of degradation?,"Nutrient cycles such as the carbon cycle, water cycle, or nitrogen cycle underlie much of our day-to-day, year-to-year activities and well-being. Is there a term or system of assessing how ""healthy"" or not nutrient cycles are for humanity or for net primary productivity overall? It's clear that certain qualities of storages and flows will either make life pretty good for us and other organisms, or make things pretty bad for us. I'm just not sure how to refer to that fact. Do experts in this field refer to nutrient cycles as being 'degraded' or 'restored', or how is it referred to?  Below paragraphs are just examples to clarify what I'm trying to get a vocabulary for regarding nutrient cycles.    The water cycle is an obvious example of this, where we need a goldilocks zone amount of water to thrive; too much water in the form of runoff, flooding, and erosion and we end up with numerous environmental costs or even loss of suitable habitat, too little water in the form of drought or degraded water quality and we end up with numerous environmental costs or even loss of suitable habitat. How do we refer to the water cycle that is suitable or unsuitable for us? What is it called when the nutrient cycle is altered to become better (I'd think ""restored"") or worse (""degraded"")?  Nitrogen or carbon are probably the next best example cycles. On a global scale we are doing pretty major alterations to the natural flows and storages of these elements. On the one hand, pulling so much carbon out of long-term storages has benefited us in vast and various ways, but these benefits may be relatively short-lived if we degraded the nutrient cycle to the point that it worsens our habitat and strains our economies around the world.

1753,Making a local geological field trip an interesting and educational event for children?,"I have no expertise in geology or earth science, but I would like to do a ""field trip"" with my home-schooled young children (under age 10) where I could teach them about geology from a hands-on perspective.  What could I do on this field trip that would make this event memorable and special for the children, that would not be possible just at home at the dining table?  If you are unfamiliar with small children, here are some outside things they like to do that I think may be compatible with this kind of event:   digging (and hopefully finding pretty rocks, crystals, fossils, etc) hiking, walking, and running exploring ""the wild"" caves creatures   I had a few ideas, but I don't know if any of them are practical or possible, or where I could gain the skills to make these really happen?   Use our knowledge of geology to predict what kind of rocks we'd find if we dug in one place. Go there and dig, and see if we are right. Somehow actually find something that is uncommon: iron, shark teeth, crystals Find an area with 2-3 distinct kinds of rock, so it is very easy for the kids to distinguish this sedimentary rock over here from that igneous rock over there. Bring back something that would be more interesting when viewed under a microscope   I would hope that any answers could be generally applied anywhere, but if it is helpful I live on the Wasatch Front in Utah, USA "

1755,"Are there ""transparent"" clouds?","Comments below this answer to the question Why are lightning towers at launch pads topped with big hollow tubes with spiral windings and not “lightning rod-shaped” lightning rods? link to a 2013 Kennedy Space Center News item RELEASE : 13-03 Space Shuttle Weather Launch Commit Criteria and KSC End of Mission Weather Landing Criteria. It's quite detailed, and discusses cloud transparency in several places.   Question: Are there ""transparent"" clouds? Are there any standards by which cloud transparency is measured or even visually quantified? I'm wondering if this is a Kennedy Space Center-specific term and they have their own way of estimating cloud transparency, or if it might be a standard meteorological term. Since launches can happen day or night, it calls into question how transparency is determined at night, and if it uses visible light or infrared measurements from ground or satellite.    Here are the most relevant excerpts in case the link breaks at some point in the future. This is from 2003.  There is one instance of ""transparent cloud"":        The one-minute average of the electric field mill network may not exceed -1 or +1 kilovolt per meter within five nautical miles of the launch pad or the lightning flash at any time within 15 minutes prior to launch. This field mill criteria becomes -1.5 or + 1.5 kilovolts per meter if there are no clouds within 10 nautical miles of the flight path except those which are transparent. Also excepted are clouds with tops below the 41 degrees F. temperature level that have not have been previously associated with a thunderstorm, or associated with convective clouds having tops above the 14 degrees F. temperature level during the last three hours.       as well as a whole section on non-transparent clouds and parts of clouds:     Clouds: (types known to contain hazardous electric fields)      [...]         Do not launch if the flight path is through any non-transparent clouds that extend to altitudes at or above the 32 degrees F. level which are associated with disturbed weather producing moderate or greater precipitation, or melting precipitation, within five nautical miles of the flight path.   Do not launch through an attached anvil cloud. If lightning occurs in the anvil or the associated main cloud, do not launch within 10 nautical miles for the first 30 minutes after lightning is observed, or within 5 nautical miles from 30 minutes to 3 hours after lightning is observed.    Do not launch if the flight path will carry the vehicle:      a) through non-transparent parts of a detached anvil for the first three hours after the anvil detaches from the parent cloud, or the first four hours after the last lightning occurs in the detached anvil.      b)  10 nautical miles of non-transparent parts of a detached anvil for the first thirty minutes after the time of the last lightning in the parent or anvil cloud before detachment, or the detached anvil after its detachment.      c) within 5 nautical miles of non-transparent parts of a detached anvil for the first three hours after the time of the last lightning in the parent or anvil cloud before detachment, or the detached anvil after detachment, unless there is a field mill within 5 nautical miles of the detached anvil reading less than 1,000 volts per meter for the last 15 minutes and a maximum radar returns from any part of the detached anvil within 5 nautical miles of the flight path have been less than 10 dBZ on radar (light rain) for 15 minutes.    Do not launch if the flight path will carry the vehicle through a thunderstorm or cumulonimbus debris cloud which is not transparent and less than three hours old. Launch may not occur within five nautical miles of these debris clouds unless: 1) for 15 minutes preceding launch there is at least one working field mill within five nautical miles of the debris cloud; 2) all electric field mill readings are between -1 kilovolt and + 1 kilovolt per meter within five nautical miles of the flight path; 3) no precipitation has been detected in the debris cloud (less than 10 dbz by radar) within 5 nautical miles of the flight path.

But predictions for the next few 100 millions of years are unequivocal that the about 10% increase of solar illumination will massively increase temperatures on earth, leading to annihilation of at least all higher life (For details, see for instance here: Solar_evolution, When will Earth lose its oceans?)   Now, it stands to reason that at some point the climate dampening mechanisms will be overwhelmed by additional solar irradiation. But there is no indication that the next 10% will be it, if at all the last 500 million years seem to indicate a trend to cooler temperatures:     What are the assumptions that these models are based on to come to their dire predictions?  "
1759,What are we seeing when we see the curvature of Earth?,"I don't know if this question's for here, physics, maths, or geometry.  I know that this or something similar has been asked a million times, but I've recently come to the concept that since the horizon is a circle centered at the viewer's position, the whole horizon is at the same level, hence why it's flat.  So what is it that we're seeing when we start seeing the curvature once we're high enough? I have a feeling that the answer to this has to do with the angle that the globe takes in your ""camera"", but the question still stands, what is this picture looking at? Why does it show a curve in the horizontal?   "
1760,Is the Arctic ice dissapearing faster than IPCC models say?,"Are observations of Arctic sea ice in accord with what the IPCC forecasts says they should be? And as such is the ice reducing in an exponential or linear way?  For instance, from [website]  Projection: The IPCC has always confidently projected that the Arctic   ice sheet was safe at least until 2050 or well beyond 2100. Reality:   Summer ice is thinning faster than every climate projection, and today   scientists predict an ice-free Arctic in years, not decades.   And then is this prediction based on the curved line on the left (found here) or the straight one on the right (found here) (both are from NSIDC data):   "
1761,Could parallel rivers flow in opposite directions?,"Some rivers have been moving backwards. This got me thinking about an unusual idea.

Is there anything like this on Earth already? Is it even possible? "
1762,What level of heat creates a dust devil?,"My understanding is that a dust devil is created when heated air rises rapidly displacing the cooler air above up. My question is, how relatively hot does the patch of air on the ground have to get in order to create a dust devil, and how is the heat related to the height and size? And secondarily, do dust devils tend to occur more frequently within a certain range ambient temperature?   "
1763,Why is my pond / lake melting when the temperature is still far below freezing?,"I recently moved into a new house with a 2 acre lake behind it. We’ve had 15 consecutive days below freezing, and the last 12 of those have been below 20 degrees (Fahrenheit)! Six days ago I shoveled off a small spot to test out whether it would be good to ice skate on the surface, with the plan that yesterday I would shovel off a much bigger area. Yesterday morning, however, I woke up to a big area straight across starting to melt! The temperature was about 5 degrees F. This morning it’s even larger. The temperature did not exceed 20 degrees yesterday. Though there has been frigid cold it has been sunny. Is it possible that the area I shoveled caused this? The rest of the lake looks exactly the same (About 2” of snow all over it. No signs of melting anywhere else.) I’ve attached before and after pictures. Can’t figure out how in the world this could happen. Any ideas?   "

1765,What determines the spatial resolution of a study?,"This might sound like a silly question to many of you, but I am addressing the comments of a referee regarding a study I'm trying to publish and I remained a little puzzled about this issue.  Let's assume I have set up a simplified model that processes biophysical and socioeconomic data to analyze an issue attaining water management. Biophysical data (mainly topographic, climatic, and hydrological) are available at relatively high resolution (0.25 or 0.5 degree), while socioeconomic data are available at country resolution. The model was set up to run at gridcell resolution (0.25 degree), but, of course, all the cells of the same country share the same values of the socio-economic variables. However the process is run for each individual cell and the results are different from cell to cell, even in the same country.  In my manuscript, I claim that the resolution of my study is a quarter degree. This sentence is contested by a referee that states: ""The resolution of the results of a given study is actually defined by the coarsest dataset that the study uses (not the finest). Part of the data used are available only at country level, so the spatial resolution of their results is at that level, not finer.""  Now, I understand that coarse biophysical data (precipitation, temperature, land use, ....) should be eventually downscaled to be used in a gridded modeling approach, but what about variables like ""corruption"" or ""quality of the institutions""? Does a downscaling of such variables make any sort of sense?  What finally determines the spatial resolution of a study?  Thank you "

1774,"Can I use radar data to estimate snowfall, or is there a better way?","The problem:  There are lots of websites that provide snow forecasts for various ski resorts.  The area of interest to me is Japan, specifically the Nagano area, where I use snow-forecast.com and www.windyty.com to get fairly accurate snow forecasts at elevation for the resorts I'm interested in, and in the case of Windy, also for other mountain peaks outside of the ski resorts.  However, unsurprisingly, often in the morning it turns out that the forecasts are not always perfect.  In fact, they can often be way off.  Sometimes a big storm never materializes, and sometimes it affects only certain areas.  The Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) has public hourly weather station data, but the weather stations tend to be down in towns, rather than on mountain peaks, and are not necessarily near the ski resorts in question.  My solution at the moment is to frequently check the radar during storms, watching hour by hour to see which areas are being affected by the storm, correlate it with the weather station data, and try to make a prediction about which resorts are getting the most snow.  Needless to say, this is fairly time consuming and often misses some things (if the storm is a surprise, if there is a big storm somewhere that I'm not checking).  My proposed solution:  Write a script to screen scrape the radar images from the JMA and watch the pixel values of the areas in question, considering the pixel values to be a function of mm precip/hour, and taking the integral of the pixel function over time to get a rough estimate of total mm precip over the past 24 hours.  I can probably then use other data at the weather stations to fit a function to calculate estimated snowfall from mm precip, elevation, and temperature.  It obviously will be pretty inaccurate, but at least it should be able to tell me with a decent degree of certainty whether there is no snow, a little bit, a lot, or tons, which is the only degree of accuracy I need.  Questions about my proposal:   Is it more or less a sound idea? Does this data (""snow accumulation in the past 12-24 hours at an arbitrary lat/lon position"") already exist somewhere that I don't know about? Is there more accurate source of radar data somewhere?  I'm currently screen scraping the JMA website to download the images, then sampling the image pixel values to get the mm precip at a given position, but the data has already been discretized, presumably for aesthetic reasons.  I would way rather just pay someone for access to a web service that will take the lat/lon and a timestamp and spit out a more accurate number. Is there an easier way to do this that I'm missing?

1775,Could we plant enough trees to offset greenhouse gas emissions?,"In 2014, the world emitted 10 billion metric tonnes of carbon dioxide. A 50 year old oak tree forest sequesters 30,000 pounds of CO2 per acre. At that rate of sequestration per acre, offsetting all carbon emissions would require 735 million new acres of trees, which sounds like a lot but is only about 2% of the world's total land area. By comparison, Europe is about 1490 million acres, and the United States is 2400 million acres.  Would it be practical / possible to offset global carbon emissions by reforesting 2-3% of the earth's land area, specifically in deforested regions? I know you can't just conjure up a 50 year old oak forest, but by choosing the right species of trees it should be possible.  "

1777,Is there any correlation between Grand Solar Minimums (GSM) and earthquakes?,"I've found many claims arguing that the periods of minimum solar activity are associated with increases earthquakes and volcanic activities.  Some of these claims are supported by articles in scientific format. However, they are not published in mainstream scientific journals (as the ones listed by SCOPUS), but they seem to show some compelling evidence of the correlation between GSM and earthqueakes. Some of such articles are:   Volcanic and seismic activities during the solar hibernation periods Influences of solar cycles on earthquakes New Madrid Seismic Zone, central USA: The great 1811-12 earthquakes, their relationship to solar cycles, and tectonic settings The January 2018 M7.5 offshore North Honduras earthquake: its possible energy link to the New Madrid Seismic Zone, Mississippi Valley Whether solar flares can trigger earthquakes?   They put special emphasis in the association of GSM's with the activity of the New Madrid Fault.  However, in the mainstream scientific literature this correlations seem to be ignored. Then I wonder:  Is there any real correlation between Grand Solar Minimums and earthquakes?  If there is: How can solar activity affect earthquakes and volcanic activity? "
1778,Would the enthalpy of fusion for melting ice fields be a causative factor for colder winter weather?,"Would the enthalpy of fusion for melting ice fields be a causative factor for colder winter weather?  As an example, NASA estimated the annual loss of the Greenland ice field 2002-2013 as more than 280 gigatons, and apparently increasing.  Would the energy required for state transition on such a scale be a causitve factor in colder weather during a period of warming climate?  UPDATED:  My wording above was too generalized and I got good answers to a question slightly different than the one I intended.  Retry: According to Wikipedia, one of the vortices of the northern Polar vortex is Baffin Island, very near Greenland.  The recent unusually cold weather in the eastern US has been attributed to the path of the Polar Vortex this year. My question should have been ""could the energy required for state transition of the Greenland ice field contributed to the change in path of the Northern Polar Vortex this year?"" "

For example, at the base of a high pressure/temperature terrestrial magma ocean, the metal/silicate partition coefficent for Si is approximately [tex] to  [tex]""   But since this paper was published 12 years ago, I am wondering if there is any compelling evidence that Si is in Earth's core, and at what concentration it might be?

1781,Standardized scale for coastline length or mapping in general?,"Measuring the length of a coastline depends on the scale of the measuring tool. The smaller the scale of your tool, the longer will your measured coastline be. The reason for this is the fractal property of coastlines. This is well known since a paper by Benoît Mandelbrot ""How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension"".  Now I was wondering if there is a standardized mapping scale to come up with global or country wise numbers of coastline length?  And furthermore, if there even is a general rule for all mapping purposes, which scale is to be used in mapping?  Is there maybe even something like an ISO standard for this? "

1788,What are the causes of lower UV radiation at lower elevations?,"After recently visiting the Dead Sea in Israel and not getting any skin burns, I was wondering about the reasons for that.

Both UVA and UVB rays are lower, but UVB rays are attenuated the most.  These sources give mostly measurements, but hardly discuss the reasons for the lower radiation. I always thought that the ozone layer blocks most of the UV radiation, but here it seems that just a few hundred meters of atmosphere can greatly reduce the amount of incident UV.  What are the reasons for that? Is it simply because there are more air molecules that absorb the radiation? "

1790,Would it be wise to monitor real time human activity to anticipate earthquakes?,"Documented strange behaviors of animals before an earthquake could invite us to believe that some of them anticipate tectonic activity. We also know that human complex organization makes it difficult for all of us to get in touch with our deepest instinct.  Is it possible that this hypothetical natural ability to anticipate earthquakes still remains as some instinctive input in our daily behavior?  If yes, and to try to measure how much global human activity could reflect some anticipation, I think we could with modern technologies, monitor all our connected device hmi's (Mouse, touchpad, keyboard, phone, voice spectral data's) (anonymously of course) and study delta's on long periods.

I had a better look around 7 and concluded that it was definitely quite a bit brighter than it was the day before at that time. There was also a strange, yellow tint to the light.  I looked up when the sun comes up in Basel (where I live) and found out it's at 7:18. Later I did some googling to see if anyone else had noticed this and came across this article about something similar happening in 2008. It mentions polar stratospheric clouds as a likely cause. The following evening however, I didn't notice anything remarkable. And as I write this the next morning, The sun has now been up for an hour but due to clouds it looks darker than it did an hour and a half earlier in the morning yesterday.  So I'm wondering, what is the cause of this unusually bright morning twilight? And can I expect to see it again in the coming days/weeks/months?  Something that might relate to this is the siberian winter that seems to await Europe.  PS: I also wouldn't be averse to other people around Europe confirming that they also noticed this. "

1797,Trewartha climate classification overlap?,"By my reading of the wikipedia page on the Trewartha climate classification, climate classifications are not mutually exclusive.  Let's take a look at the climate classification of Iowa City, IA.  The Trewartha precipitation limit is defined as 10(T-10)+3P, where T is the mean annual temperature and P is the percentage of the annual precipitation occurring in the six high-sun months. In the northern hemisphere, this is Apr—Sep.  Using the data publicly available on weatherbase.com, the Trewartha precipitation limit is 608.23 mm. Twice that is 1216.46 mm.  BW (desert) climates are defined by mean annual precipitation below the original threshold (608.23 mm for Iowa City), BS (steppe) climates are defined by mean annual precipitation above the original threshold but less than twice the threshold (1216.46 mm for Iowa City), and if mean annual precipitation exceeds twice the threshold then the climate is not classified as B (dry). Iowa City's mean annual precipitation is 922.2 mm, earning it a BS (steppe) classification.  However, Iowa City also satisfies the definition of a Dca (hot-summer continental) climate under the Trewartha climate classification:   4-7 months with mean monthly temperature above 50 degrees (F). Iowa City has 7 (all of Apr—Oct) Coldest monthly mean temperature below 32 degrees (F). Iowa City's is 22.1 degrees (F) in Jan. Warmest monthly mean temperature above 72 degrees (F). Iowa City's is 74.8 degrees (F) in Jul.   The question is...under the Trewartha climate classification, is Iowa City, IA classified as a BS (steppe) climate, a Dca (hot-summer continental) climate, or both?  UPDATE: It's come to my attention that I incorrectly used Fahrenheit instead of Celsius for the mean annual temperature, and that Iowa City, IA therefore does not actually lie within a BS (steppe) climate zone. I'm going to leave the original question, though: what happens when a climate meets the criteria for more than one zone? "

1799,What is the best way to stay safe while photographing lightning storms?,"Occasionally, I go out with my camera and tripod and capture cumulonimbus clouds from distance. Sometimes I am worried when I hear thunder that I could be hit by a lightning bolt. I have seen several ""bolts out of a clear blue sky"" and it reminds me of the danger (even though the probability is probably small).   Photography by ©Jeff Miles  A nice example of lightning comming out of cumulonimbus anvil - I've heard that you can even be hit hundreds of kilometres away (but it's extremely unlikely).  Additionally, I know that during thunderstorms it is very dangerous just to stay in contact with metals or water. This is why I never go out (or open windows) when I take photos of lightning from my flat. But... I have seen several amazing captures of lightning by storm chasers. How is it that they are so close to lightning, but do not get struck? Is there any trick or are they simply risking their lives?      I've considered how lightning strikes, and drew this image.  In this situation it seems that there are three possible targets. I drew a radius around each object because it my intuition suggests it would work like this.  If so, then the building on top of the hill has the highest probability of being struck.  If the lightning bolt hits the object closest to its path, could we completely protect ourselves from being struck by staying RELATIVELY close to some much taller objects, so that they would cover the sky around us with their large radius?  I would like to stay in safe, but take some beautiful photos of lightning too.  I know everyone says that ""during lightning storms you should never stand under trees"". But if located right, can you actually be protected from danger like this?  Or what practices are truly the best way to stay safe while photographing lightning storms? "

1803,Is non-randomly-sampled historical data representative?,"I'm a global warming skeptic, and one of my concerns is the accuracy of historical global temperatures. Since these temperatures weren't sampled at random locations or gridded points, can they be considered an accurate representation of ""global temperature""?  Thoughts/etc:   [website][website]I know climate scientists slice the Earth up into grids to avoid clustering bias, but that's not the same thing, and isn't useful if the original readings don't accurately represent the slice/region. I also realize that climate scientists have other measures of global warming, but linear regression of actual temperature measurements seems to be the most used to convince the public, so their accuracy seems important. As a skeptic, I'd also like to know if, in general, most of the arguments for global warming are statistical in nature (ie, linear regression on measured variables), or the statistical ones are just the most ""photogenic"" for public consumption? In other words, is the whole non-randomly-sampled/gridded temperature argument a red herring?   EDIT (to clarify question):  To determine the Earth's mean surface temperature, we can employ one of these methods:   Measure the Earth's temperature at every point and average. Of course, this is physically impossible, since a point is a 0-dimensional mathematical abstraction, but we can do something close with satellites. Select a large number of random points on the Earth's surface (this random distribution is uniform in longitude, but not in latitude-- in latitude, it would look like a cosine curve), measure the temperature, and average. In addition to giving us a mean, it would give us a standard deviation so we can say ""we are 95% confident that the Earth's true mean temperature is X plus or minus Y"". Take a uniformly spaced grid (non trivial, since the distance between longitudes vary by latitude), measure the temperature at those points and average. This is similar to the first approach, but with fewer points. Unless we believe our grid points introduce a bias, this should be as accurate as random sampling.   My problem: temperature measurements in the past were made using NONE of these methods. The points where temperature was measured were not chosen randomly or in a gridded fashion. Therefore, how can they be an accurate measurement of historical temperature, even if we only consider temperature changes?  NOTE: I realize surface temperature isn't the best measure of global warming, since water has a much higher specific heat than land (among other things), but that's my focus for this question. "
1804,Why did it take so long to discover the volcanic nature of mid-oceanic ridges?,"I just read this article and was astonished to see the following:     Oceanographers stumbled on [the mid-oceanic ridges'] volcanic nature in 1973.   What I find surprising is how recent that is.  Considering that   the history of geology in general goes back at least 3 or 4 centuries the study of plate tectonics goes back to 1912 (even though it took a few more decades to gain wide acceptance) oceanic ridges were known at least as early as 1872 the correlation between seismic activity and volcanoes has been known for some time (I don't know exactly how long, but certainly the Romans felt the ground shaking when Vesuvius' erupted)   Then my question is, with regards to the (seemingly unusually) recent date quoted in the above article:  Why did the discovery of volcanic activity at sub-oceanic plate boundaries take so long? "
1805,Is there a quick way to roughly estimate how quickly a flood will move downstream?,"At the time of this post, there was urgent danger of spillway failure at the Oroville Dam in California, with evacuations in place for hundreds of thousands, and even larger populations further downstream in the Sacramento metro area.  There's 300 large dams in the world.  So it would seem quite useful to have a method to quickly estimate how quickly a large flood might move downstream.    Obviously detailed hydrological models are the only way to properly incorporate the varied topography and other unique factors in each situation.  But it would seem useful for a lot of folks, whether tens of miles downsource of a mountain stream (such as might've been vital as the Big Thompson flood started), dozens of miles down a valley from a dammed waterway (like those further down the Feather/Sacramento Rivers tonight), or hundreds of miles down a flooding major river (such as the 1993 Mississippi Flood), especially given the varying warning networks in place around the world, to have a rough scale of how quickly an unexpected flood might translate downstream their way.  Is it a matter of hours, days, weeks?  A rough worst-case scenario of how quickly they may have to react is what is desired.  Would seem a reasonable formula for a loose estimate might reasonably include the volume of water flowing, the expected channel size, and the elevation change (or alternatively, just the speed of the water... but if you knew that, you really don't need any special formula!).  Does such a formula like this exist? Or are there good empirical estimates for those different situations I presented? Or is each case just so unique that there's no hope of such an estimate? "
1806,How to interpret the values of moisture flux convergence?,I have a time series of moisture flux convergence. The values show positive and negative.

Whether positive values shows week precipitation and negative values shows strong precipitation? 
1807,"What is the geologic origin of Cryolite, and could there be more?","Cryolite is a mineral of aluminum (Na[tex]AlF[tex]). The only known natural deposit was found in Ivittuut, Greenland. It was mined from 1854 to 1987 and yielded 3.7 Mt of Cryolite ore.  Basically my question is, why is this the only cryolite deposit known? What is the origin of it and why didn't any more form?  There are a lot of similar islands in the arctic: Canadian islands, Russian islands, Scandinavia and Svalbard, etc. Do geologists believe other Cryolite deposits are out there, just not discovered yet?

1808,Topographical model of a wind-farm,"Has anyone ever built and tested a topographical model of a 200 mile radius with a wind-farm in the middle to see how much wind speeds and wind direction change when the farm is active compared to before it was built? Obviously it takes power to turn the turbines in a wind generator, and that will slow the wind speed, but by how much? How much per turbine? Will it change the direction of the wind as compared to where the wind flowed BEFORE the farm was built? Sounds like a good and SCIENTIFIC question on the ""changing environment"" to me... "
1809,"What is the geologic origin of the Bauxite deposit in Bauxite, Arkansas, and could there be more?","Bauxite is an mineral of Aluminum. Despite a general mineral wealth, the USA does not have any major Bauxite deposits, except for one in Arkansas. The mining town was named Bauxite, Arkansas.  The mine operated from 1895 to 1981. It produced about 80 million metric tons of bauxite ore over its lifetime (just guestimating from this pdf, page 6).  So what is the origin of this deposit? It seems strange to me, not being near any mountains. How did the minerals form? And why aren't there any others despite very similar terrain all over Arkansas and other states? "
1810,Why do meteorologists use DM and equal height surfaces for some maps?,"In discussions from the National Weather Service, storm systems are often quantified in terms of DM, such as in this forecast discussion from Los Angeles/Oxnard on February 15, 2017:     A strong and large 487 DM low was located across the Gulf of Alaska.   When the NWS uses ""dm"" is that short for ""dam"" as in decameters, or something else? And if so, why do they sometimes give these heights rather than the millibars? "
1811,Is Zealandia really big enough to be called a continent?,"I was reading this article about Zealandia and got excited that there could be an underwater continent.  However, when viewing the image (below) it appears that Zealandia is much smaller than any other continent.   The article says the bases considered were:   elevation above the surrounding area  distinctive geology  a well-defined area  a crust thicker than the regular ocean floor   Is there some criteria on size that should be met to be classified as a continent? If so, does Zealandia meet that criteria?  Or,  is it possible that Zealandia is a continental fragment?   "
1812,Is plate tectonics a hoax theory? How can tightly packed plates move?,"Here are two questions I had ever since I first heard about plate-tectonics.   How can the plates move? Before you suggest me some page to read about plate movement mechanics, let me clarify that I am not asking about the mechanics behind plate movement here. But I am talking about the physical possibility of plate movement.   When we look at the map of plates, all of them are tightly packed, with not an inch of space or gap to move. The complex shape of surrounding plates, blocks all freedom of movement. Then how can the theory say that plates can move?  If you can't follow my explanation, consider a jigsaw puzzle in which the blocks are correctly set up. Can we move a block from the middle now? We can not because the blocks are tightly interlocked, and because of their complex shape. The same is the situation here too, in fact much more complex! Each plates is tightly surrounded by complex shaped other plates, making any movement in any direction impossible!  See the below given a map of tectonic plates for example. It is evident the plates are actually interlocked so tightly that, it is impossible to move in any direction, because of the presence of another plate in opposite direction. There is no freedom of movement available, in any direction! The complex shape of plates make movements impossible!       My second question is this: It is said that, all continents were a single large continent millions of years ago. And then much later, continents 'drifted away', reaching current shape and locations.   If tectonic plates does not even have hundreds of miles of gaps between them to move, how can continents drift away so far, even thousands of miles away?  Certainly plates can't move this far, because the whole earth surface is divided into plates, with no space left for plates to move thousands of miles.  So how did the continents drift away this far? Or do we have to assume that continents are simply floating over the tectonic plates?  Is the plate tectonics theory a complete hoax? "
1813,"Rock ID: brittle black/white w/ crystals & mica-like cleavage layers, Raleigh, NC, USA","  Where it was Found: I found the rock laying on the sidewalk near some landscaping at my apartment complex in Raleigh, NC.  Size: The largest intact portion of the rock is about 2.2 cm in diameter.  Description:  It's a somewhat heterogeneous black/grey/white rock with clear/white crystalline structures and blacker mica-like cleavage layers. The rock is very brittle (you can see ""crumbs"" in the photos generated from simply setting the rock down and rotating it to take photos). However, given the brittleness, I'd say it's actually more dense/heavy than I would expect based on its size.    The next photo shows ""crumbs"" demonstrating the two major rock-types. This photo suggests that what I had initially described as mica-like flakes, might in fact be thicker structures, but it's hard to tell.     Here are some additional photos. (note that any yellow color in the pictures is from a nearby light, and the rock itself has no yellow hues):          I apologize that I don't have better pictures as my hand lens is damaged and I do not have a good camera or scope to use currently.  This and this are the closest I can find to resembling my rock, but I don't think either is right. But based on these photos, my best guess is some kind of mica, pyrite, or scheelite mixed with quarts?? I'm an ecologist, so I have a limited knowledge of geology at this scale.  "
1814,How to characterize flow of nonreactive tracer in a porous media?,"About Tracer Experiment  This experiment is conducted by injecting a fluid with nonreactive species of certain concentration inside a column or core composed of sand. The injection of fluid can either be in the form of a pulse or it can be continuous injection. This type of experiment can be useful to characterize the static and dynamic properties of a subsurface and can help us gain a better understanding of the geology and flow dynamics of the fluid.   Known Information  In this type of experiment we typically know the velocity of the tracer through the column, say [tex], the length of the column [tex], the injected concentration of the tracer [tex], a time series of the fluid concentration at the column outlet [tex] [tex] [tex], which acts as an output data from this experiment.   Questions   Which equations are typically used to characterize the flow of nonreactive tracer in a porous media at laboratory scale?   How can we use the known information to estimate the fluid dispersion coefficient (a measure of fluid velocity variance)?  "
1815,Why doesn't it snow even when it is below freezing?,"I know the temperature of a place is determined by various factors, a few of which I can think of are: Altitude, distance from sea, latitude, wind etc.   My question is basically regarding latitude. If a place is closer to the poles, the temperature would be very low. So if the temperature is low there is a chance that it snows (I do not know what other factors lead to snowfall). But even when the temperature is below 0 in places near poles (Finland) it doesn't snow. But it snows in Germany.   So why there isn't any snow in Finland but in Germany? Does a negative temperature indicate chances of snow? "
1816,How did the intensity of Earth's magnetic field change through geological time?,"Looking at the wikipedia article on the Earth's magnetic field, I see that its strength varies through time.

My current attempt  All I found so far is this graph from wikipedia (which is on a too short time scale) and this kind of text (not a science paper) reporting an estimate for a given time point (3.2 billions years ago) reporting a field of about 25 microTeslas.

Update: So I once again visited my friends summer cottage and I remembered that I was advised to take a sample from the stone I found. I hammered too little pieces off the rock. It's completely dark from the outside but from the inside it's like a normal stone. I also rubbed it on to unglazed porcelain and it left a dark black streak like a piece of coal. So if you have any ideas what kind of stone this might be, give me your opinions?  Here are some pictures:  The big black one is the stone.   This is how the surface looks.

The actual component to the RF that shows the Sp conversion (the one always published in the literature), which would represent as a negative phase around the LAB and a big positive one over the Moho, would have to be the P component...right? I have three components to these RFs, but they were never labeled, two of them have the zero lag arrival at the same exact time while the third has its zero lag arrival occur about 3 seconds before the other two. Remember this is an Sp RF!   As an S wave in an non-isotropic (i.e. Earth) media would have some level of energy in two components, SV and SH (albeit the SH is always a lower SNR given the Earth is not actually isotropic), it completely makes sense that the two components in the receiver function that happen to have the zero lag direct arrival of the wave at the EXACT same time would have to be the SV and SH components.   Given that one of these two has a much lower SNR I could also argue which one is SV and which one is SH. Furthermore, since the only remaining component has its direct arrival occur BEFORE the other two I should naturally conclude this to be the P component! ....but this is where it gets complicated....this supposed P component does not have a clear positive spike where the Moho should be and a clear negative spike where the LAB should be.....the supposed SV component does....

For a towed streamer, the inline fold is the same as for a 2D geometry which can be expressed as:  [tex].  For the crossline fold he states that:  ""The midpoint range in the crossline direction of one boat pass equals the number of streamers times the streamer interval divided by two ... normally, the next boat pass is shifted in the crossline direction with this distance, ensuring adjacent midpoint ranges of neighboring boat passes, i.e., no overlap in midpoint coverage between boat passes; hence, crossline fold [tex]. Therefore, in marine streamer acquisition, usually [tex] ""  I feel that I understand why the inline fold is the same for the case of a 2D acquisition geometry, but I am having difficulty understanding the concept of the crossline fold.

Is it slow enough that it would be past time when the sun's temperature rises as it starts its journey into the red giant phase and heat up earth at which point it doesn't matter if earth has its magnetic field or not, or is it fast enough to happen within the next few hundred million years?

1827,"Why more matters appear in hot equator, when they should flow to the cold poles?","I am reading a paper* about the application of the maximum entropy production (MEP) in Earth science (I'm new to MEP btw). The authors start with the system of gas molecules first. When the system is isolated, it has the maximum entropy and the molecules are distributed randomly. When it get contacted with the hot reservoir, nearby molecules will have higher energy, therefore moving faster and will tend to move to the other side, while colder molecules are not really active, so they will stay in their positions. As a consequence. the molecules will shift to the cold side.    When we replace the hot reservoir with the equator, and the cold reservoir with the pole, we will have the model of planetary system.    However, doesn't that mean that more matter will locate in the pole(s) than the equator? In Earth, this would mean that there will be more structured or ordered matters, including organisms in the poles than the equator. This doesn't look right to what we know.

1828,What is the finest horizontal grid spacing that Eulerian grid-cell air-dispersion models should use?,"My colleagues run the Advanced Research Weather Research &amp; Forecasting (WRF) model in predictive mode, and then test the skill of the model anywhere from 12 - 84 hours out from the initialization time.  The accuracy of the wind and the temperature profile are considered to be the most important indicators of the model's skill.  An Eulerian grid model is then be used to represent air pollutant dispersion.  There have historically been discussions of problems with the model in places where there is complex terrain, and whether a finer-scale horizontal grid spacing would solve the issues (e.g. unable to capture local effects in the wind field or PBL). However, now there are models that are configured with the lowest recommended grid-spacing (1/3 km) and many more complex local weather patterns are being accurately modeled. I've been told that the models don't do well with grid-spacings any finer than 1/3 km. In fact, some people have said that the 4/3 km spacing can perform just as well, and that we've reached a point where Eulerian grid models don't gain much more by going to finer grids.    I know that for modeling pollutant dispersion at fine horizontal scales, Lagrangian methods have historically been used instead of Eulerian grid-cell methodology. However, with recent developments in computing, gridded modeling domains have been able to use much finer grid-spacings.  What is the finest grid spacing that Eulerian dispersion grid-cell models should realistically use? Why? "

1831,The Dust Bowl: how's the recovery of all that topsoil going?,"I must admit this is very confusing: one gets different types of information from different sources that often contradict one another.  It is said that the main event occurred due to some misguided farming practices; that those practices allowed strong winds to pick up all the topsoil in the area, carry it east, and deposit it into the Atlantic, more or less in toto. This may not be altogether accurate, but that's the impression one gets from reading essays, articles, and the Wikipedia entry pertaining to the Dust Bowl.  That said, various sources maintain that it takes 500 years or more to form 1 inch of topsoil.  Others suggest coyly that the process can be expedited artificially by burying lots of organic garbage and introducing earthworms to it: a few years of this, and voila - we've got topsoil! (Few of them say how many years, exactly, and where's one supposed to get all those earthworms?)  Still other sources say that because of soil erosion and other intriguing factors we may be running out of arable land. And not just in Kansas either, but all over the globe.  With all of the above in mind, my question is: have the areas affected by the Dust Bowl recovered partially, completely, or not at all? How much of that land can be classified as arable once again? "

1833,How to quickly or easily prove the world is spherical?,"A relative of mine has recently introduced me to the modern flat earth theory, which she believes in. Setting aside for the moment that it is ridiculous, and that sending up some balloons with cameras on would provide evidence to the contrary, how could one evidence that it is in fact spherical from ground based observation?   I immediately thought about citing the observations of Aristotle and measurements of Eratosthenes, something that one can do themselves, but of course they have an answer for that regarding curving light to explain variation of the sun's elevation with latitude. Also refraction backed up by observations of ships on the horizon appearing to be above the horizon (due to refraction) and so light-based observations of a curved body of water are out. To make it even harder, the belief has been adjusted to allow for a flat earth that curves slightly but is not spherical, so objects gradually disappearing over the horizon aren't proof and neither is observing the curvature from a plane! For every argument there is a counter argument, and I, as a layman, don't know how to prove e.g. that the light isn't curving as described.  Without getting into countering non-scientific flaws such as the massive amount of government-level collusion that would be needed to maintain this conspiracy, how might one go about demonstrating it or designing a practical experiment for which the conclusion cannot be refuted. Is this even possible when someone can claim e.g. light curving through the atmosphere in a particular way, without having to back it up? I'm not familiar enough with scientific theory to know how one establishes certainty, or if it is based on a balance of probability (i.e. more proof of one theory than of the contrary).  Note: This is a thought exercise only, I do not expect to actually convince my relative while she is going through a personal crisis for which this is one of many symptoms, that is a separate issue. She holds a degree in aeronautical engineering so it isn't caused by a lack of intelligence.  "
1834,Why does gold and other metals conglomerate,"When gold, or some other metals, such as copper, are found, they are often found in large nuggets. But, from what I understand, gold is produced in quite stochastic stellar processes. As such, shouldn't the distribution of gold and other elements be rather uniform, or at least conglomerated according to the stellar process by which they were created? Why do we see large gold nuggets? Shouldn't we find gold mixed uniformly with all the other elements created along side it in its stellar process? "
1835,Why is Earth's Core Iron?,"The two major constituents of the Earth's core are iron and nickel.  In documentaries and scientific conversations, iron gets more attention than nickel, probably because it makes up a bigger percentage of the core.  But before I consider this scenario—where it was nickel that makes up the bigger percentage instead of iron—I must ask:  Why does iron make up the majority of Earth's core as opposed to nickel?  Does either metal have an advantage over the other?  If so, which advantage?  If nickel is the number-one metal of the core instead of iron, how would the magnetic field be affected? "
1836,How different is the proportion of heavy water ($\ce{^2H2O}$) in the different oceans?,"The average proportion of naturally occurring semi-heavy water or deuterated water, [tex] or [tex], is about 1 molecule in 3200. The proportion comes from the fact that one hydrogen in 6400 is in the form of deuterium. The heavy water, [tex], proportion is about 1 molecule in 41 million ([tex]) as part of a dynamic equilibrium between normal water, semi-heavy and heavy water (water containing 50% H and 50% D, is in fact a balance between 25% of [tex] and [tex] and the rest is [tex]).  I understand that the Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW) has a set proportion equal to the average proportion, but heavy water abundance changes slightly from one kind of water to another.  My question is how much does it change? What oceans have a higher proportion of heavy water? As a hydrogen bond with deuterium is stronger than a normal one, would we expect any biological effects from the different abundances? "
1837,Local Weather Forecast (Self-Learning Algorithm),"First of all, the question! :  Is it possible to predict local weather tendencies for the upcoming hours (let's say 2-3 hours) using only local data? If yes, which data is needed to make such predictions and which predictions are possible?  I'm not talking about very precise predictions, just basic stuff like: ""The temperature will rise/drop"" or ""If humidity goes up and air pressure drops, it will probably rain"" etc.. you get the idea.  I was thinking of using data for temperature, air pressure, humidity, time of day and wind speed/direction.. maybe something else?  Some Background :  for a little DIY Home-Project I decided it would be an interesting idea to set up a little ""weather station"" in front of my home and collect all sorts of weather related data in short intervalls (e.g. temperature, air pressure, humidity, wind speed/direction, time of day etc.)  The idea is to collect data over the period of a few months (or more) and to develop an algorithm that is able to predict the upcoming weather with a certain probability. The result should be a little program that was trained on past data and is then able to predict weather tendencies (Temperature, rain, etc..) using the data of the last couple of hours. Let's say the temperature and the air pressure drop and the humidty rises over a certain period of time, then it should tell me that it will likely rain.   I will not bother you with the details on how to write such a self-learning algorithm, but since I'm not very well educated regarding meteorology I'm not even sure if such predictions are possible or to what extent.  I think you've understood the idea. Please give me your Ideas about it. What's possible what's not. Maybe experiences, which data I need, what predictions i could possibly make and which not and so on.  Thanks for any help!   "
1838,How did these grassy hillsides in Colombia become terraced?,"In Colombia, many grassy hillsides are terraced, like in the photo below. This terracing also occurs on hillsides that never had these palm trees on them. I assume that it also occurs outside of Colombia. How does this terracing happen?  Just from my first-hand observations, I think the answer is: The terracing was formed by grazing livestock. Grazing livestock is common in these areas, and the barbed wire fence hints that it is occurring here. On flat ground, the livestock wander in random directions. On steep ground, the livestock prefer to follow the hill's contour lines, as that is the easiest path to walk, as opposed to more directly uphill or downhill. When a livestock initiates a contour path on a not-yet-terraced hillside, that path is repeatedly trod by subsequent livestock, as it is a little flatter and easier to walk than other contour paths, eventually leading to significant terracing. The terracing is uneven (not level) because the livestock have to go up or down a bit to graze elsewhere on the hill.  Can anybody confirm my answer, or provide another answer that is objectively correct, preferably with citations? I asked the same question in the form of an SE puzzle, which is currently on hold because ""This question may invite speculative answers, as the question is not fully defined. The validity of some answers may be based upon opinion. Good questions for this site [puzzling.stackexchange.com] have a limited number of objectively correct answers.""

1839,Sustained WS discrepancy for Hugo 1989 in Charleston,"I am reviewing Sustained Wind Speed data for several locations associated with Hurricane Hugo in September 1989.  HURDAT2 data shows the Max Sustained Wind Speed at Landfall to be 120 knots at Isle of Palms, SC on 9/22/89 at 0400. But the Max Sustained Wind Speed for Charleston Airport is 52 knots at 0100 on the same date. The Max Sust at 0400 is recorded as 32 knots.  Charleston Airport is 17 statute miles from Isle of Palms as I measure it in ArcGIS Pro just now.  Can anyone explain the source of this discrepancy? Is it possible their anemometer(s) were in error at high speeds? Is it possible the maximum speed really dropped off that much over this short distance? "
1840,Night sky visibility prediction,"Given a location (e.g. Osoyoos, British Columbia) and human eyes only, what's the ranges for the nights of the year most likely to give clear astronomical viewing?  What historical data sources might be mined for a clue? Satellite vs surface? Would the past few years/decades reliably help to predict the future year?  Constrained to the new moon cycle, how might the clearest months be determined? "
1841,Loop in the continental divide,"Various maps of the Continental Divide (the hydrological  feature, not the trail) contain a loop that looks like this:    What is the hydrologic meaning of the loop in Wyoming?   Even if it's a basin, it must have at least a theoretical outlet from which a high enough water level would flow.   Or does the definition of the divide treat this as having no outlet, and hence in neither the Atlantic or Pacific watersheds? "
1842,How does extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere contribute to radiative forcing?,"The CO2 absorption spectrum taken at 200 mmHg partial pressure, beam path length = 10 cm, resolution = 4 cm^-1 shows that light can only travel a couple hundred meters before being completely absorbed by atmospheric CO2 at its absorption peaks. How does extra CO2 increase absorption?    Answers here discussed several mechanisms of spectral broadening and minor absorption bands. But the major absorption bands seem to be wider beyond what a few nanometers of broadening could affect. Would these effects have a non-negligible contribution to carbon dioxide radiative forcing?  As seen in the outgoing spectral radiance taken at the top of the atmosphere, the CO2 absorption peak is only half as high as the blackbody spectrum at the same wavelength. This is contradictory to the argument that the atmosphere is completely opaque in CO2 absorption bands. Does that mean that the thermal emission of CO2 accounts for most of the outgoing radiance at 15 µm? Is there a quick way to see that, and what implications does it have on the radiative forcing of CO2?   "
1843,How Could Sheep Graze these Steep Hillsides Without Leaving any Marks?,"Here are two images of English hill figures (The Cerne Abbas giant and the Uffington white horse):    These hillsides, which are obviously grazed by sheep, show tracks that form numerous contour lines around the said hillsides. According to many people, however (e.g., Wikipedia), these contour lines are not generated by domestic livestock.  If that is the case, what causes these lines and why do they only appear on hills that are grazed by livestock? If, on the other hand, no livestock grazes these pastures, what keeps the grass so short and why are English farmers wasting such huge amounts of good grazing land? Are they mad? Some people, such as this answer, say the lines are caused by natural earth movements, but won't explain why they only occur on hills that are grazed by livestock. There are many more examples, and better ones, of chalk hill contour lines available on Wikipedia, but my simple explanation of how to find them has been deleted. The Long Man of Wilmington is a much better example than the two photos above, it shows the sheep as well as contour lines and is available on Wikipedia. "
1844,How are hillsides farmed?,"I would assume hilly land is more labor-intensive to farm than flat land, and more exhausting to humans and animals if traditional farming techniques are used.   How do farmers plant and plow on uneven terrain? And do the furrows on a hill run uphill-downhill, or “horizontally stacked” up the hill’s incline?   Edit: I see why sloped land is more conducive to other kinds of agriculture. Any idea how steep a grade has to be before farming grain on it is more trouble than it’s worth? "
1845,Why is reverse osmosis desalination the dominant method used and not heat-based methods? Also why is brine being dumped back into the ocean?,"So I was recently watching this video regarding desalination efforts around the world and the viability of desalination as a means to provide humans with freshwater. I had a few questions:  1 - They mention that the brine that is released as a byproduct of the process is potentially harmful to marine life, so why not just dump it in the desert? Why do we need to release back in the ocean? I'm sure the effects of this won't be that big given that desalination is a tiny percentage of the world's water production. And if anything, given that global sea levels are rising, this might help things, right?  2 - The video states that the vast majority of desalination plants these days use reverse osmosis desalination and not heat-based methods. Why is that so? How is a process that requires energy better than using solar energy to evaporate the water?   Heat-based methods require energy from the sun, yes. But the way I imagine things, we can passively let in water from the ocean, put it under some glass panel that magnifies sun energy, and then let the water evaporate out through some piping to condense somewhere else. How is powering a pump through a membrane (that requires cleaning after) better?    A lot of these thoughts are just me thinking out loud with no data to back me up because honestly, I wouldn't know what to look up regarding things like this. I'd love some science-based replies to this! I'm definitely missing something big. "
1846,Could an earthquake on flat land still kill someone without any buildings/boulders or such near by?,"Suppose you were sitting near the epicenter of an earthquake, sitting down on flat land without much else near by, maybe some grass. Is it still possible that say, a magnitude 8 or 9 earthquake would be lethal, assuming you can spread out enough to avoid tipping over and hitting your head?  It seems like the biggest damage in earthquakes comes from buildings, not the ground splitting apart, but it is also possible the terrain itself could warp like an ocean wave several meters I guess. And if a fissure was opening up near someone from the quake's epicenter, would they have time to react and avoid being dropped into it?  "
1847,Has the Average Volume of Volcanic Emissions Been Constant Since the Last Major Fluctuation?,"Are total volcanic emissions worldwide constant, or do they rise and fall? We know there are large fluctuations on a scale of tens of millions of years, but is the total volume of emissions stable on a scale of tens of thousands, the last ten thousand in particular? The last major increase that I know of was shortly before the extinction of the dinosaurs and according to some geologists was the cause of the extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous, but I suspect there have been further significant episodes of volcanism since then. "
1848,Can I see curvature of the Earth on a picture,"I've been piloting a drone yesterday and made a video hovering at around 100m, the visibility was very good. I've shown the video to a friend of mine and we were arguing whether it's the curvature of the Earth visible at horizon, or is it just camera lens disturbing the image.  I'm rather sure it's curvature of the Earth, but still don't know how to prove it. I already checked that on the lower part of the picture the buildings-roofs are lined up straight, no disturbance. Yet the horizon is slightly bent (checked by putting a piece of paper on the screen). Which I think already proves the point: should lens disturb the picture, the disturbance would be visible both on the upper and lower part of the picture symmetricly.  I've read How high must one be for the curvature of the earth to be visible to the eye?, but it doesn't help me just yet. As far as I understand, the above link help calculating the distance to the horizon depending on the altitude. But why is the horizon bent?  I would appreciate anyone helping me straighten my thinking :).  The picture:  "

(and yes, I've tried to ask manufacturers but to no avail).  "
1855,Can crystal lattices be analogue?,"This question might turn out to be more about physics then geology so apologies in advance if that is the case.  Years ago I read something that said in crystals ""atoms have finite positions along the crystal lattice.""  What I took that to mean was that in any crystal structure, atoms have a finite number of possible positions. Which is what I want to find out here.  After searching images for crystalline structures I found that all of them represent atoms as tiny balls that line up perfectly in a regular pattern.    What I take all this to mean is that, in a crystal structure, atoms can only exist in very specific places in accordance with their patterns like a cube made out of Lego bricks. They can only exist in, for want of a better word, a digital fashion. They always form straight edges and if another atom is added, it's like another Lego brick has been added to the cube, it can only be fitted in exactly according to its grid like structure. The atom can only be in column one row six or column three row four and so on. Like pixels on the screen.    My understanding is that, in a crystal lattice, atoms cannot take positions in an analogue way, they cannot be positioned in a lattice a few micro metres one way or the other.   What I conclude from this reasoning is that there is only a finite number of shapes that any crystalline material can take because of the digital nature of the positioning of the atoms, as opposed to the analogue way you can sculpt plasticine.  Is this so?  If we could shrink down to the atomic level and look at a crystalline solid with the entire structure look like a Lego sculpture or a pixelated image? Or do the atomic patterns allow for some degree of analogue placement?  I have read there is such a thing as screw dislocations.    Does this say that although crystal atoms do generally have a pattern, that pattern is not rigid and inflexible?  When you pour liquid glass into a spherical mould and let it cool or sculpt something out of clay and fire it, do the crystal lattices that form bend to accommodate these curved edges? Or is the solid still cubic in pattern and it just seems to be analogue because it's too small to be seen? Do screw defects only occur when someone or something is applied pressure to the crystal or do they naturally form with curved lattices?  And yes I'm aware crystal grains have non-latticed atoms between them and sometimes there is a missing atom in the lattice. But that's not what I'm talking about here.  To put it as simply as I can, to crystals onlay ever exist as lego scuptures or can the grow like trees with curved bows?  Edit: when I say crystals I mean crystals like what we call in every day life like pyrite and quartz, materials like stone and ceramics.  Thank you for your attention. "
1856,Newton's & Kepler's age of the earth calculations - References?,"""Everybody knows"" that Newton and Kepler calculated the age of the earth. My problem is that, whilst ""everybody knows"" this, no-one gives a reference that I can read for myself.   If, for example, I want to read what Thomas Burnett believed, I download a copy of Telluris Theoria Sacra and I can read for myself that he accepted the reality of Noah's flood. The same is true of St Augustine's beliefs as there are several online translations of City of God Against the Pagans.  But Newton and Kepler?   Zilch. Sweet F.A. Absolutely nothing.   Even when a website  references a text, either I can't find the text, or there is no age-of-the-earth calculation in the text that I can find.  So, did either Newton or Kepler calculate the age of the earth, or is this just an urban myth? If it's true, does anyone have references that I can look at for myself. These will have to be secondary references (English translations) as I expect the actual primary reference to be in Latin, and sadly, I only read English. "
1857,Do dams reduce the flow of river downstream?,"There is a conflict between Egypt and Ethiopia, because the latter wants to build a dam on the Nile river. Citing this article:     [Egypt] fears the Nile dam will reduce its share of the river and leave the   country with dwindling options as it seeks to protect its main source   of fresh water.   What do they mean by ""reduce its share of the river""? As far as I understand, the dam will create a reservoir, which will initially divert some water to be filled, but once that is done, the flow of the river should be the same. Is Egypt worried about this initial reduction, or do dams somehow reduce the flow of a river?  If so, what is the mechanism? I would guess that this is due to increased evaporation from the river, since the reservoir has a bigger surface than the usual river, but then again, it also collects more rain. "
1858,"To stop anthropogenic climate change, is it necessary to stop extracting petroleum and start pumping carbon under ground?","The amount of carbon (C) on Earth is constants.  As far as i understand, all carbon that is not found in the atmosphere or the oceans in the form of CO2 or CO is stored either in the biomass (plants, animals, including humans, bacteria, mushrooms, etc.), or in fossils and fossil fuels (coal, petroleum, natural gases), or in non-organic form as graphite and diamonds.  Is this correct?  Does it follow that the only way to stop anthropogenic climate change and decrease the amount on CO2 in the atmosphere is to stop extracting fossil fuels and to start converting CO2 from the atmosphere into graphite or diamonds or into some form of petroleum and pump it back under ground?  I have asked a related question about carbon distribution on Earth. "
1859,"How is carbon distributed among the atmosphere, the oceans, the biomass and the unburnt fossil fuels?","In relation to my other question about carbon cycle and climate change, i would like to know some estimates of the carbon distribution among the atmosphere, the oceans, the biomass and the unburnt fossil fuels.  Here are more specific parts of this question.   How much carbon is there on Earth? How much carbon is there in the atmosphere (in the form of CO2 and other gases)? How much carbon is there in the oceans in the form of CO2 and gases? How much carbon is there currently in the biomass? How much carbon is there left in the form of fossil fuels?   If possible, i would also like to know how this distribution has changed, for example, over the last 100 years (in particular, how much carbon from the fossil fuels has been burnt over the last 100 years).

1860,Are there any metal anomalies other than iridium in the K-Pg boundary?,"The iridium anomaly marks the elevated concentration of iridium in sedimentary deposits of the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. The iridium is said to come from the impactor, which is supposed to have much higher iridium contents than Earth's crust.  What about other metals? Is there an observed increase of other elements as well? For example, osmium is another extremely rare element in the crust. Is there an osmium anomaly as well? If not, why is the anomaly restricted to iridium and not the other metals? "
1861,Why does Coriolis determine the rotation direction of a cyclone but not my drain?,"It is a common misconception that Coriolis is responsible for the direction the water swirls down a toilet, tub or sink drain.  E.g. does a toilet flush the other way in the southern hemisphere? (If it does, it is due to the construction of the basin, not Coriolis).  This misconception has been debunked many times and leads to a new issue I ran into recently.  I was talking to someone about low pressure systems (cyclones, e.g. mid-latitude storms and tropical cyclones) spinning in the opposite sense in the the north and south hemispheres and they questioned this fact because ""Coriolis does not determine how something spins, Mythbusters showed that with a toilet"". This demonstrates a lack of understanding in how Coriolis works and leads to this question:  Why does Coriolis determine the sense of rotation of a cyclone but not my drain?  How can it work on one phenomenon but not the other? "
1862,Monsoonal interactions with mid latitude disturbances,"For the past few years in succession India has witnessed extreme flooding events caused by monsoonal troughs colloding with what appears transitory mid latitude disturbances and these appear to trigger flash floods. Case in point - [website]Following are my questions: 1) The northward propagating waves emanating at the 850 hPa level from the MJO(BSISO) appear to be damped at the Himalayan foothills(30 N latitude). Following orographic interactions I presume the 850 hpA 's geopotential height appears to be raised. Is that an accurate statement i.e. in the mountains the 850 hPa monsoonal trough's geopotential height is higher(much higher) than at sea levels?  2) Then the planetary wave at the 500 hPa level then appears to be dipping down in the tropics and interacting with monsoonal troughs. How does a upper level trough ""propagate"" down ? Is this due to quasi geostropic theory? "
1863,Farthest point from the center of the Earth,"At first glance, this seems like such a simple question of ""What's the highest point on Earth"".  However, I also know that the Earth isn't perfectly round.  So that ""highest point"" may be in a relative valley.  Also, because it's non-spherical, the ""center"" may not be easily obvious either.  So, I'm curious if there are different answers based on different definitions of ""center"" (such as geographic center versus center of mass).  So, what is the point on the Earth's surface farthest from the center of the Earth?  Is this different based on different definitions of ""center""? "
1864,Determine Latitude and Longitude without a GPS,"Is it possible to measure the strength of a rare earth magnet to determine latitude and longitude of a current position? For instance say you start with your known latitude and longitude and then use a compass, accelerometer or other sensor besides a GPS to get your coordinates. What sensors would make the most sense? What equations would you use to keep track of your location based upon a fixed point in space?  "
1865,What is the methodology to analyze future climatic extremes using the results of climate models?,"What is the accepted methodology to predict future climatic extremes using the results of climate models?  I have recently read a report about climatic extremes considering climate change (MICE, 2002). The report says that researchers fitted extreme value distributions (generalized extreme value, generalized Pareto) to the intensity of predicted, future climatic actions, e.g. rain, snow, wind. Applying these models, events with a large return period are used to assess the impact of climate change. Additionally, there is a recent Nature article by O’Gorman which also deals with future extreme events, particularly snow.  Considering that the predictions (projections per scenarios) can be made only in probabilistic terms. I would like to know how these predictions are made, what methodology are they using? I mean the actual climatic data, not the extreme value (statistical) analysis of them. For extreme value analysis, annual or more frequent maxima can/could be used. It is quite dubious that climate models would predict monthly or annual maxima of rain/snow for a certain region, up to the end of this century (or are climate models so sophisticated?). Someone told me that on this site (Earth System Grid Federation) there is an example of daily predicted snow data (this can be downloaded).  So, my main question is how this data, these predictions, are produced. What are the underlying assumptions of the models? Can these 100-year long simulations be used to predict extreme events within a 100 to 1000 year return period (these are common in engineering practice).  As far as I know, the climate models contain 'accurate' models (where the phenomenon is described by differential equations) and 'approximate' models (where empirical models are used). I guess the actual amount of precipitation for a given region belongs to the latter; in this case how uncertain are these models? (Surely the 'accurate' models have large uncertainty as well, but perhaps less).    I have an engineering background and I am interested in the effect of extreme climatic events on the reliability of structures; especially considering climate change. In order to study this, it would be great to know how reliable are the climate predictions regarding extreme events. If the probability distribution (or more complex probabilistic model of the actions) is given, the reliability of a structure (system) can be directly calculated. However, I am quite suspicious about the extremes predicted by the climate models.  It is quite hard to navigate through the thousand pages reports and find the probably one page long section which would answer my question. I would highly appreciate if someone could explain the main aspects of methodology, basic assumptions or point me to specific references, any help regarding the original question is welcomed.

1867,'Late Veneer' on other planets,"Is there any evidence of external material source events, like the 'Late Veneer' on other planets?   Or is this theory specific just for Earth?

1868,Relation between direction of shear and tropical cyclone formation,In an earlier question/answer Why are there no cyclones in the southern Atlantic basin there was a point raised about direction of              shear(abetting/retarding) cyclone formation. It appears westerly shear hinders the formation of tropical cyclones and easterly shear enhances it. This should mean that cyclone formation is only allowed over monsoonal regions. Is that accurate ? From this article - Tropical wave dynamics and Heatinduced steady response.    it appears that in the presence of westerly shear Rossby waves have large amplitude at the upper troposphere whereas in the presence of easterly shear Rossby waves have large amplitude in the lower troposphere. Given that the precursors of tropical cyclones are equatorial waves can a clarification be provided in this regard ?  
1869,What amount of permafrost carbon release could be expected with the IPCC worse-prediction of a 4.8C temperature rise?,"As answered in my earlier question How much methane clathrates are buried in continental deposits?, there is alot of methane trapped in the form of clathrates in continental deposits.  Additionally, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Centre webpage Methane and Frozen Ground states that the     estimate that there are about 1,400 gigatons of carbon frozen in permafrost.   According to the webpage, this is more than exists in the atmosphere, but it is unlikely to be released at once (due to depth, local conditions etc).  The recent IPCC 5th Assessment Report stated that     Without additional efforts to reduce GHG emissions beyond those in place today, global emissions growth is    expected to persist, driven by growth in global population and economic activities. Global mean surface    temperature increases in 2100 in baseline scenarios – those without additional mitigation – range from 3.7 to    4.8°C above the average for 1850-1900 for a median climate response.   (GHG = Greenhouse gases)  They also state, in regards to permafrost,     It is virtually certain that near-surface permafrost extent at high northern latitudes will be reduced as global    mean surface temperature increases, with the area of permafrost near the surface (upper 3.5 m) projected to    decrease by 37% (RCP2.6) to 81% (RCP8.5)for the multi-model average (medium confidence).   What amount of permafrost carbon release could be expected with the IPCC worse-prediction of a 4.8C temperature rise?  (If any published studies are available, that would be good too).  Note: this carbon source is not explicitly covered in the question and answer for How is carbon distributed among the atmosphere, the oceans, the biomass and the unburnt fossil fuels? "
1870,Why would there be no hydrocarbons in the Sveconorwegian belt?,"I've had an inconclusive chat about the Sveconorwegian belt of the Fennoscandian shield, the western parts in particular, and reasons as to why there would not be any deposits of hydrocarbons there. Perhaps someone here can provide a definite answer?  Is it simply that the belt is of primarily Gothian origin, or might there be more to it? "
1871,What is the status of meteorological data exchange standards?,"How do the web services exchange meteorological data?   One method is transferring NetCDF and GRIB data and hooking them up to your software.  I read here about the possibility of using WFS and WCS. Here, I read about the proposal of using calls like dataQuery, similar to getCapabilities of WMS servers. I also note that NASA uses JSON output, e.g. for the DCP-30 dataset. In Europe, the INSIPRE committee publishes very complex guidelines . DWD, UK Met office and others recently held a conference on that.  Is there a global standard and what is it? I know the OGC-DWG is working on that since 2009. What are the latest updates?  Addendum (Full forms of Abbreviations)   WMS : Web Mapping Service, a Server that responds with a map image of a spacific area, or about its ability to serve.  WCS : Web Coverage Service, similar to above, but serves gridded data, e.g. temperature, covering a continuous area.  WFS : Web Feature Service, similar to WCS, but serves features on an around a given point (or points) - thus discreet, not continuous.  DCP : Downsized Climate Projection, a low resolution dataset projecting the future global climate. 30 indicates 30 years in future and so on.  OGC : Open Geospatial Consortium , a non profit organization standardizing geospatial data. DWG : Domain working Group, a workgroup in OGC specializing in a particular field, one in this case for standardizing meteorological and oceanographic data exchange.  "
1872,Is it possible to create an enclosed manmade weather system?,"There are plenty of experiments, usually geared toward kids, that involve ""making a cloud in a bottle"" or something similar.  These exercises are neat for what they are, but pale in comparison to the beauty of real clouds.  Really you're just making fog in a bottle.  Using currently available (preferably consumer grade) technology, is it possible to create real clouds?  Or even better, a real weather system?  Imagine you have an enclosed 10 ft wide cube.  If you build a landscape inside, complete with mountains and bodies of water, and you have complete control over the boundary conditions of the cube (temperature, airflow in/out, etc.), can you reproduce the beauty of a towering cumulus cloud inside the cube? One step further... can you create thunderstorms?  I have a very rudimentary understanding of how weather works, but the engineer in me says in theory this should be possible.  But in reality a lot of small details glare out at me as possible show stoppers.  Aerodynamics does not scale, because of the constant size of air molecules at all scales.  I suspect this limitation may affect my weather system puzzle as well.  Also with respect to thunderstorms, I suspect the 10 ft wide cube may not be able to mimic the role of planetary grounding, atmosphere, etc., in the creation of electric discharges. "
1873,What is El Niño Modoki?,"What are the characteristics that distinguishes a El Niño Modoki from a ""normal"" El Niño?   What are the effects of El Niño Modoki on atmospheric and oceanic processes? How does it affect weather systems?   What are the mechanisms that determine whether an El Niño event is a normal event or a Modoki event? "
1874,How does one create petroleum/crude oil for future generations?,"I am a geological novice so maybe this is a wrong question. But the idea is to create a thought experiment. How does one ""create"" petroleum or crude oil for future generations? Is it enough to bury a lot of trees underneath the earth at great depths and eventually thousands (maybe hundreds of thousands years) later crude oil is formed?  "
1875,How much of a mountain is below the surface?,Is there some kind of math rule for how much does a mountain extend (depth) below the surface?  I found an article like this [website]
1876,Why is Earth's age given by dating meteorites rather than its own rocks?,"Reading a course on Precambrian, I read that:     Earth Age (around 4.5 billion years) is dated thanks to the meteorites hitting Earth during its formation rather than the inner materials composing the Earth.   Wouldn't it be more accurate by doing it with its inner materials? Why do we use meteorites if they hit the Earth after its formation? "
1877,Is the Principle of Original Horizontality a good indicator?,"Still reading a course on datation over multiple stratums that may have setting up the Earth's crust, I'm meeting for the first time the principle of original horizontality Steno.  Is this theory safe?   Logically, if multiple stratums squeeze, the last one to squeeze will be the youngest. It makes sense to me. But isn't Earth's crust affected by inner perturbations that may disrupt the stratums pile? Is it safe to date stratums this way then? "
1878,At what point does plate tectonics stop?,"As the core and mantle of the earth cools, it will reach a point where new crust cannot be produced.  How can this point be calculated?  If we can, has anyone done such calculations?  Thanks! "
1879,Why air do not suffer density stratification of its gaseous components?,"The different gases that make up the air have different densities. So, naively, one would expect the heavier gasses to pool in the lower atmosphere and the light ones at the top.  I asked myself this question a long time ago and I found the answer to be that the mixing produced by atmospheric circulation was more than enough to keep the whole mix homogeneous, and I was happy with that answer until I considered the case of caves, or chambers within the Earth that have been discovered in underground mines, and that have been isolated for millions of years. But despite of that, there is no reports of miners dying because on the top of the cavity the air was only nitrogen or oxygen at the bottom.  Is the mixing produced by molecular movement due its temperature enough to avoid stratification? Or is there another reason? Would air at very low temperature suffer from density stratification? "
1880,Do Siberia and Canada have a rasputitsa?,"The rasputitsa is a muddy season that happens twice per year in West Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. It happens in mid-October to late November due to rains, and mid-March to late April due to thaws (according to the Russian wiki page with google translate). These conditions make travel by dirt road almost impossible, as made famous during WW2.  What I'd want to know is, does Siberia and Canada also have rasputitsas? If so, what times of the year do they occur? and are they comparable to the West Russian one?  Edit: I should have specified this, but Siberia and Canada are large places. I would guess there's an arctic limit somewhere, to the north of which never gets muddy since it's always too cold. So I guess what I'm asking is, what regions of Siberia and Canada have rasputitsas (if any)? "
1881,Why does the absence of diabatic heating rate and frictional terms make the zonal and vertical velocity identically zero?,"I was reading an article on fluid dynamics of tropical cyclones, where I came across a condition which states that,     For adiabatic friction less flow, equations (1) to (5) have a   solution, v(r, z), for a steady freely spinning vortex in which u and   w are identically zero and v(r, z) is an arbitrary function of r and   z.   Where these 5 equations are basic primitive equations (2 horizontal and 1 vertical equation of motion,conservation of mass and thermodynamic equation) written in cylindrical coordinates.  If I try to consider the horizontal(u component only) and vertical equations of motion when they are in gradient wind and hydrostatic balance, u and w will be conserved i.e du/dt=0 and dw/dt=0. How can one conclude that they are identically zero? For the article, please open the following link  [website]The primitive equations are given in section 2.1 and the lines highlighted above are taken from the first paragraph of section 2.2 "
1882,barotropic component definition,"In this paper the author calculated the barotropic component [tex] of the current [tex] as:      the vertical mean velocity weigthed with the depth differences   If I am not wrong, in a continuous case, this translates to:  [tex]  However, supposing the current to be geostrophic, the following expression can be found for the barotropic component:  [tex]  where [tex] is the gravity acceleration, [tex] the Coriolis parameter and [tex] the SSH anomaly.  Are these two expressions equivalent? If yes, why? If not, which are the differences between the hypothesis at the base of the two expressions? "
1883,What would it be like to live in an ice age?,"If you were born in the most recent ice age, how different would your life be compared to how you live it today? Furthermore, if humans currently lived in an ice age, how would it affect life today? "
1884,Megathrust earthquakes on subduction zones,"I am a beginner in geology and earthquake studies, and learning about subduction zones recently.  Question is: do large earthquakes (sometimes referred to as megathrust quakes) occur on any point in the Subduction zone? For example, the Indo-Australian plate subducts underneath the Burma microplate, and the Sunda plate. So does the megathrust quake occur anywhere along this zone or is it limited to certain areas within the subduction zone?  Another related one is what is the different b/w earth quake and rupture process that happens after an earth quake. Example: in some articles about the 2004 Northern-Sumatra quake, I read that ""the rupture continued northward for nearly 1000 km"". "
1885,How much would a nine inch slice of the Earth's inner core weigh?,"If one took a slice of the Earth's inner core measuring nine inches across how much would that slice weigh? Or, conversely, how much mass would that contain? "
1886,Difference between pyrite oxidation and dissolution,I've seen papers use oxidation and dissolution of pyrite. Are these two processes the same? I was always under the impression that pyrite does not dissolve easily. What is the difference between oxidation and dissolution of pyrite?  
1887,"Relationship between natural disaster and global warming, in the media","Sorry in advance if this is too broad a question. Feel free to let me know if it is off-topic.  I don't know more than the next person around about climate change, but I am really not a climato-skeptic myself. Yet, I feel uneasy about the way the media reports about the relationship between natural disaster and climate change, and I am looking for an unbiased assessment of these reports.  At least in what some would describe as “mainstream” media, my impression is that the following pattern emerges:   When a natural disaster or nasty weather seems ""intuitively"" relatable to global warming (e.g., hurricanes, floods, etc., which a lay person like myself could believe would become more common with global warming), journalists go out of their way to find an expert who will tell them ""yes, this is going to be more likely to happen as the planet warms up"" and then headline things like ""Flooding in Paris Maybe Due To Climate Change"", to only cite the latest ( [website]On the other hand, when a natural disaster or nasty weather seems to ""intuitively"" contradict global warming (e.g., snowstorms, cold-wave, etc., which a lay person like myself has a harder time understanding how the phenomenon would become more common with global warming), journalists go out of their way to find an expert who will tell them ""this really is consistent with global warming and does not debunk the predictions of climate models at all"" and then headline things like ""Why the winter cold snap doesn’t disprove climate change” to only cite the latest (this is the title under which an article once appeared on CBS, before the title seem to have changed to [website]I am not interested in these two examples per se. In particular, I am not claiming these specific reports are biased (or unbiased for that matter, I am simply not qualified to make that call).  Rather, my question is:    On average, is the media doing a fair and balanced job as an educator of under-informed people (like myself) on that topic? Are they providing an even and science-based account of the relationship between natural disaster and global warming, honestly explaining how global warming is a complex phenomenon which may have surprisingly different --- and sometimes maybe “counter-intuitive” for lay people --- impacts here and there (including cooling and increased likelihood of sever weather in some areas)?  Or are they inflating reports “in favor of” action against climate change (e.g., reports that natural disasters will be more frequent with climate change, and that some “counter-intuitive” event do not disprove climate change), while maybe minimizing other reports of situations in which climate change could impact some areas in ways that some would view as “positive”? Following useful comments: if ""averaging"" makes the question too hard to answer, which media does a good job, and which doesn't?  Any empirical work done on that question? Did anyone try to text-mine information websites and assess biases (compared to the best scientific evidence) in the media’s presentation of the relationship between natural disaster and global warming?  "
1888,What regions of the US will have *improved* climate given current predictions of climate change?,"This is really a two part question:  1) Is there a good model for mapping climate conditions in a particular location to pleasantness or livability or something like that?  2) If there is such a model, has anyone applied this livability index to predictions of future climate changes?  An perhaps created a map?  Ideally it would easy to answer questions of the form: would Detroit or San Francisco likely have a more pleasant climate in 2050? "
1889,"What is the relationship between raw seismic data, CMP Stacking, NMO & Machine Learning","I recently joined a geophysics project to assist with some of their machine learning modeling but am trying to gather the domain knowledge required to participate.  Something I don't quite understand is the common-midpoint stack, Normal MoveOut &amp; raw data. I have these seg-y files and I am able to plot them in python. They look fine to me, but I am reading a lot about CMP stacking, weighted CMP stacking and NMO. Are seg-y files considered to be ""raw seismic data"". Is the CMP and NMO process something that happens at the stage I am getting the files? I am confused because these seem to be standard practices yet I am unable to find an implementation for any of this in any programming language. Are there any tools you recommend for preparing seismic data for machine learning modeling?  "
1890,Divergent boundary and trenches between oceanic plates,"Why Divergent boundary create ridges between oceanic plates and rift valley between continental plates? I think that the ridges are formed because of the volcanic eruptions. But like rift valley in case of continental plates, can trench ever form because of the divergent oceanic plates? "
1891,Where do riverbed stones come from?,Have they always been here since the river was formed?  Are some newer than others?   
1892,High tides at Venice,"I read somewhere that the new MOSE system can withstand a maximum rise in water of about 3m. I was wondering if that extreme case will happen on the coast line of Lido di Venezia, there will be a rising of the water with a consequent problem at the many beaches along the litoral. What are they expecting? Venice would be, hopefully, saved while Lido will suffer high level of water on the beaches. And more important: how much above the sea level is the highest point of Lido di Venezia?  Added: if the highest point at Lido is 3m that would be the only dry place in case of a tide of 3m. Or I'm wrong? "
1893,Calculate the number of model grid cells covering a specific country,"What is the best method of calculating the number of model grid cells (e.g. of climate models) covering a specific country? For example, if I wanted to know how many 2 degree grid cells are in the United Kingdom, how would I go about it? At present I use the mapping toolbox in matlab and add a 2 degree grid and calculate manually. Is there a better way of doing this? Any advice is appreciated.   "
1894,Inorganic Limestone and Inorganic Gypsum,"I read that limestone is made from the compaction of marine animals' bones. But, I am unable to find out why limestone could not have been produced from calcium occurring naturally (5th most abundant element in earth's crust) in the Earth Crust and in the mantle?  Is gypsum also produced from marine animal's bones? "
1895,Puzzle using relative dating principles,"This isn't directly looking at a real life ecological example kind of thing, but it requires knowledge of relative dating, so I thought I would come here.  Here is what was told:  -""Worms"" (curved lines) tunnelled through a block of material that used to be rectangular. (C,D,F,J,H)  -faintly-circled letters represent ""cracks"" (discontinuities such as faults, I guess) (A,B,E,G,I)  -D is ""broken"" by B. (hard to tell in picture)  -Although there are ten letters, only 8 of them can be placed for certain. But we have to place the letters in order, say the two letters we cannot place for certain, and show all the possible locations where the other letters may be placed.  Here is what I have so far:  I looked at the cracks first.   E crack goes through A crack.  B crack goes through A crack.  B crack goes through I crack.  B crack goes through G crack.  I crack goes through G crack.  G crack goes through A crack.  Using principle of cross-cutting relationships, order from oldest to newest here is A, G, I, ((E,B) or (B,E))  Then I looked at the worms to the earthquakes.  A --> F goes through A, but J is broken by A.  B --> breaks C, H, F, J, and D  E --> C goes through E, but J, D, F, and H are older.  G --> C goes through G, but D is broken by G  I --> F goes through I, but H is broken by I.  Since B breaks all of the ""worms"" but E only breaks through four of the five ""worms,"" we can place the cracks as, from oldest to youngest  A, G, I, E, B  Then I started to place the ""worms"" between the cracks using principle of cross-cutting relationships. I got in the end (oldest to youngest):  J, A, G, I, F, E, C, B - D and H cannot be placed for certain.  That's all I have for now and it seems a bit off to me, but I can't place where? Am I doing this right? "
1896,Why is the Earth's shadow blue?,"After every sunset, once the sun is gone, I always enjoy seen the belt of venus rising in the other side, followed by the Earth's shadow.  This is a picture I took (you will find better ones online). The Pinkish-purple band on top is the Belt of Venus, and the blue band on the bottom is the Earth's shadow.    This figure from Sky &amp; Telescope explains it well:    While contemplating these beauties, I've had hard time understanding why we see the colors we do. To my eyes, the belt of Venus looks purple, which didn't makes sense to me, as the very short wavelength of purple light should have been scattered long before arriving back there. Then all made sense when I realized that if you mix blue and red light you get purple. So the color comes from the blue mixed with the red light backscattered by the high atmosphere that is still illuminated by the Sun.  However, I can't still figure out why the Earth's shadow looks blue, and I haven't been able to find an answer (here some links about the Earth's shadow but without an explanation of the color: 1, 2, 3).  We know the sky is blue and the sunset red to due the preferential scattering of blue light by the air. But: How can the air in the Earth's shadow scatter blue light if it doesn't get any direct illumination, and any indirect illumination getting back there should be VERY depleted in blue (i.e. mostly red light)?  I thought the fact that the belt of Venus scatters red instead of blue as the rest of the atmosphere, is precisely because back there there is no more blue light left, so the weaker scattering of red light becomes noticeable (please let me know if I'm wrong there).  Or is the air actually emitting blue light in some sort of fluorescence/glowing?   PS: As this is a purely atmospheric phenomena I though it would be better suited here than in the Astronomy SE. "
1897,Does subduction of plates make them stretch and form the oceans?,Ocean plates subduct beneath continental plates. Does this make the oceanic plates stretch and become thinner so that the elevation of the sea flow is lower? Is this why oceans form where they do - when water collects in these low areas? 
1898,How can we calculate the total water mass that falls during a flood?,"I would like to know how to calculate how much water fell on California during, for instance, the mid-February 2017 flood.  I know how to look up the total rainfall at a specific weather station.  And, given a meteorological model output, I could calculate the total water precipitated over some area.  However, I don't know of any standard method (using observations) to calculate total cumulative water fallen over some area.  I've seen multi-station precipitation indexes like the one shown below.  But, I don't know how to use that to calculate total water that has fallen to the ground.  Based on observations, how can we calculate the total cumulative water volume (or mass) that has fallen on a large area during a storm?  And, using that method, can we calculate how much water fell on California during the 2017 February flooding events?  The only thing I can think of is to use the rainfall measurements at every station, interpolate across the area of interest, and then integrate.  Though, that seems like quite an intensive GIS project.  Is there a better,standardized way to make the calculation?   "
1899,"What ""g"" would be needed to keep helium on Earth?","I know that helium is a very light and rare gas on Earth because Earths gravity is not strong enough to keep it. Instead, helium and hydrogen are rising through the atmosphere and escape into outer space.  My question is: How massive would Earth have to be so that it could keep helium in the atmosphere? 2, 5, or 10 times the actual mass? Could we, for example, compare it to Neptune or Saturn? "
1900,Effect of urbanization on weather events,"At what stage is the studies on effect of urbanization on weather events (eg: Rainfall, Temperature, UHI) are now? There has been a number of observational and modelling studies around the world and it has been found (In my understanding) that urbanization cause increase in frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall, higher temperature, heat island, changes in boundary layer etc. in urbanized region, mainly due to land-surface change.  Now, What challenges and possibilities are there in this particular research field? "
1901,How can we estimate the amount of sediment that traveled downstream during the California flood?,"It's amazing how much water traveled down the slopes of California during the first two months of rain/flooding of 2017.  Since the amount of water was far greater than anything in recent history, there were many landslides and widening of rivers.  As part of that process, there was a lot of sediment that traveled downstream.  Is there anyway to estimate how much sediment there was?  If so, how can we calculate it? "
1902,"Is there an instance where the sun sets or rises partly, then return back?","I am reading Longest Sunset from XKCD. At first, I've thought that he mentions these phenomena just for fun, but it turns out to me that it might happens, based on the level of somewhat seriousness that I perceive from his writing. He doesn't talk about that in detail.  For the sunset:       Sunset starts the instant the Sun touches the horizon, and ends when it disappears completely. If the Sun touches the horizon and then lifts back up, the sunset is disqualified.   I'm not sure if the sunset is disqualified is because it happens, but we don't count it, or because he's just making fun. But I can't prove that this cannot happen. The more we head to the poles, the shorter the night is. Ultimately there will be a point that the sun still sets, but not completely, right?  For the sunrise:     For the purposes of our question, this is not a sunset:     The phrase for our purposes strengthen my doubt that he is being serious. The logic is the same above.  But these two illustrations are in the series of other apparently amusing ones, which are the sun as the cell in division, or as the egg in hatching (if you read the book, you will see this effect stronger).  So, is there an instance where the sun sets or rises partly, then return back? "
1903,Can winds also arise due to a statistical probability that more air molecules suddenly gets an equal direction?,"Although air molecules have an average speed of about 1,500 km/h if there is no wind the air would stay still. The reason for that is that the directions of the molecules cancel each other out.   But is there a probability that wind arise because a majority of the molecules get the same direction? Or is this only theoretically possible? "
1904,Direct measurments of vertical ocean mixing?,"What kinds of vertical ocean mixing measuring instruments are available? This answer How to measure ocean vertical velocity? tells about the measurement of vertical velocity by ADCP, but they give very noisy vertical velocities and hence almost unusable (at least in my case in the Bay of Bengal in India). Also I am interested in vertical velocities in the upper ocean with mixed layer depths of 30 to 50 meters and this is where many different things happen (e.g. fish, air bubbles etc.). Has anyone done direct vertical speed measurements in the upper ocean? I am unable to find a good lead. "
1905,Would adding sulfur dioxide to the atmosphere have a global cooling effect?,"There is reasonable evidence to suggest that the Earth is warming. The most probable cause appears to be increased CO2 in the atmosphere, which has been reasoned about for quite some time.   There appear to have been some volcanic eruptions in the 1200s that lead to a mini-ice age. The cause appears to be increased sulfur dioxide (S02) in the atmosphere.   Could we engineer this?  My question is: Would adding sulfur dioxide to the atmosphere have a global cooling effect? "
1906,Is the Earth heated up by the tides?,Reading about moons of other planets they often get heated up by the tides so for example Io and Europe of Jupiter get friction by which eruptions and liquid water can arise. But is there also an effect on Earth due to the tides of the moon and sun? If so how many degrees is the Earth heated up? 
1907,Why does the emission of aircrafts at higher altitudes have a greater effect on the climate?,"I am trying to understand the footprint of a flight.  First Wikipedia says (without quoting a source):      The level and effects of CO2 emissions are currently believed to be broadly the same regardless of altitude.   But then there are numerous references to radiative forcing, which is supposedly almost doubling the effects of the emissions (at this point only co2, or also NOx and others?). These are never explained (it says ""see below"" once, but there follows no explanation below.  The article on radiative forcing says that      Typically, radiative forcing is quantified at the tropopause in units of watts per square meter of the Earth's surface.   However this does not seem to explain why quantifying it ""at the tropopause"" makes sense, or what that means, since the measure given is measured on the surface. Does this imply that emissions below / above the tropopause are not considered contributing to radiative forcing? (I presume they are.)  Also, how come that emissions at greater heights force more? After all, at lower heights the same amount can cover a greater surface area at the same thickness / density. Maybe, the change in wavelength of incoming radiation is greater since the traveled distance is greater, and thus more is absorbed?  Lastly, does CO2 not ascend after being emitted at surface level, such that it will enter the stratosphere just as well as if it is emitted there? Or are there further factors partially mitigating this?  You can see I have too many questions, and find the Wikipedia articles very unrevealing / lacking.  Thank you! "
1908,How much water does a wave transport into a sea cave?,"How much water is transported (volume) as a wave travels into a sea cave?  The wave has a height of 1 m and a period of 12 seconds. The average water depth at the cave mouth it 5 m and the width is 15 m.  How do I calculate this? This is a real-world problem and if there is any other information needed for this problem I will happily collect it.  This isn't a homework problem. This is a real cave and I assumed water is transported because it does pile up in the back of the cave until the wave is reflected and exits the cave in the opposite direction. Just as on beaches where waves push water up on to the beach and gravity pulls the water back to ocean creating the nearshore current. I understand that deep water waves have an almost circular orbit but due to Stokes drift a particle will be slightly displaced in the direction the swell is moving. In this cave we can assume the wave is well with in the shallow water wave criteria and almost at the critical depth in which the wave deformation is extreme and wave energy is about to be converted into turbulent kinetic energy as the wave breaks. The orbit therefore would be linear, as the wave moves in and out. The net change would be 0 m[tex], but how much water flows in and then flows back out of the cave? "
1909,"How exactly is the ""global average temperature"" calculated and how reasonable is this method?","During the recent (2015) Paris climate negotiations there was a lot of talk in the media about ""limiting the global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius"". I keep wondering about what this value of 2 degrees really means, and what can we read from this value.  It is said to refer to some sort of global average temperature. How is this average calculated, how meaningful can it be?  Temperature is what physicists call an intensive quantity, as opposed to extensive quantities which are additive.  Thus there is no physically natural way to define an ""average temperature"".  Any averaging process will necessarily be arbitrary and ad hoc.  It can be done through space and through time, with various sampling frequencies in both, and with various averaging methods (arithmetic, geometric, various weighted versions, etc.).  It is indeed possible to construct pathological functions [tex] the estimated average of which will be wildly different based on the averaging method, or even based on something as innocent looking as the sampling frequency.  Of course these difficulties don't mean that any average of an intensive quantity is meaningless.  It is completely reasonable to try to mathematically formalize the intuitive concept of warming.  But they do mean that it has to be done carefully.  It is also quite striking for those of us who are not climate scientist that the amount of warming we are talking about is on a scale (0-2 C) that is much smaller than the temperature variation we might experience during a time scale as short as a day or distance scales as short as a few hundred of kilometers.  So, to finally come to concrete questions:   How is this average calculated exactly?  Why is the specific method used considered to be reasonable?  "
1910,Altering the Milankovitch Cycles,"As I understand it, the Pleistocene ice ages were dictated by three major factors suggested by the Serbian geophysicist Milutin Milankovitch--eccentricity (orbital shape), obliquity (axial tilt) and precession (direction of rotation in relation to fixed stars).  The one identical factor between our Earth and this alternate Earth is the eccentricity--no lower than 0.000055 and no higher than 0.0679 over a period of 100,000 years.  Back home, Earth's axial tilt varies between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees in a period of 41,000 years. In this alternate Earth, the tilt varies between 20 and 25 degrees in a period of 61,500 years.  Back home, Polaris will be the North Star for a total length of roughly 26,000 years. In this alternate Earth, Alioth in the Big Dipper will be the North Star for a total length of 46,800 years.  With these changes, how would Earth's climate been different? How would these changes affect the extents of the ice ages? "
1911,What is meant by Global-warming Potential (GWP)?,"I was under the impression GWP (global-warming potential) is the measure of a gas' impact on global warming, in comparison with CO2.   E.g. methane has a GWP of 86 over 20 years - Wikipedia  Comparing paper and ceramic cups for GWP, this article (page 24) shows GWP in kilograms. Does this make sense to show GWP in kg? Can anyone explain why? "
1912,SST and air temperature differences,"I'm trying to understand what causes the sea-surface temperature (in the open ocean and coastal areas) and the air temperature immediately above it to be different. I know very little about the subject, as I have not taken a class on boundary layers. I would think that in the winter, air is colder than the ocean (and vice-versa in the summer) because the ocean has a higher heat capacity than air. Am I right? What other factors contribute to the differences between SST and local air temperature, and are there notable exceptions to what I say above?   If there are relevant papers or texts on this topic, please let me know... "
1913,Possible Effects of a Nuclear Reactor Breach in the Mediterranean,"Double-barreled question which may not precisely belong here!  Input nonetheless greatly appreciated.  My question:  To what extent would a nuclear reactor breach in the Mediterranean sea affect the sustenance of the ecosystem?  Would its bounty be rendered inedible to humans?  Additionally, could Europe adapt without starvation?  Any general thoughts on long-term implications and extenuating factors?  EDIT::: An example cause might be the catastrophic failure or aggressive destruction in the sea of a typical naval Pressurized Water Reactor used in nuclear marine propulsion. "
1914,Pangaea - Why did all the land mass form in one area?,"The thing I find most interesting about Pangaea is that, if all the landmasses were connected, it leaves a massive amount of uninterrupted ocean everywhere else. It seems to suggest that there is a significant difference between the two areas of Earth; one area being where Pangaea was located, and the other area being the rest of Earth.  Why would only that portion of the Earth be above water? Is there something significant about where Pangaea was located which made it different from the rest of the Earth? "
1915,Are the magnetic elements of meteorites that have struck Earth aligned with the magnetic field?,I was just pondering this question; do meteorites containing significant magnetic metal elements displace paleomagnetism the same way that magnetic striping on the ocean floor occurs? When the meteorites pass through the atmosphere do they actually get hot enough to go beyond the curie point of any metal-bearing minerals that are within and then subsequently align with the magnetic field as they cool back down?   If so; I assume that would that be indicative of the Earth having an inner liquid core producing a magnetic field or could something else be the contributing factor to the alignment? 
1916,What makes pollen varieties useful index fossils?,What makes pollen varieties useful index fossils? Should pollen not be a poor index fossil? 
1917,Wobbly Tire Theory -- Is there an existing theory that fits the following description?,"I am not an earth scientist but for many years I have wondered about the following. I am curious if this has already been explored by scientists? If so, what is the theory formally called? and what is the consensus of the scientific community about such a theory?    CONCEPT: When you have new tires put on your car the mechanic will put the tire on a machine to check the balance and then add small lead or zinc weights on the rim to correct any wobble. Even though the weights are tiny by comparison they play a critical role in effective lifespan of the tires.   For the past couple hundred years humans have been moving ""tiny"" amounts of weight around the surface of the earth. We add weights when we build large cities, or dam rivers. We take away weights when we excavate and overdrafting.   There also of course are natural events that move ""tiny"" surface weights around, such as glacier movement, island formation, caldera eruptions, and meteor strikes. This last of course also imparts a vector of kinetic energy change due to impact force.    THEORY: I call this personal idea the ""Wobbly Tire Theory"" on the presumption that Earth has for millennia been dealing with axis wobble but has usually had time to adjust/stabilize between significant changes. However, in the past 200 years or so we have been making a lot of man-made changes in these weights in a timespan that is a geologic blink-of-an-eye.   I speculate that these rapid changes may be affecting the earths rotation in subtle ways. For example, I wonder could such changes affect the core's rotation vector in any way?  So back to my original Question: Does this theory (including OR excluding the last about man-made effects) already exist among geophysicists and others? What name(s) does it go by? And what details, if any, are there on the scientific consensus of this concept? "
1918,Future super-continent,What will the earth look like when the continents recollide? What will the climate be like? Assume global warming has been taken care of. 
1919,St. Elmo's Fire not dangerous?,"I know that St. Elmo's Fire is a form of plasma that occurs during thunderstorms that is similar to lightning because it is formed by a difference in charges.  But why isn't it dangerous if St. Elmo's Fire is around you?  For one, the fact that there is a charge difference usually means an electric shock, whether that is a tiny bit of static electricity from touching metal or a lightning strike. Yet St. Elmo's Fire is caused by a charge difference but doesn't give you an electric shock.  Also if there is a charge difference around you, lightning is more likely to strike you, even if you are as low as you can be. This can lead to heart problems such as tachycardia, fibrillation, or asystole. It can also cause uncontrollable muscle movements which itself can be dangerous because if your muscles are out of control you can end up anywhere. Muscles being out of control can also mean things like vomiting, lots of mechanical digestion, high blood pressure and more from involuntary muscles being out of control. In any case it is dangerous to have voluntary or involuntary muscles out of control. It can also cause nervous system problems, in particular excitation toxicity from positive charges continously reaching neurons until they don't send a signal.   So with all the health problems that can result and the difference in charges itself without an electric shock, why is St. Elmo's Fire not dangerous? "
1920,Appearance of Tornado,"Does the appearance of a tornado come from the dust or is there some characteristic of swirling wind? Additionally many experiments shows a tornado-like phenomena in a jar of water, is this possible without water? "
1921,First to Sail the Jet Stream Around the World,"My questions are related to a scenario discussed on Earth Science: A huge (heavier-than-air) kite sailing in and out of the jet streams.   The kite:    The scenario:        The assumptions:   Such an airship exists and there is a person aboard, with an oxygen mask. The person is thermally insulated to keep the heat inside. The jet streams are at an altitude around 9–12 km (30,000–39,000 ft) .   The Questions:   Can a kite like the one in the picture be built to hold a person? Does the human body require pressurization as well as oxygen and insulation? ANSWER  Is it possible using the jet stream systems to go around the world? Can the kite fly at speeds around 80-150 km/h related to the ground? Can it sustain a free fall from its cruising altitude around 9–12 km so that the pilot can land maybe using a parachute?   Possible Solutions:  Launch Considering the altitude is up around 9–12 km then air would be thinner the size of it will have to be much larger to compensate. Use a cable and boat to lift the UltraKite into the Jet Stream. At preferred altitude cable then can be mechanically released from connected drag section of the kite. A drone or balloons could replace boat and then dropped. Maybe the person could ride in the drag section.  Long Term Altitude with Ultralights Gliders on Record.  The current 15460-meter glider height record was made with pressurized suits. But it is only 500 meters higher than Harris' previous record from 1986, which was done with just an oxygen mask. – Martin Argerami in a comment in Turbulent Jet Streams on Ultralights  As commented by @Jan Hudec: This is supposed to be a kite, but instead of being fixed to the ground as normal kite, it would have just a cabin with a braking parachute flying below the jet stream and the kite flying in the jet stream, so the whole thing would move at some speed between the slow speed of the wind at low altitude and the high speed of the jet stream.   "
1922,"Relationship between obliquity, antarctic circumpolar current, and atmospheric $\ce{CO2}$","Hannah's text on the biology of climate change appears to suggest that forcing due to changes in obliquity can act in opposite ways in Antarctic waters.  On one hand,      ""Low obliquity brings cool summers to both hemispheres, which favors ice buildup in the north and intensified circumpolar current in the south.  The intensification of the circumpolar current reduces upwelling of [tex]-rich water.  The reduction in atmospheric [tex] cools the planet...""    On the other hand,      ""high obliquity results in warmer summers in both hemispheres.  This begins to melt the continental ice sheets in the north, whereas in the south it intensifies circumpolar currents and winds, pumping [tex]-rich water to the surface and warming.""   How can ""intensified"" ACC both increase and decrease upwelling?  How does this ""intensification"" occur, that is what is the linkage between warmer or cooler Antarctic summers and the intensification?  Apparently ocean - atmosphere [tex] exchange is important here but the fertilization effect of upwelling is not? "
1923,"What are the effects of underwater ""windmills""?","Most early examples of tidal energy generators used barrages (damns) to generate electricity (La Rance, Kislaya Guba, Annapolis Royal). Meanwhile, a lot of newer projects use rotary blades in the tidal flow (like windmill blades), resulting in an installation that looks like an underwater wind farm. Examples of such projects are: FORCE (Fundy Ocean Research Center for Energy), SeaGen, TidalStream...  While some have claimed that the environmental effects of these new systems are much less severe, the fact is that tidal current technology is relatively new and has been applied in only a few sites. The environmental impacts seem to be based on hypothesis, modeling and simplified lab experiments, but my questions are:   What are these environmental effects? How much are the local currents affected by these structures?  "
1924,Modeling swirling storms,"I'm looking to demonstrate the rotational behaviour of swirling storms with a numerical simulation. So far it includes pressure-gradient, Coriolis acceleration, frictional forces and the acceleration due to gravity.  In a non-inertial frame of reference (surface of the Earth), [tex], [tex] points south, [tex] points eastward and [tex] upward. I've found that the acceleration of air masses is expressed as:  [tex]  [tex]  [tex]  where the last terms are the deflections due to the Coriolis effect, the middle ones friction forces and the first ones pressure-gradient forces. [tex] is the acceleration due to gravity ([tex]).  I would work in 2 dimensions since my initial conditions (pressure maps) are given for a specific altitude. But then I would ignore some terms of the Coriolis and gravity, and many other effects I bet. I can go for a 3d description of the phenomenon, but it might be too difficult to deal with a collection of pressure maps at different altitudes.  Questions:   Is the set of equations physically correct to model accurately the spiral-ish rotation of hurricanes? If not, what are the other forces that would be worth adding? I'm doing a numerical simulation, and I want to test it with pressure maps. The first thing I've done was removing the terms that act in the [tex] direction since my initial conditions (pressure maps) are given for a specific altitude. Is this approximation still correct to achieve my goal? In addition to question 2, if the model should rather be described in a 3 dimensional coordinate system, it might be too difficult to deal with a collection of pressure maps at different altitudes, is it?   I'm definitely not an expert and my readings in the subject didn't help. "
1925,How will axial precession affect the weather in the northern hemisphere (UK latitudes)?,"Unless there's a twin star to our sun in which case axial precession might be an illusion the Earth's wobble won't effect the total amount of energy received from the sun as is expected from increased ellipticity, but will effect the amount of sun's energy to the Northern and Southern hemispheres in a cyclical 26000 (and diminishing) year period with periodic further exacerbations caused by variations in tilt.  How has Precession and variations in tilt been factored into the weather change model if at all?  As a side question: On the Salisbury Plain 6500 yrs ago according to wobble theory the East-West alignment going by the apparent motion of the sun across the sky must have been different to today. Can anyone tell me how to calculate the difference in respect to Grid North  please?   Background: I'm building a picture of Neolithic Britain and want to know the orientation of East-West in this time period to check for orientation practices if any. The particular time period I'm interested in lies about half way along the Axial Precession's swing so I'm interested to know A) Whether the axial precession exists or not and B) How the theory is in agreement with the weather patterns for the last 24000 yrs on Salisbury Plain.  "
1926,How Short IS The Arctic Summer?,"In all the documentaries I've seen regarding the Arctic or anyplace close to it, like Alaska or Siberia, they simply say that summer in the Arctic is ""short"".  But how short is short?  How long does the sun refuse to set in the land of the midnight sun? "
1927,How accurately can a tsunami be predicted? Have there been any successful evacuations?,"With the current instruments in hand, how accurately can we predict tsunamis?

1928,Base temperature value for European Nordic Countries,"I am calculating Heating Degree Days and Cooling Degree Days for European Nordic countries (Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania).  On a paper (Benestad 2008) I read that the base temperature is bounded between 18°C and 22°C, but this value is too much generic for my purposes, as I have to compute exact HDD and CDD for the aforementioned countries. Where can I retrieve Base Temperature values for Nordic countries?   UPDATE: I found that EUROSTAT use a value of 15°C as base temperature for computing HDD and CDD. Would it be acceptable? "
1929,Are volcanoes formed from earthquakes?,I know that some earthquakes are caused by volcanoes and that some earthquakes can trigger volcanic eruptions close to where the earthquake is.  But what if a great earthquake(8.0 or above) occurs and causes there to be a fault line? If more earthquakes of any magnitude occur in the same area the fault line would get deeper and deeper until the mantle is exposed. Then the pressure in the mantle is released and lava starts flowing out of the fault line. Over years this would form a ridge whether that is underwater or inland.   But are any volcanoes actually formed from earthquakes? 
1930,"Definitive values that classifies a rock as having “low”, “medium”, and “high” -strength, -hardness, -toughness, and -consolidation?","Question:  Are there any widely accepted published values (or ranges) that classifies a rock as having “low” “medium” “high” -strength, -hardness, -toughness, and -consolidation (cementation or cohesion?)?  UCS Background Material:  I have come across some papers that have defined what is considered to be “low”, “medium”, “high” strength rocks as characterized by unconfined (uniaxial) compressive strength (UCS).  This is what I have found:   “Due to the unique properties of these quartz arenite sandstone reservoirs high compressive strengths up to 25,000 psi are common,…” (emphasis is mine) (1) “In order to define the effect of formation compressive strength on perforator penetration and hole character, various formations in the low-, medium-, and high- strength ranges were acquired for laboratory shot tests.” (emphasis is mine)  (2).     The author then lists the rocks tested:  low ~ 2000 psi UCS ( Austin chalk), medium ~ 5000 to 7000 psi UCS (Idiana limestone and Berea sandstone), High ~ 11,000+ psi UCS (Carthage limestone)   “Ultrahigh-strength formations….Oman formations in which UCS varies from 20,000 to 55,000 psi.” (emphasis is mine)  (3)   Hardness Background Material:  I have seen a paper that has defined the inter-relationship between hardness (using the Brinell hardness number (BHN)) and consolidation, reference 4.   Loosely consolidated material (BHN 2-4 kg/mm2) Friable-to-consolidated material (BHN 10-15 kg/mm2)   Consolidation Background Material:  Reference 5 defines what is “unconsolidated” (damp sand), “weakly consolidated” (Saltwash south), and “strongly consolidated” Castlegate, Berea, etc., qualitatively.   “unconsolidated” = essentially no cohesion e.g. cohesive forces due to friction, granular interlocking and capillary forces. “weakly consolidated” = can be failed by forces one can generate with their fingers “strongly consolidated” = requires a tool such as an hammer to fail the rock   References:   Blosser, W.

1932,How can we accurately quantify the degree of scientific certainty that global heating is caused by humans?,How can we accurately quantify the degree of scientific certainty that global heating is caused by humans?  It seem virtually certain that the huge 100 PPM spike in CO2 since 1950 can only be caused by humans. Can we be as sure that this huge spike in CO2 caused the 1C increase in global temperatures as we are that tobacco causes cancer?   Do validated alternative explanations exist?  What kinds of objective measures are typically used to determine the specific degree of scientific certainty?      There is a trend showing an increasing slope in the following graph data 1910 to 1960---0.41---50 years / 0.41 = 122 years per degree 1960 to 2018---1.03---58 years / 0.87 =  67 years per degree  [website]
1933,What is the temperature of the flowing water in icy river?,"Boundaries of the question:   The question is about rivers where water flows in cold area of the earth. Whether it's because of the winter or it's simply cold all year long. Usually, the top layer of the river freeze and water underneath continue to flow freely. The question is about the temperature of the liquid water only. So, the temperature of the solid water is irrelevant to the question. This question is only about fresh water rivers only. So salty rivers are not part of the question.   The question itself:  What is the temperature of the flowing water in icy river? More precisely, does the temperature of the water drop below 0 °C? If it does, is this common? If it doesn't, does it get close to it at all?  Attempted research to find the answer :  I had in mind that the current allowed the water to stay liquid, but that might be wrong because there is no proof to it. However, this answer says:     For flowing water to freeze, the temperature would have to be   exceptionally cold.   Which seems to agree that current can lower the freezing point.   I found a great document about the temperature of the water within lake, but didn't find any reliable answer for rivers.    EDIT I have come to believe that temperatures don't typically fall below 0 °C, based upon aggregating the following information...      Rivers freeze completely once the heat lost exceeds the rate of water replacement. Most lakes and rivers don't freeze solid because water, ice, and snow are good insulators and poor conductors of heat. The portions of a lake or river that is exposed to the cold winter air freezes, and this ice insulates the water below from further rapid freezing. Earth is warming the water from below.    Using this, we can probably conclude that water won't cool down enough during it's journey down the river. Thus, the water would need to be already colder at the start of the journey. We know that the start is a lake with calm water. So, it's unlikely to happen because the lake would freeze completely and stop flowing out into the river.  "
1934,Convert air vapor pressure to relative humidity,"Is it possible to convert Air vapor pressure ([tex]) to relative humidity (%) given a known air temperature?   For example, I know that relative humidity can be estimated as:  [tex]  where [tex] is the air vapor pressure and [tex] saturated vapor pressure at air temperature, both with units of mb. Specifically, [tex] can be estimated by:  [tex]  where [tex] is the air temperature in [tex].   However, in my case the air vapor pressure has units of [tex]?   How can I use this conversion with these values/units? Is it simply the case of converting [tex] to mb via:  [tex]  and then using the equation? "
1935,How do rivers last so long in dry weather?,"I got caught in a downpour while climbing a mountain and was amazed to see, as I climbed down, the tiny trickles of water combine to form mini-streams, the dry rocks I had climbed up now hosted sizable waterfalls, and the path which I had followed to the mountain had become a small river.  But it got me wondering about my question, which  is the reverse of this. Why, after a long period of dry weather, are many rivers still flowing? I live near a river and it seems that it takes over a week of dry weather before there's any noticeable drop in its level. How does it not simply run out of water?  Is it simply that it takes very a long time for the water at its source and the sources of all its tributaries to reach the point I'm observing from?  It seems there's a constant supply of water when I would have expected the network of rivers to start draining, and the drying up starting from the source the moment the rain stopped. "
1936,Why in different places seems directions are changed?,I'm living at place A I traveled to B and I seen like sun isn't set as in place A. Like directions are changed. Where east is in place B is north of A and south of A is   west of B. Because of sun wasn't set in B as usually as set in place A. Sun rises in north at place B and sets in south. I really confused with this phenomenon of nature. Is it mean we consider direction which region we living in? Is it all because of longitude and latitude? Why it'd be like this? May it because if sun travel by specific longitude and latitude and so we would confused in situation like this even sun is stable planet and just earth rotate?

1944,How long does a magnetic pole reversal take to complete?,"Geomagnetic pole reversal is a ""regular"" phenomenon on Earth. Although the interval pattern has been irregular at times (sometimes with millions of years of difference between change intervals), Earth has settled in the last 20 million years into a pattern of a pole reversal about every 200,000 - 300,000 years (source: NASA). Based on this pattern and the fact that the most recent pole-switch occurred ~780,000 years ago, the Earth is ""overdue"" for a pole switch.  My question: How quickly does a pole switch occur?    Is it instantaneous? Does it take years? Millennia? Is the current movement of the pole part of a drawn-out switch, or is it just ""normal"" pole movement? Again, from NASA:     The magnetic north pole has been creeping northward – by more than 600 miles (1,100 km) – since the early 19th century, when explorers first located it precisely. It is moving faster now, actually, as scientists estimate the pole is migrating northward about 40 miles per year, as opposed to about 10 miles per year in the early 20th century.  From some previous research, it seems like it doesn't always make a ""clean"" switch either, with multiple poles appearing globally -- would this multi-pole extravaganza increase the switching time, or is it also normal?

1947,What field studies have developed or supported the Penman-Monteith equations for estimating evapotranspiration?,"I'm trying to understand transpiration estimation methods. The FAO recommends a standard Penman-Monteith methodology for modeling evapotranspiration based on meteorological and vegetation parameters (ie. wind speed, leaf area index). Many eco-hydrology models make use of the Penman-Monteith equations, some with minor modifications.  I understand the Penman-Monteith equations, and modification thereof, are simplifications of complex processes. It would be impractical to measure actual transpiration in all conditions where that information is useful, so we model it instead. That said, field observations in the development or support of models is valuable for verifying knowledge gained through models.  My question is: what field studies have developed or supported Penman-Monteith equations (or modified versions of it)? In a sense there is indirect verification of the equations through field measurement verification of results from models that implement the Penman-Monteith equations. Are there any direct field measurements of (evapo-)transpiration that support (or even helped develop) the Penman-Monteith equations, to demonstrate the equations' validity in real world conditions? "
1948,Phase conversion of snow and ice due to irradiation versus melting,"A few years ago another question touched on the relative rates of sublimation versus melting in terms of snow and snow pack disappearance.  What was unusual about the answer is the huge range of variability in the results from different studies. One study claiming only 2% of ablation was due to sublimation and another claiming almost all of it was. I vaguely remember an extensive New Zealand study (not shown in the answer) that had a result showing about half of ablation is due to irradiation (sublimation).  Has this subject been revisited by more thorough-going studies that answer the question definitively?  In my own view, it would seem that ""backyard"" experiments could be done on snow drifts to answer this question. In my mind there should be no one single numeric answer but rather a table which relates several factors:   the underlying ground material and strata (sandy soil, rock, asphalt, etc) the air temperature the latitude and time (= inclination to the sun) surface area exposed to sun surface area exposed to ground volume of frozen accumulation type of frozen accumulation (dry snow, wet snow, ice)   Based on these factors it should be possible using the principles of thermodynamics and physical experiments to create tables (or equations) that define ablation in terms of these seven variables.  Has any study been done to do this computation? "

1951,What factors explain mountain glacier retreat variability?,"It is well known that the majority of the world's mountain glaciers are retreating, but looking at a few LANDSAT images from the 1980s and today I am able to see glaciers that have retreated kilometers in that time frame, and others which have hardly changed at all within the same region.

1953,A balloon falling from space?,How long would it take for a store bought rubber balloon filled in space with air to fall from space just outside the atmosphere and touch ground? Would it Pop?     Added after comments: Ideally you would like to have a balloon filled with 14 PSI before it was dropped so that way it maintains its shape all the way down to the ground. But being a normal party balloon has its problems. It would only take one PSI of ambient air to fill a party balloon in space and any more than that it would pop. I didn't take in consideration on how temperature would affect the rubber. On the sunny side it would be well above the melting point of the rubber. On the freezing shadow side of the Earth side the rubber would freeze becoming brittle and break.  Temperature outside would the pressure of falling through the atmosphere pop the balloon?

1956,"How to use Maximum Sustainable Yield concept with given a given population, growth rate and carrying capacity?","For my class, I was given a hypothetical situation that uses the concept of Maximum Sustainable Yield to see how much fish I should harvest. I am given an initial population, a growth rate, and a carrying capacity.   Then with these given values, I was supposed to use this information to calculate for next year's population which I easily did with the logistic growth formula. I got a population of 368 (which is obviously rounded to a whole number). From what I know, with this initial population of 368 that I calculated, it would a bit over the one-half capacity but not over the carrying capacity of the environment that was given to me.  At this point, I don't know how to apply the Maximum Sustainable Yield concept here. I am not sure on how much I should harvest this year if the current fish population is 368. I don't want to harvest all 368 fish because that would mean that I wiped out the entire population for this year, correct? So would it make sense if I harvested half this number while still have enough fish for next year?  I tried to look at this graph I found as a reference but I'm not too sure how to apply it:  MSY GRAPH HERE  If I am made a misstep in my process, please do share. Thank you! "
1957,What gravitational evidence do we have to counter the idea that oceans are formed when continents sink?,"Is there some evidence for this based on gravity anomalies?  I think I know how to tell if a mountain or structure is compensated based on bougeur and free air anomalies, but this really has me stumped?  Does this somehow tie into how underwater mountains are compensated by pratt rather than airy?   "
1958,How much plastic settles to the bottom of the oceans each year?,"This article says that 5 to 13 million metric tons of plastic go into the ocean every year.  In the study At what point do floating plastics sink?, they give an estimate of the weight needed to sink plastics.  They reference the paper Assessing marine debris in deep seafloor habitats off California, which assesses the amount of plastic debris that has settled to the bottom of the ocean off the coast of California.  Given this information as a starting point... How much plastic settles to the bottom of the oceans each year? "
1959,Using NASA's radiance calculator to make a graph to find the where the peak radiation emission are?,I am trying to graphically show the radiance emissions of both the Sun and Earth. I am using NASA's radiance calculator then going to graph it on paper.  Here is what I typed in:  Low wavelength: 0.1μm  high wavelength: 100.0μm  Plot 1:  Temp: 5778k &lt;- for the sun's avg temp  Emissivity: 1.00 &lt;- was unsure what this was for  Plot 2:  Temp: 274.03 &lt;- for the Earth's avg temp  Emissivity:  x-axis scale: log  y-axis scale: log  Here is what that all looks like:   As far as making a plot of the emitted energy of the Sun and the emitted energy of Earth on the same graph does this look correct? How might one annotate/label the curves to show where the peak emission occurs?  Should the x or y axis be dialed down they are between 0.1 to 100.0 and then the y-axis sale 0.01 to 10.000  I appears that the Suns peak emission is between 0.32 - 10.00microns and the Earth is 10.00microns.  Thank you 
1960,Earthquakes in Oklahoma influenced by Humans?,"I'm currently living in Oklahoma, and there has been an abnormal amount of earthquakes lately, by abnormal I mean more then 5 in a day(not sure if that's normal or not)..  I've also been told that in OK earthquakes are a relatively new thing, now they've brought a bunch of experts in to try to figure out the problem but my question being what could possibly cause so many earthquakes to start happening randomly?  I have a couple theories:   Oil wells, we're sucking up all the oil in the ground and the planet is trying to cope with it Underwater waste pipes, idk if these would have anything to do with it, but putting something underground that isn't natural seems like a bad idea to me..

1961,Where can I get historic hourly precipitation data for Italy?,"I am looking for a time-series of hourly precipitation for Naples, Italy. I'd like to learn how to find this sort of data for Italy in general, as well.  Ideally this data would cover a recent year with no gaps greater than a few days, and would come as a spreadsheet with time-stamps and precipitation measurements on the hour side-by-side. I'm not picky and will format as needed, but I haven't found anything close to this yet. Also, public-domain/open-data is much preferred (we all like free things right?) but is not a limiting factor in my search.    Research thus far:  I've searched and cannot find a text-based data source as I described. I think the closest source I've got is the following, which does not have observed hourly precip: [website]  Precipitation      This station provides hourly reports of significant weather events at and around the station, but does not report the quantity of precipitation at the station itself. This is common for weather stations located outside of the United States, and for a small subset of stations in the United States that are located at lesser used and smaller airports.    I'm familiar with the difficulty of getting hourly precipitation and certain other meteorological variables from most weather stations outside of the U.S. and major international airports. In many cases, locals have been able to help me, often by providing the data themselves (these locals tend to be experts) or sharing the right channel to reach out to in their country's national government or research institutions. I haven't had such success in Italy though, but I only know/have asked a couple of relevant scientists. In part I'm hoping this question will serve as me asking more Earth scientists who work in Italy.  I've searched the European Union Open Data Portal, which feels like it would be the right place but is not (yet) as far as I have seen.  In searching for digital elevation data (which I'll be using with the precip data in this project), a Cornell page pointed me to Italy's Military Geographical Institute. From what I can tell through a Google Translate lens, this site doesn't offer hourly precip data. I don't speak Italian and have only poked around a couple of pages, so I could be missing something.    I turn to you, ES:SE. Where can I find historic hourly precipitation data for Napoli, Italia? "
1962,A simple formulation to calculate the sequence and rate of salt precipitation in a brine?,"Is there a simple formulation to estimate the rate of salt precipitation in a brine given its ion concentrations and the evaporation rate?   For example: if we know the concentrations of Cl−, Na+, Mg2+, SO42−, Ca2+, K+ of a sea-water brine at a known temperature T, what salt(s) and how much of each will precipitate for a given evaporation rate E (assuming time enough for equilibrium)? Can you refer to a concise text-book or article?  I need something that goes beyond the simplistic saturation concentration concept (i.e., prescribed limit for diluted salt concentration). The effects of life in the solution can be dismissed.  "
1963,Why is the pond in my backyard not frozen when it is -15 °C (5 °F) outside?,"I am in O'Fallon, Missouri and today it is -15 °C (5 °F) outside. I was taught water freezes at 0 °C (32 °F). I could understand if it was exactly 0 °C (32 °F) that the water might not be turning to ice, but how can it be 15 °C (27 °F) below water's freezing point and still be liquid water? The water is still moving due to the wind, which I think shows it has no plan of freezing. How can this be?   My question may be too broad because there may be more than one reason why it isn't freezing, but I don't know of any. I tried to narrow it by giving my exact location and temperatures. It is a pond in my backyard. From what I've seen through Google, it may have something to do with crystallization rate? Thanks in advance. "
1964,Using Range Height Indicator scan of radar,I am learning about the several modes of radar that are used to study structure of thunder storms and mesoscale systems. There are three modes of radar scans as documented here - Weather Radar Systems  I have only used the Plan Position Indicator(PPI) mode to track thunder storms.  Could somebody who has used the Range Height Indicator(RHI) mode as a meteorologist or using it as part of their research work put up a sample RHI mode scan for a thunderstorm(can be supercell)  explain the following   What extra information can be gleaned from the RHI mode that is not available with the PPI mode ?  Can phenomena such as back sheared anvil be observed from the RHI mode ?  Also can anvil rain be inferred from RHI mode?  
1965,What is the strongest observed static stability in the troposphere?,"I know that typical values for the Brunt–Väisälä frequency, [tex], are of the order [tex], but what is the strongest observed stability?  And how deep are such strong layers?  I am interested in running idealised simulations for such situations. "
1966,Near Future Precipitation and Temperature estimations?,"I was wondering if anyone here is familiar with temperature and precipitation estimation?   I need to estimate P and T from April to July 2016. I am planning to use excel to do the calculation because  I am not familiar with programming languages.   What options do I have for the calculations? are there ready formula that I can use to estimate T and P? what historical based models are there for such problem?  Thanks, "
1967,How long would it take for Mars to cool after asteroid impact?,"As someone interested in terraforming, the main obstacle to colonizing Mars is the lack of a magnetosphere and Atmosphere. To create a magnetosphere of sufficient magnitude the Martian core must be reignited. There are several ways to do this, some of which involve using electric current to restart the core, but the most feasible way it seems would be to take an asteroid of sufficient size and slingshot it into Mars. Doing so would reignite the core resulting in increased volcanic activity, the formation of a thick and stable atmosphere, etc.  It seems to be the perfect solution despite the fact that doing so would be a long term investment. I was wondering - based on what we know of the Earth's development - how long would it take Mars to cool after an asteroid impact of sufficient size? are we talking millions or billions of years? "
1968,The effect of buildings on frost,"I have see this morning this curious garden where one part was covered with frost while the other was frost free.   Question 1: What are the factor that play a role in this configuration?   My guess is radiation from the building and the wind (the frost free part being more protected from the wind by the building) but then I wonder : Will there still be these two zones after a night without any wind? (Question 2)  The left house is heated, the middle one isn't but it's inhabited, the shed is closed but not insulated and without heating source inside. There isn't any other surrounding structures that could create shade.   The open side of the garden is facing south.   I observed the frost after sunrise, but before the sun rays were reaching the garden.   "
1969,Round structure in southern United States,"Assuming here might be someone who knows something about this, I wanted to ask what is behind this round structure I have spotted today on Google Earth:    There seems to be a large (~200 km), nearly perfect half-circle covering the states of Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee. How could this regular structure  possibly originate? I did some research on the web, but could not find anything. It looks a bit like an impact crater, but there is none listed in this location and especially of this large size. So how did this structure emerge? "
1970,Why does dew accumlate on only one side of my car?,"Many days I walk out to my car to go to work and notice my windows are fogged up, I believe due to dew (haha homophones). When I am at my mother's house(O'Fallon, MO), all Windows get fogged up. When I am at my father's house (Saint Charles, MO), only one side of the car is fogged up.  This is kind of a two-part question. 1) How does dew accumulate? 2) Why would it only accumulate on one side of my car?  I suspect it has to do with the fact the side that does not fog up faces a tree. This is very curious to me. Since I am not sure what else is needed to answer my question, I will update as comments come in. "
1971,How to compare earthquake magnitudes,"On the USGS website, it says     Because of the logarithmic basis of the scale, each whole number   increase in magnitude represents a tenfold increase in measured   amplitude;   However my book says this:     Like many other scales in science (decibel is another example), Richter scale is not linear. This means that an earthquake of magnitude 6 does not have one and half times the destructive energy of an earthquake of magnitude 4. In fact, an increase of 2 in magnitude means 1000 times more destructive energy. Therefore, an earthquake of magnitude 6 has thousand times more destructive energy than an earthquake of magnitude 4.   But based upon the USGS information, an increase in 2 magnitude would be 10 x 10 = 100 stronger.  Now which one is correct? "
1972,Has an entire plate ever subducted?,"We know that plates can subduct, causing one plate to be pushed into the core by another.  As the plates move, the subduction continues, pushing one plate under the other.  If this process continues, logic says, the entire plate could be subducted under the other.   Has this ever happened?  How would we know? "
1973,Interpreting some hydropower data. What does DSF mean in this context?,"This is the historical feed of the Keystone dam for October 2014:   www.swt-wc.usace.army.mil/chartbin/KEYSOct14.shtml   Here is the real time feed:   www.swt-wc.usace.army.mil/ops_hydropower/KEYShydro.html   I am having trouble understanding the ""Releases DSF"" Power/Total columns. What do these mean? I understand that DSF is day-second-feet but that is a unit of volume NOT flow rate. The real-time feed shows the flow rate in CFS (cubic feet/second). The dam is rated at around 70 MW. Do you think that the column in the historical data is mislabelled as Power when it should be Energy (MWh)?  I understand that Power = Height of Dam x Flow Rate x Efficiency and this makes sense in the real-time feed. However, I am having trouble reconciling the historical data with the real time data.  Bottom line: I want to know the power / energy generated at the dam historically and in real time. "
1974,How do we know the asteroids formed at the same time as earth?,"In continuation of the question Why is Earth's age given by dating meteorites rather than its own rocks?, what evidence do we have that the asteroids indeed formed at the same time as earth? Is there any physical evidence, or is it a conclusion reached mostly through simulation? "
1975,Why does seismic activity shed light on the inner core rigidity?,"Reading Introduction to Geology (MIT 2005) and Wikipedia's article on Earth's inner core, it is specified that:     Earth was discovered to have a solid inner core distinct from its liquid outer    core in 1936, by the seismologist Inge Lehmann, who deduced its presence from observations of earthquake-generated seismic waves that reflect off the boundary of the inner core and can be detected by sensitive seismographs on the Earth's surface.   Why does seismic activity would result in the conclusion that the inner core is rigid? What is the link between seismism and inner core? "
1976,What is limestone made of?,"I know that it is calcium carbonate (CaCO3). I also know that these are the dead bodies of microorganisms.   My question is, where do they procure the building material? The limestone seems to cover the whole Planet with a multimeter-thick layer. How is this possible - after we assume the conservation of atoms? Where did the limestone molecules come from? How long can the process of sediment formation last? Is the building material coming from space or due to Universe Expansion (black matter)? Is it right that the Planet becomes thicker and thicker with every year if we assume conservation of matter? "
1977,Does the climate have any effect on plate tectonics?,"After reading the question and answer Is there any correlation between La Niña/El Niño and seismic activity?, I am wondering if there is any evidence (case studies) to suggest that longer term climatic dynamics (long term trends in seasonality, ambient temperature and pressure, such as ice ages, warm epochs) has any effect on plate tectonic dynamics (rate of plate movement, frequency of megathrust events, earthquake and volcanic eruption frequency and severity etc)? "
1978,"Are the ""polar vortex"" and ""cut-off lows"" over/near the Great Lakes new phenomena?","In recent years, I've heard weather reporters describe ""cut-off"" low pressure systems which park over Southern Ontario for days at a time. In summer months, they bring us long stretches of cool cloudy, often rainy days. In only the last couple of years, there was mention of the ""polar vortex"" which seemed to unusually extend and deepen our winter last year.  I don't recall mention of either term in weather reports for the Southern Ontario region more than a few years ago.  Over the meteorological record for this region, are these new patterns? If they are not new patterns, is it simply a trend in weather reporting to apply these terms? "
1979,What is the reason why there are radiosonde measurements in the atmosphere?,I have seen weather balloon measurements of air.  Why is this done?  Aren't the measurements we take on the ground enough? 
1980,"What are the tectonic implications of the Quaternary Igwisi Hills, Tanzania, kimberlite volcanics?","The Igwisi Hills Kimberlite volcanic features in Tanzania are described in the article Mapping the Igwisi Hills kimberlite volcanoes, Tanzania: understanding  how deep-sourced mantle magmas behave at the Earth`s surface (Brown and Sparks), as being Quaternary or younger in age and consistent with my earlier question and answer, What is it about ancient craton geology that results in associated kimberlite pipes containing economic diamond deposits?, it had erupted through the Tanzania Craton.  The article Tectonic setting of kimberlites (Jelsma et al. 2009) has made correlations between older kimberlite volcanics and aspects of the supercontinent cycle, specifically:     Kimberlites can be viewed as time capsules in a global plate tectonic framework. Their distribution illustrates   clustering in time and space. Kimberlite ages span the assembly and break-up of a number of   supercontinents, such as Rodinia and Gondwana. These supercontinents show time lines with (i) broad   periods devoid of kimberlite magmatism corresponding to times of continent stability, and (ii) narrow   kimberlite emplacement windows corresponding to times of fundamental plate reorganizations.   Implying a link between parts of the supercontinent cycle and kimberlite magmatism.  However, this implied tectonic setting does not seem to match with Quaternary Tanzania, when the Igwisi Hills kimberlite volcanoes erupted.  Therefore, what are the tectonic implications of the Quaternary Igwisi Hills, Tanzania, kimberlite volcanics?  The only thing that comes to mind is the East African Rift tectonics, but are not sure about this link. "
1981,Is the Principle of Fossil Succession accurate?,"After wondering on the validity of the principle of Original Horizontality, I'm now focusing on the principle of fossil succession.  This principle states that :     Fossils of species that did not coexist in the same geological period were found to be in different strata. The principle provided a way for geologists to determine the age of a particular rock layer based on the fossils embedded in it.    This principle seems illogical to me. Let's say that in South America, fossils of a certain species are found, and dated to be from Jurassic. Now, same fossils are found in Europe, and therefore we should conclude that stratum are from Jurassic too.   As we know that Earth is all the time disrupts by inner motions of its cores, what if those motions implied a fossil to move over stratum? It would imply a miscalculation here. How can I prove that this principle is safe?  (For better understanding, imagine that I bury a box at a certain place. If you come 2 years later, nothing proves that you'll be able to find it again, because 'things move in the inside') "
1982,Color of ocean waters and Ekman pumping - what is the connection?,"Is there a connection between the colors of oceanic waters near the coast and Ekman pumping? Along the coastal areas of the Bay of Bengal where I live, occasionally during the monsoon, the colors of the waters become aquamarine, only to become sky blue in color a few hours later as the sea breeze sets in.  Can this be explained by coastal upwelling?  If this is due to Ekman pumping where does EP take place? Over equatorial waters and is then pushed north due to a coastal current?  The phenomenon has been observed during both the Indian monsoons- the south west monsoon as well as the north east monsoon i.e. that the seasonal shift in wind direction does not impact the appearance of the aquamarine color.   The width of the patch is between 200-300 meters from the coast and it is oriented parallel to the coast. Closer to the coast the color is dark greenish brown and as you go further into the open sea it is aquamarine green. There are occasional dark blue ""patches""(dark blue bands) which I am presuming is phytoplankton.   Few more personal observations. It appears that the aquamarine color usually manifests itself during the mornings (when there is no breeze whatsoever). The sea presents extremely gentle waves when the aquamarine color is visible. Does that mean that the origin of the aquamarine color is ""non - local"" ?  "
1983,Is the Cameroon Line still an active rift zone?,"The Cameroon Line is described by the Oregon State University's Volcano World webpage What is known about the volcanoes of Cameroon? as a      a chain of volcanoes extending from Annobon Island in the Atlantic Ocean northeastward through Cameroon. The oldest rocks have been dated at 70 million years old.   As in this map from the Global Volcanism Program's Oku Volcanic Field webpage:    A notable active volcano in the area is Lake Nyos which killed 1700 people in an eruption that spewed noxious gases (mainly [tex]) in 1986.  The explanation for the active volcanism is given by Oregon State as being due to     About 80 million years ago, during a reorganization of plate boundaries, the African plate rotated counter-clockwise. Then a new rift formed that failed to split Africa but apparently did form conduits that allowed magma to ultimately reach the surface and form the volcanoes of the Cameroon line.   Is there any evidence to suggest that the Cameroon Line is still a tectonically active rift system? "
1984,Hypotheses about Silurian carbon isotope excursions?,"The Silurian Period is now known to have undergone several significant positive [tex] excursions, namely the early Aeronian, Late Aeronian, Valgu, Ireviken, Mulde, Lau &amp; Klonk events (see e. g. Cramer et al. 2011; Gradstein et al. 2012). It seems to me that those excursions where mainly studied in the context of chemostratigraphy and not paleoclimatology, though.    Is there any hypotheses on what could have triggered these excursions? How come the short (ca. 24 Myr) Silurian be so unstable has to have so many significant excursions?

1985,Did a gamma ray burst contribute to the Ordovician mass extinction?,"According to the University of California Museum of Palaontology webpage The Ordovician Period, the late Ordovician period witnessed     when Gondwana finally settled on the South Pole during the Upper Ordovician, massive glaciers formed, causing shallow seas to drain and sea levels to drop. This likely caused the mass extinctions that characterize the end of the Ordovician in which 60% of all marine invertebrate genera and 25% of all families went extinct.   NASA's webpage Explosions in Space May Have Initiated Ancient Extinction on Earth and the paper Did a gamma-ray burst initiate the late  Ordovician mass extinction?  suggest that a gamma ray burst may have initiated the cooling at approximately 440 million years ago.  What palaeoclimatological and geochemical evidence is there to support or refute the gamma ray burst cause of the late Ordovician mass extinction? "
1986,What is the difference between eluvium and alluvium?,"I was reading about kimberlite on Wikipedia and it mentioned eluvium. I've heard of alluvium, alluvial fans, alluvial deposits, etc. However, when I looked up eluvium, it sounded exactly like alluvium.  Indeed, looking at the Wikipedia articles, the definitions sound identical to my (expertly untrained) ears:     Alluvium: loose, unconsolidated (not cemented together into   a solid rock) soil or sediments, which has been eroded, reshaped   by water in some form, and redeposited in a non-marine setting.      Eluvium: geological deposits and soils that are derived by in   situ weathering or weathering plus gravitational movement or   accumulation.   So, both of these sound like soil and sediments, eroded and deposited. But obviously, they can't be the same thing.  What's the difference? How can I tell the difference if I see it ""in the wild""? "
1987,"What does the term ""Snow Interval"" mean?","When looking Weather Station readings from the National Weather Service website, what does the term ""Snow Interval (inches)"" actually mean?  6 hr and 24 hr readings are obvious, but I can't seem to connect the dots to ""Snow Interval"".  For an example, look here. "
1988,How global was the Bonarelli Oceanic Anoxic Event?,"The Bonarelli Event (a.k.a. OAE2) is a well-studied episode of ""worldwide"" oceanic anoxic event at the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary (ca. 94 Ma). It is characterized by the presence of organic-rich marine sediments and a [tex] shift. It is thought to have provoked a minor mass extinction and an increased atmospheric and oceanic temperature.    What evidence do we have that the anoxia was indeed global? Is there really no known ocean basin with sediments spanning this time interval that doesn't show those characteristic black shales? "
1989,"What, if any, paleoclimate data can be derived from igneous rocks?","Paleoclimate data often derives from sedimentary rocks. Metamorphic rocks can also contribute to paleoclimate information in a wide variety of ways.  What about igneous rocks? I guess that this can question be divided into two, about intrusive and extrusive rocks.  Extrusive rocks will have direct contact with the climate. They may exchange geochemical signals with the atmosphere or water they've erupted to. The cooling rate may be dependent on ambient temperature. Lava flows may fossilise the soil.  Intrusive rocks may be harder to interpret in that manner, if at all. The time resolution will obviously not be as good as dating individual beds from the lake floor, but I still think something can be gained from it. Maybe some igneous rocks can form only after a special sedimentary rock (derived from a specific climate) has been buried and remelted? What about isotopes? Sedimentay systems often fractionate various isotopic systems. Can this variability be later traced in igneous rocks? "
1990,How much of the underwater land masses within the arctic ocean is considered continental shelf?,"Right now I'm in the middle of writing my master thesis which is about modelling the ocean bottom pressure (obp) under areas with sea-ice coverage.  In most Oceanic General Circulation Model's (ogcm) obp is calculated prognostically, so it's basically just the sum of the sea-surface height [tex].  Recent studies show an increase in [tex] for regions with continental shelf within a reasonable timespan, so I was wondering how much of the arctic sea is above continental shelf? I know it is probably a lot, but are there any numbers, units of [tex]? "
1991,Could Earth have had a greater axial tilt?,"In thinking about the question, Why is earth's axis tilted?, and reading articles about Earth's axial tilt, I came across the website Snowball Earth which describes an alternate theory for global glaciation proposed by George Williams, from the University of Adelaide - what is proposed is that the Earth had a considerably higher axial obliquity (greater than 54°) up to about 600 million years ago.   Professor Williams proposes that this could be a mechanism for Snowball Earth events and cites the 'explosion' of life occurring after the axial tilt stabilised, thus causing the seasonal changes to become less severe with lower obliquity.  This is related to the question What sort of climate zones would be present if Earth was tilted like Uranus?, but asks the question if there is evidence that Earth did have a greater axial obliquity in the Proterozoic? "
1992,Pressure as a function of altitude,"My city's altitude is almost 950 meters, yet the weather stations provide a read of 102.14 kPa which is around 1 atm!   Shouldn't the pressure be a function of elevation?   I doubted that the data provided could be wrong, so I checked New York and got almost the very same results.  All reading are very close to 30 in.Hg (around 1 atm), yet the elevation varies from 0 to 550m. So, what is going on? "
1993,Glaciology: odd pattern of smooth and ribbed chunks of ice in Antartica,"At -69.184611, -68.124276 (just east of the Bugge Islands) there is a triangular ice shelf. On satellite images (as seen on Google/Bing maps) you can see it is riddled with --for lack of a clearer description-- chunks of ice that are either ribbed or smooth.    What are these chunks? And how are they formed?   I think both types of chunks might be created by the glaciers flowing toward the coast; as seen at -69.214204, -67.055682 (mostly ribbed):    and at -69.315307, -67.625613 (mostly smooth):    But how is there a difference between the two? "
1994,Why would magma have high amounts of nickel and chromium?,"I am doing a research project on Mount Lamington and through my research I have found that its magma has unusually high amounts of chronium and nickel. What would cause this to happen? Is there science behind it, or is it unexplained? "
1995,What are the high field strength and large ion lithophile (HFS or HFSE & LIL or LILE) elements?,There are two groups of elements that are frequently mentioned when discussing incompatible trace elements. They are the high field strength elements (HFS or HFSE) and the large ion lithophile elements (LIL or LILE).  What are these groups? How are they used in geochemistry and petrology? 
1996,Are average daily temperatures affected by DST?,"To calculate the average daily temperatures, do meteo professionals still use the Mannheim procedure with twice weighted measurement in the evening? (It could be obsolete by automated weather stations.)  If so, does DST affect the daily average by getting that measurement one hour earlier?  I'm not asking if that invalidates the results, just whether there is a measurable impact. "
1997,What is the physical meaning of the von Kármán constant?,"I know that the von Kármán constant ([tex]) is useful in turbulence modeling. Something that bothers me is my lack of understanding where [tex] comes from or the physical meaning behind it. If [tex] is mainly used as a proportionality in the log-wind profile, why is it within the formulation of the Monin-Obukhov length? What is the physical meaning behind [tex]? Is it a universal value (i.e. valid on extraterrestrial planets)? Why is [tex] considered important enough to be eponymous, while I see [tex] more often in formulations than [tex]? "
1998,Do humans cause a DST-related shift in average daily temperatures?,"Inspired by the title to this question, is there a shift in average daily temperatures caused by the DST change in human activities?    I can picture any number of mechanisms by which a shift could happen (eg. more cars driving past the thermometer at the time the measurements are taken), so has such a shift been found? "
1999,How would this experiment's different particle types produce atmospheric reflectivity?,"The MIT Technology Review news item Harvard Scientists Moving Ahead on Plans for Atmospheric Geoengineering Experiments discusses a proposed experiment to study in a carefully controlled way the reflectivity induced by various kinds of particles released into the stratosphere. The underlying idea being explored is that increased atmospheric reflectance could partially offset warming effects due to greenhouse gases.      Sometime next year, Harvard professors David Keith and Frank Keutsch hope to launch a high-altitude balloon, tethered to a gondola equipped with propellers and sensors, from a site in Tucson, Arizona. After initial engineering tests, the “StratoCruiser” would spray a fine mist of materials such as sulfur dioxide, alumina, or calcium carbonate into the stratosphere. The sensors would then measure the reflectivity of the particles, the degree to which they disperse or coalesce, and the way they interact with other compounds in the atmosphere.      The researchers first proposed these balloon experiments in a 2014 paper. But at a geoengineering conference in Washington, D.C., on Friday, Keith said they have begun engineering design work with Arizona test balloon company World View Enterprises. They’ve also started discussions about the appropriate governance structure for such an experiment, and they plan to set up an independent body to review their proposals.   This is an effort to explore how best to do a small, controlled test and how to establish proper guidelines. This type of atmospheric experiment is very different than the long established practice of cloud seeding for rain, so this thoughtful approach is taken.  A short review of the background concept and associated issues can be found in the video shown in this article, after the first minute or so it gets more serious.  While Alumina (Al2O3) and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) might be in the form of solid particles for such an experiment, and particle size can be engineered to various controlled size distributions ahead of time, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a gas at STP. At one atmosphere of pressure, it would become a liquid at about -10C. Would the plan be to spray or atomize liquid SO2 at the low ambient temperature at altitude?  If I understand correctly, SO2's mechanism would be to 'chemically scavenge'  water vapor from the air, forming reflective droplets of sulfuric acid. Would the alumina and calcium carbonate also seed water droplet formation as their reflective mechanism, or would only the particles themselves be reflective? "
2000,Lake Manasarovar v.s. Lake Rakshastal: fresh-water v.s. salt-water,"In Tibetan Plateau, about 4600m elevation, If Lake Manasarovar and Lake Rakshastal (""lake of the demon"" ) used to be the same lake, but due to the tectonic activity now they are separated to two by small hills, how come Lake Manasarovar is a fresh-water lake while Lake Rakshastal is a salt-water lake?  Before they were separated, was the overall old lake a fresh-water lake or a salt-water lake?    Is that just because Lake Rakshastal is in the Endorheic basin and Lake Manasarovar is not within the Endorheic basin?  Also, Lake Manasarovar overflows into lake Rakshastal which is a salt-water endorheic lake. These lakes used to be part of the Sutlej basin and were separated due to tectonic activity. "
2001,Was the filling of the Three Gorges Dam's impact on the Earth's rotation rate detectable?,"I'm a big fan of Vsauce and the video How Earth Moves is just one example of science related to the Earth available there (there's plenty more).  But the statement in this video starting at 01:39 strikes me as a little surprising.      You know how a figure skater, spinning in place, can slow down their (rotational) speed by extending their arms out; by moving some of their body mass away from the middle of their body? Well the same thing can happen to Earth.       The Three Gorges Dam did exactly what a figure skater does when they move their arms away from their center. It transferred thirty nine trillion kilograms of water one hundred and seventy five meters above sea level.       NASA calculated that that massive amount of water moved, caused Earth’s rotation to slow down, so that every day of your life since that dam was finished, has been longer by 0.06 microseconds. (emphasis added)   If I calculated correctly, that would be a ""slip"" of about 1 centimeter per year at the equator.  There are many causes of change to the Earth's distribution of mass, it's moment of inertia, and therefore the length of a day. Tidal forces from the Moon can contribute substantially to changes in Earth's rotation as well, and there could be short term geological effects as well.  Is this roughly 0.06 microsecond/day shift well below the ""noise"" level, where in this case I'm using ""noise"" to refer to effects that are smaller than the error that can be modeled? So for example exchanges between sea ice and sea water can be measured and modeled to some level of accuracy, and the Moon's tidal effects can be measured and modeled to great precision, so even if the Three Gorges Dam effect turns out to be small compared to those, it could still be detected as long as its effect is larger than the error that those effects can be accurately calculated.     below: Screen shots from the Vsauce YouTube video Water.

2002,What drove the Puy de Dôme volcano?,"The Puy de Dôme is an extinct volcano located pretty much smack in the middle of France. It last erupted some seven thousand years ago, which in geological terms is fairly recent - prehistoric humans might even have born witness to that eruption! What I'm wondering, though, is what drove this volcano, seeing as it is not located where tectonic plates meet? Was there a hot spot underneath central France that powered this volcano, and if so, could we witness future volcanic activity in this region?   "
2003,What is a breadboard (retrieval) algorithm in the context of geophysical satellite retrievals/remote sensing?,"In a recent met-jobs job posting (different version here) for a researcher with a background in climatology/meteorology/hydrology or environmental sciences, I saw the phrase breadboard retrieval algorithm (emphasis mine):     Sentinel-4 Retrieval: This Research Fellow Opportunity aims at   testing of breadboard retrieval algorithms. It is foreseen that   synthetic satellite data, and possibly also real measurements data from   airborne and satellite sensors will be used for this purpose. The   activity might also cover the exploration of alternative retrieval   approaches depending on the expertise and skills of the candidate.   What is a breadboard (retrieval) algorithm?  Google Search yields precious few results, mostly from ESA.  Another usage I found  Albert, Preusker, and Fischer (2012), ENVISAT workshop:     Originally, three breadboard algorithms were developed at the    Freie Universität Berlin, and the knowledge for their creation    was  transferred  to  ESA  /  Bomem  for  the  creation  of  the  ESA  algorithms.  In  the  meantime,  the  original  look-up  table approach was replaced for the breadboard algorithms by the use of artificial neural networks, which significantly eases the interpolation  of  the  simulation  results  onto  the  actual  viewing geometry.   Wikipedia tells me that, in electronics, a breadboard is a construction base for prototyping electronics.  The details of the article do not appear relevant for the algorithm usage, but it makes me guess that the meaning of breadboard is related to prototyping.  However, from context, it is clear that the job ad or the ENVISAT paper has nothing to do with electronics.  What does breadboard mean in the context of Earth observation retrieval algorithm development (which are the only contexts I could find)?  Is it simply a synonym for prototype, or does it have a different meaning? "
2004,How is geological time divided into units?,"Earth's history is divided into eons, which are divided into eras, which are divided into periods etc. Consecutive time units differ in their geology and/or fossil species. But what events are the basis for dividing time into discrete bands?  Roughly speaking (forgive the approximation), the Hadean is the time before life, the Archean is the subsequent time before eukaryotes, the Proterozoic is the subsequent time before complex multicellular animals, and the Phanerozoic is the time since then. Yes, I know that the actual definitions are in terms of either what can be seen in the rocks or a certain number of Mya; and yes, I know the Ediacaran biota technically lived in the late Proterozoic; but, if I've understood correctly, the reason we separate these four parts of Earth's history is because of such distinctions. We can similarly divide the Phanerozoic into three eras based on the P-T and K-Pg mass extinctions. (However, the other three of the Big Five extinction events define the start of new periods rather than eras.)  Is there a more thorough list than this of the qualitative events and processes in Earth's history that motivate the specific ways we've defined eons, eras and periods? I realise there may be some arbitrariness in it, e.g. the fact that some mass extinctions ""only"" start a new period instead of a new era. However, I'll be satisfied with a summary of the key moments on which these divisions are based. "
2005,"How much worse is the typical subway air, compared to street-level air pollution, in a typical city?","An excerpt from a section about the capital of Taiwan, in an article I wrote about Air pollution in Taiwan:     Further more, in greater Taipei, the outdoor PM2.5 concentration in   the air at ground-level up until the height of three-stories is around   ten to twenty times higher than the concentration in the air at the   height of four-story buildings and above. Levels of other hazardous   suspended particles such as silicon and iron were equally found to be   significantly lower when increasing altitude. Professor Chang-Fu Wu   (吳章甫) of the same university attributed this to dust and traffic   pollution.   So, my question is, can this increasing pollution, when decreasing in altitude, be extrapolated to a negative (as compared to street-level) altitude as well, in a typical city? Intuitively, I would assume that parkings (don't forget about traffic tunnels) can be pretty bad, when thinking of sub-terrain places in a typical city, with regards to pollution? But what I am really interested in here, is finding out more about the increase in pollution in subways (underground transportation), as compared to the street-level.  Is this problem perhaps being mitigated partly by sucking in air from a high altitude? (this shouldn't be seen as the question, it's just a remark)  P.S. (this is also not part of the question, so please don't close this question because I wrote a remark): I think finding higher ground is actually one of the best ways to escape from pollution in cities. But of course many cities will not give this advice to its citizens ... it might be unpopular and sound bad. "
2006,What kind of mine pit in northeastern Minnesota could make residue that turns water turn bright red?,"Reading about turbidity, I came across this web page with the frightening image shown below.  Text immediately before reads:     Reasons for Natural Variation      Algal turbidity varies seasonally and with depth in a complex manner as discussed previously in response to physical, chemical and biological changes in the lake. Inorganic and detrital particles from the watershed vary largely in response to hydrological events such as storms and snowmelt.   The figure caption reads:     Even relatively small amounts of wave action can erode exposed lakeshore sediments, in this case a mine pit lake from northeastern Minnesota. Can you guess what mineral was mined here?   Any ideas? I know there are bright red oxides of heavy metals like lead and mercury, certainly hope that's not the right answer.   "
2007,Why is the elevation of the Iberian Peninsula so high?,"The Iberian peninsula lies more than 600 m above sea level, on average, far above similar geological regions in western Europe. Even tectonically undeformed areas in the inner basins present a topography and a sedimentary infill sometimes higher than 1000 m. Why?  The elevation of continents is generally thought to be the result of the isostatic equilibrium (Archimedes balance) of the crust floating on a fluid mantle (Pratt and Airy models, late XIX century). The thicker the crust (which is less dense than the mantle), the higher topography. The denser the crust, the lower the topography.     Cartoon explaining the concept of isostatic equilibrium, according to which topography (h1) is sustained by a crustal root (b1) in the same way that the elevation of an iceberg reflects the size of its submerged part.  However, the crust of the Iberian Peninsula is about 30-33 km thick on average, similar to most of the western european platform, and nothing suggests that the Iberian crust has a lower density than other regions. Why then is the topography of Iberia higher than 600 m, in contrast with the near sea-level western Europe?  So, the underlying question is: why Iberia is 600m higher than the W European Platform, having its Moho (base of the crust) shallower?

2010,How far upstream would severe sea level rise (1m) noticably affect a large river?,"The projection for sea level rise due to global warming seem to hover about 1m by 2100, let's use this figure. How far upstream would this noticably affect a large river, e.g. the Rhine?  I think it is obvious that the Delta would be changed severely, while it is nigh impossible to say accuratly how exactly (I assume). Upstream, I think the following effects com into play: Less hydraulic head means less flow velocity, more sedimentation and a higher water level in the river bed (the river needs more cross section to achieve the same volume flow with less head). Are these assumptions correct so far?  Now the main question is how far upstream we would notice these changes in river behavior: Only at 1m above new sea level, or 10m, or 100m? Is this stronger determined by linear distance along the river, or by height above (new) sea level?   I prefer the Rhine as an example because it's the closest large river. If someone has a good answer for another large river I'm happy too. "
2011,What's the background concentration of trace gas/pollutants?,"I have read a paper discussing the concentration of air pollutants and their background concentration. In the paper Characterization of background air pollution exposure in urban environments using a metric based on Hidden Markov Models, Gómez-Losada et al wrote:     Urban area air pollution results from local air pollutants (from   different sources) and horizontal transport (background pollution).

2034,How does temperature impact the elevation distribution of orographic precipitation?,"Consider the case of two weather systems of different temperatures hitting the Andes Mountains from the west: After traveling a long distance over the Pacific ocean I would expect the air in both systems to be water saturated (i.e. Relative Humidity of 100%). However, the warmer system will be carrying more water and it will drop more water over the mountains (correct me if I got something wrong up to this point).  Now: Will the precipitation happen over the same elevation range? Or it will start to happen at lower/higher elevations?. Will the point of maximum precipitation stay the same? Or it will migrate upwards/downwards?  In case particular details are needed to answer this question, I'll describe now my main area of interest, that correspond to the Patagonian icefields, in the southern tip of South America between latitudes 46 to 51° South, roughly 500 km in the north-south direction. The area corresponds to the red box in the following world map:    The size of the area would put it in the the upper boundary of the mesoscale meteorology. However, topography gradients can vary quite a bit within the domain.  The following image show how the area looks from above, with a sat image on the left (where the ice extent is clear) and the topography on the right:    I have averaged the above elevation model in the north-south direction to obtain the average topography profile that Westerlies will face when hitting the mountains from the West (predominant winds come from between W and NW direction). This is how it looks:   The red lines (40 km apart) indicate roughly the currently ice covered longitudinal band. To the west of it, liquid precipitation dominates and there is no permanent ice cover. To the east, there is very little precipitation (dry pampas) and therefore no ice cover either.  The tree line in the area is usually between 400 and 600 m of elevation, represented by the green lines in the graph above.  The mean wind speed (from a 22 year average dataset) when the winds hit the land is between 7 and 8 m/s (25-29 km/h), as show by the shading and contours in this figure:   From the same 22-year average dataset. The typical 10-meter air temperature on the ocean just before hitting the land is between 6 and 7 °C. "

2036,Science behind the groundhog day myth,"The myth goes that if a groundhog sees his shadow on Feb 2, six more weeks of winter are yet to come, but if he doesn't, spring is just around the corner.  I am wondering if there is any science behind this myth, or perhaps an origin based on observations of actual weather patterns relating to the seasons.  Never mind the groundhog, I am thinking about sky conditions and the seasons.  Specifically, where I am in southern Ontario Canada, winter is usually at its coldest around the start of February. At this time of year we are often under an arctic high pressure ""dome""; skies are often clear. As the cold gives way to milder weather, we often end up under the jetstream, or at least it sweeps back and forth over us, delivering a lot of stormy, wintry weather, after which the jetstream at the boundary of the polar air mass eventually retreats north and spring arrives.  Is this an oversimplification? If not, could this sort of pattern be the origin of the myth: generally clear skies mean winter remains settled in, more unsettled weather means winter is about to give way to spring? "
2037,Safest spots when an asteroid hits?,"I am breaking this question and no longer making an effort in refining it with the exception of adding an associated link with the scenarios.   I always wondered if a devastating asteroid was predicted to impact the Earth where in the world would I have the highest chances of surviving the blast and short-term aftermath like seismic activity.   Which of these scenarios would have the best chances of survival?  Scenario 1. In the air of some type blimp or aircraft on the opposite side of the Earth? How is radiation dispersed by Earth&#39;s atmosphere?  Scenario 2. On or Underground in a cave? Can a shock wave be felt all the way around the Earth?  Scenario 3. In a submarine or capsule underwater? Does being under water provide any protection from a asteriod?  No point on Earth is truly safe without the known impact of the asteroid, but are there points on the Earth, even if you are on the other side, that you don't want to be like near fault lines?    "
2038,How to divide timeseries into normal periods in meteorology and climatology?,"When analyzing hydrological and climatological timeseries/observations it is a common practice to compare statistics made on normal periods. As WMO calls them: ""WMO Climatological Normals"".  These periods consist normally of 30 years of data. If you want to compare two normal periods with each other, let's say for example the periods 1951-1980 and 1981-2010.  Now if we take averages for all the seasons in the period 1951-1980, the last month is December in this period. If we regard December, January, and February as a complete season/winter, it means that we have an incomplete winter at the end of the period 1951-1980. Now taking December to represent a whole winter, would be inaccurate. The monthly variations of a climatic parameter can vary greatly, and multiplying the December values by 3 wouldn't yield a result based on actual observations. Also making December the whole winter of 1980, would underestimate the real winter average. This would in turn affect the overall 30-year mean, by lowering it and giving a wrong picture of the actual seasonal mean in that normal period.  Same goes for the beginning of the period 1981-2010, here we have January and February as an incomplete winter.  Now in order to get complete seasons in the intersections between the normal periods, wouldn't it be best to split the periods as follows: 1951-1980.11.30 and 1980.12.01-1990.  Also it would be best to cut out December completely at the end of the period: 1980.12.01-1990.  So that it becomes: 1980.12.01-1990.11.30.  The same goes for the last normal period: 1951-1980.11.30.  Where we would cut out January and February of 1951 so that we get: 1951.03.01-1980.11.30.  In this way we make sure we have complete seasons in both normal periods. So if we also do comparisons of monthly averages: JAN-FEB-MAR..., we would still split up the periods in the same manner, in order to use the exact same periods for exact comparison with the seasonal averages.  However when we have split up the periods as follows: 1951.03.01-1980.11.30 and 1980.12.01-1990.11.30. Is it still normal in academic papers to say that we are comparing the normal periods 1951-1980 and 1981-2010, when there is actually a small overlap in the last?  If this is not the normal procedure, what is the way to get around this? What do researchers normally do in this case?  In addition cutting of seasons/months in this manner yields an unequal number of months/seasons. The analysis might have data from a higher number of the month February compared to January. So the statistics from February are more reliable. Also a disadvantage of cutting out actual observation data, yields a loss of valuable observation data, which lowers the reliability of the statistics. "

2040,What is the origin of the ocean's salt?,"We know we cannot live without salt, but an investigation into the origins of ocean's salt leads one to believe that this issue is not fully resolved yet.  What geological phenomenon caused the earth to contain so much of salt? I see questions on SE that ask about the origin of earth's water.

2042,Is there conclusive evidence to refute an earlier oxygenation of the Earth's atmosphere?,"The Great Oxygenation Event (sometimes called the Great Oxidation Event (GOE), as in the journal Nature) occurred around 2.2 to 2.45 billion years ago (Frei et al. 2009). However, in the article A Whiff of Oxygen Before the Great Oxidation Event? (Anbar et al. 2007) and in The rise of atmospheric oxygen (Kump, 2008) where it is hypothesised that through chemostratigraphy, there was a small amount of oxygen before the GOE.    This is disputed in the later article Hematite replacement of iron-bearing precursor sediments in the 3.46-b.y.-old Marble Bar Chert, Pilbara craton, Australia (Rasmussen et al. 2014), who state that the hematite found in banded chert of Marble Bar (and environs) are mistakenly interpreted as being evidence of a oxygenated ocean.

2045,How are 'Morning Glory' clouds maintained?,"Reading the Physics.SE question What is the current physical theory of what causes the 'Morning Glory' roll cloud over Northern Australia? (pictured below):    Image source: NASA Astronomy picture of the day 24 August, 2009 of a Morning Glory roll-cloud over northern Australia. The origin and processes are quite well understood.  In the paper linked in the answer: Travelling Waves and Bores in the Lower Atmosphere: The 'Morning Glory' and Related Phenomena (Smith, 1988), the author expressed an uncertainty in his concluding remarks, which are the basis of this question:     The structure and origin of northeasterly   morning glories is relatively well-understood,   although questions remain about the precise   mechanisms inhibiting the leakage of wave   energy to the upper atmosphere, and the   transformation of disturbances over the land   during the day when the original wave-guide   is destroyed by convective mixing.    The italicised portion suggests that some mechanism(s) prevents these effects from occurring, resulting in the roll-cloud persisting.

2048,The significance of peak period in surface wave models,"The peak period or peak frequency is considered to be an important quantity in characterizing ocean surface waves, including wave models [e.g., 1]. But practically, why are we interested in modelling the peak period accurately?   I'm thinking the peak frequency directly translates to how fast the dominant waves propagate, and so is important to predicting when the waves will reach coastal locations of interest. Is this thinking correct? "
2049,Can soil color give accurate data about properties which affect it?,"I understand that soil color is affected by several factors some of which are (but not limited to):   organic matter content underlying parent material drainage and aeration   Soil color being an indirect measure of other important characteristics (Foth, 1990), I have been thinking about building an application that reads a soil color in terms of it's hue, value, and chroma as the munsell color system using openCV color detection techniques.  After reading this data, the application should be able to interpret it to give meaningful information about the soil. This can be organic matter content, dominant minerals, drainage etc.  My questions now    What information be accurately be obtained from soil color?  Is this application by any means feasible? Do technologies exist that achieve the same? (using computer vision)   Reference Foth D. (1990). Fundamentals of soil science J Willey. "

2052,Is there a time difference between two points at the same longitude but at different latitudes?,"Assume we have two cities A and B both at the same longitude (say [tex] E) but at different latitudes say [tex]N and [tex] N. Can we get a time difference between these two cities. I raised this question because the shape of the Earth is oblate spheroid,i.e., bulges out at the equator and constricts at the poles. In 24 hours the Earth rotates once. But the circle at the equator traversed by the sun is not equal to the high latitudes because of the shape of the Earth. This difference in circle traversed by the sun makes a difference in time between the two latitudes. Am I wrong to put it that way?   To elaborate a little bit, one day is 24 hours and is the period of time during which the Earth completes one rotation with respect to the Sun. We call it a solar day. One complete rotation around the equator gives big circle (longer circumference) and around the higher latitudes makes small circle (smaller circumference). So the time it takes to complete one complete circle around the equator is not equal to the time it takes in higher latitudes. Or are they equal? "
2053,Help interpreting a wind rose diagram,  Can someone comment on technical explanation of the wind rose attached?   I can understand the wind is blowing between WNW &amp; SSW with speed of 7-11 km/h. For frequency of 11-16 km/h its blowing from SW &amp; SSW. For frequency of 4-7 km/h its blowing between WNW &amp; ESE?  Is this all or some info I am missing? What do the spikes mean? 
2054,Is there a differential angular rotation on Earth?,"I asked a question about solar day difference between two latitudes on the same longitude here on the Earth surface. The answer was clear due to constant angular rotation time is the same. Tangential speed is different in the two points though. Then I came up with another question here that was the reason for my previous question. Gaseous bodies like the sun have different angular rotations from the equator to the poles. Others may still argue that the Earth is rocky and solid but we have a fluid atmosphere  that can have differential rotational impact on Earth's rotation. So, my question is anyone aware of the differential angular rotation on Earth as a result of solid earth and fluid atmosphere interaction? If so, what is its latitudinal gradient?  "
2055,Why do we say Earth rotates from west to east?,"It is said that Earth rotates from west to east. I take this as      Earth's western hemisphere moves towards the Eastern hemisphere when seen from the frame of reference of pole star.    Now I can also say that,     Earth's Eastern hemisphere moves towards the western hemisphere when seen from the frame of reference of pole star   So can't I say then Earth rotates from east to west?  When we say Earth rotates from west to east we don't say a point on earth moves from its west to its east. We just say Earth moves from west to East. Now what is west and East for Earth? My knee-jerk is that Earth's west means the western hemisphere. Then it is not wrong to say Earth moves from East to west as the Eastern hemisphere always move towards the western hemisphere.  P.S: The question was originally asked at [website]"
2056,"What's the minimum number of days needed for reporting a ""monthly average"" of daily satellite retrievals?","NASA's Earth Observing System produces many maps of air quality and land-surface variables, from instruments like MODIS, AIRS, OMI, VIIRS, etc.  Both NASA and the scientific community produce maps of the retrieved data on a daily basis, but there are often gaps (e.g.  no data) for many locations because of clouds, satellite coverage, or other limitations.  Daily retrievals are often averaged by month or season so that a complete global map (or sub-region) can be made and then presented to the public and put into publications.  Some locations have very few retrievals available for a monthly average (e.g. if there is a predominant cloud mass that sticks around for a long time).  So, researchers must choose some threshold where no data is reported.  As a graduate student, I would report the average if I had at least 4 days in the month, which seemed reasonable to me at the time for some reason.  However, the number of available data points for a monthly average fluctuates so much, that the minimum number of members in the monthly average that I chose affected my temporal trendlines.    What's the minimum number of days needed for satellite-derived maps of monthly averages?  I can't call 3 days of data a ""monthly average"" in good faith, but is 4 days enough?  For the purposes of this question, assume there is only one possible data retrieval per day per geo-location. "

2058,Does natural plant decomposition release more greenhouse gases than burning,"I understand that all plant matter releases CO2 as it decomposes and also when it burns in, for example, a forest fire. My assumption, upon which this question is based, is that the CO2 release is the same in each case.  My main question is, what drives the production of all greenhouse gases in those two situations, e.g. methane in decomposition, NOx in combustion to help determine which is worse in terms of the total radiative effects of the greenhouse gases?   I appreciate the answer is likely to vary according to type of plant matter, the degree of anaerobic decomposition and the intensity of fire. Sub question: Are there any benchmarks that indicate which is worse in some specific situation or controlled trial? "
2059,What are the natural causes for methane formation?,Natural gas is mostly made of methane ([tex]). Methane can be produced as a result of microbes eating organic matter.

2060,What is the age of the earth's oil?,Oil in the ground is found under the oceans and seas. It is made of dead fish. But from what period are those fish? I heard they are about 119 million years old. But fish exist much longer than that. So is it clear how old our oil is? 
2061,Why are oceans so deep?,"Some areas of oceans are about 11 km deep. Is it because continental plates were moving away because of troughs in the middle from where new rock is formed? If so, why did it become deep? If not, what are other reasons? "
2062,Why is at high altitude more light from oxygen in the auroras while it is heavier than nitrogen?,"In an other recent question is said that because of diffusion and thermal causes oxygen and nitrogen are mixed. Nevertheless oxygen is a little bit heavier than oxygen so it should be lower in the atmosphere.  In an other question I read:  ""This is why there is a color differential with altitude; at high altitude oxygen red dominates, then oxygen green and nitrogen blue/red, then finally nitrogen blue/red when collisions prevent oxygen from emitting anything.""  What causes the beautiful Auroras on the north and south magnetic poles?  So my question is why is at high altitude more aurora from oxygen while concerning diffusing it shouldn't make a difference and because of oxygen is heavier it should be lower.   But in case of an aurora it is higher, so why is that? What makes all the differences in auroras? "
2063,Guidelines for locations of NTU markings on a turbidity tube,"One way to estimate the turbidity of water while in the field is to use a  turbidity tube. So far I've found two sources where I can get an idea of the locations of NTU markings along the tube.  The PDF file The Turbidity Tube: Simple and Accurate Measurement of Turbidity in the Field - originally by Elizabeth Myre &amp; Ryan Shaw at Michigan Tech is a nice introduction to the concept, outlines how to build a turbidity tube from simple materials and use it, and offers a table of numbers that comes with the following description:     (UW Extension, 2003). Several tables of slightly different conversions are currently in use. This table was chosen from among the alternatives because of the reliability of the source and because the values were more conservative than in other tables.    Select Scientific in Australia sells a professional two piece turbidity tube  and one image (from here) includes a photo with a length scale so that marking locations can be estimated.  I've made a rough plot of both below, and they are significantly different. That's not too surprising, as there is difference in construction as well as difference in opinions and between sources.  Are there any further guidelines out there that I've missed? Any further advice before I make one and give it a try? Of course I'll include a centimeter scale so that it can be converted later, but sooner or later I'll need to settle down and choose a conversion.  note: I am most interested in the higher turbidity end of the scale, say above 50 NTU. This is not traditionally the turbidity tube's ""best end"", but it's where the two sources I've found diverge the most.      above: plot of some estimates for position of NTU markings on a turbidity tube as a function of distance from the bottom in centimeters. The solid line is tabulated data in the Michigan Tech PDF, the dashed line is estimated from the Select Scientific photo. Curves are from the equations below. Since they are power-law, they show as straight lines on the log-log plot on the right.  [tex]  [tex] "
2064,"What's up with the ""jelly sandwich"" analogy of the lithosphere, asthenosphere and mesosphere?","Here's what I know:   The lithosphere is hard because it is cold and low-pressure.  The asthenosphere is more deformable because of higher temperatures and pressures.  The mesosphere is below the asthenosphere and presumably experiences higher temperatures and pressures than the asthenosphere.    Why does the asthenosphere act like a lubricant for tectonic plates to slide over? Why is the mesosphere more viscous than the asthenosphere?   What's causing the differences in the viscosity between these regions, and is there more than viscosity going on? "
2065,"How is water surrounding an area of pollution, able to 'trap' that pollution, or otherwise deteriorate air quality?","An article seems to assert that air pollution can be held in place (or 'trapped') by high mountains surrounding the area of air pollution.  This seems very understandable. But the same article seems to assert that this is the case for water (read: lakes, seas, et cetera) as well?   To clarify, I will quote the relevant passage:     Taiwan's topography is one cause of its air pollution problem. Taipei,   the capital and largest city, is effectively in a ""bowl"" ringed by   mountains, while other industrial centers are along the northern and   western coasts of the island, surrounded by water and high mountains.   My question is: how is water surrounding an area of pollution, able to 'trap' that pollution, or otherwise deteriorate air quality?  Please provide at least one relevant source, when answering this question. Your knowledge would be much appreciated. "

I've been looking at an buying a condo in Cocoa Beach because of it’s proximity to Orlando and Cocoa’s decent but consistent surf break.   What concerns me is the perchlorate from all the rockets that launch from the Kennedy Space Center and also the jet fuel(kerosene) from Patrick Air Force Base.   Do you think that’s a legitimate health concern? I'm curious because some of the properties seem ""inexpensive"".  EDIT: I'm curious about the safety of surfing.  My guess is it's fine, the ocean is massive; I don't swallow that much water surfing, but always some.  It does seem there are some contaminants in the water. It'd be a bummer to get Thyroid cancer or something like that. I linked to a book mentioning it below.  [website]"
2067,How to compare the oil production in barrel vs production in tons,"I hope this is the right SE site...I was unsure if to post here or on Physics, but I see there are quite many questions about oil here. So, my question is the following: I would like to compare the huge oil production of Texas, vs the minuscule (in comparison) oil production of a small region in Europe. I know it's silly, but some people are making this comparison and I want to show it's meaningless with actual numbers. Texas oil production is easy to find:  [website]1 131 557 443 barrels for 2016: I'm a little bit surprised they can pin it down to the single barrel (I guess much more than a barrel is lost in spillage, contamination, etc.), but oh, well.   The European region I'm considering has a production of about 3.75 million tons of oil. So, how do I compare barrels (a unit of volume) to tons (a unit of mass)? For a rough number, I thought oil must be lighter than water, since it floats on it, so if I consider water density, I'll get an upper bound. Now, since an oil barrel seems to correspond to 159 liters according to Wikipedia, I would get an upper bound of  [tex]  About 180 million tons of oil (thus the comparison is ridiculous, as I suspected). But oil density is less than water, and it's actually very dependent on the type of oil being extracted, so to get a lower bound I will consider a density of [tex] which I think is fairly low for Texas oil (correct me if I'm wrong). So I get about 142 million tons of oil, and this is still nearly two orders of magnitude larger than 3.75 million tons of oil. Is this correct? Would it be possible to get sharper estimates, or is this the best one could hope to get, given all the uncertainties in this calculation? "
2068,Pigments from earth,"We're about to do lime wash on one of our heritage buildings. We decided to use ochre as pigment because it comes from earth. My boss says with any pigment that comes from earth, we don't need to worry about discoloration in lime mortar, which is high in pH value. But some of our guys are using laterite powder for brick repairs and I wonder if it is a good choice. Would it discolor in lime mortar? How would it react? Please, someone answer me!    Maybe I need to mention more info in my question. I'm from myanmar and we've got a lot of sunshine and a lot of rain too during moonsoon season. We're not doing new buildings, just repairing a historic building built around 1900. This building is basically abandoned for decades, and it's quite big. A lot of bricks need to be replaced, but in some areas we intend to use lime mortar with brick dust to imitate a brick rather than raking out and replacing with a new one. But we're not achieving the same color as the original brick but when we add laterite powder to lime mortar, color is satisfactory. Our only concern is that we don't want the repaired areas faded away after three or four years.  "
2069,Is winter hotter at the Equator?,"I live in the Northern Emisphere. One of the things I have been taught when I was in high school is that winter is colder than summer because in that season we're at an unfavorable angle and nights last longer than days, despite Earth being closer to the Sun during winter months.  Does this really mean that on the Equator, where day and night are of the same length all year long, winter is the hottest season*?  Does this also mean that Winters in the Southern hemisphere are colder than our Summers and their Winters are hotter than or Summers (or that they would be if not for the Gulf Stream, air currents and other temperature-changing effects)?    *I can think of a different reason that would make equinoxes hotter (more sunrays per surface area when the sun hits from above all day long) but I have no idea of which effect would be greater.

2070,"Are ""monoliths"" giant, isolated rocks sitting in dirt, or are they continuous with bedrock","I am at a loss for the precise, correct terminology, but I have read in Wikipedia that Uluru is not a monolith, but Savandurga is, and that I probably shouldn't be using the word monolith to begin with, but instead use inselberg.  I was once told that Uluru is a giant rock, just sitting in the soil. I think this is probably impossible and that it is part of the underlying bedrock of the area, but is that the case for all/most inselbergs?

2071,How does the existence of a Greenhouse Gas Effect (GHE) in the atmosphere affect the tropospheric lapse rate?,"I am restricting my consideration, for the moment, to just the troposphere. With regard to our understanding of the GHE do we predict that an increased GHE due to increasing CO2/Water/Methane will change the lapse rate postively or negatively? The dry adiabatic lapse rate (DALR), according to my old text books, is easily calculated from the formulae -g/c, where g is the acceleration due to gravity and c is the specific heat capacity of the atmosphere. This is supposed to be a general formulae that can be applied to any planet with a solid surface and a gaseous atmosphere. So for earth is the formulae now -g/c + (GHE) or is it -g/c - (GHE)? The bracketed GHE term being specific to the atmosphere of a specific composition, e.g. including 400ppm CO2.  The second part of the question then , after we have the correct sign, is how is the term (GHE) expected to vary as the CO2 (or other greenhouse gas) concentrations vary?  "

2075,Do U & V vectors differ depending on GRIB layers (wind vs current)?,"Essentially I would like to know how current direction ""DIR C"" and wind direction ""WDIR"" for gribs is computed.  I'm trying to compute some angles from u and v vectors in grib files. My understanding from this link is that:  Positive U component represents wind blowing to (not from) the East (90 degrees). And positive V component is wind to (not from) the North (0 degrees). Is this correct?  In grib files values UGRD &amp; VGRD are stored this way. How does this apply to currents like UOGRD and VOGRD? Is the same convention used as for UGRD and VGRD?  For example, assuming the vectors are defined the same (UGRD and UOGRD) I'm calculating current headings like this from the GRIB data:  [tex]u, $v) * 180 / pi()); if ($angle &lt; 0) {     [tex]angle; }   And wind like this:  [tex]u, -1*$v) * 180 / pi()); if ($angle &lt; 0) {     [tex]angle; }   The current output looks like this (using u &amp; v values shown):  u=1  v=1 45° NE u=-1 v=1 315° NW u=1 v=-1 135° SE u=-1 v=-1 225° SW   And wind looks like with the vector being ""from"" not to:  u=1 v=1 225° SW u=-1 v=1 135° SE u=1 v=-1 315° NW u=-1 v=-1 45° NE   Does this look correct?

They extract a fractional cloud number, shown in percentage.  From the ERDDAP portal to the GFS model (NCEP_Global_Best), the only relevant data regarding clouds is:   dlwrfsfc (net downward longwave radiation flux, [tex])  dswrfsfc (net downward shortwave radiation flux, [tex])    Is there a way to estimate fractional cloud coverage from these two parameters or does GFS offer some other product for global cloud coverage?  Is there a GRIB or other type of portal with an API to access cloud coverage estimates?    Edit:  I tried openDap as suggested, but the help pages are not clear.  And I don't understand the ranges on the time specifications. Let's say I want to look at 22N, 155W (just 1 point) and look at a 24-hour time frame. I tried this.  Lat 88, lon 820, time 301950-301970 (I just assumed, probably incorrectly that it ends at the current offset from  2015-01-15T00:00:00Z).  But the results are not what I would expect.    Any help would be appreciated. "
2077,Fossil or Pseudofossil?,"I found these rocks in the Oregon Coast Range many years ago and have always wondered whether the interesting image was a pseudofossil or an actual fossil.  If it's a pseudofossil, any ideas on how it would form? If it's a fossil, what on earth is it? The image measures about 37 mm at its widest point.  Thanks for any insight you can provide!    "
2078,What is the impact of climate change on tropospheric ozone production and vice versa?,"I know ground ozone reduce the photosynthesis rate of vegetation and could lead to increase respiration and hence more CO2 in the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. But what is the opposite? How is climate change affect the production of ozone? Higher temperature means higher ozone production? but also more water vapour in the atmosphere which counteract it?   "
2079,How can ice crystals with adsorbed chlorine remain over the south pole all winter?,"I just saw the Periodic Video Ozone on Bondi Beach - Periodic Table of Videos where the impact of Chlorine from CFCs on Ozone is discussed. At around 04:00 or so, the adsorption of chlorine on to very small atmospheric ice crystals above the poles, especially the south pole is described. The chlorine is ""stored"" until hemispheric spring, when the sun releases the chlorine from the ice, so its impact on ozone spikes.  My main question is about the ice crystals. What keeps them suspended in the atmosphere for months? Why don't they fall, or participate in precipitation? Are they ""hovering"" over the pole for the whole winter? How?  Note: The video then goes on to discuss a ""recent paper"" (as of 2011) where the UV light reaching nearer the surface enabled by the ozone ""hole"" goes on to affect rainfall patterns over Australia. Is this now believed to be significant? "
2080,Current temperature increase VS decrease during the little ice age,"Looking at the following temperature reconstructions i have two questions (source: wikipedia):       Why is the y-axis centered around -0.2 °C? Why are the consequences of the current temperature increase by +0.4 °C considered so ""catastrophic"" when the -0.8 °C during the little ice age  was not? Maybe i am mistaken but looking at the chart the current +0.4 °C doesn't seem so much more varying from the median that the -0.8 °C do.   "
2081,How to find Cloud cover data in GFS grib models,"I've been looking for the cloud cover estimates provided in the NOAA GFS models.  This page discusses all their weather products and one of the few I find that includes cloud cover data ""Total Cloud Cover [%]"" (variable TCDC) is gfs.t00z.pgrb2.0p25.f006 which you can find in its product description.  Upon extracting that file using the grib filter tool generated URL selecting for the proper layers and variables, this data appears to be just initial values (1 for cloud cover) and 9999 for many of the other values.  I read a lot of gfs grib &amp; cloud details here that suggest the .fxxx files like ""gfs.t00z.pgrb2.0p25.f006"" are      The cloud % field is probably output from some of the model physics (microphysics I guess) routines, which may not be setup to write out the fields after the very first model time step (the f00 files denote fields after the first model time step, not the actual analysis/initial condition).  We do in fact initialize the cloud condensate field, however   My question is where are the TCDC cloud data numbers in the GFS grib models?  They don't seem to be in the analysis files (gfs.t00z.pgrb2.0p25.anl) or the FH000 file.  Note:  I'm using grib_api tools to read these fields (grib_ls and grib_get).  I've used them successfully for currents and winds, but I can't seem to find the right GFS data for TCDC cloud cover.    EDIT:  I've been testing the full files from [website]the gfs.t12z.pgrb2.0p25.anl file didn't contain cloud data, so I tried one of the .fxxx files (gfs.t12z.pgrb2.1p00.f384).  There appeared to be fields set, but they were at initial values according to grib_ls tool.  Here's a snippet:   [3036] =&gt; 260130      Total ozone  9999 [3037] =&gt; 228164      Total Cloud Cover  9999 [3038] =&gt; 228164      Total Cloud Cover  9999 [3039] =&gt; 228164      Total Cloud Cover  9999 [3040] =&gt; 228164      Total Cloud Cover  9999 [3041] =&gt; 54          Pressure    9999 [3042] =&gt; 54          Pressure    1 [3043] =&gt; 54          Pressure    9999 [3044] =&gt; 54          Pressure    1 [3045] =&gt; 54          Pressure    9999 [3046] =&gt; 54          Pressure    1 [3047] =&gt; 54          Pressure    9999 [3048] =&gt; 54          Pressure    1 [3049] =&gt; 130         Temperature  1 [3050] =&gt; 130         Temperature  9999 [3051] =&gt; 130         Temperature  1 [3052] =&gt; 228164      Total Cloud Cover  1 [3053] =&gt; 228164      Total Cloud Cover  1    I'm using a little older version of grib_api on my server: 1.10.0  I get a little different response with grib_api 1.14.4:     3054        Precipitable water  34.4   260102      Cloud water  0   157         Relative humidity  39   260130      Total ozone  283.1   228164      Total Cloud Cover  4   228164      Total Cloud Cover  0   228164      Total Cloud Cover  5   228164      Total Cloud Cover  9   54          Pressure    9999   54          Pressure    90670.4   54          Pressure    9999   54          Pressure    13200.4   54          Pressure    9999   54          Pressure    88060   54          Pressure    9999   54          Pressure    11470.4   130         Temperature  288.9   130         Temperature  9999   130         Temperature  198.2   228164      Total Cloud Cover  0   228164      Total Cloud Cover  2   But it still seems a bit odd for the results.

2082,When do winds gets stronger?,Do winds on Earth always gets stronger when the temperature is higher or are winds only increasing when the temperature gets higher.  So the difference is that when temperatures áre higher (with a constant level) that there is less difference in temperatures but in case of gétting a higher temperature the differences of temperatures are higher and that causes stronger winds?  So is a high temperature the most important factor or the increase of the temperature? 
2083,Identifying different parts of a cave,"Hopefully this is on topic here - I'm wondering if there are names for the different ""biomes"" that are present within a cave.   Some of these ""biomes"" include:   Open (no) ceiling, sunlit, potentially with trees growing (grotto?) Dark, little to no natural light (""standard"" cave) Containing an underground stream or lake, potentially supporting aquatic life   I know little about caves, but they (can) have diverse areas that give rise to all sorts of interesting creatures. Are there any specific names given to the different parts of a cave?  Please let me know if I can edit this question to make it clearer or more on-topic. "
2084,How much warming there was over time for a specific month?,"I'm calculating warming trends in specific places and periods of time, that are related to the time a migratory bird spends in a stopover. But using different methods I got different results and I'm trying to figure out which is the most accurate. I know it will depend on location, so my sites are Southeast Canada and the Arctic. How much warming is possible in 40 years for example in a period covering only one month in spring, like May? What would be a good value to compare my results? spring temperature warming trend?  There's a lot of fluctuation in temperatures, so when averaging them I get no changes, including in the Arctic, which cannot be true. I looked at trends of the maximum temperatures and they are increasing, also investigated the anomalies, but I would like to have an advice. "
2085,How to relate RCM/GCM RCP climate projections to observational data for use in a hydrologic model,"As a (smaller) part of my research, I want to look at climate projection data and how that might influence the hydrology within a study catchment in Rajasthan, India. For ""the present day"" climate, I run a simple soil moisture model that gives an estimate of the groundwater recharge.  I aquired MPI-ESM data for the pathways RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 downscaled as part of the CORDEX project for the years 2006-2100. The annual means (or sums, in case of precipitation) are shown below for r1i1p1.   However, the mean annual observational values for the last few decades are:  variable,               value u2_m_per_s              2.28 rh_mean                 46.88 actual_sunshine_hrs_day 7.17 tmean_degree            25.05 precipitation_mm        568   Some of the variables, such as windspeed, are not yet adjusted to the same reference height, however the most striking deviation is the predicted precipitation, which even for the ""present"" is far off.  What simple possibilities are there to transform the RCP data to ""fit"" the observational data in the beginning of the projections? As mentioned, this is a side part and there are no resources for an elaborate approach. Would it be possible to normalize the RCP timeseries with its own ""beginning"", say the mean of the variables of the first twenty years, and then multiply it with the observational values above? That way I would get move the beginning of the time series closer to the observations while still maintaining the (relative) trend in the data.  Normalized to the mean 2006-2020 values:    Rescaled with the observational data:    How would one then continue? I'm aware that the signal is only within the trend, so would I look at two years, e.g. 2050 and 2080, that both are represented as the mean values of the year +- 15 years, similar to the data provided by WorldClim? Also, would I calculate the means time-step wise?  "
2086,How would I use data to find specific humidity and mixing ratio?,"I keep reviewing this table to compare and contrast my results:    The parcel of air is at 35°C and a relative humidity of 43%.  I used this online calculator and it stated that with these two factors it would be 16.01 g/kg. Is this correct? What is the formula for this answer?  If that is right how would one use that information in order to find the specific humidity? If the atmospheric pressure is at 1000 mb, what would its mixing ratio be? "
2087,What are the sunniest places on Earth? (including oceans),"This question did arise when thinking on offshore solar power plants, what's their potential, and how efficient would they be compared with land based counterparts.  Recently, it is becoming more common to hear about offshore floating power plants, like this one, this one or this one.  But when it comes to big projects, usually solar power plants are planned in very sunny places, like the Arizona desert to maximize output the power.  And when looking for the sunniest places on Earth, all the lists and ranks I've found only include land areas. All the above had motivated the following related questions:   Is it true that no place in the surface of oceans gets as much solar energy as a sunny place on land? Are the oceans always cloudy? Or cloudier than land? How much of the solar energy reaching Earth's surface fall on land and how much on the oceans?  "
2088,Confused about whether physical impact is 'erosion',"When I dropped a stone or a crystal onto the floor, can it be considered as erosion? What is the difference between rocks breaking due to natural disturbances vs human action?  Here is the stone/crystal I dropped     "
2089,Is there less precipitation (rain/snow) in cold weather than in warm weather?,"To me it seems that there is a lot less precipitation when temperatures go below -5°C (23°F).  Is there any evidence for that? Could this be a local phenomenon (I live in Germany)? What could be the cause for this?  I tried searching for charts that show precipitation over temperature, but all I could find were charts that showed precipitation over months of year which is not quite the same. "
2090,Does being in the air provide any protection from an asteroid?,"How does radiation and shock waves from a radioactive asteroid or atomic explosion disperse throughout Earth's atmosphere?  Are there specific areas on Earth that are less likely to receive the shock wave or radiation by being on the other side of the Earth and/or land or wind characteristics like being in a deep valley?   I'm trying to go with the worst case survivable scenario if the asteroid hit with the possibility of hitting a nuclear reactor, arsenal or deposit of uranium.    Related:     This is from a broad question that I am breaking up in 3 questions. Feel free to edit.   Which of these scenarios would have a smaller chance of being struck?   In the air of some type blimp or aircraft on the opposite side of the Earth?   Does being under water provide any protection from a asteroid? "
2091,Can a shock wave travel around the Earth's curvature?,Can an explosion be felt in the ground on the opposite side of the Earth like from an asteroid? Would planes in the air on that side of the Earth be able to survive? Does the shock waive follow the ground or will the curvature of the Earth limit the shock wave?     Related:     This is from a broad question that I am breaking up in 3 questions. Feel free to edit.   Scenario 2. On or Underground in a cave? 
2092,Does being under water provide any protection from a asteroid?,Does being under or on water provide any protection from an asteroid hitting the opposite side of the Earth over being in or on land or in air? Why?   Will the shock wave follow the curvature of the Earth through the oceans?  I'm trying to go with the worst case survivable scenario.  Related:     This is from a broad question that I am breaking up in 3 questions. Feel free to edit.   Scenario 3. In a submarine or capsule underwater?  Does being in the air provide any protection from an asteroid? 
2093,If Earth had rings would gravity exerted by Earth decrease?,"If Earth had enough mass in its own rings, more than the weight of Earth:    What could it decrease the gravity to? Would the atmosphere have more depth or be thinner? What would the weather be like?     [website]"
2094,What is the definition of a continent?,"Is there a scientific definition of a continent? Is there an academic reference for such a definition? There's a tendency to correlate with tectonic plates, but of course lots of plates don't have continents.  I keep running across ""by convention"" and ""landmass"" but I don't see anything really definitive, or anything academic. I've got the whole Pangaea/Gondwana/craton/shield/continental crust/oceanic crust/plate tectonics fine, but this simple question is pretty vague.  "
2095,Where did the energy released due to gravitational binding energy of the Earth go?,"The gravitational binding energy of the Earth is [tex], so the same amount of energy must have been released during the Earth's history.   According to this and this, the current internal energy of the Earth is ~ [tex], and according to this source, the amount of heat loss due to outward radiation by the Earth during the entire lifetime of the planet is about [tex].   So, by adding those two numbers we get the Earth internal energy + energy radiated = ~ [tex], which is an order of magnitude less than what we should expect.  We are also ignoring the fact that 50-90% of the current internal energy of the Earth is due to radioactive decay. So where did the rest of the energy go ? "
2096,How does anthropogenic heating affect global warming?,"Anthropogenic-sourced greenhouse gases are commonly cited as the main source for human-caused climate change. However, something that I never see discussed is the actual heat produced by human activities. It could be that it's negligible, but I'm still curious to see quantitative data.  For example, a running engine in a vehicle produces [tex] due to fuel combustion, but the engine also produces heat. What about heat produced from ovens, fireplaces, incandescent lighting, etc.? Ignoring the carbon footprint of such activities, can the heat alone be sufficient to affect the atmosphere on a global scale? "
2097,"Why is the concept of ""mass extinction"" a relatively recent development in geology?","The concept of ""mass extinctions"", with its catastrophic connotations, is a relatively recent development in the geological sciences. It evolved in the early 1980s, driven by two landmark publications in the journal Science:   Alvarez et al. (1980) Extraterrestrial Cause for the Cretaceous-Tertiary Extinction: The proposal that a asteroid or another large impactor caused the K-T K-Pg mass extinction, Raup &amp; Sepkoski (1982) Mass Extinctions in the Marine Fossil Record: Suggesting the ""Big Five"" mass extinctions.   Why did this idea develop only in the 1980s? It was known since the 19th century that extinctions had occurred. Even the stratigraphic time is divided into units constrained by different fauna found in the fossil records. What was it that made the change from a ""gradualist"" perspective of things to the ""catastrophic"" point of view? "
2098,Why did people draw so many continuous squares in the sand on the beach at Cape Juby?,"At Cape Juby, Morocco, we can see with Google Maps a rectangle of 3 km long, in which there is hundreds of little squares. What method was used to draw these squares on the sand? More importantly, why are these square drawn?   "
2099,Why is ocean surface velocity around 3% of wind velocity?,"Many introductory level textbooks suggest that, as a rule of thumb, the velocity of the ocean surface is around 3% the wind velocity at 10 meters above the sea surface.   For instance, Ocean Circulation by the Open University Press, page 39:      Another useful empirical observation is that the surface current speed is typically 3% of the wind speed, so that a 10 m/s wind might be expected to give rise to a surface current of about 0.3 m/s   What are the mechanisms that result in this ratio? How universal is this relationship? "
2100,Is the color of the sky the same everywhere on earth?,"Is the color of the sky at noon (local time) in, say, NY, Buenos Aires, London, Nairobi, Sydney, New Delhi and Tokyo the same? I choose the specific time of noon to exclude the twilight colors of the sky and I choose cities that aren't above the northern or southern pole to make it easier.  Also can the color of the sky be the same or not depending of the season? For instance, the color of the sky of Buenos Aires on January 1st would be the color of the sky in NY on June 1st.  Also, is the color of the sky of one region on earth the same all year round and all day long, once again, without taking in account twilight? "
2101,What do the researchers in Antarctica wear if they must go outside during winter?,"The Vostok station can observe temperatures as low -90 C during winter.  Human skin gets frozen wounds on the spot on direct contact with such cold air and precautions must be made to avoid open exposed skin during outdoor operations at these temperatures.  I don't thing going outside is possible, but also I think that they must have some solution in case going outside can't be avoided. Especially because the possible problems of heating and similar infrastructure are in their case life-threating consequences.  What do they wear? I think something similar to a space suit, but instead of compression it contains heated internal atmosphere, should work. Do they have something like this? "
2102,What are the non-anthropogenic causes of The Netherlands' low elevation?,"A large area of The Netherlands is below sea level. There are two non-anthropogenic reasons that I can think of:   Compaction of delta sediments that lie below the country, A side effect of the isostatic rebound after the deglaciation of Scandinavia.   Are there any other reasons? What are the relative proportions in magnitude of these factors? "
2103,What does geochemical data tell us about Earth's earliest palaeoclimatic conditions?,"Given that the age of the oldest zircon samples are about 4.4 billion years old, and meteorites and other extraterrestrial samples can also give us some indication about the Earth's composition into the Hadean era (source: Zircon Chronology: Dating the Oldest Material on Earth.  Many resources refer to the earliest atmosphere as being (for example):     As a result of the high temperatures at the center of the Earth, and due to volcanic activity, the crust emitted halogen gasses, ammonia, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, and other gasses. In the following 100 million years, these gasses accumulated to form the primordial atmosphere.  This atmosphere was quite similar to the atmosphere of Titan, one of the larger moons of Saturn.  The primordial atmosphere is believed to have reached a pressure of 250 atmospheres and would have been extremely toxic to life as we now know it   Source: The Hadean Eon  Many mechanisms are suggested in this and many other resources, from impacts to volcanic outgassing etc. But what does measured geochemical data tell us about the Earth's earliest palaeoclimatic conditions?  This question is related to the previous questions:   What, if any, paleoclimate data can be derived from igneous rocks? What, if any, paleoclimate data can be derived from stromatolite fossils?   But, this question is looking at the earliest palaeoclimatic conditions of the Earth. "
2104,Can impact events cause widespread volcanic activity on the other side of the planet?,"The currently accepted theory for P-T mass extinction is environmental change triggered by the Siberian Traps volcanic activity.  A paper(1) suggests that the Siberian Traps were caused by a hotspot created after an impact event on what was back then the antipode of Siberia: the Wilkes Land crater.     Thus, the impact may have triggered the “Great Dying” at the end of the Permian and contributed to the development of the hot spot that produced the Siberian Traps and now may underlie Iceland.   However, another more recent review paper(2) mostly discredits this theory:     Finally the recent report of a 500-km-diameter impact structure of possible Permian–Triassic age in the Antarctic(1), is based entirely on satellite gravity measurements, provides no geological context, and completely ignores the absence of any predictable regional and global geological effects from such a large impact event, e.g., the absence of any thick ejecta layer at nearby Antarctic Permian–Triassic boundary sections.   Leaving aside the discussion of whether such a thing caused the formation of the Siberian Traps and thus the P-T mass extinction, in theory, can an impact on one side of the Earth cause volcanism on its antipode?  Also very important, why would this happen? What's the supposed mechanism that converts short term seismic activity to volcanic activity derived from long term hot spots?  Note that I'm not asking about in situ volcanic activity (such as the case of Sudbury). The impact also has to be reasonable in magnitude: I don't consider the moon-forming event that destroyed the young Earth as a reasonable impact in magnitude.    (1) von Frese, R. R. B., L. V.

2105,What do the derivative or the integral of amplitude of a seismogram mean?,"I'm doing a project in which I'm analyzing earthquake seismogram waves. I used a program to graph the exact amplitudes and how they changed over the course of a single earthquake. For the project I need to incorporate calculus, so I was wondering, what does finding the derivative of amplitude do? And what does finding the integral get you?   The integral is the area under the entire wavelength, but I was wondering if it was equivalent to energy released, or some sort of geology/physics thing I didn't understand. Thank you. "
2106,"Do other terrestrial planets have ""earthquakes""?","I know some planets have storms akin to what we have on Earth although obviously varying in nature.   I was wondering if other planets have earthquakes? Since this comes down to plate tectonics (right?), I guess I am also asking if other planets have plate tectonics.   Obviously, a planet like Uranus or Neptune wouldn't because they are gas, so I am restricting it to terrestrial ones.  I tried to look this up on Wikipedia, but I couldn't think of a word besides non-earthquake or just quake but those didn't turn up any results.   What frequency do different kinds of seismic activity appear throughout the universe? "
2107,Axial Obliquity and Climate Change,"The Wikipedia page for Earth's Axial tilt says:     Earth's obliquity oscillates between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees on a   41,000-year cycle. It is currently 23.44 degrees and decreasing.   My Questions are:   What changes in climate pattern can be observed when obliquity is at the extremes? How extreme can the climate get if the obliquity oscillates between 20 and 30 degrees?  "
2108,How probable is is that earth magnetic field will change 180 degrees at once?,"Today the Earth's magnetic field is moving a little bit.

2109,How can I merge weather data from different time zones?,"Does anyone know of any simple means for merging (inverse distance weighting method) hourly weather files (precip, temp, etc.) from different time zones?  I am creating weather data for HUC8s, and am using the 5 closest NCDC weather stations.  But some HUC8s cross over different time zones.  Has anyone figured out the easiest method for aligning weather data?  My thought is to put everything into GMT - so that 10am is 10am everywhere, and track the offset in a new column in my data.  I believe this would work, but am having trouble completely wrapping my head around it:  Focusing on a watershed that cross from CST into EST - if it was raining at 10am EST, and also raining at 9am CST (raining at the timezone division, with weather stations on either side of the timezone division), it's raining at the same time, we are just marking the 'time' differently in each location.  However, if I transformed my date/time into GMT, with a new column tracking the offset (maybe to convert it back later), it would be the same GMT time in both locations that the rain was occurring?  In effect, it is just shifting all the weather into the same time zone, and then merging based on IDW.  Does anyone have any simple solutions I am overlooking? "
2110,What are the relative contributions of planets to the Milankovitch Cycles?,"When reading about the Milankovitch cycles here, it says:      If the Earth were the only planet orbiting our Sun, the eccentricity of its orbit would not perceptibly vary even over a period of a million years. The Earth's eccentricity varies primarily due to interactions with the gravitational fields of Jupiter and Saturn.    My question is, what are the relative contributions of Saturn and Jupiter to the orbital eccentricity of the Earth?  Do the Trojan Asteroids also factor into the eccentricity of our orbit?  Finally, what is the temperature change we can expect on Earth due to changes in eccentricity of Earth's orbit around the sun (e.g. the long-term climate cycle)? "
2111,How does the lifetime of methane vary in the atmosphere?,"When reading about methane and its effect on climate, it is clear that its lifetime in the atmosphere is important to the global warming potential.  However, the lifetime does vary from 9 to 15 years, depending on conditions.  What are those conditions that would affect the lifetime of methane?  How does the lifetime of methane vary in the atmosphere?  "
2112,Are all natural diamonds made of organic carbon material?,"I've read that diamonds are created at a depth of about 180 km. By volcanic activity it comes above. But did plants and trees of 300 million years ago sink so deep? Or is it possible that  inorganic carbon, what was already in the Earth, is the source of diamonds?  I've heard also that there could be other exo-planets in the galaxy that are made of diamonds so it looks like it should be possible, or isn't that true? "
2113,"Why are ""ground level"" air quality monitors really on rooftops?","There are many papers that talk about the air quality at ground-level in cities, observed by air quality monitors.  Some monitors are located above the building(not actually on the ground). For example, my lab's equipment was located on the 5th floor of the building (~ 15m).     My questions are:   Is it appropriate to represent air quality using measurement data on a building roof?       What's the difference between air quality on the ground &amp; the roof? And what matters?  "

2115,How about local impacts of deforestation on droughts and floods?,"In fields like economics, people tend to think that catastrophic events like droughts, floods, desertification, landslides, soil erosion etc. are events which are linked to global climate change and global [tex] emissions or they think these events could be exogeneous events (they argue that floods come from the massive rainfalls which are due to whole climate change problem or they think that droughts are mainly caused by the average increase of global temperature).  In some sense, I agree with these arguments but my intuition is that events like droughts, floods and desertification are events which are also due to local activities, such as deforestation or loss of wetlands.  I explain this intuition in more detail. When we cut down trees, this reduces the land's ability to absorb water from rainfall and this directly increases the frequency and severity of floods. I know that deforestation in Indonesia contributes to the whole climate change problem but are there not any local impacts of this deforestation in Indonesia directly concerning droughts and floods on this region?  Morgano et al. (2014) shows that there exists a massive deforestation in Indonesia. So, in this case, does the risk of having more floods, desertification and droughts increase directly in Indonesia or around this region?  Is this a legitimate idea or are there any academic papers which link the frequency of catastrophic events like droughts, floods and desertification to local activities, like deforestation,   I make the same reasoning for the drought problem.  This link shows how drought frequency in Sub Saharan Africa, South Asia and Latin America has increased between 1990-2010 relatively to periods 1950-1990.  [website](Source for graphics : Spinoni et al. World drought frequency, duration, and severity for 1951-2010-International Journal of Climatology)  Most of FAO reports and other academic papers point out the deforestation and inappropriate use of water resources in South Asia and Sub Saharan Africa.  In this case, can we attribute the increase of frequency and severity of droughts in this region (and other possible events in this region) due to the bad use of this natural capital ?  I really appreciate if there are some references for the local impacts of inappropriate use of natural capital. "
2116,Dating fluvial terraces with $^{10}\rm{Be}$,"I've completed part A of the question below.    Dating fluvial terraces with [tex]  One way to determine the age of an alluvial deposit is to collect a series of samples from a range of depths, from the surface down to a few meters, and analyze the cosmogenic nuclide concentration. The expectation is to find an exponential-like decline in concentration with depth, with an asymptotic value that reflects the inherited concentration. Suppose you sample an alluvial deposit on a mesa surface near Boulder and find the values that are shown in Table 1.  10Be C      26AL C     Depth (m) 4.29E+06    2.62E+07     0.0 2.44E+06    1.64E+07    -0.5 1.88E+06    1.24E+07    -0.9 1.49E+06    9.80E+06    -1.3 1.27E+06    8.32E+06    -1.7 1.12E+06    6.89E+06    -2.5 9.99E+05    6.46E+06    -3.1  C units (atoms/gram*year)   A Use a spreadsheet (or if you prefer, a script in Python, Matlab, etc.) to make a plot that shows the [tex] and [tex] concentrations as a function of depth. Make depth your y-axis, and have the values increase downwards.  B Make an initial guess about (1) how old the terrace is, and (2) how much of the Beryllium concentration is inherited from when the sediment was first deposited (the exact numbers you use in your guess don’t matter, since you will change them). Then use your spreadsheet to calculate the expected [tex] concentration that each sample should have if it had the inheritance and age that you have specified.  C Quantify the error in your guess by calculating, for each sample, the root-mean square error: (i) take the difference between the sample age and your guess, (ii) square it (to make the number positive no matter which way you’re off), (iii) take the square root, (iv) take the average.  D Now, iteratively adjust (1) your guess at the age and (2) your guess at the inheritance, until you find a pair of values that come as close as you feel you can reasonably get.  E In your paper, present and describe a graph of the sample data that also shows your best-guess curve. Discuss this “best fit” estimate of the age of the terrace. What is the root-mean square error? Can you think of a procedure that would be more systematic than trial-and-error guessing? "
2117,Physics based circulation models,"How useful are physics based models when considering circulations at synoptic scales? Are they useful? Can we not make predictions, observe trends based on data alone? I am studying A.E.Gill's model on tropical circulation and this thought often occurs to me due to the approximations made in the model. "
2118,"Cloud in a bottle experiment. Why does the ""cloud"" get thicker with repeated squeezing?","I have done the cloud in a bottle experiment (Youtube video) with a thermometer probe in the bottle to show the temperature increase and decrease.  I am interested in the nature of the changes as the cloud nuclei get covered with water and then as the water evaporates (almost instantly) with the increased pressure as you squeeze the bottle.  For those unfamiliar with the subject,  evaporation of a cloud droplet absorbs energy and the formation of a droplet releases energy. I find it interesting (and counter intuitive) that when you release pressure,  cloud droplets form (meaning that the droplets themselves are releasing  energy).  Why are they releasing  energy in a system that is already going to a lower energy state?  Seen as a part of the system,  as a speck of smoke at the start of the pressure drop,  they have no energy to begin with!      I would also like to see a theory about this. Where the things that happen are related to how catalysts work.  Smoke is a catalyst in this case.  And where the condensation nuclei are acting almost like ""buffers"" in acid base theory.  A buffer in acid base acts as a proton donor or proton acceptor   to reduce pH fluctuations. Maybe the condensation nuclei can be seen as doing the same thing to reduce temp, and pressure changes in the cloud?   So, anyways, a cloud droplet forms around a condensation nucleus.  Energy is released, while water vapor is absorbed from the gas around the nucleus.   As the droplet falls into lower humidity air,  it releases droplet water as water vapor with absorption of energy. On the one hand,  more water vapor is more volume, but on the other hand,  the lower temperature as the droplet absorbs energy as the water vapor is released  causes lower pressure.  I do not know where the balance lies.  Here is my attempt (Youtube video) to provide questions and maybe answers "
2119,How to tell the difference between real rain and fake rain (cloud seeding)?,"I live in a city where the pollution is bad, so bad that sometimes we get 'fake' rain (from cloud seeding). This may last for an extended period.  There have been times before when it has “rained” and it might as well have been raining.  This seems to defy some sort of logic though. Natural rain and human produced rain must have some fundamental differences, should they not?  What differences exist between natural rain and human “rain”? "
2120,Volcanoes in the Alps and Himalayas and the subduction of Tethys Sea,Geologist have theorized that the Tethys Sea subducted under Eurasian plates. But where are the volcanoes that would have resulted due to this? Where are the volcanoes in the Alps and the Himalayas?

2122,Is Atacama Desert cloudy or cloudless most of the year?,"I saw many contradictions everywhere.  For example, my geography textbook says that Atacama Desert is a desert where foggy weather is common, and it persists almost the whole year. Whereas every astronomer will say that it is the place with least clouds and fog, which is why it is one of the best places for astronomical observations beyond the dark sky.  So, which is true? And if one of them is not true, then how did it gain popularity at all? "
2123,Changes in Earth's orbital and rotation speeds,What are the Earth's maximum and minimum orbital speeds around the Sun?  Is there any way to calculate orbital speed at any point of Earth's orbit? Is there a way to relate this to the calendar?  Does the change in speed during an orbit around the Sun affect Earth's revolution time around its own axis? (24 hours slightly more or less on day to day basis) 
2124,Are we now and/or have we been in the RCP8.5 scenario?,Is it generally understood that we (globally) have been living in an RCP8.5 scenario over the past 7-8 years?  Such that a predictive climate model using RCP8.5 assumptions that was run circa 2011 can be considered indicative of the time between then and now?  I am working on a calibration of modeled dry-bulb temp data versus real observations over the intervening years but I realize that any correction I come up with would necessarily have any deviation from reality and RCP8.5 baked into it. 
2125,"Is the ""Kartenhoff"" meteorite real?","In the Bond movie ""Spectre"", there is a scene with a large meteorite on a stand:    Is this meteorite real, or is it based on a real meteorite? Are there actually any meteorites this large and perfect? "
2126,Stream function on a periodic domain?,"Part 1  In this paper the authors calculate the barotropic stream function from an output of a numerical model as:  [tex]  over a global domain and this is the result:    In the caption, they specify that the value at the African continent was subtracted from the result of the integral.  If I interpret correctly, this is necessary because the domain is periodic and we need to ensure that the integral over the globe (excluded the Southern Ocean) is zero. Is this correct?  If yes, what is the rationale for choosing the values at the African coast? wouldn't the value at Cape Horn be more natural?     Part 2  Another aspect of this calculation that I do not understand is the fact that the values of [tex] near the coasts are not zero. I would expect the values of the stream function to be zero near the coast in order to ensure a zero transport across the coast. Why is this not an issue? "
2127,What is the general procedure to run WRF-chem with chen_opt=16,"Is there anybody who has run WRF-chem with chem_opt=16 successfully to simulate the green house gases?

Hence, any body can give me advice? If possible, a namelist.input may be great helpful.  =============================update 2018.03.22============================  I still don't konw about the auxinput15.

That leaves 25%, where does that go/factored into?   The entire right half of this diagram confuses me, what is happening there? Why is there a red line connecting 70%SW and 70%LW?

The following picture was included.   "
2131,What are the criteria that make a planet (in)habitable?,"Recently, I realized a lot of factors must contribute toward making a planet habitable, other than just the ones that come to mind like having oxygen, the right temperature, and so on.   What makes a planet habitable? Is there an official set of criteria? I don't see how one could say we have [tex] number of official potentially habitable exoplanets unless there was a standard set of criteria.  EDIT:  I'm not sure if the correct term is ""habitable"" or ""inhabitable"", but what I am obviously asking is what factors determine whether humans and other organisms could live on a given planet.

2132,Where does the lithium in Salar de Uyuni comes from?,"Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia holds a large percentage of the world's lithium reserves. Since the lithium is dissolved as LiCl in the brine, it makes extraction much easier than the alternative: Li bearing minerals in granitic pegmatites.  What is the source of lithium in the brine? Where does it come from? "
2133,Does the gravitational pull of the moon affect the composition of Earth's atmosphere?,"In particular, does the pull of the moon affect the amount of water vapour in the Earth's atmosphere? In other words, if the moon were larger, or orbiting more closely to the earth, would the increased gravity cause the composition of the atmosphere to change? "
2134,Regarding various types of atmospheric pollution,"Does all the car pollution (from about 150 million cars at least in the U.S. and a lot more in all of North America and the rest of the world) all the smoke-stack pollution of various factories and all the Airline pollution running day after day have a deleterious and damaging effect on the general atmosphere and, over time, the climate?  Given all the observed pollution that China has caused itself and some of the resulting weird weather events there this certainly seems to be evidence of the damaging effects of car and factory pollution. Has anyone calculated how much exhaust from cars is produced in one day on average in a 'moderate' sized city?  Of course it seems with all the increased oil production in the U.S. and elsewhere we, human beings are going to keep are love-affair with gas-powered cars for the next 200 or 300 years. That is if we don't use up all the oil and gas in the ground before then. "

2136,Intuitive explanation of precipitation amount,"I'm trying to learn how to make sense of numbers in a forecast. I can interpret temperature and wind speed, but I don't know what to make of rainfall. What does it mean, for a human, that there will be (for example) 0.5mm precipitation? Is it a lot or not? Is there a reference online describing precipitation amounts in everyday terms? I've been looking for something like that, but found nothing, only formal definitions of measurement. "
2137,Freshwater changes in time?,"Taking freshwater as being:      Fresh water is naturally occurring water on the Earth's surface in ice sheets, ice caps, glaciers, icebergs, bogs, ponds, lakes, rivers and streams, and underground as groundwater in aquifers and underground streams.    How much has the total available freshwater change over time? How much has it gone from one reservoir to another? How can we estimate future changes? "
2138,"'Peak water' in the Ogallala Aquifer, USA?","According to the United States Geological Survey Report (USGS) Groundwater Depletion in the United States (1900–2008), the Ogallala Aquifer (or High Plains Aquifer) is a vital source of groundwater for a major agricultural region in the United States.   In the USGS report, there is evidence of significant and ongoing depletion of the aquifer.  From the USGS report, the total depletion at the end of 2008 is about 341 km[tex] and the rate of depletion at the time of writing the report was ""continuing as high a rate as ever"".    The Ogallala Aquifer is labelled as number 13, in the above USGS map.  Given the effects of climate change on aquifer recharge and drought cycles, coupled with the human depletion of the aquifer, is there any evidence that 'peak-water' could occur in the Ogallala Aquifer?  By 'peak-water', I am referring to a point where it becomes practically and economically impossible to pump water from the aquifer  This question is related to Recharge a dry aquifer? "

2141,Width of strata in stratigraphic column,"I am trying to understand whether there is one ""standard"" meaning of the width of represented strata in stratigraphic columns, but I can find nothing online or in my geology books.  I notice that, sometimes, under stratigraphic columns there can be legenda explaining how the width of the represented strata relates to the measure of the clasts of a conglomerate, but I have also found stratigraphic columns with no stratum of conglomerate or breccia where not all the strata are equally large.  Is the width of strata usually an increasing function of the area occupied by the respective stratum? Can width represent other characteristics of the described stratum? "
2142,Statistical weather prediction,"Assuming I have time evolution of air temperature, air pressure, wind speed, wind direction, relative humidity and cloudiness, how can I predict weather based on this information?   I know that high air pressure increases chance of more concentrated sunlight and low air pressure increases chance of precipitation. I know that a decrease in temperature increases chance of snow or ice and also of low relative humidity and vice versa. I also know that higher wind speed means higher chance of a storm and that certain directions of wind can cause a change in temperature.  However I don't know what meteorological parameters I could predict with a combination of these variables. How would I predict the weather based on the time evolution of these variables? "
2143,What precursor geological activity occurred prior to the Parícutin Volcano eruption in 1943?,"Parícutin Volcano, sometimes referred to as the 'A Volcano Born in a Mexican Cornfield' (which is also the title of a book published in 1993, more information here), was one of the most well documented and observed volcanic eruptions in the world.  Quite literally, it grew out of a fissure in a cornfield in February 1943, continuously erupting until 1952.    Parícutin Volcano image from the USGS in 1946.

2144,Why can isotopes reflect the age of the Earth rather than the age of the supernova that created them?,"Radiometric dating is based on heavier elements decaying into lighter elements, for example uranium decaying to lead. But wasn't all uranium in the Solar System created in one or more supernova? And floated around in space for millions or billions of years before accreting to form the Earth and its meteorites.  How come the isotopes reflect the time of the accretion of the Earth? How come the accretion affected the ratios of different isotopes, changed the nuclei of atoms? Why doesn't radiometric dating just reflect the age of the supernova in which the isotopes were once created by high energy nuclear fusion processes? "
2145,Compute direction of gravity vector,"As I understand to compute vector of gravity not saficient to compute normal to elipsoid, but we need to computer normal to geoid (by definition geoid is a surface to which the force of gravity is everywhere perpendicular).  So I have some questions:   How to compute normal to geoid? What is the maximum discrepancy of angle between elipsoid normal and geoid normal?       Update:  About practical application of gravity normal:  I have some tall object that stand on Earth (like Leaning Tower of Pisa) and I can obtain GPS coordinates of it top and bottom points by using photos taken from air and applying photogrammetry methods. Then from GPS coordinates of top and bottom of object I can get vector in ECEF coordinates and find angle betwen this vector and gravity vector.   Also my question:  If difference in angle between ellipsoid normal and geoid normal(""deflection of the vertical"") is about 100 seconds of arc (0,0277778 degree) is it safe to use ellipsoid normal for this practical application?  Update 2:  First:  I'm trying to understand if normal to ellipsoid is sufficient for practical application. In real life object is mounted by using spirit level and on this picture we can see that theoretically I need normal to geoid, but if deflection of vertical small enough I can use normal to ellipsoid as approximation.    Second:  I'm trying to estimate the error of angle measure, I have some error in calculating of GPS positions of my object top and bottom points say epsilon_1, also I have some error in calculating gravity vector because of I'm using normal to elispoid say epsilon_2 and I'm trying to understand how epsilon_1 and epsilon_2 affects resulting angle between object vector and gravity vector. So I need to derive the formula that will give me measurement error of angle using measurement error of GPS points and gravity vector(epsilon_1 and epsilon_2). "
2146,"In general, does the presence of vegetation increase/decrease gross water loss (evapotranspiration) compared to barren land (evaporation only)?","I am doing some literature review on desertification. However, I could not find any information related to my question. Based on my knowledge, barren land faced greater heating and wind than vegetated area but the presence of vegetation can lead to a huge increase in evaporation surface area. They seem to me opposing factors. Based on my intuitive guess, I would say barren land would suffer bigger water loss but has there been any reliable research done on this? Is there a method to calculate and compare the gross water loss of the two scenarios? "
2147,Why is the South Pole colder than the North Pole?,"This question popped into my head because I am designing a fictional world map, and I was wondering what factors influence the amount of ice at poles.  I want to know why there is much more ice covering South Pole than North Pole.  An answer I found here states:  What makes the South Pole so much colder than the North Pole is that it sits on top of a very thick ice sheet, which itself sits on a continent.  Does that mean that if there was a continent at North Pole, there would also be much more ice there? Is impact of Gulf stream also a factor in this or no?  I think I am on the right track but someone more knowledgeable than me could really clear this up.  Thank you in advance! "

2149,Does the Nasa video show proof of the biotic pump theory?,"(Edited). Biotic pump theory (2006): Forests cause enhanced transpiration and precipitation and create areas of low pressure that suck in more moisture in a positive feedback loop.  A few years ago an international team found the mechanism for enhanced precipitation.  They found that fungi release potassium salts late at night, as they release spores, and that plants release turpenes and isoprenes in the morning and these sublime onto the salt in the sunlight  to form extremely good condensation nuclei. Source: Biogenic Potassium Salt Particles as Seeds for Secondary Organic Aerosol in the Amazon  I made a video about this.The second part, from about 7 minutes into the video, clearly shows cumulonimbus clouds forming at approximately 3 to 4 pm over forested areas of Cuba, Florida and Mexico. This is consistent with the biotic pump theory.  The biotic pump theory is that enhanced transpiration and precipitation  over forested areas causes low pressure areas and attracts wind (laden with moisture) from elsewhere.  To create a low pressure area, the clouds have to remove some gas from the area,  and they do so by transporting air up into the next layer of the atmosphere. The ""tail"" of the hurricane (the stream of wind delivered to the upper atmosphere by the hurricane actually demonstrates that this is happening.  When its tail  passes over those areas,  its moisture condenses on the condensation nuclei that have passed up through the cloud with the dry air into that higher layer of the atmosphere.   The main problem that the biotic pump theory has is that it was proposed by nuclear physicists. They suggest that several of the ""assumptions"" on which meteorology are based violate the laws of thermodynamics. Coming from mere nuclear physicists,  this should give people pause for thought. But the biggest problem has been a communication problem.  The meteorological community have found the mathematics they use almost incomprehensible.  How do you read the evidence?  "
2150,What would be the effect of bringing seawater pipes to the Sahara desert?,"This is a childhood dream.   What would happen if pipes were installed (similar in principle to the Great Man-Made River, but for seawater) to continuously pump seawater into the Sahara desert.   Let's say that a precise desert location, with no known aquifer nor water table, was chosen to be an inner sea. And let's say that wildlife was negligible at that location. And that solar panels were installed to provide energy for the pumping of the water. And that the water was pumped at the surface of the Mediterranean sea and that precautions were taken not to greatly damage sea life.  How hard will it be to fill, say, a Nevada sized inner salty lake? And would that humidify the air enough that dew - falling to the ground each night - would somehow start a greening cycle?   What if a little mud was added to the water to precipitate into a bed that would retain the lake?   Is there any modification to this childish plan that would make it, at least, realizable? "
2151,Why is lightning going from the Earth to the clouds while the electrons are going from the clouds to the Earth?,"The lightning is often a discharge in advance. The (negative) charge slide occasionally a little further on in the conductive channel, wherein said channel is highlighted each time something. The lowering speed of the discharge is ""only"" about 1,500 kilometers per second.  The main discharge provides the lightning that we usually perceive (which appears from the clouds to the earth, but not in reality). After the discharge of this strong flow fills the entire channel. This is called the main discharge or sometimes the 'backlash' (return stroke).  This phenomenon, with intense light accompanied, moves at about 100,000 to 150,000 km / s from the earth to the cloud. In this situation, the electrons move down and our speech becomes the current direction counted up. After all, the electric current runs from plus to minus, as opposed to the electrons.  But the question now is how electrons that emerge give a flash of light which goes up?  See also : Why does lightning strike from the ground-up? "
2152,"In -20 °C weather, creeks below waterfalls here form ice columns. What are these called? Ice-canoes?","  I would like to know the name(s) of this ice formation. How common or rare is it? What other regions of the world does this occur in? What specific requirements are needed to produce it and could it be reliably produced in a lab or a fountain or pond? What other structures are similar to this?  We also have a video which shows the center of the growing columns bubbling with orange froth, which appears to supply material to the sides of the columns as it grows.  These columns appear to be about two feet or 60 cm high and about eight inches or 20 cm in diameter for the largest ones.  They do not look like they take the shapes of crystals, rather, like the precipitation chimneys of undersea hydrothermal vents.  I heard that this kind of structure has been seen in Nova Scotia. I also heard they form in more than one creek in or near Hamilton, Ontario, Canada (where the pictures and videos were taken). I also heard this has happened in other years, not just this year. "
2153,What is the difference between climate change and global warming?,"1. Question:  In the article, Global Warming vs. Climate Change is an example of the confusion regarding these terms.  What are the ""official"" definitions of ""Climate Change"" and ""Global Warming""?  How does the IPCC - distinguish between ""Global Warming"" and ""Climate Change""; or, are the terms interchangeable?  Clarification:  To avoid ""opinion"" / ""debate"", I am just hoping for authoritative definitions. Specifically, I am hoping to clarify the different uses seen in objections raised within the science community, (Question Link).    2. Example Ambiguities:   Global Warming - a relentless rise in temperature? Due to both natural and human contributors?  Or exclusively to pollution?  Associated with the relentless rise in Carbon Dioxide levels, or perhaps Chlorofluorocarbons, etc. Climate Change - A competing theory? A newer refinement of Global Warming Theory? Extreme, and unpredictable variability in climate--rather than a consistent, relentless increase in heat. Corollary Theories -  Is Climate Change is a larger study, and Global warming falls within, or one causes the other, etc?  "

For this I would like to know how the velocity-field (i.e. wind-speed and direction as a function of position and time) looks like and how constant it is in the time and space domain.  Is there some publicly available data about air-circulation in the stratosphere? Or do you have an idea how to generate test-data for my simulation? 
2156,Meteor Explosion,"I just read the article Meteor Explosion Over the Atlantic and it states that ""Data released by NASA shows that the meteor released an energy equivalent to 12,000 tonnes (13,000 tons) of TNT, and it was moving at over 15.5 kilometers per second (9.6 miles per second).""  Awesome.  I understand that part.  What I don't necessarily understand is how an explosion happened if the meteor is disintegrating.  Is it when the meteor enters the atmosphere, or is there some reaction that I'm missing.  Thanks!  Edit - My understanding is that it caused an explosion after entering the atmosphere prior to hitting the ground. My question is how that is possible? I understand the concept of the atmosphere and ground would cause an explosion, but how is it possible while in mid-air?  PS - Couldn't figure out which Overflow I should place this question in.  This one sounded the best.  Thanks! "
2157,"Is there a formula for heat retained by an atmosphere, based on density and composition?","I'm looking for a formula, either precise or an approximation (it's for a video game so it's ok to have somewhat rough numbers), that determines heat retained from the sun by an atmosphere, based on its density and composition (specifically CO2 composition, but bonus points if it factors other things in too).  Does such a formula exist?  Or if not, are there any rule-of-thumb sort of things I could use for estimating ""If an atmosphere doubles in density, its heat will rise by X percent"" or ""If you replace half the CO2 in the atmosphere with O2, your heat will drop by Y percent"", etc? "
2158,How bad is geo-engineering?,"It is just curiosity that forced me to ask this question. At some point in time, if we can't control global [tex] emissions, temperature will increase until a tipping point and it will be a complete catastrophe. However, if we could prepare ourselves through geo-engineering (e.g. carbon removal, blocking solar radiation), then we may return the temperature back to normal. I am not saying that we have to experiment with mother Earth, but if we may do weather-engineering experiments in controlled labs just like the Large Hadron Collider(LHC), we may some day be able to save the planet from catastrophe.   So, my question is, how bad does geo-engineering go as far as controlled experiments done in totally isolated labs?   In NWP models, it is mostly possible to control the evolution of [tex], solar radiation, moisture, temperature etc. Given the current computation power is better than in the past and will most likely be better in the future, once we have calibrated and validated those climate/weather models, can we use them to fight extremes of weather like floods, drought, hurricanes and all other wind storms?  The accuracy of current weather predictions is better for forecasts 5-10 days ahead. So, this may give enough time to do controlled simulations before and after our intervention. Based on that we may act on to, for example, increase precipitation (e.g. through controlled spraying of condensation nuclei) where there is drought, hit and disperse hurricanes or change their directions before they hit and damage cities etc. How wrong can one be to think like that?  "
2159,How deep is the permafrost in the Antarctic?,"I tried in vain to find the answer to this question on the web, but all it would tell me was, ""it is very deep"", and ""it is known as a thaw line rather than a frost line in the arctic and antarctic"". How far down you would have to live to escape the permafrost? 100 ft? 1000 ft? 10000 ft?. How feasible would an underground base be? "
2160,Why don't scientists use fire entry suits to study volcanoes?,"It seems like the only personal protective equipment (PPE) that volcanologists use are aluminized suits that don't provide any protection from direct contact with lava, making an unexpected splash lethal. There are suits that firefighters use to go directly into fires for prolonged periods of time, and they are able to resist temperatures exceeding 1100 °C (~2000 °F) for up to 15 minutes at a time. Most lava is around this temperature threshold, with the coolest lava erupting at a mere 650 °C (~1200 °F).  Why don't volcanologists use these suits to study volcanoes? Instead of using those awkward long metal rods to pick out the right piece of lava to study, couldn't they use their gloved hands to pick it up (perhaps on the colder erupting lavas like the ones that does so at 650 °C)? "
2161,Is the temperature (even a bit) warmer in a forest?,"Is the temperature (even a bit) warmer in a forest?  For example, there no frost on the ground in a forest when there is some in a field just outside the forest. Is it because the temperature is a bit warmer? Or simply because there is no dew on the ground in a forest? "
2162,Oceanic-atmospheric coupling between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean basins,The two great basins - Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean have their respective oscillations Indian Ocean Dipole and El Nino Southern oscillation that affect the climate of the regions as well as the world at large. Is there scientific agreement that the two basins are coupled at the oceanic level as well at the atmospheric level ? What are the observable manifestations of this coupling between basins ? 
2163,Pyroclastic flow protection,"Related to the question Why don't scientists use fire entry suits to study volcanoes?, where the issue of volcanologist protection against lava splatter and bombs is discussed.  Another major and sometimes sudden volcanic event are pyroclastic flows - the suddenness and swiftness of these events have occurred in many places, one recent example is the recent tragedy that occurred at Mt. Ontake, Japan, discussed in the question Why would volcano eruption cause cardiac arrest?.  There are many examples of volcanologists perishing due to pyroclastic flows.  Around some volcanoes in Japan, for example, there are reinforced concrete shelters touted as being pyroclastic flow shelters, as shown below on Oshima Island:    Image source  From personal experience, these shelters also surround Mt. Asama (have visited there).  How effective are these concrete shelters for survival against pyroclastic flows?  additionally, has there been any research for the development of protective gear against pyroclastic flows? "

2165,How does a 'fire tornado' form?,"A 'Fire tornado' or 'Firenado' or 'Fire whirl' are a fearful feature of forest fires world wide.  Having seen one up close, I can attest that they are both awesome and utterly terrifying, but I am aware that these vortices are not strictly speaking, actual tornadoes.  An example, filmed in fires in 2012 around Alice Springs, Northern Territory, Australia, as in this YouTube Clip.  The Wikipedia page for this topic rather vaguely states     Often, fire whirls are created when a wildfire or firestorm creates its own wind, which can turn into a spinning vortex of flame.   But, the page does provide the following public domain image of a 'fire tornado':    How does the vortex of fire in a 'fire tornado' form? "
2166,How can the average coldest day of the year be before the winter solstice?,"There are parts of the U.S. where, on average, the coldest day of the year comes before December 21st. [source]    How can this be? Why would temperatures start rising again even while days are still growing shorter?  (I would have assumed that daily temperatures should, in general, always lag behind daily insolation, with some sort of hysteresis relationship.) "
2167,Is there conclusive evidence for the Antarctic Circumpolar Current developing after the glaciation of Antarctica?,"The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is the continuous oceanic current that encircles the Antarctic continent, as is often explained in the literature as being the cause of the onset of glaciation in Antarctica.    However, a study in 2013, in the article A potential barrier to deep Antarctic circumpolar flow until the late Miocene?, suggest that the ACC did not fully develop until the late Miocene, due to the current being blocked by a volcanic arc in the early Drake Passage, and that the ACC importance was not in the global cooling on the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, but in the intensification in the late Miocene of the glaciation of Antarctica.  Is there conclusive evidence for the Antarctic Circumpolar Current developing after the glaciation of Antarctica? "
2168,What are the tallest hydrothermal vents in the world?,"Hydrothermal vents are commonly found near active volcanic areas and provide for a rich and complex environment for many biological organisms (archaea, bacteria, tube worms...). Many new hydrothermal vent systems are being discovered and many more are likely to be discovered in the future. My questions are which hydrothermal vent system is currently considered to be the tallest? What contribute to make that system larger? How old is the vent system? Are there any peculiar organisms associated with the system that haven't been found anywhere else? "
2169,Should total ground heat flux be 0?,"In the context of the land surface, the ground absorbs heat from radiation (also some times from precipitation and advection), and releases heat through evapotranspiration, advection and radiation, and run-off. If it were a closed system, you would expect the net heat loss/gain to be zero (at least on a reasonably long time scale, that irons out daily and seasonal cycles, and noise). However, there is also heat from the mantle to consider, and also heat conduction to the oceans.  Are there other avenues for heat loss or gain from the soil? Are any of these significant in a climatological context? Or should the total heat flux into (or out of) the ground from the atmosphere be equal to zero (or close enough for practical purposes, over time scales longer than a year)? "
2170,About the effectiveness of sand-bags,"Are there any recognized studies on the effectiveness of sand-bags in protecting property in some disaster or flood? Many times on the major news they talk about how sand-bags are used in a flood , how many people 'pull' together and make a great effort to save various properties. The thing is in many such instances the News people do not follow up on whether the sand-bags held. There has been a few mentions of it being successful but they do not mention much if or when the sand bags actually fail. So have there been any official studies in the effectiveness of sand bags? "
2171,Are cloudy nights warmer than nights without clouds?,"I have noticed this winter that nights without clouds (especially when the 12h before the night where not cloudy) were way colder than the cloudy ones.   It makes sense to me because the clouds can reflect the heat (infrared?) earth have accumulated during the day rather than loosing it into the atmosphere (like a kind of blanket). But I could be ""swayed"" by a confirmation bias here, so here is my question:  Is there a correlation between temperature and cloud, during the night? "
2172,Dry atmospheric temperature profile (dry adiabatic vs. isothermal),"I'm trying to understand why there are differing predictions of the atmospheric temperature profile. It is well established that the dry adiabatic lapse rate (DALR) is:  $$ \frac{\mathrm{d}T}{\mathrm{d}z} = -\frac{g}{c_p} \approx -9.8\ \mathrm{K/km} $$  This is derived by assuming adiabatic process and hydrostatic pressure gradient:  $$ \mathrm{d}s = c_p\mathrm{d}\ln{T} - R\mathrm{d}\ln{p}\quad(= \frac{\delta q}{T} = 0)\\ \quad \frac{\mathrm{d}p}{\mathrm{d}z} = -\rho' g $$  where [tex] is density of ambient air, and pressure of an air parcel is the same as ambient pressure ([tex]). It is essenitally the cooling an air parcel will experience due to change in ambient pressure when risen adiabatically in the atmosphere.  However, when using the principle of maximum entropy (i.e. looking for the equilibrium profile) we get isothermal profile, as predicted classically by Gibbs and Boltzmann.  Apparently, the actual atmospheric profile (where there is no moisture condensing) is consistent with the dry adiabatic lapse rate much more than with the isothermal profile. The actual profile is of course subject to continuous thermal cooling of the atmospheric layers, thermal warming by radiation from the Earth's surface, heating from the surface by conduction (by turbulence and molecular diffusion), and during the day to solar heating. These factors can obviously affect any equilibrium.  My question is:   What causes the discrepancy? Is there a consensus? If there was initially a DALR profile, would it eventually turn into an isothermal profile if there was no influence (no radiation, no surface, no dynamic phenomena).   My impression is that when radiative processes (thermal cooling and thermal heating from surface) are included in the maximum entropy calculation, one might get some sort of lapse rate, i.e. something between a pure thermal radiative profile and the isothermal profile.  I found some papers discussing the issue, esp.:   Verkley WTM., Gerkema T, 2003. On Maximum Entropy Profiles. Journal of atmospheric sciences. Akmaev RA., 2008. On the energetics of maximum‐entropy temperature profiles. Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society   where they treat potential temperature as something which is conserved when applying the maximum entropy principle in order to reach a profile with a lapse rate. But it is not clear to me why such an assumption should be made, or if there is any general consensus that this is the right approach. "
2173,Mixing equation for confluence of two rivers,"How can I calculate the final concentration of two ions in a river after the confluence of two rivers?   River 1 flows at [tex], contains $\small\sf{500\ mg/L\ Mg,\ 1.1\    g/L\ Ca}$ River 2 flows at [tex], contains $\small\sf{0.34\ g/L\ Mg,\ 200\    mg/L\ Ca}$   How do I find Mg and Ca concentrations in River 3, after the joining of Rivers 1 and 2? "
2174,How did plants adapt to $\small\sf{CO_2}$ levels past 400k years? Why won't they do it again?," (Description from climate.nasa.gov: This graph, based on the comparison of atmospheric samples contained in ice cores and more recent direct measurements, provides evidence that atmospheric [tex] has increased since the Industrial Revolution. (Credit: Vostok ice core data/J.R. Petit et al.; NOAA Mauna Loa CO2 record.))  I'm not sure where and why has all [tex] gone every 100.000 years and out of where has [tex] come?  But if [tex] came from burning trees or volcanoes and disappeared because plants adapted then I have this question:  Plants somehow tolerated these 100.000 year [tex] changes over time which is very evolutionary small time. So perhaps adaptation was just about changing plants' composition percentages which is very flexible. When some rare [tex] eating trees came to be more frequent. But if that's true why can't plants change their composition again to adjust for human [tex]-emissions pace? "
2175,What is the source of lava of volcano? From magma below crust? Or from molten crust by rubbing?,"Ok, it looks like a very simple question but I still have some point want to clarify...  Most images explain volcanos contain some orange stuffs as magma below volcanoes as magma chamber, but the problem is, what is the primary source of the magma? I have 2 assumptions but don't know which is correct:   Magma is directly supplied from magma below crust, in subduction zone the crust rubs and some cracks formed, magma rushes out from mantle and then to the surface of Earth via cracks. The magma is formed by molten crust cause by rubbing and then heating, then it rushes out via cracks. In other words, the magma is originally a part of crust and it just melt again through rubbing, which is not related to the magma below crust.   Which is correct? "
2176,Is oxygen the most abundant element on Earth?,"When I was in school, I was taught that we need oxygen to breathe, but it actually constitutes only a small fraction of the atmospheric composition, and that nitrogen constituted the largest fraction of the atmosphere's composition.  This quick Google search mentions oxygen as the most abundant element.  How can this be reconciled? "
2177,Largest mountain range,The major mountain chains of Earth are found near: Convergent (subduction) and convergent (collisional) boundaries or transform boundaries?  it should be both subduction and collisional right? 
2178,How are wind speeds typically distributed?,"What probability distribution do wind speed measurements typically follow?  I have seen a Weibull distribution used, but the page was a bit lacking on background information so I would appreciate confirmation and a reference, if possible.  If it is a Weibull, are there typical parameters that are used, or can these vary?  Thanks. "
2179,What are the dominant elements that oxygen is bonded to on earth?,"Elements are found in different minerals and chemical compounds on earth. Oxygen is dominantly found in silicate minerals which, aside from silica, contain other elements. One way of looking at the chemical form of oxygen is to look at its bonds within the compounds. Is oxygen dominantly bonded to silicon? If so by how much and to what other elements does it most likely bond to?  "
2180,Seismic data processing software,"For processing seismic data, why is Seismic Unix so important? What distinguishes it from other seismic processing software like GLOBE Claritas or Omega?  Is it argued that processing capabilities are superior to other seismic processing software or that it is easier to use? Does it get recommended for use because of cost or its wide use? "
2181,Why are Kp Index values updating at times greater that the intervals in which they belong?,"I've been observing the current Kp Index values from this site      At 12:18 AM UTC   The latest measurement is 1- (the next row for 160314 hasn't been filled out yet for the next series of measurements)     160313  1- 2- 1- 1-  0o 0o 0o 1-    4+      2 0.0   If the intervals go in order from 0000 - 0300, 0300 - 0600 to 2100 - 2400 then  that value is the last which makes it fall into the interval 2100 - 0000 UTC. So why is there a value present in the last interval, shouldn't it belong in the next row - to the first interval of 160314 (i.e. 0000 - 0300)?  Or is there some sort of delay or shift I need to take into account? "
2182,What causes such a narrow slit in a cliff? (see photo),"  I have this photo as a background image and I often wonder how such a narrow, well-defined slit could be formed.

2185,Is spectrum of sunlight the same in the summer as in the winter?,"Of course we receive less sunlight in winter, because the sun is lower in the sky, so the light has to travel through more atmosphere, and loses strength. Does this mean that the blue light is more scattered out?   Are the frequencies we receive in the winter relatively the same as in summer or is there a change in the received spectrum? Are there less UV-B rays in winter than there are in summer relative to UV-A? If so what is the cause of that? "
2186,Long-term Wind Speed Forecasting: reality or wishful thinking?,"I have been studying/working with Wind Energy for a while and, one of my main responsabilities right now is to search for adequate long-term wind speed forecasting models.  However, 2 things strike me about this quest.   Wind speed forecasting is a task of great complexity for wind speed itself is highly stochastic. It depends on climate patterns, regional weather behavior, topography and atmospheric stability, or the lack of thereof, just to mention a few.  The very own idea of ""long-term"" varies from researcher to researcher. So far I've found authors who claim that 1 to 7 days can be considered long-term (Current status and future advances for wind speed and power forecasting,Jung &amp; Broadwater, 2014); but also those who say one full year is the minimum threshold for long-term forecasting (The quality of weather information for forecasting of intermittent renewable generation, Sokolowska &amp; Hossa, 2014). It's clear that forecasting horizon is highly linked to the aim of your research; therefore, when topics change, so will their forecasting horizons.   a. Isn't there a consensus about what long term means when it deals with wind speed forecasting?  b. Can it be assumed year(s)-long wind speed forecasting withsignificant accuracy  is still some far-fetched, wishful thinking?  c. What are some efficient models out there yielding meaningful results?  I would like to hear your ideas/points as long as they can be backed by scientific reasoning. If you could point me out in the direction of research (proofs to your rationale) in long-term wind forecasting, I'd be downright grateful.    In case you have worked with this topic, then I'd enjoy hearing from your own experience.   Thank you so much in advance for all inputs.  "
2187,About Earthquakes and their properties,"I know this sounds like a crazy observation but San Francisco has a lot of HUGE buildings in the downtown area , millions of tons or probably more. Many Scientists think a big earthquake there is 'overdue' or maybe 'delayed' for some reason. I was thinking could all the millions or billions of extra 'tonnage' of buildings that has been built over the last 20 years say, could all this 'MASSIVE' pressure on the ground in San Francisco be somehow delaying the build up of any instabilities in the underground areas ? Maybe all the massive buildings in all big cities can serve to 'dampen' any underground instability. Do Earthquakes mainly strike near areas where there are not that many MASSIVE buildings? "
2188,Can climate models reliably predict meteorological extremes?,"This question is related to and extension of my previous question which was about the methodology used to predict future climatic extremes:  What is the methodology to analyze future climatic extremes using the results of climate models?  Although the answer to that question is quite detailed and informative, it is still not clear to me whether the models used in global climate (GC) simulations can predict rare (~1000-year return period events).   I understand that if we have multi-thousand simulations, we can calculate the 0.1% quantile, but I do not know whether the applied models can predict rare events reliably. Under reliably, I mean that in some alignment with the observed extremes or with the extremes statistically inferred from the observations. All the papers I saw so far, which dealing with extremes due to climate change, are considering 20-year return period events as maximum and comparing the simulations to observed quantiles. This is one source of my suspicion regarding the reliability of GCMs. Are GCMs calibrated to observed mean or multiple quantiles? Daily, monthly, annual, etc. averages are used? Averages of larger areas or grid points (corresponding to the applied resolutions) are adopted in the calibration, validation processes? What are the typically used target parameters used in the calibrations? Here is an example to make it more clear: one wants to determine the probability distribution function of extreme wind speed in a given location from daily measurements/simulation results. The question: If we take one simulation for the 1950-2000 period and assume for a moment that model uncertainty is negligible compared to climate variability, can we treat the simulation data as a sample with more or less equivalent confidence than that of the actual observations, corresponding to the same period, to infer large return period extremes?   One way to check this is would be to compare the large return period extremes inferred from observed data and from multiple simulations, I have not seen any papers with above 20-year return level comparison yet. I see that we cannot expect very accurate models regarding e.g. 1000-year extremes, because we cannot reliably calibrate and validate GCMs:   The available measurements are from a 100-200 year observation period (at best); We do not have too much data from different climatic conditions (there might be some phenomena which are not (or not adequately) taken into account in current models, we are somehow biased by the observed, prior 100 year conditions.   Any help, idea, reference, link are welcomed. "
2189,How isotropic is the Earth's inner core boundary?,"Often, in texts (particularly for schools etc) depict a smooth spherical isotropic boundary between the inner and outer core, as shown in the image from this USGS public education page:     The inner core boundary is between the inner and outer core layers.  How isotropic is the Earth's inner core boundary?  Related questions  How can we guess the size of the Earth's inner core(and what it's made of)?  Why does seismic activity shed light on the inner core rigidity?  Why is Earth's inner core solid?  These are related but this question is about the nature of the boundary between the inner and outer core. "
2190,How much has the total transport of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current changed over time?,"The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), the oceanic current that flows around the Antarctic continent, has many links to weather and climate processes (e.g., Is there conclusive evidence for the Antarctic Circumpolar Current developing after the glaciation of Antarctica?). My question is how has the total transport of the current changed in time at different time scales? Clearly, it has changed since its potential formation in the late Miocene. My interest is in both short time scales (seasonal), decadal (e.g., ENSO effects) and longer time scales. "
2191,Is there an estimate for the length of the American Cordillera?,"There was no geography site on Stack Exchange, so I thought the best place to ask about this was in Earth Science: Do we have an estimate for the length of the American Cordillera (the chain of mountain ranges in the west of the Americas, reaching from Alaska down to Antarctica)?   I tried calculating it by using the lengths of the mountain ranges listed on the Wikipedia page, but some mountain ranges don't have a length recorded anywhere. The best I could get was a rough estimate of about 8500 miles, the length of the Alaska Range, the Coast Mountains in British Columbia, the Cascade Range, the Sierra Nevada, the Sierra Madre Occidental, the Baja California peninsula, and the Andes. The Sierra Madre de Chiapas, COrdillera Central, and Graham Land had no length to add, and maps were no help.  Does a record exist for this lengthy range, or did no one ever bother? "
2192,What would be the first thing which will render the Earth uninhabitable?,"There are quite a few things which can make an otherwise habitable planet uninhabitable, and some of these will eventually happen, sooner or later:   engulfed by its star when it becomes a red giant destroyed by the nova or supernova of its star loses its magnetosphere and the solar wind blows its atmosphere away collides with a large enough object gamma ray burst maybe other astronomical phenomena?   some of these will inevitably happen to Earth in the future, but which one is to be expected to happen sooner? By uninhabitable I mean uninhabitable to currently known multicellular life.  For the sake of this question, assume that humans don't invent technology in the future which would stop this from happening, and also no extraterrestrial visitors, supernatural forces or similar effects intervene. Actually, let's assume that humans magically vanish today, just to not get distracted by the effects of human technology. "
2193,"Nuclear testing and the Anthropocene, a chemostratigraphic link?","The Anthropocene is described by Wikipedia as     an informal geologic chronological term for the proposed epoch that began when human activities had a significant global impact on the Earth's ecosystems   Due to its informal nature and not wide acceptance, there is often debate among adherents about when the Anthropocene is supposed to have started. Note: this is not a question about this debate.  A working group recently suggested in the article When did the Anthropocene begin? A mid-twentieth century boundary level is stratigraphically optimal (Zalasiewicz et al. 2015) has taken a different approach, looking at the effects of human activity on the chemostratigraphic record, suggesting that the Anthropocene epoch ought to have its beginning at the start of the nuclear age.    From the article's abstract:     We propose an appropriate boundary level here to be the time of the world's first nuclear bomb explosion, on July 16th 1945 at Alamogordo, New Mexico; additional bombs were detonated at the average rate of one every 9.6 days until 1988 with attendant worldwide fallout easily identifiable in the chemostratigraphic record. Hence, Anthropocene deposits would be those that may include the globally distributed primary artificial radionuclide signal, while also being recognized using a wide range of other stratigraphic criteria.    This question is not about the legitimacy of such an epoch, but looks at the main point of the working group's findings that radionuclides from nuclear testing may have a measurable imprint on the chemostratigraphic record.  Have there been any global correlation of artificial radionuclides in the recent chemstratigraphic record to justify this as a possible Holocene-Anthropocene boundary? "
2194,Is Antarctic sea ice at record levels?,"Every time I read a news article about Antarctic ice extent, I don't seem to have a clear answer as to what the deal is. If I look at the February sea ice extent from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), I get no trend that I can see: .  If I look at the September data from NSIDC, then I get a clear increase.. NSIDC even tells you what the trend is.      ﻿Monthly Antarctic September ice extent for 1979 to 2014 shows an increase of 1.3% per decade relative to the 1981 to 2010 average.   Finally, if I look at the monthly values it is even trickier:   What I can tell is that the minimum extent seems to be unchanged, while there is an increase in the maximum extent. If I where to analyze the trend using all the data, I wonder if any significant trend would be extracted.  I don't want to create any controversies, as I realize that the gains in the Antarctic (small increase of ~100,000 km2 per decade) are much smaller than the loss in the Arctic (decrease of ~500,000 km2 per decade) (NSIDC).  My questions are: Considering the level of variability in coverage, can the Antarctic sea ice extent be considered at ""record levels""? If so, what is the consensus on the causes of  this increase?

2196,"Mega-tsunami, what is the greatest possible height of a tsunami?","The notion of a taller-than-skyscraper, so called ""megatsunami"" is not new - with the often-reported 524m (1720 feet) high Lituya Bay tsunami of 1958 is sometimes referred as such (despite the wave not reaching that high). In many movies (and some documentaries), there are massive tsunami depicted. Some of these movies depict tsunami taller than skyscrapers (such as in Deep Impact and Haeundae). There is also evidence of massive tsunami occurring in different places around the world in the past.  We have seen the reality of devastating tsunami in and around the Indian Ocean in 2004 and Japan in 2011 for example.  These, while not being 100's metres high, are still catastrophic.  How a tsunami forms and how it travels is well documented (thus is not the subject of this question), nor is this asking about the inland reach of such a disaster, they are answered in the related questions Is a mega tsunami that will destroy America inevitable?, Is Atlanta too far inland and too far above sea level to be affected by the comet in “Deep Impact”? and Why does every tsunami travel differently?. But rather, the maximum height possible for a tsunami from any cause.  Is there a theoretical upper limit for the maximum height of a tsunami? "
2197,What is the tectonic explanation for parallel ridges in the Arctic Ocean?,"Looking at a map of the underwater features of the Arctic Ocean reveals three roughly parallel ridges, separated by basins (see image below):    Image source  The three ridges, as labelled are the Alpha Ridge, Lomonosov Ridge and the Gakkel Ridge, the latter being the slow moving plate boundary between the Eurasian and North American plates as an extension of the Mid Atlantic Rift, according to the Polar Discovery page Arctic Seafloor Expedition: July 1-Aug. 10, 2007.

2198,Why does the Inter tropical Convergence Zone shift?,"I am currently learning at school about the climatic conditions (mainly winds, difference in pressure, Coriolis effect, etc.) that cause and affect the monsoons received by India.  One of the factors mentioned is the shift of the Inter tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) towards the Ganga plain in the summers. I tried reading up on Wikipedia to understand this better (here especially), but couldn't understand much.  Could someone explain, in simple terms, (a) What the ITCZ and monsoon trough are? Are they just regions of low pressure? (b) What causes this to shift away from the equator? (c) Does 'convergence' have anything to do with all of this?   "
2199,Why deep ocean didn't freeze during snowball Earth?,"I know that at least twice in its history Earth was totally frozen. I also know that the last time it happened there were already life on Earth, and it survived. In deep water, under the ice, which was transparent enough for light to penetrate it and support life.   My question is, why didn't all the water freeze? AFAIK Earth was frozen for 10 million years, so I think it was enough time. Something must have kept deep water from freezing, what was it? Geothermal warmth? Underwater volcanoes? Both seem to be too weak sources of energy for keeping deep ocean liquid.  The same about Antarctica. I know there was a lake found deep under thick ice, why didn't it freeze? "
2200,How do we use oxygen isotopes as temperature proxy?,"As far as I know scientists use oxygen isotope 16 to 18 ratio in air trapped in glaciers (or in old foraminiftera shells) as proxy for temperature in the past. I know that [tex] is heavier, and it precipitates faster, and [tex] is lighter, and it evaporates faster.  I understand that when it's warmer, there is more evaporation and more heavy isotope left in water. Vapor moves toward poles, where it falls as rain or snow and goes back to water (this doesn't count) or stays in glacier for hundreds of thousands of years.  So when it's warm, we should have more [tex] in ocean sediments, and less in arctic glaciers, right? So more [tex] (less [tex]) in glaciers -> warm period.  On the other hand, when it's cold, precipitation occurs earlier while air moves to the poles, and heavy isotope falls down earlier, on bigger latitudes. In the air that goes to the poles there is only little heavy isotope left. So more [tex] (and less [tex]) in glaciers -> cold period. This is contrary to the above. So how to figure out temperature from ice and sediments cores? "
2201,Negative values of relative humidity in CFSR,I recently started using the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) 6-hourly products ([website]
2202,"Sudden Localized Surface Water Temperature Increase In Eastern Lake Superior, Canada","As can be seen in the below sequence of NOAA images spanning 15 hours (most recent at top), in extreme eastern Lake Superior the surface water (but not bottom water) temperature increased dramatically in a localized area.  Can anyone confirm or rule out that this is a real event?  If it is real, what is the explanation?  Link to source and additional information (Additional information includes lake-bottom temperature maps and additional time points)       "
2203,Does temperature affect partial pressure of gas dissolved in water?,"I am trying to understand the behavior of oxygen dissolved in seawater. I have always been under the impression that if a gas is in equilibrium between its gaseous and aqueous forms, that it will always have the same partial pressure in the air as in the water. For example, both air and air saturated seawater have a pO2 of 21.227 kPa (101.325 kPa x 20.95%). I recently, however, came across this tool from a company that creates dissolved O2 measuring devices which indicates that temperature has an effect on this relationship. It indicates that if atmospheric pressure is 101.3 kPa (pO2 in the atmosphere = 21.222 kPa) then the pO2 in seawater could be anything from 21.094 kPa at 0*C to 20.331 at 30*C.  If this is true, what causes this relationship? How can I calculate expected seawater pO2 given atmospheric pressure and temperature?  Bonus if you know of a function or package in R that could do this. Perhaps in the marelac package? "
2204,How viscous is the Earth's mantle?,"I'm posting here to get some more expert information based on this question.  If the Earth were to stop rotating, removing the centrifugal force causing the equatorial bulge, how long would it take for the mantle and crust to return to hydrostatic equilibrium?  That is, immediatly, thousands of years, or millions of years?  Never mind that changing the rotation in reality would involve forces and timescales that would not really provide this condition. if matter were arranged in such a shape, how long (orders of magnitude) would it take to settle? "
2205,"If the distance between Earth and the moon were changed, would the effects be immediate?","I need your help on a possible (but perhaps low probability) scenario for how the distance between Earth and the moon could change: say a large object from the Kuiper Belt manages to make its way into the inner system. It passes by our moon such that its gravity changes the moon's orbit around Earth into a more pronounced ellipse. So there will be times when the moon is much closer to Earth and other times when it's further away than its current distance from Earth.   Say that this change in the moon's orbit isn't enough to cause an apocalyptic scenario for life on Earth but that the tides are of course much, much more pronounced. I surmise that the greatest impact would be felt in costal towns and cities around the world. My question is: how long would it take for the change in the moon's orbit to be felt on Earth? Are we talking almost immediately/ within the hour for some unlucky areas that are now much closer to the moon on its new orbit, and at most within 12 hours for the ""luckier"" areas? Or would the time frame be much longer?  Thank you in advance for any insights you could offer on this. "
2206,What is a vertical wavenumber?,"I can understand that the wavenumber is number of waves or cycles in a given distance. But what would a vertical wavenumber mean? Is it just another term for the wavenumber of a wave that is propagating vertically? I came across this in the context of oceanic internal waves.  Precisely, how is it (if it is) different from the wavenumber of a wave in general? "
2207,"How long does earth take to recover from mass extinctions? What is ""normal""?","Wikipedia states the following about the P-Tr extinction event: ""Because so much biodiversity was lost, the recovery of life on Earth took significantly longer than after any other extinction event,[5] possibly up to 10 million years.[10]""  The source for the claim about 10 million years is this article: [website]Another wiki article states: ""Life on land took at least 30 million years to fully recover from the environmental disruptions which may have been caused by the eruption of the Siberian Traps.[10]"" Source: [website]I have a lot of questions about this.  Frankly 10 million years sounds like a very short time to me in this context. Is it short or is it long?  To expand the question:   Is the global ecosystem resilient to complete annihiliation? As long as there is some life left, is it likely to prevail? Let's say some catastrophe strikes and wipes out everything but bacteria - are we likely to see complex life ever again? I know there are debates about the Great Filter, but is there any consensus? What are the most popular contenders?  "
2208,Global warming cycles,"Everyone is saying we are in a global warming, an unnatural one at that because of CO2.  Has there ever been a 'global warming' in Earth's history?  I know that global cooling is cyclical and 'looks' like global warming at the beginning of the cycle and luckily it is cyclical.  There was a good explanation that the 'great dying' was because of global warming.  If there is such a thing what would make global warming cyclical.  Venus is global warming for sure but what could have stopped the cycle of warming to go to cooler therms and stop the 'Venus' effect that can not be changed? There is a negative feedback for global cooling thus keeping that in check.  Is there a negative feedback for global warming?   "
2209,Does the geographic North Pole move?,"The magnetic North (or South) Pole moves due to activities in the inner of Earth. And earthquakes can tilt the Earth's orientation a tiny bit. But can and does the axis' orientation relative to the surface change too? A major impact could surely do it, but could the Earth's inner activities?  I don't mean precession, nor tectonics or continental drift, but the movement of the rotation axis. Could for example the geographic North Pole move to Greenland? (Not Greenland moving to the NP) "
2210,Could a massive flood have formed the Grand Canyon?,"I believe that the accepted theory for how Arizona's Grand Canyon was formed was that erosion caused by the Colorado River flowing through the area over millions of years was the force at work.  Yet accounts of a massive flood have been passed down to various peoples throughout the world, even in landlocked areas. Could the Grand Canyon actually have been formed by such a cataclysmic flood?  In either case, it is assumed that vast amounts of water formed the gigantic chasm; the main difference being: over how much time did the transformation occur?  If a global deluge were accepted as a possibility, is the condition and appearance of the Grand Canyon consistent with such an origin? "
2211,Will global climate change alter the interannual and/or intraseasonal variance of temperature and/or precipitation?,"A quick skim of the regional chapters in AR5 shows predicted changes to average temperature and precipitation.  If I understand (in rough terms) the modelling methodologies used, a variety of models (an ensemble) are run many times each, each with different initial conditions.  The output is [tex] where [tex] are coordinates and time, [tex] is a model, [tex] is one run of a specific model, and [tex] is some modeled climate variable.  The ensemble mean prediction at time [tex] for gridcell [tex] is just the average over [tex] and [tex].    The variance of [tex] however is comprised both of real variability in the climate system, and model error.  This paper (9 years old now) suggests that drivers of intra-annual precipitation are really hard to model with GCMs.  Can it be done effectively with RCMs?  Are there dynamical arguments suggesting changes to higher moments of climate parameters (particularly in the tropics)?    Changes to distributions are commonly talked-about in the impacts literature, but I haven't come across concrete projections of changes to distributions from the climate science community.  Citations welcome. "
2212,How much of earth's molecular oxygen in the atmosphere is due to plants?,"I know plants form a critical part of the earth's biosphere, including molecular oxygen production. Molecular oxygen makes up ~20% of our atmosphere.  How much of the earth's molecular oxygen in the atmosphere is due to plants? Is there a minimal level of plant life necessary to maintain levels of oxygen so that land mammals can live? Also, are land plants mostly important or are underwater plants a significant source of atmospheric oxygen? "
2213,Shallow water height as vertical coordinate,"In atmospheric physics we use often a variety of vertical coordinates, [tex] the height above some reference surface, or [tex] as distance from the planetary center.  However sometimes it simplifies the equations we want to solve by using other coordinates, Pressure [tex], LogPressure, Potential temperature [tex],...  One vertical coordinate I want to specifically ask about is the shallow water height. It is defined by looking at the hydrostatic stability approximation [tex] then integrating over a variable height [tex] so that we arrive at constant pressure [tex] we get easily [tex]  So [tex] is now the variable height between two Iso-Pressure surfaces in some planetary fluid. Now we can express the navier-stokes-equation, mass equation, thermodynamic equation in terms of [tex]. I guess this will be very familiar to those who could answer me.  My question is now:   Assuming no vertical mixing (=geostrophic movement on isobaric surfaces), can I now build a vertical model of the planet consisting of a multitude of shallow fluid-layers? Namely I'd take [tex] as between [tex] and [tex], [tex] between [tex] and [tex],... and thus build up and atmosphere of a gas giant between [tex] and several [tex] bars. And more important: when could this approach be totally wrong?   Naively I'd expect this to be OK in my case, as I'm still effectively integrating over the whole planet, but I hoped for some experts opinion on this.  "
2214,What is the mechanism for deep-sea volcanism of the Gakkel Ridge in the Arctic?,"Related to an earlier question, What is the geochemical source for the helium detected in deep Arctic explosive eruptions?, where it is stated in the linked article that there is evidence of explosive volcanism deeper than 3km depth - the evidence coming from both seismic and petrological observations.  The article Hotbed of Volcanic Activity Found Beneath Arctic Ocean suggests that, as the article title alludes to, that the region has many hydrothermal vents and explosive centres.  These types of eruptions are not thought to be able to occur at depths greater than 3km, according to the article Arctic Volcanoes Found Active at Unprecedented Depths.  What is the mechanism for deep-sea explosive volcanism of the Gakkel Ridge in the Arctic? "
2215,Is it possible for rivers to freeze completely and stop flowing?,"Is it possible for rivers to freeze completely in the winter and stop flowing?  Are there known examples of this?  If yes, how large can these rivers be and where does the water go?  There are several large Siberian rivers that empty into the Arctic Ocean. "
2216,How was the Earth formed?,What events took place in our Solar System which led to formation of the Earth? I have heard from sources that a big giant star exploded and the Earth was formed. Is this true ? 
2217,Bulk and dynamic viscosity in the atmosphere,"I'm studying the physics of the atmosphere but I'm struggling with the matter of viscosity (Navier-Stokes equation) for gravito-acoustic waves. From Landau-Lifschitz :  $$ (T)_{ij} = -p\delta_{ij} + \eta(\partial_j\mathbf{v}_i + \partial_i\mathbf{v}_{j} - \frac{2}{3}\delta_{ij}\nabla\cdot\mathbf{v}) + \zeta\delta_{ij}\nabla\cdot\mathbf{v} $$  where [tex] is the dynamic viscosity, [tex] is the second viscosity, [tex] is the velocity, [tex] is the pressure, and [tex] the Kronecker delta.  My question is, in a windy viscous stratified atmosphere (up to 500km) how should I treat the viscous stress tensor [tex]? Should I take into account both the dynamic viscosity (normal viscosity) and the second viscosity? Can I consider the viscosity coefficients [tex] to be constant? What about the Stokes assumption [tex]?  Considering viscosity can I still use the adiabatic assumption to settle the Navier-Stokes equation?  More specifically, for gravito-acoustic propagation should I consider shear effects as well ? "
2218,"What are these lake-like blue patches in the desert, visible in satellite image?","I found some blue patches in the Arabian desert in Google Earth.  It looks like as if they were lakes with sand dunes rising out of the water.  But there isn't water in the desert, at least not this much, or is there?  So what do we see on the image?  I realize that the colour we see in the image may not be accurate.     Link to Google Maps     In response to Fred's comment about whether it might show water after a rain  I took some time to browse Landsat archives and see if things are changing.  Here's a comparison of the same region on two different days (note the different dates, about 1.5 months apart).  The comparison shows that things are changing, i.e. it doesn't permanently look like this.  Most of the time it's like the first image.  This is not the exact same area as above, but it's ""nearby"".      Are there satellite images freely available taken at wavelengths that can clearly show water?    Update 2  Here's some daily MODIS images from the same time as the two photos above, I'm not really sure what to make of them though.  See the clouds passing through 2013 Aug 3-4.  The precipitation layers in the same tool do confirm rain during those two days.    Update 3  Yet another image showing more clearly what looks like lakes.  Click for description and full-size image showing larger area.  This is the eastern part of Rub' al Khali.      Update 4  These are likely old and dried up lake beds.  Mention on Wikipedia.  Quote from article:     All that remains of the lakes are their eroded basins, standing up in forlorn little buttes a meter or so high, in stark white or gray against the Rub' al-Khali's infinity of rusty-red sand.    It doesn't explain the bluish colour, but it's likely these dried up lake beds that I see on the images.  Some ground-level photos here. "
2219,How are Mauna Loa $\ce{CO2}$ monthly trends computed?,"The problem  I am trying to figure out how [tex] concentration trends are computed in the data provided by the Earth Systems Research Laboratory Mauna Loa Observatory. The data contains monthly measurements, seasonally corrected trend, and interpolated data with filled gaps. The trend and interpolated data should be computable from the raw averages. I was trying to reproduce the results of computing the trend and interpolation, but my values keep being slightly off.  I have tried two formulas to compute the trend that I call formula1 and formula2 below and neither reproduces the data exactly, though formula2 seems to fit pretty well.    The data  The data (esrl.noaa.gov) is made available as a text file structured as follows:  #  (-99.99 missing data;  -1 no data for #daily means in month) # #            decimal     average   interpolated    trend    #days #             date                             (season corr) 1958   3    1958.208      315.71      315.71      314.62     -1 1958   4    1958.292      317.45      317.45      315.29     -1 1958   5    1958.375      317.50      317.50      314.71     -1 1958   6    1958.458      -99.99      317.10      314.85     -1    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    Here average is the average from monthly measurements of [tex] concentration in ppm units, #days is the number of valid days' measurements per month if available.  The other two columns, interpolated and trend are a bit more involved. The file describes the method to compute the values as follows.     The ""interpolated"" column includes average values from the preceding column   and interpolated values where data are missing.  Interpolated values are   computed in two steps.  First, we compute for each month the average seasonal   cycle in a 7-year window around each monthly value.  In this way the seasonal   cycle is allowed to change slowly over time.  We then determine the ""trend""   value for each month by removing the seasonal cycle; this result is shown in   the ""trend"" column.  Trend values are linearly interpolated for missing months.   The interpolated monthly mean is then the sum of the average seasonal cycle   value and the trend value for the missing month.   The formulas  In order to avoid dealing with boundary effects I compare the results past the first 3.5 years of record, so that centered 7-year windows can be correctly defined. That is starting from September 1961.  Let [tex] be the monthly average values.   I need to first compute ""the average seasonal cycle in a 7-year window around each monthly value"". And then substract it from the data to obtain the trend.  As I understand the average seasonal cycle is the difference between the seasonal filter and some seasonal average.  To compute the 7-year seasonal filter for each [tex] I compute [tex].  No for a seasonal average I tried two options.   The 7-year seasonal filter average [tex] The 7-year average [tex]   Thereby formula1 is [tex] and formula2 is [tex].  Conclusion  It seems to me that I misunderstand what is meant by ""the average seasonal cycle in a 7-year window around each monthly value"". Neither [tex], nor [tex] defined above fit. What is the correct formula?  I have put the data into a read-only (Google sheet) for a quick check. "
2220,Why Vp/Vs and not Vs/Vp?,The relation between shear wave velocity (Vs) and pressure wave velocity (Vp) is often expressed as Vp/Vs. Wouldn't the opposite be more logic? Vs/Vp would never lead to division with zero and the relation would always be a neat number between 0 and 1.   What are the reasons behind this convention? 
2221,How are critical loads of nitrogen deposition on eco-regions determined?,"Natural habitats have a ""critical load"" threshold in regards to deposition of nitrogen compounds (both wet and dry deposition).  The critical load is calculated in kg N / hectare and is specific to local ecoregion type.  I've heard that critical loads are based on lichens or other simple vegetation, but I'm not sure.  How are critical loads calculated?  What are the factors that are considered?  An example of critical loads are shown below for the western USA. In general the ecoregions are pretty coarse and in my mind over-generalized.  I'm curious about how these ecoregion distinctions are made.  How many types of ecoregions are there and what are they based on?Is it based on the vegetation that currently exists in that area (which can sometimes be distinctly different than indigenous vegetation)?  Or is it based on some historical vegetation type?  Furthermore, what is the expected result if deposition surpasses the critical load and what is the time horizon involved? ! "
2222,How and why do these tree-like river structures form?,"I noticed these detailed tree-like river structures in Google Earth    Google Maps link  How and why do these form?  Rivers don't typically split.  What would cause the water to keep branching off again and again, forming these tree-like fractal patterns?  I count as many as 7-8 branch splits even in the smaller trees.  I expect the answers will provide qualitative explanations, but if anyone can connect it to quantitative physical models that would be even better (e.g. diffusion limited aggregation, viscous fingering, dielectric breakdown all have analogous mechanisms behind them; could this one be related?)

2224,"The climatological variance of albedo, soil moisture in weather models","Looking at WRF currently but I am sure this applies to most weather models there is a file (specifically LANDUSE.TBL) that specifies USGS derived albedo, soil moisture and other parameters on a biannual basis - one for summer and one for winter.   Why would not these parameters vary on a more seasonal basis and/or on a annual basis? Why are these these variables assumed to be constant? Would not changing vegetation or land cover modifications affect these values on a regional basis as well as their impact on regional climate?   Also would it make sense to model these values on a regional basis after deriving them from remote sensing as indicated in the below mentioned article [website]"
2225,Converting glacier volume to mass: what ice density to use?,"The density of ice is 0.9167 g/cm3 at 0 °C (under atmospheric pressure).  I know of two factors that may influence this (are there more?)   Pressure  The glaciology faq (Common Questions and Myths about Glaciers) at the Alaska Science Center of the  U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) mentions for glacier depth:     A good guess is that the ice thickness is about one-half of the surface width of the glacier. Although few glaciers have been measured, the measured thicknesses range from a few tens of meters for small glaciers to about 1,500 meters for the largest glaciers in Alaska.   Does the density of ice change significantly with depth?  The Wikipedia article on ice mentions the density of ice increasing slightly with decreasing temperature, and the different phases of ice under pressure, but nothing on density. Inclusion of air  Googling for pressure ice density the (my) first search finds Density of glacier ice at the International Glaciological Society. This focuses on air in glaciers making the density lower, and concludes that at larger depths we reach that 0.92 limit:     What would be a good average to take? "
2226,TRMM rainfall measurement for synoptic systems,I have gone through the website of TRMM that explains how the TRMM satellite gather precipitation data- [website]Now one way they could overcome that is they mention they have a dozen such satellites that measure the precipitation but do those dozen satellites coordinate their work as in a A-train satellite constellation? If they do not coordinate their work they probably return to the same location every few hours to make a measurement.   If that is true what sort of assumptions are made  about what happens between these observations from a algorithms perspective to derive precipitation values?  
2227,Are there any geological periods found on top of each other that have dinosaurs of that period with in them?,"In diagrams, It is common to depict geological periods to be directly on top of each other with fossils of that period within them. When looking for evidence of this, I have only found examples of trilobites and shells. However it is common to see this sort of ordering depicted with dinosaurs in them [website]In high school my teacher said that at the grand canyon we find no fossils at the bottom, further up we find shells, above that we find jellyfish, then fish, then reptiles, then mammals. After doing research I found out that this was not the case. Now I suspect that diagrams that depict this ordering of the fossil record with dinosaurs maybe deception or at least a representation of the fossil record that can be easily misinterpreted by laymen.  So are there any examples of this ordering with dinosaurs? eg Jurassic layer with Jurassic fossils, then on top of that layer there is a Cretaceous layer with Cretaceous fossils?   Note: I know the wording of the question is quite terrible. Feel free to edit it. "
