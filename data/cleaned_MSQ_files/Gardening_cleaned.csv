0,Which side of a house will get the most sunlight?,Which side of a house will get the most sunlight?  Articles on the internet seem to have conflicting answers. Is this because it is dependent on location? 
1,How can I revive a tree that's been stripped of bark?,"I've got what I think is a cedar tree in my backyard that is missing most of its bark on one side from the ground to about 4' up. (Thanks to my puppy who is a shredding machine.) The branches next to the bare area of the trunk are slowly turning brown and dying. Is there any way to revive the tree and minimize the damage? Should I prune off branches that appear to be mostly dead?  Also, on the topic of preventative action: Are there products that successfully keep animals (dogs in my case) away from trees and shrubs? "
2,What's the most effective way to harvest rhubarb?,"I've got a big, lovely rhubarb plant in my yard which I'd hoped to be able to harvest a few different times over the course of a summer. How should I harvest my rhubarb to encourage it to regrow quickly? Should I cut it off near the base, pull it up from the root, or something else? Should I harvest it all at once, or should I leave some of the stalks in place? "
3,Replanting out of control raspberries,"I recently purchased a house with a couple of rows of raspberries (which seem to be well established) in the garden. The first row on the north side was starting to disappear, so I trimmed it down expecting to take some of the many of the wild shoots that had spread to the south and start a new row.  So how do I go about plucking these shoots out of the ground and transplanting? Any special considerations for the new row, such as ground temperature, fertilizer or spacing? Should they be in a hill?   I live in western Washington state if that helps. "
4,Do Pawpaws do well in common landscape settings in hardiness zones 6B?,"I've seen wild pawpaw in VA, but never spent the time to investigate any special growing conditions. I'd love to plant them as an edge plant here in NY, but I've never seen them around here. I'm wondering if there's a good reason for that absence.  So, is it possible to grow them productively on Long Island?  What are the soil, lighting, fertility, and watering requirements?  How far from optimal could conditions vary while still producing fruit? "
5,Have a grafted fruit tree. Want to have less of one of the fruits,"I have a fruit tree whose primary trunk is pomelo fruit and the grafted trunk is Lemon. It's a reasonably large tree (35ft as a guess).  I don't much like the pomelo fruit and don't really eat them. I can't really reach the whole tree, so the fruit drops off and makes a bit of a mess. I get out there and clean up the dropped fruit on the weekends, but it attracts rodents and such as well. All around, a little more annoying than beneficial.  On the other hand, I love the lemons and would hate to lose them. Planting a new lemon-only tree would presumably take a long time to reach the size of this current tree.  How aggressively can I prune the pomelo branches without killing the lemon? Will the lemon be able to support the root/trunk of the tree if I cut back the pomelo completely?  Added photo. The left hand 'trunk' is the lemon and the more vertical larger trunk is the pomelo. "
6,"I accidentally froze my papaya seeds, how will it affect them?","I scooped out a bunch of seeds from a fresh papaya (a very good one, seems like prime genetic material). I didn't have time to clean them right away, so I put them in the fridge to prevent the pieces of pulp and sarcotesta around them from decomposing and smelling until I could clean them.  My fridge is a bit unstable, and it turns out the seeds ended up below zero. Probably only by a few degrees, at worst. They would have been in that state only for a few hours. However, ice crystals had formed on them, and the pouch had hardened a little bit.  I have now taken them out to thaw. How will this episode affect germination?  And if a plant does sprout from these seeds, can it be any different because of it?  Update: They sprouted! This subject now continues on Biology SE. "
7,How do I grow root vegetables in pots/grow-bags?,"We have a flat (apartment) with no garden, but would love to grow root vegetables such as potatoes and carrots. Is it possible to grow these in a pot, container or grow-bag, or do they need too much depth for this?  If it is possible, what containers would be recommended? I assume deep pots - but would those get enough drainage? "
8,How often should I fertilize my lawn?,"How often should I fertilize my lawn? Should I follow a certain schedule? I have heard of people fertilizing on around holidays [US: Easter (sometime in April), Memorial day (last week of May), fourth of July, Labor day (first week of September)].   "
9,Why do small fruit fall off chilli plants?,"My chilli plants are flowering and producing fruit now.  However, some of the very young fruit regularly fall off. They are not very big, probably no more than 2mm in diameter. But they definitely taste of chillies.  On some plants the rate of successful fruit out number the rate of failed fruit, on other plants it's the other way around.  Is there something that can be done to improve the rate of successful fruit?  Or is this just the way of chilli plants?  Edit:  So here are pictures I took this morning. all my plants sit on the balcony, but the glass on the railing is tinted. I can get ull sun light by moving my plants back from the railing.  I've actually done some comparisons and it seems like the tint filters out enough light, that if I move my plants into full sun, they can get sunburnt.    Here's a slightly yellow stem. This will probably fall off in the next few days. The stem will detach from the plant. There's a tiny little nub of a chilli in there.    I'm in Sydney and the weather is pretty crazy at the moment.  Edit 2:  I have been hand pollinating and just seeing how things progress. More flowers started turning into fruit but I also had more tiny buds drop off. Then there was a huge storm and the temperature dropped quite drastically for a couple of days and there was a lot of yellowing of leaves.  At this stage I think it's the temperature fluctuations giving me issues. "
10,Why is my guava plant producing sour fruit?,My guava plant is producing sour fruit. Is this because of a nutrient deficiency or because of the type of plant? How can I grow sweet guava fruit? 
11,Is it possible to reuse rockwool cubes?,"Small rockwool cubes are very cheap, but the bigger ones can be a bit expensive. Is it possible to reuse the cubes? How is it possible to remove the old roots? What kind of cleaning is necessary? "
12,Covering soil of Ponytail Palm,"I recently acquired a ponytail palm, which is alive, though it wasn't taken care of well prior to my acquisition. One thing I noticed is that the pot was covered in rocks, that appear to be fused together to make some sort of covering over the soil.  I'd imagine that the covering was intended to help lock moisture into the soil, but ponytail palms, like all succulents, have their own ways of holding moisture and prefer drier soil. Could this rock covering be harmful to its roots and promote mold and root rot? Or should I remove it to allow the soil to dry and air normally?  Edit: I'm growing this plant inside (upstate NY), and I have it on a shelf so it can get direct light most of the day. It's in a typical ceramic pot with one hole at the bottom - seems to drain well. And the dirt inside feels dry to the touch (though I'm not sure of the last time it was watered).    "
13,How do I encourage lawn seeds to germinate successfully?,"I'm trying to repair some patches in my lawn with grass seeds, but I can't seem to get the seeds to germinate. Is there anything that can be done to encourage germination?  In addition, the weather has been really changeable of late, so it's wet and cold for a few days and then hot and dry for others. Is there anything I can do to give the grass some consistent warmth and moisture?  "
14,Is it safe to grow food plants near the road?,"I have been told that debris/pollution from the road will find its way into my plants, but I don't know how much to be concerned about this.  We have a nice porch which could be used as a vegetable garden, but it is near a side street. It is, however, elevated from the street by a good 10-15'. Should I be concerned about toxins in my food?  What about a planter that is much closer? My neighbors have a vegetable garden that is set back about 20' from a major road (45 mph), at ground level. Should they be concerned? "
15,Should I replace my Colorado Blue Spruces?,"I have two Colorado Blue spruces, both looked to be damaged at installation. One is missing about 2 feet area of twigs near the top. They looked to have broken off during transit? The other has had its top broken off.  Should I rip them out and start again? Will the side branches grow back again? Will it look terrible?  They are both around 13 feet tall.  Thanks     "
16,When planting is it good to use one pot for each plant or one large common pot?,I'm trying to plant some vegetables in my second floor balcony. I have one container for each plant. Is this the best method or should I go for one long common container to plant all of them? What are the advantages and disadvantages? 
17,What can cause the leaves of a rose bush to turn black and fall off?,"I bought a small rose bush on Mother's Day this year and planted it in my flower garden. The area probably has too much shade for a full sun plant, but I don't think that is the issue here.  Shortly after planting, its leaves began to develop black splotches and fall off. The leaves are mostly gone at this point. What happened, and is there anything I can do to help it recover?  EDIT: I noticed last night that all of the leaves had fallen off and some new ones were starting to show up. What can I do to prevent these leaves from developing the same mold? Is now the time to apply manure tea or should I wait? "
18,How long before poisons like Round-up become inert?,"If I spray some grass with a poison like Round-up or Kills All, how long before that spray is not dangerous to plants?  So for example, if after spraying, I walk through the sprayed area and then onto my lawn, how long until I am not going to be leaving ""foot prints of death""? "
19,Can leaves absorb light from below as easily as from above?,"I'm considering trying to improve my indoor herb growing.  It seems that under certain conditions, one could easily run strings of LED lights at the soil surface, which would allow for the plants to grow tall without the complexity of an overhead support structure.  Plus, I think it would look pretty cool.  My question is: can you grow small plants with the lighting coming from below the leaves? (assuming that the lighting is bright enough within the bands that chlorophyll will absorb).  I would think this would affect the plant's growth pattern; has anyone here tried this, or found records of those who have? "
20,Different plant compatibility and care,"I've recently bought a few seeds: including that of Endive ( Endivia Ruffec ), lettuce, chicory, chard, cactus, and a flowering plant with the scientific name of Viola Tricolor.   Which plants have similar requirements and can grow in the same pot? And what are the general care guidelines for the "" compatible batch ""? (I'll ask a separate question for the plant(s) that aren't compatible) . Our weather is typically 50-60's F during winter , but we're on the verge of spring and the weather has been sunny with temperatures between 70-90F during daytime.  "
21,How do I safely eradicate mold without hurting cactus seedlings?,"Here are some of my seedlings, sown a little bit less than a month ago. As you can see, there's mold starting to form. I am using the baggie method whereby the pot with the seeds is enclosed in a Ziploc bag, to maintain high humidity and protect from contamination. What would be an easy way to get rid of the mold without hurting the seedlings? Someone suggested to use hydrogen peroxide, but I'm not sure it's safe for the seedlings. Ideas?   "
22,Is mulch in the desert a good idea?,"I am getting wildly conflicting information on mulch. Some sources say that it starves plants, keeps rainfall from reaching the soil, grows mold, rots tree trunks, and feeds termites. Other sources say it's critical in a desert environment like mine (15f-105f, 7"" of rain per year on average)--that it prevents weeds, keeps moisture in the soil, and prevents erosion.  In the past few years I've tried various wood mulch strategies for large expanses of bare soil: deep (6""+) and shallow (1-2"") wood mulch and pine straw. So far I have not gotten great results:   The ground does not stay moist with any method. The mulch seems to soak up all the water and the ground is dry a day after rain. My worst weeds (Bindweed and Silver Nightshade) are not impacted, even with with deep heavy wood mulch. Less competitive weeds like Tribulus Terrestris are prevented, though (thank goodness). Termites like to eat the wood mulch, not so much the pine straw mulch.   However, in places where I water (like around trees), the mulch does break down and become great soil. But in places that receive only natural irrigation, it does not break down, and the weeds take over. Why do so many desert gardeners swear by heavy mulch? I don't get it. Why am I not getting their results? "
23,How to plant a new lawn on a hillside?,"I have a hill beside my house with an approximate 25% grade.  What steps can I take to get a new lawn planted on this hillside, without it being washed away with erosion?  Would I need to put some kind of straw-like covering over it and secure that to the ground with stakes, or should just planting the seeds, fertilizing and watering be enough? "
24,How do I grow a basil plant tall?,"In my workplace we have a competition on who can grow their basil plant the tallest in 9 weeks. I know next to nothing about gardening, so I would appreciate tips. The plants are store bought, so already ""grown up"" (mine is 14 cm).  Here are my questions and musings so far:   The pot it came in is quite small. Could I benefit from replanting it in a larger pot? Should I put a lamp over it and cover the sides in something dark, forcing it upwards? Do I need a special lamp or is any lamp ok, including LED? I suppose I should tie it up to a stick to help it stabilize? Should I use fertilizer or some nutrition other than just water? Could I benefit from hanging it upside-down, with a lamp underneath, to make gravity stretch it? I read about someone growing marijuana saying that you can make a plant grow larger by pruning the lower leaves. Is this true? Can I stretch the plant somehow? Perhaps if I combine hanging it upside down and tying a small weight to it? (I like this idea :)   And also the basics:   How much should I water it? (I think basil should be watered from below) How much sun and warmth does it need? If I use a lamp, should I turn it off X hours each day? How strong should the lamp be?  "
25,How do I grow chilis in limited light?,"I have been growing a few varieties of chili pepper (incl. Scotch Bonnets) in my garden since April (Spring). Due to trees, other houses, etc., they only get about 6 hours of direct sunlight a day.  Is this amount of sunlight sufficient? Is there anything I can do to help them? "
26,How do I encourage my Florence fennel to produce fat bulbs?,"I have some Florence fennel in my garden that tends to grow very fast in height and to make flowers, but the base stays relatively thin.  What should I do to encourage the growth of a ""fat"" bulb in order to have a better harvest? Does it help to cut it from time to time? "
27,What is causing the weird bubbles on my pepper seedling's stem?,"Any recommendations you have would be appreciated.  I'm assuming this is bad and will kill the plant? :(  The pepper seedlings have been indoors their entire lives (a few weeks). Not all of them have these bubbles on them, and some aren't nearly as covered as this one. Is there anything that can be done for this or any of them? If not, how do I prevent this in the future? Would less water help?  Click photo for full size   "
28,Grapes leaves too dry - is that normal?,"Recently I noticed my green grapes leaves don't look too good. There's nothing like scales or ants or any other sign of parasites. Only older leaves are affected, new ones are fine as you can see on the photos.   Do I need to give it more water? Add some fertiliser? Or is it just normal?      I'm in Sydney, Australia. It's end of summer here now.  "
29,Why do my Cherry tomatoes split as they ripen?,"It doesn't matter what I do, my Cherry tomatoes always seem to have many of them crack when/as they ripen. I have tried everything - more sun, less sun, more water, less water, different varieties etc. It only seems to happen badly with Cherry tomatoes. I am not talking about the occasional crack that sometimes happens early on the fruit is green and then heals to forms a dry scar over time. This is the kind of splitting that happens suddenly, just when the fruits become ready to pick. Is this a common problem? Does anyone have a solution? What might I be doing wrong? "
30,Damage to Arboerivities,"I have flat cedars/Arborivitaes in front of my house planted 5’ above the road and 5 ft back from the road stand 30’ h.  Recently the town redid our blacktop road by heating and relaying the top layer, in doing so they severly burnt the entire side of the trees.  Will they grow back? I tried to post pictures but your site says too large.  Is there another way I send pictures?😥 "
31,How closely related do plants have to be for grafting purposes?,I have a lovely trunk / rootstock that I want to use for bonsai. It is a field maple (acer campestre). I don't particularly want to foliage though.   I will have (hopefully at the end of the season) some Japanese maple (acer palmatum) saplings. Would it be possible to graft these saplings to the field maple seeing as they are both acers? Or do they have to be more closely related? 
32,Is this discoloration on a pumpkin plant stem caused by squash vine borer?,"I have a big, healthy looking pumpkin plant with a dozen small pumpkins starting to bud.  Today I went in and got a good look at the base of the vine and found this discoloration. Is this squash vine borer? If so, how can I save the plant?      So I did the surgery and found no worm and no frass in there. It looks like a healthy vine, right? And the leaves are still growing like crazy and not wilted. The flowers are big and healthy. So, false alarm? I buried it with dirt where I sliced it and hopefully we will have pumpkins in the fall. "
33,Can this plant be transplanted or is it too mature?,"I have a plant (not sure what species) that was badly positioned when it was planted. Because of heavy wind, it is constantly injuring the neighboring pepper tree, and vice versa.    It is about 50 cm (about 1'8"") tall.   Can I transplant it with a reasonable chance of success?  How would I go about it, how should I dig?   I'm nervous because I've ruined plants this way before.  "
34,Orchid on branch: What carrier could work?,"A few years ago I had an orchid that was sold mounted on a cork plaque and did very well - until it was stolen. So I know how to care for them and what to expect (not my question).  I can get my hands on a few Phalaenopsis and Dendrobium nobile keikis that need a new home and am tempted to try again, this time mounting them myself. From what I read on the web, keikis are especially suited for mounting, as they never were potted and therefore don't have to deal with changing conditions.  But I'm still wavering as to what to choose as the base:  I'd love to use ""the right"" branch and find it myself instead of ordering something off the internet. We live in a rural area and I can get my hands on a lot of natural materials.   My current list of ""candidates"" looks like this:   Oak (Quercus robur) Texture-wise my first choice, but how about the tannins in the bark? Oak was used for tanning leather, after all, would this affect the roots? I wouldn't want to ""tan"" them... Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) Also with a nice texture, but would the orchid's roots cause the small layers of the bark to separate, thus leading to instability? I'm only marginally worried about the resin as pine bark is a main component in most commercial orchid mixes. Grape vine (Vitis vinifera) I have seen orchids on grape ""trunks"", so I know it's doable. For me, that would probably be the hardest to get my hands on. But does it contain chemical residue after decades of commercial wine production? And if so, would it affect the orchid? (I'm not planning on eating the orchid, of course, so it's about the plant's well-being, not mine...!) Apple or Plum (Malus domestica / Prunus domestica) Currently my favourite, because  really easy to get and with a wide choice for ""the perfect piece"". I think the bark is reasonably coarse given the right cut and it should be pesticide free (meadow orchard). Would the moss and lichen that's often on the older branches be a problem? Should it be scrubbed off or can it stay for additional visual interest? Some random piece of fallen timber or root, left outside until the bark fell off and it turned whiteish  (The landlocked equivalent of driftwood, so to speek.) Arguably the choice with the ""most visual appeal"", but would it be too hard and smooth for the orchids to ""get a good grip""?   Any comments on my plans? What would be a good choice and why? Did I forget something? Would any bark fall off eventually, thus risking the stability of the orchid fixed to it? Commercial cork plaques are only bark, so no risk of separation. On the other hand, our local botanical garden / zoo has many of it's orchids on tree branches and this seems to work fine.  Or should I simply put the keikis in a nice pot and forget about this plan? "
35,What is a good method for rapidly cloning White Pumpkin plants?,"I have six particular 40-day-old white pumpkin plants. I need to multiply these particular plants as rapidly as possible -- It's at least another month or two before I can extract viable seeds.  Am I better off utilizing the bury-the-vine method? I am a bit concerned about what stage (how large) a pumpkin plant should be at before burying portions.  There is also the method that involves cutting the plant, dipping in root hormone, and placing in a greenhouse environment to supposedly promote new root development. I believe this method could multiple faster if it worked, but I'm hesitant to waste the effort on this if the bury-the-vine method is more suitable.   "
36,Why are the leaves of my fig trees drying and falling off?,I have several fig trees. Some of them seem to be contracting some sort of illness - leaves dry and fall off completely.     This does not seem to weather or water related. Watering them does not help and others that had no water at all are doing great.  Two trees that had the problem when I moved here last summer have since recovered but now two previously healthy trees have it.  Is this an illness? Should I be worried? Is there anything I can do except wait? 
37,How do I grow multiple generations of lima beans?,"I am working on a school project and was wondering how fast can I grow lima beans indoor? What would be the minimum and maximum water, light and other nutrition I can expose them too? Do they need to grow aligned and how far apart should I plant them?  Once the lima beans grow, can I get the immature beans inside the pod and regrow a second generation and so on? How would I do this? "
38,"Tulip bulbs, plant them late or keep them until next year","I've got a bunch of bulbs from tulips and other early-bloomers, that I 'forgot' to plant last November.   By now it's almost March, and I wonder, should I plant them now, or should I keep them until next fall. In other words, will they still be okay next fall, and don't I risk that they start growing in their packaging? And if I plant them now, will they still bloom? "
39,What is the point of a greenhouse?,"How does putting my plants in a greenhouse help them grow? Is it purely to shield them from cold weather, or are there other benefits? "
40,How could I estimate the age of a natural olive europaea sylvestris bonsai?,"Today I found two natural bonsai of olive europaea. I think that it is the sylvestris variety based on the fact that the distance between the leaves is very small. Also, the way the leaves are arranged is more similar to the sylvestris variety than to the normal one that it's cultivated where I live.   Even if I'm not an expert in bonsai, I think that this is a real one and not a young tree because it's strongly branched, like an old tree. It seems just a smaller version of a bigger wild one. I found it on an old macera (a type of stone wall), so without much soil.  How could I know how old is it? If I put some photos here are you able to tell it (I didn't have a phone, so I didn't take any picture of it)? "
41,What is this growing on my arborvite,What is this growing on my arborvitae? Is it good or bad?  My trees have lots of them.     
42,Is drainage needed for a new lawn on compacted clay?,"I am in the process of creating a lawn at the back of my house. The previous owner had paved and stoned the area. The size is about 30ft by 40ft, it is raised from the level of the house by about 2ft, with steps leading up (see pic 1). It was 50/50 split of stone and paved.  I have removed the membrane and most of the stones from the stone area. I have lifted up all the patio flags and now there is about 4"" of hardcore that was supporting the flags. I can also see from the level of my neighbour's garden area that the previous owner has dug down about 6-7ft to create this space (see pic 2).  What this means is there is no top soil. As the area has been dug out to 6-7ft the base is compacted clay. A few stones from the stone area are sitting on top of the clay and all hardcore remains from the flag area.  What is the next step after clearing this area? I was thinking I could just level out the stones and hardcore over the clay evenly. Get top soil for about 6"" coverage and then sow seed. Is this enough or do I need to do anything extra regarding the clay? Do I need to consider some type of drainage?  After some rainfall I can see a few areas of water that have not cleared after a day.  These aren't large areas, just a few puddles.  Pic 1    Pic 2      Any responses appreciated from novice gardener "
43,Is it too late to plant my avocado plant in soil?,"I have had my avocado plant in water for 6 months now on my window sill and it has grown to be about 30cm. However the bottom leaves are hanging and have slight brown spots, the second set of leaves are thinner and slightly curly whilst a third set is currently about to grow out. I assume this is because it is still in water? Will it be able to readjust if I plant it in soil at this point? Be a shame to see it go. "
44,What factors affect the spiciness of jalapeños?,"Researching growing jalapeños, I've seen people mention how water-starving your jalapeño plants can lead to spicier peppers. How true is this? If there's any truth to it, what tips can you provide about watering amounts? How much is too little? Does this vary by the growth stage of the plant?  What other factors affect the spiciness of peppers? "
45,Is a northwest facing porch a good place for a miniature rock garden?,"I am thinking about planting Hens and Chicks and the likes in this planter that is on my porch. The orientation is north west, so it gets some sun in the afternoon and it gets rain every now and then when the direction of the rain allows it.    Is this a good place for a miniature rock garden? What do I need to know before attempting to do this? "
46,Some of my ferns have brown spots on the tips of their leaves. What causes that?,"I have a few ferns with long pointed leaves, and their tips have turned brown. The plant is otherwise healthy, and is actively growing.   What is causing that? Should I worry about it? "
47,Is peat moss nutritious enough for tomato seedlings?,"I have a seed starter kit with a wicking system.  The kit came with a peat moss mix and I have purchased some new peat moss pellets for starting seeds.  I know that peat does not really contain any nutrients for the plants.  If I am simply using a typical liquid plant food as fertilizer, is that good enough for a month or two of growing?  Do I need to transplant quicker to larger pots with more nutrient rich medium?  Would using a hydroponic fertilizer, which contains much more trace elements/minerals, be a better option? "
48,Get rid of weeds from my raised garden bed - without pesticides,"I bought a house that came with a rather large (8' x 50') raised (well, raised only 4"") garden bed. It is infested with weeds. Last summer I planted some vegetables in it but spent most of the time pulling out weeds. I dumped a bunch of woodchips over the soil to try to help with managing the weeds, and only spread the parts where I was planting my veggies and then covered up around them when they grew taller. It worked somewhat, but I have much more success keeping my used car tire planters, that have fresh soil, weed free.  Assuming that I am not interested in eating chemicals, what is the best way to move forward? My wife wants me to get rid of the tires since they are an eye sore. Should I remove all the existing soil and get new soil? Or should I get more woodchips? Are there any tricks of the trade here? I'm ok starting with a fresh slate and replanting anew.  Thanks "
49,London garden lawn and tree positioning,"I have a west facing garden in London. The back of the garden gets sun from about 8/9am and the kitchen patio (you can just see the drainage at the bottom of the picture) gets sun from about 11am. The whole garden then gets sun apart from the left hand bed as it is shaded by the left hand fence as the sun arcs on the left of the garden until it swings rounds and sets at the back of the garden (behind the houses to the right at about 7pm) at which point the back fence generates some shade.  I am about to lay some turf this week and want to decide what the shape should be and what trees I should plant (after the lawn has settled). I then plan to buy garden on a roll Mixed Sunny Border and plant around the trees.   Garden size: Patio is w 6.6m x l 2.4m Rest of garden is w 6.6m x 12m  Below is my sketch with my current list of trees. I am trying to avoid large trees on the left that would steal my sun.    Do you think this list of trees makes sense for the size of garden? Would you suggest alternative trees instead? What do you think about the positioning? Would you suggest an alternative layout? I plan on making the back area left of the shed a veg patch, do you think the fact it gets shade at the end of the day makes this a bad idea?    Thanks so much for your help in advance!  Update in response to bamboo's helpful comments:   We wanted to add the trees to give the garden some structure (and maybe some fruit as a bonus!), they don’t have to be big, in fact the smaller / less dense the better. If this was your garden what would you do? How about we move the Veg patch to the bottom right (No7)? And an olive tree next to it? We were going to do veg patch at the back as we didn’t want to anything too permanent there as in the future we might change this into a seating area or a kid’s play area (play bark, swing, trampoline etc) On the Silver Birch – we quite like the multi-stemmed look, like this picture?     Silver Birch Betula utilis var. Jacquemontii 3ft Thoughts anyone?   On the Acer – we don’t have a strong opinion which type but love the deep purples. Something like this.   We also like the deep purple Japanese Maples, can you suggest one or the other that would work in our garden?    On the apple tree, If we got a dwarf apple, where would you suggest we put it? What about the cox orange pipin? Which rootstock would you suggest? M27? M9? On the dual plum – we were looking at one like this: Dual Plum ‘Bleue de Belgique’ + ‘Reine Claude d’Oullins’ - Tree. Would that work?     Update 2 (Sunday) Ok, I have had another go after listening to everyone's comments. What do you think?       Update 3:  Here it is:   "
50,Is it possible to grow a mango plant in the Phoenix climate?,"I've been wanting to plant a mango seed; though I live in Phoenix, Arizona.  Firstly, would a mango seed actually grow in my area? Secondly, I'm pretty new to any kind of plant life. So, does anyone have any information on germinating and planting a mango seed? "
51,What will speed the decomposition of a tree stump?,"I have two large oak tree stumps.  Will drilling them and applying sugar decompose them?  Because of their position, I cannot grind them out.    Is there anything else that will speed the effects of decomposition, for example some type of acid, plain urea or something else? "
52,At what point do seedlings start to need nutrients?,"A seed has all the food it needs to germinate so water is enough to make it grow, after that though, at what point are minerals and other nutrients needed?  I suspect the time would depend on the type of plant, but is there a general way to explain this? "
53,Yellowing of peach tree leaves,"I've read Levi's questions, and your responses; however, watering is not an issue w/my trees as we've had consistent/adequate rain all summer long, and the landscape is lush and green; a neighbor has a peach of similar size that looks very healthy.  Unlike Levi, my 2 trees were grown from pits and now are about 2 yrs old, and about 3' tall.  All the leaves, on both trees, are a consistent yellow, and have been for the entire growing season.  The trees are planted at the edge of my garden, approx 5' from our lawn, which is treated by a lawn service, which makes me wonder if they are getting inadequate/inappropriate chemicals?  Could the yellowing be caused by an iron deficiency?   "
54,Will african violet fertilizer diffuse through clay pots?,"I have several african violets in special clay pots. The pots kind of resemble a double boiler, and the lower pot is filled with water, then the upper section, containing the plant, is unglazed on its bottom half.   If I add fertilizer to the water in the lower pot, will it diffuse through the clay to the soil? Or do I need to apply it directly to the soil or directly water the violet every now and then? "

56,Growing trees from seed & cuttings,"I would like to learn and compare the different methods to grow trees from seeds. I found a good website ([website]Could anyone suggest some references? I am also very interested in learning and compare the different species of trees and shrubs that can be propagated from cuttings.   A detailed guide on the propagation of trees and shrubs, in general, with all the different ways (water propagation, air layering, from seed with stratification, etc.) would be perfect.   Thanks a lot "
57,How should I properly prepare a raised bed vegetable garden?,"When building a raised bed for a vegetable garden, what do I need to do to properly prepare the soil? It is going to be mixed with different types of vegetables and herbs that I will rotate out all year long.   Should I buy the more expensive garden soil? Or use essentially use top soil and add the necessary fertilizers? "

59,Sodding a grub-damaged area in Southwest Florida,"I've got some white grub damaged areas (I've seen some on the top of the damaged areas) in our front lawn that will need to be replaced. It's probably too late in the cycle to really do anything about the grubs now, correct?   What steps can/should I do before I get my exercise and start laying some new St. Augustine sod (which will probably have to be done over a few weekends)?  Stormy, last spring I applied an insecticide (a ""once a year"" kind, but I don't remember the brand though) when I saw some grubs on the neighbor's grass (probably ended up being the wrong time of year... should have been here sooner about it).  I'll upload a photo when I have some time, but they look like the ""C""-shaped grubs found when you Google ""lawn grubs""  Sorry for the delay... pneumonia is a bear... here's a closeup of the lawn damage. There are several patches like this, the whole area affected is about 27' x 20', but I won;t have time to do that all at once... gonna try to find some grubs today  Lawn Damage [website]Over the weekend, I tried dumping several 2 gallon buckets of soapy water onto some areas of the damaged lawn, but I didn't see any grubs come to the surface during a few hours of checking.

60,Using Pine bark mulch and Cedar mulch together,I read in many places that pine bark is light weight and heavy rain will wash out the mulch.  Can I use two layers? First layer of Pine bark and second layer on the top of Cedar mulch. So the pine bark will decompose and provide nutrition to the soil and top Cedar layer will protect the mulch and keep it in place. Is this a good idea?  Thanks. 
61,What is this disease on my carrots?,"I have just discovered that some of my carrots have this very dense presence of insects.  Are they aphids?  I have learned recently that ants love to grow aphids and I could notice some ants around aphids in other plants before. But this is different: around these carrots, there is a massive highway of ants (not sure if it is related).  What should I do about this?    "
62,What is the proper way to overseed your lawn?,"I have read all the questions to this point in the overseeding category. There are questions about if the asker is doing things right, but not about the how. What I'd like to know is:    What is the proper way to overseed your lawn?  How much seed should you be putting down (ie: x lbs of seed per 1000 square foot or some other measure)? What time of year should we be attempting to overseed? Or is it an anytime thing? How often should you attempt to overseed? Should I utilize fertilizer while overseeding? If so, what mixture would be best?   Is there anything I'm not considering?  EDIT: To clarify a few needed points at J. Musser's request ...  My location is central Virginia, USA, which means it's in Zone 3 climate wise (I believe) about 300ft above sea level, but not near the coast. Summers are very warm (temps to 100+F) and humid (upwards of 100%). Winters are cold and dry. Time of year was actually in the question ... as to, what time of you should I be doing, now you could say, considering my climate. Soil conditions are rich without much clay in the top soil (lucky one around here). Soil stays moist. I do have a mole problem at the present, but plan on trying to kill all of the grubs this spring so hopefully they will move on. I don't know what else I can add.  NOTE: I realize there is more than one question here, but since they are very much related to a single thing, I've asked here as one question. "
63,"What is this weed, and how to remove it?","Does anyone know what this is? and how I can remove it from my yard without hurting my yard?  This is in Houston Texas, it is found just through-out my yard. It is full sunlight pretty much all day, and it popped up about two weeks ago and it seems to love the rain we have been having lately.   "
64,Database/API for vegetable growing seasons?,"I'm looking for a database, (ideally an API!) that has information on the growing season of vegetables in various places. For example, what months can onions be harvested in Minneapolis? When are tomatoes in season in Atlanta?  Does such a thing exist?  Thanks! "
65,Does moss sprout leaves?,"I had some moss in one of my seedlings pot and I asked what I should do with it here in GSE. I was assured it was mostly harmless so I left it be. However, a couple of days ago, it has sprouted leaves. Does moss do that o_O? If not, what is it? Is it time to panic?    I don't think it's something independent from moss. since, as you can see, it only sprouts in the center of the moss. "
66,What is the best time to apply manure to a vegetable garden?,"I know that this question is very much vegetable-dependent, and I am aware that certain vegetables (as brassicacae in general, and root vegetables as well) do not like manure, others can be grown on a land that has been manured the previous year, etc.  My question is about the right time to apply manure. I am having 20 kg of well-rotted horse  manure delivered next sunday. I already started some peas, broadbeans, chickpeas, courgette, squashes, cauliflowers, salads and herbs indoors, and I am planning to start hardening them outside during April. For the moment almost everything is in pots or seeding trays. By the end of April I am also planning to start sowing other varieties of courgette, french runner beans, tomatoes (probably in pots) and other herbs.  In my garden I have two big beds, with clayish soil (therefore not draining excellently), but full of compost and organic matter (worms really thrive in it, and I have almost no weeds at all).  Questions:  1) When should I apply the manure to the soil? Is it best to do it now, then leave the soil covered (so that the sun doesn't get in and weeds do not develop, and to protect from weather) until I transplant my vegetable outside (in 1-2 months)?  1a) If I am planning to lime the soil before planting, when am I supposed to do it?  2) When people say manure is well-rotted, does that mean that it has been composted long enough to ensure it is safe to use it straight away in the garden?  3) Should I use some manure also for the soil I am going to use in the pots for tomatoes and some courgettes?  4) Which vegetables among those I have mentioned really could get in trouble because of the presence of manure?  Thanks a lot! "
67,Will these varieties of mulberry survive the UK climate?,"I recently became aware of two varieties of mulberries with very long fruit which are supposed to be very tasty. They are known as Taiwan and Pakistan mulberries.  I can't seem to find much information on these varieties specific to the UK climate. Does anyone know if they are hardy like the common Black Mulberry? If so, where to buy them online and have them shipped to the UK? "
68,How to prevent avocado from drying out indoors?,"I have an avocado plant that has grown indoors since it was a pit. It grew first in a badly insulated, north-facing, wet and cool house, where it grew splendidly. After I moved it to a well insulated house with central heating and lots of light, the avocado began to act sick.  The symptoms were drying of leaves from the tip to the stalk with wavy patterns on the edge (the remaining green area, gradually reduced, would thus look like a oak leaf).  I first suspected that the drying of leaves meant I had drowned the roots, so I gave it less water. Then I read somewhere the symptoms could be a fungus, the only cure for which would be some bouillie Bordelaise, which I prepared and sprayed on the plant.  The next year the avocado grew new leaves, but by the end of summer, they got brown again. By then I thought the problem may have been the atmosphere at home, too dry perhaps. So I sprayed the avocado several times daily to keep it cool and humid. It didn't help either however.   This year I pruned the tree and it grew new sprouts which dried out in turn. It didn't even get the chance to grow them. The dehydratation this year looks different however, it is not brownish, it is dark green and dry.  I'm really confused, I've tried many different things and don't really know what to do now. What has caused this change? I can only think of the climate change, but funnily an avocado is a semi-tropical plant from meso-america, it should love sun and heat right? I really am attached to this tree and would like to do my best to help it grow. If you could help, I would really be happy for it. Thanks.  Update:  Here is a picture of a smaller plant which has similar symptoms (the larger one has lost all its leaves):   There is another picture I found on line too.  Edit July 21st, 2011: I have transplanted the large plant into a new light humus soil. I can't get a clay pot for now, so I used the same plastic pot and made 4 x 5 cm diameter holes at the bottom. Water runs through now. Hopefully that will help.    The following picture's blurry, but the tip of the young leaves are drying and curling at the tip:    Update July 30th, 2011:  I have not watered the plant a second time since changing the soil, which is still humid today.  The plant's young leaves are drying out further as you can see from this picture (compare with above).    There are a number or new sprouts however, but I'm afraid they'll suffer the same fate.    Further help would be appreciated. "
69,How important is it to install an irrigation system during a new build?,"We're building a new house in Lenexa, Kansas (southwest side of Kansas City). Our yard is larger than average, and the cost for the builder to put in an irrigation system is $4,250. I'm debating on if we should do it now or not.   How much does having it done later add to the cost?  How badly does it mess up your yard when it is put in? How important do you think it is in this part of the country to have an irrigation system?   Our lot is roughly a half acre (a little under I believe). It's a fairly irregular shape. There's a cul-de-sac on one end and then the back is angled from the middle of the cul-de-sac to the neighbors on the other side. I don't really know how to describe the soil. It's not clay, and it isn't terribly rocky. We don't intend to have any veggie or flower beds away from the front porch of the house. Also, the land is pretty level. "
70,Can I harvest and plant vegetable seeds in the same season?,"I have some plants (cilantro, lettuce) that have already gone to seed.  Am I able to plant these seeds immediately or would I need to wait until next season?  My question is not about the length of the growing season, but more about the ""seed dormancy"" period.  Is there a good general resource that would help me answer this question for other plants as well?  Update: I have five healthy looking lettuce plants and one cilantro growing!  I would still like to find some more info on seed dormancy, but for at least these two plants, the answer seems to be that you can plant immediately. "
71,"Is it worth treating non-germinating seeds, or should I just toss them? Watering new seeds?","I have some seeds of Sage and Parsley in two separate pots. I tried to plant them as the seed bag recommended, but nothing has come out of the dirt. In some other pots, I have Basil, Dill, Cilantro, and Oregano, all of which have come up and are about 2-3 inches tall at this point. I would estimate it's been 25-30 days since I planted them (all of them, at the same time).  I think the time has come to give up on the Sage and Parsley, but is there anything I can do for it? Should I pick the seeds out of the dirt and soak them in water or something?  Should I have been watering dirt with seeds in it? I gave all my seeds the same process. First, I soak the dirt that will go in the pot overnight so it's very saturated. The next morning I put the dirt in the pots and let it drip through the bottom hole. A few hours after that I sowed the seeds to a depth recommended by the particular seed bag. A few of the seeds were soaked in a cup of water beforehand, as recommended by the bag. After I did that, I covered the pots with plastic wrap, put them in the window, and left them alone until I saw shoots come up, then I removed the plastic wrap. This worked fine for most of my plants but for Sage and Parsley, nothing happened after a week or so, so I dripped a bit more water on to the top. Was that a bad idea? The top of the soil felt dry but I'm a bit of an amateur so I'm not sure...  Edit: I forgot to mention, my Rosemary (treated similarly) has also not sprouted yet.  "

75,Can I force a dormant forsythia branch to bloom by bringing it inside?,"I live in Massachusetts, where we have approximately three feet of snow in the yard, and the temperature has been well below freezing nearly every day for the last two months. In an article in yesterday's local newspaper, a horticulturist wrote that even though our forsythias will likely flower later than usual this year, a branch can be forced to bloom now by bringing it inside. Is that true? If so, what would be the proper procedure? "
76,Can I save this crop of broccoli that bolted early?,"We've been having a yo-yo spring (temperature-wise) here in Central Texas and our Packman Hybrid broccoli, which is in a raised bed and kept under a plastic frame on cold days, just decided to bolt. I'm guessing that when it got warmer yesterday and we failed to remove the cover, it got a bit warm due to the greenhouse effect and decided to flower.    Other than cutting off the main head and hoping to get some small side offshoots, is there anything to do? Should we just tear it all out and go ahead and plant something different?  This is our first attempt at broccoli... and, honestly, our first serious attempt at vegetable growing. We'd always been concerned about the broccoli bolting so it wasn't unexpected, just want to know where to go from here. "

I had a wild guess that it was a Frailea, but having looked at all the recognized species of the genus, I didn't find any that looks like it. Does anyone have an idea what this might be?  Update: It has bloomed this spring and the ID can be confirmed. It is indeed Rebutia heliosa. Thank you!  "
79,How often do you need to turn the compost heap?,"If you have a compost heap, how often should you turn it? Does it make a difference if it's a simple heap (a mound on the ground) or in a tumbler?  Alternately, is it even necessary to turn the heap? "
80,"New construction with sloped subsoil yard, best way to go about growing grass?","I recently purchased a new construction home. The backyard came unfinished and the yard is sloping away from the house.  From what it looks like, the yard is subsoil, it looks like it's essentially all the stuff building debris/rocks scraped off the land when the developers were building/grading the foundation.  Grass obviously can't grow on this so I assume I will need tons of topsoil prior to grading/seeding (4 inches?) I live in the Pacific Northwest so we get a lot of rain during the winter season so erosion and runoff is generally a concern on a sloped backyard.  I recently finished spraying glysophate 41% (roundup) on the whole yard, I expect it to die out in a week or two. I assume I need to pull all the weeds out prior to adding the top soil, I will also have to remove the large rocks/roots/general debris from the subsoil.  My question is, should I be tilling the subsoil prior to adding the topsoil? If so, how much inches? Or should I be adding the topsoil then tilling it directly into the subsoil?   Any recommendations or techniques on how to make the topsoil stay on the sloped hill?? It's roughly 30-40 degree slope.  Any advice is greatly appreciated. My end goal is to have a grass seeded in September.   edit: Pictures here - [website]You can see how the fence slopes to get an idea of the hill. I plan on putting a garden bed on a majority of the slope with trees/shrubs/mulch and maybe have stairs to the right of the house. The picture of the dirt was with the rake, I pretty much can't really ""dig"" at all. Water does pond up on some parts from what I have seen. "

82,What type of fruit tree is this?,"  This tree is growing in Escambia county(in panhandle of Fl). It is, roughly measured by comparing to our 6ft tall fence, about 10-12ft tall. It is growing in my neighbors yard but it grows over the fence, dropping the fruits into our yard when they are ripe every late summer. I am assuming it is a fruit tree, but I don't know what kind. Are the fruits safe to eat? It is probably 7-10yrs old, but I'm no tree age expert. The flowers were a dark color, maybe a brown/maroon? I didn't think to take pictures of it when they were blooming so maybe that was the flower color just before turning to fruits. Thank you for the help.  "
83,How much damage did I do to my Maple Tree?,"I received some bad advice from a neighbor and now I want to know how much damage did I do and also ask for some advice on what I can do to help ensure the tree doesn’t die. I live in NC and have about a 20 foot red maple tree (I think that’s what tree it is) in my front yard. The surface roots were getting really bad in some areas, growing near  my house and sidewalks. I counted about 8 surface roots that it had. After getting the bad advice, I ended up cutting 4 of them about 2 feet from the base of the tree. 2 of them were almost 4 inches in diameter and the tree itself is 6 inches in diameter.  Did I kill my tree or can it be saved?  And advice on what I can do to help the tree?  Or did I just kill it?  Thanks for any help and I just wish I would of gotten on here before I cut them :(.   "
84,"Should I clean pruning shears with hot water, alcohol, or similar?","Should one (occasionally) clean pruning shears with hot water, alcohol, or similar?  I am imagining pruning is a bit like plant surgery (see also here), so precautions similar to regular surgery may apply in principle.  For the time being I am just wiping mine clean after use, and the same tools serve e.g. for pruning both lavender and vines. "
85,Why is the purple becoming a dingy green on my wandering Jew?,"  It was getting full direct sunglight out on my porch. I’ve moved it inside and am trying to give it indirect, bright sunlight. If too much direct sun is the reason for this when should I expect it to recover ? Or perhaps it is root bound ? "
86,"Will a galvanized container leach Zinc and ""Trim"" the roots? Are there other effects?","I have heard that a galvanized container such as this one for a raised bed will leach zinc and ""trim"" the roots. What do they mean by this?   Would the increased zinc be bad for raising food plants? I was planning on growing bamboo in them but having a couple more for  food plots would be awful convenient.   "
87,How can I encourage my indoor vermicomposting bin to produce more dirt?,"I have an indoor vermicomposting bin. It has served me well for 3 years. Since the bin is indoors, and I live in a small apartment, I'm fairly cautious with feeing the worms. I don't want to overwhelm my red wigglers or cause anaerobic decay.  But this spring I'm expanding the garden out on the roof and I need more dirt. This seems like a simple thing, but in NYC there aren't many sources of dirt except for ... buying it. Which I can't stand. That's why I started with the worms in the first place.  Is there a way to ramp up the bin for higher production? Many guides online talk about making worm food out of old ground dry soy beans that have gone stale, and other pantry items. But these are geared for making fat bait worms and that isn't my goal. Also I'd never use my babies as bait!  In any case, how can I go about getting the worms to have more offspring and eat more? What scraps are fairly safe to bulk up on for indoor set ups?  Right now I put in kitchen cuttings, but if I end up with a bad head of lettuce I might skip it since it seems like too much.  I have lots of cardboard, peanut shells, wilted leafy greens etc. I just need some advice about how to go about adding more to the system without throwing it out of whack or making a big stench.   Also, how aggressively can I harvest?  I really need to get more dirt over the next two months.  "
88,Methods of Composting,"What are different methods to composting? I heard there is a little more than just throwing stuff on a pile. So what is the differences between any methods. And also, what is safe to put in a compost bin? How long does it need to sit till its ready for use? This would all be very helpful to know, thanks! "

91,How do I know when and how much to aerate my lawn?,"I have a section of my lawn which seems prone to standing water, grass that doesn't grow very quickly, and seems very hard-packed. I think it's probably in desperate need of aeration.  What is the proper way to know when and how much to aerate? Also, since I have a small lawn, is there such a thing as a small lawn aerator and will it get the job done?  Edit:  As it turns out, there is a small aerator, like this one:    I purchased one recently and it works rather well. Obviously not a good choice for a sizable lawn, but for my small lawn this worked extremely well. I'm seeing some improvement already in the grass gradually becoming more green. "
92,"Unknown pest identification - eggs? On a grape vine, UK","Something has laid eggs (I think?) on my grape vine.      They are all over the main branches of this vine, which is decades old.

It has a nice garden in the back yard and when we moved in in July 2014 there were 4 healthy ferns pleasing my eye.  Now, with winter having passed, they all seem to be dead and I do not know when exactly that happen.  I tried to search google for clues about why this might happen, but could not find anything.  Could anyone tell me if this is a normal thing or not (are ferns supposed to not survive English winter?). Could it be a disease?

94,Whats the name of this plant and is it edible?,"Today i was wandering over a random meadow located outside the city of Groningen, The Netherlands. I was checking out some oak trees until i suddenly noticed these small plants between the grass that resembled field lettuce. The whole meadow was full of them! At a point i really started to wonder what they taste like, so i plucked one of the leaves and stuck it in my mouth. The plant had a very fresh mildly sweet acidic taste and i kind of enjoyed eating it to be honest. I kept on eating it until i realized that i really don't know what this plant is despite being so damn delicious. It could be a highly toxic plant! But its been about 5 hours since consumption now and i'm still not feeling sick so i guess its either not toxic or i just havn't consumed enough of it to feel its toxic effects on my body. Hence the question: What is the name of this plant, and is it edible? And if its edible, how nutricious is it? I want to harvest more of these plants so that i can put them in my salads. I really like the taste of this plant! Anyway, heres a photo of the plant.   "
95,Dahlia question,I'm asking for a friend who is puzzled.  She purchased this dahlia five years ago.  The first four year all the tips of the petels were uniformly white as she expected.  She divided the tubers at the end of season last year. This year they have been coming up with random white tips.  Any thoughts on why this happened? Is it a type of reversion? Or perhaps something caused by the division?  Someone suggested it might be caused by something in the soil she added last year.

Compared to other trees in neighboring lots, planted at the same age at the same time, they are notably stunted, short, and devoid of many branches. They are alive and well, with new growth and green leaves, but are not growing taller and branching.  I suspect a soil problem, but it could also be due to a history of underwatering.  What steps can I take to turn these trees around, and help them grow properly? (Or is the damage done and it's too late?) "
97,Help with identifying weird tree,"We’ve had 3 or 4 arborists over to the house for tree work over the years and we always make sure to ask if they know what one type of tree is.

98,How are weeds controlled in a butterfly garden?,"I have a large packet of a large assortment of seeds growing in a prepared bed.  Probably 20 different varieties of flower for a ""Butterfly Garden"" which I have scattered in the plot.    I don't mind weeding it, although I would like to know that I am pulling out weeds.   For instance, it has some sort of clover in the bag, and I have clover growing all over my lawn, but not usually in the garden, should I pull out half the clover in the garden?    The packet also says to make sure the plot is weed free, but how can I tell if a plot is going to be weed free before the weeds grow?  So far the only thing I know to pull is grass... "
99,Prune baby kumquat (citrus) tree,"Just for the fun of it I threw a kumquat seed in a pot, and it has actually grow quite a bit. I know you should ideally graft cuttings onto rootstock and not start from seed. But I just did it for the fun of it.   Now I wonder if I should start pruning it? When I transplanted It to the current pot I cut the top of cuz I lost many roots moving it, so it has now got two main branches.  While it has grown quite tall (about 1meter) it's not thicker than a pencil.   Should I cut it down, or let it continue growing?    "
100,Harvesting Baby spinach,"I'm growing some spinach this year. Compared to the baby spinach we get in the store, my plants already have leaves the same size. Yet there are only 6 leaves total.  My question is, can I pinch off these baby leaves, and will the plant keep producing new leaves? Can I keep doing this for a while, and keep getting baby leaves? Obviously I wouldn't take too much, wanting to keep the plant growing. Maybe just pinch off the two biggest leaves. "
101,Is it sensible to do composting in a grow bag or pot which already has plants planted in it?,"I've taken a half liter soft drink bottle, cut off the bottom portion of it and created holes at the bottom and created top-vents like the ventilation that pipe composting needs.      The blue arrows show the air-vents and the yellow arrows, the plant stems. The picture I've shown is that of plants growing in a grow-bag. The contents inside the bottle are empty pea pods and tomato skin which I hope will be disintegrated by microbes, fly larvae and two earthworms that are already in the grow-bag soil. I took care not to hurt the roots of the plants, and this plastic bottle is protected from rain and direct overhead sunshine.    I did this, considering it'd be easier to allow the compost to form within the soil and automatically seep into the soil, rather than have to buy fertilizer and mix it into the soil or have a separate composting system which I hear can create quite a stink.    Questions: 1. Is this sensible to do? Are there any disadvantages of doing it this way? (one of the reasons I've asked here is being worried about hygiene and this setup affecting the plants somehow) 2. If it isn't sensible, can the existing apparatus I've used, be improved in any way? "
102,How would I go about grafting Japanese Maples?,"I would like to plant a nice weeping Japanese Maple in my yard, but the nice ones at the nursery are quite expensive.  Some friends have exactly the type of Japanese Maple that I would like in my yard.  How would I go about grafting a branch into a tree that I could plant in my yard? What is the process and how long does it usually take? "
103,Repurposing this rhododendron,"I've been gradually building a house on a site that has been fairly well dominated by wild, unchecked growth of various greenery over the past 15 years. Time has come to turn my attention to the garden / landscaping  Part of the garden is planned to have a vehicle turning circle right where an enormous rhododendron is well established; it's on an embankment that is approx 3m high and the bush itself is another 3m high, with a footprint of probably 5x7m and stems as thick as my arm.  I don't want to just rip into it for two reasons; one that I'm acutely aware it's bird nesting season and I genuinely don't know if birds nest in rhododendron (but I'm not averse to bullying my way in there to have a look). Q1: is it likely to be home to one or more families of birds?   Reason two; I actually really like the plant despite them seeming to have a poor reputation in the U.K as being somewhat invasive and antisocial - people seem to regard them as a similar nuisance to sycamore and leylandii; perfect plants to establish on an order if you want to upset the neighbours. Fortunately I have no neighbours who would care so I'd like to repurpose this one as hedging. Clearly it can grow well on the site soil and seems to have thrived on what is a windy, exposed site (though it is in the building shadow a bit).   Q2: What would I need to do to cultivate it for hedging? Are the existing stems suitable or should I employ some propagation technique to establish a number of smaller plants? I've got a requirement for a lot of hedging; the landscape plan calls for about 200m. Am I embarking on a task whose cost and efforts vastly outweighs the success, beauty and ease of maintenance of the end result, and it would be simpler and easier to order 400 beech hedge whips in a pallet and plant them out? How about the chances of moving the full stems of the plant and re planting them in a large rectangle to make a secluded inner garden; will bare stems establish new green growth down the sides to become a private screen over time? "
104,What are inexpensive materials for homemade tomato cages?,"After starting our tomato plants from seed this year, we have many more small plants in the ground than in the past years. We are looking to make our own inexpensive and durable cages that we could use year after year.   What are starting materials that we can use? Are there materials to avoid? It seems that the openings in chicken wire and hardware cloth are too narrow.  "
105,Camelia with virus?,What is the problem with this white camellia? Some leaves are getting completely yellow but the plant is generally very vigorous. Is it virus? Is there a treatment? 
106,Availability of metering water timers,"When I was a child, my mother had a handy mechanical device that could be hooked to standard garden hose fittings.  You turned the knob to the number of gallons you wanted to dispense and it would automatically turn off after that amount had passed through.  It was useful for certain applications where the amount of water was important, but the delivery rate was not constant and/or it needed to sit in readiness for a while, but then only dispense a particular amount of water once activated.  These days everyone seems to use simple timers, whether mechanical or electronic, and I can't find such a metering device anywhere.  I can find valves with no meter, and meters with no valves, but come up completely dry when I look for meters that shut the water off.  I do have the skills to manufacture one myself, but that would be quite a bit of effort, and I'd rather avoid kludging it all together just to have somebody tell me that I could have just purchased one for half the price of the parts...  Does anybody still make such a contraption?  Or does everyone really just use timers? "
107,What do purple tomato leaves mean?,"Sometimes the leaves of the tomato seedlings we grow in pots gain a purplish shade on the bottom; the plants themselves (don't know if this is a coincidence) also seem to turn out stockier, shorter, and thicker in the end, and curl a bit.   Does the purple color mean anything? Is it a problem, and if so, are there cures? "
108,Why are we instructed not to use manure before planting carrots?,"It's said that we shouldn't use manure when preparing ground intended for carrots. Is it that carrots don't thrive on manure, or is it that they fork and splinter too much?  What about other roots? Radishes, beetroots etc? "
109,Does fruit on fruit trees need to be thinned?,"Do fruits need to be thinned on the tree? For example, I have a young Pomelo tree that's producing fruit for the first time. In order to get bigger, nicer fruit, should I be thinning the fruit? How is it done?  Here's a good example cluster from my Pomegranate tree:   "
110,What are some vegetable plants to start from seed in July?,"I have some space in my raised bed that I can use to plant some vegetables for the rest of the season.  Is it too late to start vegetables from seeds now?  If not, what are vegetables that would be appropriate to start from seed perhaps with the goal of harvesting in fall?  I am in Zone 9B. "
111,Will it kill my potted tree if I use tree fertilizer spikes?,"I recently bought some tree fertilizer spikes to feed my potted dwarf kumquat and lime trees.  After I got them home, I read the following warning on the side of the box:  NOTE: Never apply within 30"" of the trunk.   Obviously, my pot's radius is less than 30 inches so I would need to go against the instructions if I were to use the spikes.  Is the 30 inch warning there to protect the tree's roots from being spiked (in which case I can be careful and take the risk) or because the fertilizer itself will damage the tree being in high concentration (in which case I should return the spikes)?  Or is there some other reason for the warning?    Update: One suggestion below is to break the spike in half to reduce the concentration of fertilizer.  Is that a good idea?    Final update: The die is cast and I've put half a spike in each pot.  Depending on how the trees respond, I'll post any further updates as answers to the question. "
112,Tomato plant after neem oil application,My tomato plants stems had mealy bugs and with in an hour of my notice I started to spray neem oil liquid soap water and the plants now looks very bad and the leaves looks very dull. Will the leaves again regrow or the plant will die? I have applied this before also when my plants did not have mealy bugs but I never saw this change. Please tell me as what can I do now?  
113,How do you safely and effectively stop a cat from pooping in your yard?,Our neighbor's cat keeps pooping in our mulch and around our yard. Is there a safe and effective way to stop neighborhood pets from doing so? Has anyone used a method that works well? 
114,How do I get rid of insects on fruit trees?,"I have an infestation of aphids on my citrus and pomegranate trees. The bugs are being ""farmed"" by ants. I read they might actually be bringing the aphids to the trees.  Is this at all a problem? Can my trees still produce good fruit while they're infested?  If not, how can the problem be controlled? What safe insecticides suitable for fruit trees can be used?   "
115,Why and how do I need to re-pot indoor Basil?,I have read that you need to frequently repot Basil grown indoor.  Is that true? Why? What is the recommend repotting?  
116,My orchid has one yellowing leaf. What's gone wrong?,"I have an orchid that I bought about a month ago.  I'm following the watering directions that came with it (which means it's only been watered once so far) and I believe that it has the appropriate amount of light.  But one of its leaves suddenly became yellow all over.  What might have caused that and what can I try to fix the problem?    Further information: The tag that was attached suggests that it is a Phalaenopsis orchid and the medium it is planted in is mossy and moist to the touch.  It has two stems and the flowers on the side with the yellowing leaf have fallen off, but the flowers on the other stem are still in place.  There is a much larger leaf above the yellowing leaf that is still green and healthy as are the two leaves on the other side.  Does this help?    Final update: I took courage and poked around in the pot.  It seems the medium is entirely moss and that Phalaenopsis prefer bark.  Therefore, my plan is to repot the orchid in bark and see how it goes. "
117,Removing Bermuda Grass,"I have a small area of Bermuda grass in my lawn, roughly 30 square feet or so. I had a plan of getting rid of it by digging the area up in the fall, right before my yard is aerated and reseeded with a normal fescue type grass. I would then use Turflon Ester next growing season to spray and kill any remaining Bermuda grass.  Or would it be better to start spraying the Bermuda now with the Turflon to start killing it, and then dig up the area prior to aeration/reseeding? "
118,How to protect your grass in the winter months,"We have a small lawn and very active in the children. In the winter when it is wet the grass is completely destroyed mostly from games of soccer.  What can we do to protect the grass other than telling our children not to go outdoors?  I noticed online something called ""grass reinforcement mesh"". Is this the best method? "
119,"Can weeds be put into compost, or will they grow again when the compost is used?","I usually discard weeds but it occurred to me that they would probably be good for compost.  Are there any steps I can take to use them in compost without having them grow again when I use the compost? Do different types of weeds need different treatment prior to composting?  The main weeds I have are dandelions and ""farmers friend"". "
120,Should i prune tomato fruiting trusses?,"We all know to leave about 4 fruit trusses on a tomato plant and to prune out suckers and side shoots. But the ends of the fruiting trusses on my plants have turned up and shot up in the air like new side shoots. They still have fruit on but then they curl up and have a huge shoot on the end. Why is this happening? Is it normal, and should I prune these ends off?  Here are a couple of pictures. I've circled the fruiting trusses near the plant.  In both cases the truss and the plant are at the back, and you can see where it then has a new megashoot on the end coming towards the camera which is about 2 feet long an curves up!  Do you think I should cut these off?  I'm doubtful the plant can ripen all that fruit.     "
121,How do I grow sweet potatoes in a pot?,"I planted some attractive sweet potato vines in a 6 inch deep pot -- about 1.5 ft in diameter. I didn't expect them to grow extensively. However, with watering regularly, they certainly are growing like crazy. I'm wondering if I should take the time to try to harvest sweet potatoes from them.  Is it feasible to harvest an appreciable amount of sweet potato from the pot? Or would it only be feasible to grow sweet potatoes in a more traditional vegetable garden? "
122,"Why are my courgettes enormous, and my pumpkins puny?","Typically in August/September I get vigourous courgette plants but if I don't catch and harvest the fruits quickly I end up with enormous useless marrows.   At the same time my pumpkins are doing the opposite, that is growing to size of large oranges then stopping and sulking.   I want small courgettes and large pumpkins but I get the opposite. It's perverse! They're basically the same thing aren't they?   Is there any way to encourage courgettes to slow down?   More importantly - how to boost pumpkins? The pumpkins are being grown in tons of horse manure so they're not hungry. I'm wondering whether I'm putting them in too late, and they're running out of daylight by August/September. "
123,"How can I identify and eradicate poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac from my yard?","Every summer despite my best attempts to be careful, I end up developing a nasty rash due to an unfortunate encounter with poison ivy while doing routine yard work.  How can I best identify poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac?  What are the best methods for eradicating these from my yard without killing the existing trees and shrubs they seem to grow around?  Are there any specific chemicals that are better than others?  What special considerations are there if there are young children or pets in the area?  "
124,Will glyphosate directly harm Monarchs or other butterflies?,"A large portion of my yard is infested with (non-native) Japanese knotweed, which is nearly impossible to remove without herbicides.  I have been waiting until late summer/early autumn to begin an eradication campaign using glyphosate. In general I am very careful with how I use glyphosate/Roundup, only using it when dry weather is predicted and only in cases where manual removal is impossible.  I noticed a few Monarchs flying around my yard today, and I am worried that this could kill them if they light upon a treated plant. Most of the literature I was able to find points to an indirect impact of commercial-scale eradication of milkweed, which is the sole food source for larvae. However I do not plan on spraying milkweed (if I even have any in the yard) and I cannot find much about the direct impact of glyphosate on Monarchs or other butterflies.  Is this something I should be worried about? Ironically, I am planning to plant a butterfly and pollinator garden once the knotweed has been eradicated. If I wait a few more weeks for the Monarchs to migrate south, will it be too late for the glyphosate to be effective? "
125,What is this white growth on my cactus?,"I have several cacti growing in my yard and one (t. pachanoi, if it matters) has developed a white layer across the top of the plant.  It is very fine and looks almost sandy, like perhaps a mould or fungus.  It does brush off fairly easily though.  What is this white stuff?  Is it dangerous to the plant or its neighbours?  How can I treat it?  EDIT: Now with picture.  I've brushed most of it off but you can see the white dots across the top.  Before my attempt to clear it it was covering the entire surface   "
126,How should I treat a frangipani?,"I've just potted a frangipani (plumeria) cutting given to me by a friend and since it's not in its natural climate, I'm wondering what conditions it will thrive in?  If it matters, I live in a temperate zone.  How should I water it?  How much sun does it need?  Fertiliser?  Does it need to be changed with the seasons? "
127,What should I do with garlic I planted as whole cloves instead of breaking them up?,I planted whole cloves of garlic without breaking them up a few weeks ago. Now I see I should have broken them... they have formed lots of roots and small shoots. Should I break them up now? or just cut my losses and let it grow from here? 
128,Translucent spots on leaves,"Recently, several of my plants have developed these translucent spots on their leaves:    What is causing this? What should I do? "
129,How can I get rid of rabbits in my yard?,"I have rabbits that routinely build nests in my yard. How can I get rid of the rabbits legally? I don't want some officer from the DNR knocking on my door because I improperly hunted or poisoned them.  The rabbits cause several problems:   Our dog goes absolutely nuts barking at them through the window, chases them when she can in the back yard, and gently removes the young from their nest to play with (or tend to as a mother) when she finds a nest. The nests are basically a hole in the ground about the size of a softball. They're easily big enough to cause a twisted ankle when stepped in while walking in the yard. I'd like to start planting tomatoes and other vegetables, but I'm fearful the rabbits will have their way with my crops.   I've recently started using Liquid Fence, but it's hard to say if that's had much of an effect. I've certainly still had some rabbits, but maybe not as often.  What's the best course of action for me? "
130,Is having moss in your terrarium similiar to a layer of activated charcoal?,"I am making a terrarium and almost everywhere (on the web) it says to add a layer of activated charcoal between the soil and drainage rocks. I plan on creating a sort of 'meadows' look by making small hills and planting it with moss then adding a few trees. Thus there will be a LOT of moss in the terrarium. Is the layer of charcoal still needed if I have so much moss? I read that moss can have some of the same effects as charcoal such as helping reduce mold and mildew but also read that it can do the exact opposite. Would this then mean that when having so much the need for a layer of activated charcoal is higher?  Some useful info  The terrarium is closed and does not have any drainage.  I will be watering it with clean pond water, so no chemicals in the water. "
131,How to keep chipmunks out of my garden?,"Forget rabbits, I have a fence around the garden, my real pest problem is chipmunks.  I've got a fence, with some below ground barriers, to keep larger pests out and to keep them from digging but the chipmunks still get in.  Chicken wire doesn't keep them out and they end up digging holes in the garden, and eating roots of some of the plants...I lost a bunch of tulips last year due to their incessent root eating.  I do have a live trap but that only gets them if they get in, I want to keep them out.  Does Coyote Urine work?  What about the fox pheromones?  The dried blood and chili powder spray, good for rabbits and such, is not working.  I tried the fox stuff when they had been in the house but that didn't work as well as the live trap by their door, that got set with seeds and I eventually got them all out.  Is there a good method that I can use?  Rather than make my garden a small greenhouse I'd like to keep them out if I can with something sort of organic, if only there was an herb or something that would keep them out. "
132,Lilac tree has branches without flowers,"My parents have had a lilac tree in their backyard for about 25 years. It came from saplings given by a neighbour. Over the years, some secondary shoots (""suckers"", I think?) were removed as they broke under the weight of snow. Up until a year or two, it bloomed consistently every spring.  This year, it looks like this:    Large areas of the top have no flowers, only dried bits from last year, although all branches have leaves. There seems to be three main shoots that are devoid of any flowers.    On the older shoots, there seems to be moss or some white stuff on the bark. I don't know whether this is normal.    I don't think my parents have done any pruning of this tree over the years, except for removing obviously broken branches. They are now thinking about cutting the base of all the trunks that have no flowers. I asked them to wait until I could verify whether they could be salvaged. Is there anything we can do to make these trunks flower again? "
133,Various Questions About Fairy Castle Cactus,"I have a few questions about my Fairy Castle Cactus.  It’s barely grown since I bought it, in contrast to my other plants.  I’ve read conflicting info about the amount of light it likes. I’m using the right soil, not overwatering.   So, why are the joints growing in a spiral like/twisty fashion? It’s not a very attractive plant right now but I’m giving it time to grow, lol. If I prune it a little, will that help it or just damage the plant?   Also, I’ve read the “fake flower” could be real with the glue actually being cactus sap?  I dont know if there’s any truth to this.  And, the flower, opens and closes by itself. So how could it be an inert thing? I’d be suprised if a fake flower still reacted to the environment like that. Please help me understand!   "
134,"What actually occurs for manure to become considered ""well-rotted""?","I know that you shouldn't use raw manure on plants because it's bad for them, but I don't understand why.  I know you should stack manure before using it (i.e. literally stack it into a big cone), and wait until it no longer smells. How long would this process normally take? Is it different depending on the type of manure, e.g. chicken vs. cow vs. bat etc.  What is the mechanism in play that makes raw (or not well rotted) manure a bad thing for plants? "
135,I was wondering if my Chocolate Mint plant had some type of disease?,"So, I've had this Chocolate Mint plant for about a month now and some/most of the stems are brown. Some leaves on this plant also have brown spots on them, but not all are affected! So my question is: does my mint plant have a disease, too much sunshine, or something else?? Thanks in advance!!   Edit: Here are the bottom of the leaves!!   "
136,Why do fertilizers for the same plant type have significantly different ratios?,"We have a beautiful, large citrus tree that hubby grew from a seed 25 years ago. It lives in a pot due to cold winters here, but spends as much time as possible outside - better for the tree and us. Now that the days are getting warmer, the tree seems ""hungry"" and the growth phase should kick in.  Obviously potted plants need extra nutrition and so we went to our local garden center to get a new fertilizer. And promptly started wondering:   Brand A 3-1-5 NPK plus 0.8% S (sulfur), 1.5% Na (sodium), 0.3% Fe (iron) Brand B 3.5-6 NK plus 0.01 Fe Brand C 7-3-6 NPK plus 3% S (2% soluble S), 1.0% Na, 0.1% Cloride   All are labelled as fertilizers for citrus plants. And while I see some similarity between A and B, C is in a totally different range.  So what should we do? And why do I have that nagging feeling that I'm missing an essential part of the big picture here?        "
137,Why are the tips of my hardneck garlic plants dying?,"I've noticed that the tips of my hard neck garlic leaves are dying, and was wondering if this is normal, or not, because the flower stalk hasn't come up yet.   Time:right before summer Location:full sun flower bed   What am I doing wrong/right? What should I do for them? "
138,"""Forcing rhubarb"" - what does that mean?","In the question Forcing rhubarb - alternatives to fancy forcing jars?, the poster is asking how to ""force rhubarb"".  What does that mean?    The house we bought has a rhubarb plant in the yard, but I don't know anything about caring for it.  Is rhubarb forcing something I should be doing?   "
139,How do I connect a nozzle to a hose that doesn't have a threaded connector?,"My garden hose does not have a threaded female connector at the end. In that case, how can I connect a nozzle to the hose? I tried to find if there is any type of threaded connector that can be inserted into the hose to make a connection but couldn't find any. Is there any such kind of connector? "
140,Making a yard that's settled more level?,"My yard was installed when the prior owners built our house a dozen years ago. They did a decent job with the landscaping and yard. The problem is that some areas of the yard have settled and I'd like to ""fill"" those areas in without redoing too much of the yard.  The most obvious place where this has happened is where the water main comes into the house. If you look closely, you can see that the yard has a small ""dip"" in it the entire run from the house to the street where that pipe runs. The dip is small enough that it seems like a speed bump when pushing a lawn mower over it and never looks just right when mowed.  I'd like to fill in this dip or trench without needing to reseed the whole area, because the grass is fine on top; it's just not level.  Can I just add topsoil slowly so the existing grass will continue to grow? Or do I need to dig up the existing grass like sod and add new dirt underneath the existing root structure?  Is there anything else I can do? "
141,what roses can be planted in a pot,"I'm looking to put some yellow roses in a 2' long planter, and my local garden center doesn't have any yellow roses. Perhaps they are out of season? And I see there are a bunch of different kinds of roses (climbing and bush). I'm wondering what sort of roses would be suitable for planting in a pot, and any recomendations about where to acquire them (website?) "
142,What factors could cause a young oak tree to leaf out late?,"I have a young oak tree (ETA: It is a White Oak) that has been in its current location for 7 or 8 years. This year it is very late leafing out. In fact, it has only just started getting leaves in the past week. All of the other trees in the neighborhood (including mature and immature oaks) have been fully leafed out for about 2 weeks now. Reasons I've considered:   The tree does not seem to be located in a frost pocket. This is the first year it has leafed out significantly later than the other trees. We did have several late spring frosts/freezes - but again, no other trees in the vicinity seem to have been affected to this extent. When looking at the tree, I see no obvious signs of disease or injury. The bark is intact, I see no damage to the trunk or roots.    What am I missing? Or is the most likely explanation simply that it was more susceptible to the late frost than my other trees?      "
143,Cycas revoluta yellow leaves,"I have been out of my place for more than one month but I asked a friend to give water to my plants, including my beautiful Cycas revoluta. I don't think my friend gave the plant too much water (since he came only three times in one month), but now the leaves at the bottom of my cycas are entirely yellow as you can see from the attached pic.  Now, I don't see any fungus and the soil was very dry when I came back home, so I gave the plant a bit of water. Living in London the rain can be an issue but till now the plant was great! So I am not sure what to do (not watering can be the solution), but then the leaves will stay yellow? Shall I cut them? Thank you for any advice!   "
144,How can I control thistle in a lawn?,"Our back fence (an iron bar fence) borders a golf course, and between us and the fairway is about 50 feet of ""native"" landscaping.  This mostly means long, native grass (some type of crab grass?).  Unfortunately, next to one section of my backyard, a large patch of thistle grew up very tall a few years ago.  While thistle can turn out very pretty...   image source  ... it's also terrible when even small growth appears in my lawn. Given how spiky it is, bare feet is not a good idea.  I ended up spraying weed-killer on this patch and got it mostly knocked down.  However, the bits that had already spread to my lawn have come back year after year.  They don't go away when I  spray with lawn-safe weed killer, and I even had Tru-Green service for a while and nothing they did was successful either.  I have tried pulling them out by hand, but our lawn, unique soil (solid clay), and the toughness of the root system makes most of them simply break off at the soil, leaving them to come back in just a few weeks.  Is there anything I haven't tried?  Or should I just keep trying to dig them out by hand?  Note: since I've been more attentive to the patch on the other side of my fence, and it hasn't gone to seed in a couple years, the weeds have stayed confined to about 200 sq. feet of my lawn.  Lawn type: Kentucky Bluegrass Climate: Semi-arid (grass growing season is about March/April to October/November) "
145,Fig tree - white holes & bald spots,"I’ve searched for fig tree ailments (and there are many!) but can’t find a match for my problem. Can anyone help? Many of the leaves look like this - the leaf bulk has been eaten away and there is left either a hole, or a fine white mesh (I guess leaf veins). I don’t see any rolled leaves, aphids, ants, bulbous areas on either side of leaf, no brown or yellow anywhere. We are in the south of France. Ideas??   "
146,How do I keep Grackle's from pooping on my lawn?,Below is what I think is grackle poop on my lawn. (It might not be but I haven't seen any other animals there except desert cottontail rabbits and I know what their poop looks like.) How can I prevent these animals from defecating on my lawn? Will their poop benefit or harm the lawn if I spray it into the lawn?   
147,How are wind flattened plants realigned?,"Holy cats, that was a nice storm last night. 100 MPH gusts have flattened my 12in tall tomatoes, cauliflower, broccoli and cabbage.  This morning I straightened them out by propping them up with a little dirt or straw.    What is the best way to straighten these plants?  Will they straighten themselves? should I just toss the ones that can't fix themselves?  Have I just re-decimated my entire crop? "
148,How do I prevent the seeds on my Japanese Maple from falling off?,"I have a 6 ft tall 'Bloodgood' Japanese Maple in my yard. It gets a lot of afternoon Californian sun, but the leaves are a nice color and are healthy.  I wanted to collect some seeds this fall (to try to grow some unique seedlings and the such) and was pleased earlier this year that there were multiple bundles of maple seeds growing.  Come this month, they've all dried up—died immature—and fallen off the tree. Is there any way that next year I can save some seeds and prevent them from falling off prematurely? Or should I just wait for the tree to get older, as it's not very old yet? "
149,"Green side up, green side down","Parrots sleep upright on their perch; bats sleep hanging upside down. In the plant world the mantra is ""green side up"" but is this always the case? Are there any plants that would find roots above more rewarding than below? Are there any plants that might normally be grown green side up that would benefit from green side down, and if so how would this be achieved in a practical sense? "
150,Diagnosing if a tree is dead,"I found a very large branch in my yard.   Looking up, I was surprised to see a a bare tree amongst the leafy ones, from which this branch had fallen.  Not a tree expert but I'm guessing this one is dead/dying and will eventually damage my house.   Based on the photos, can anyone confirm this tree is a goner (I don't know if it's dormant or why it would in May in the southeastern US)? I'd like verification before I call a tree service to have it removed.  Is there any way to tell from the photos what disease is affecting this tree? I also would appreciate suggestions for what I should look for in a tree removal service.    "
151,What kind of plants will survive the heat from an air conditioner?,"I live on the 18th floor of a building in Hong Kong. In summer, all of my neighbors turn on their air conditioners, which generate a huge amount of heat.  I have a little balcony like gardening area out of my window (see below).      The problem is the heat -- the heat killed most of my plants last year. This summer is coming. Is there any way to avoid the heat killing my plants? I do not want to install a fan to blow off the heat, because construction is troublesome. I want an eco-friendly method, if there is any.  Now, my ultimate strategy is to plant some heat-resistant plants (ideally herbs, fruits, other things that can be eaten and aloe vera). In general, summers in Hong Kong are hot and rainy. The location is sheltered with half sun (it faces east, gets good sun in the morning and the afternoon is normal). The plants are typically grown in pots and should preferably be less than 1m in height.   What kind of plants will survive in this condition in addition to the heat from the air conditioner? The temperature is about 31-32 degree C "
152,Advice with laying a lawn please,"This is probably the sort of thing thats been asked a thousand times but I have no idea what I'm looking for  we moved into a house with a lovely huge pond, however now we have our first child and shes trying to walk, the pond had to go. :(  the lawn was lumpy, weedy and generally pants so we decided to take it all up, rotorvate it all and lay new seed. unfortunately we took the lawn off, rotorvated it all, put some food down then the rain came, so did Autumn, winter etc. we never got the seed down and now the ""lawn"" is just a wild meadow of weeds and grass that is hard to remove, especially with an 11 month wanting attention.  Do I have to take all the weeds out and rotorvate it all again, or can I just rotorvate it and stick some turf on top?  I need some top soil to level out the hole where the pond was but may just level it out and see how lower it is.  final question, anybody in Barnsley that actually likes gardening and wants to spend an afternoon away from their family helping us get it sorted?  thanks Be "
153,"Why do pink rain lillies flower after rains, but not from being watered? How to make them flower?","We have pink rain lilies (Zephyranthes Carinata) in the garden. In my personal experience, I've found that they always flower, without exception, shortly after rains. However, there are roughly ten totally dry months each year. During this time, even though I water them regularly with well-water, I've never seen them flower. I've tried copious amounts of water, and frequent watering, but to no avail. They seem to depend on rain.  The rains here come at different times each year. We just had a totally unexpected rainstorm in May, causing them to flower. We are inland in southern India. It's very hot here, and the climate is quite dry in the periods when it's not raining.   What is it about the rain that makes this plant flower? (No need for excessive details on this.) How can I utilize the answer to #1 to make them flower even when there is no rain?    "
154,Why have my tomato leaves started yellowing at the base?,"One of my tomato plants (Better Boys if that matters) has a few leaves that have started yellowing on the lower branches. Not sure if they aren't getting enough water, or if they are diseased or what.   What is causing this? If it's a disease how can I prevent it from spreading to the rest of my plants? "
155,How do you identify a plant?,"I'm pretty new to gardening and landscaping. Having recently bought a house, one of the things I'd like to be able to do is identify the trees and smaller plants that are on the property so I can learn how to take proper care of them. Rather than post a bunch of pictures here, how do you go about identifying unknown plants and trees? Are there resources (online and free are a bonus!) that you go to? "
156,"do ""real"" vegetable gardeners buy plants, or use seeds","I am a new gardener, and am really excited to grow my own vegetables.  It's end of May, so I may have missed the boat slightly in terms of planting seeds and growing a tomato plant from that.  Next year, I will be prepared, and will maximize the growing season.  But what do I do?  Do I buy a packet of seeds, do seed starters, and then transplant into a pot or the ground? Or just buy a tomato plant and transplant that into my pot?  It seems that buying a plant just saves a little work and is many many times more expensive (a plant could be a few bucks, and a single seed in a packet might be a nickel).  The plant would help me this year because I missed the boat in the spring to plant seeds, so it might help me make up for that.  But outside of being lazy and/or lack of planning, is there really a reason to buy plants, when you could have just planted a seedling a few months prior?  Are there any benefits to buying the tomato plant.  Can anybody share their thoughts/experiences on the matter?  My questions are about growing all vegetables, not just the tomato example I used above.    EDIT: I live in the SF Bay Area.  The climate here is pretty mild/nice. "

I miss being able to grow vegetables and so I attempted to start some leaf lettuce indoors, however, almost every plant died quickly.   I'm just curious, does anyone have experience growing vegetables indoors? What are the best ones for this? What sort of planter do you use? Do they need to be directly next to a window? How often should they be watered? I'm not used to not having Mother Nature help me out with my plants  Any tips that can be provided would be much appreciated, thanks! "
159,How much should blackberries grow in their first year?,"I planted 15 small (6"" tall) blackberry plants from pots (9 Triple Crown Thornless and 6 Prime-Jim) in late April in southwestern Pennsylvania (USDA zone 5).  All of the plants look very healthy in color and shape, but after 6 weeks the Triple Crown hasn't moved more than an inch, and the Prime-Jim has grown at most 2 or 3 inches.   The native soil does have a lot of clay, but we added a bunch of compost and topsoil. There is definitely enough rainfall (maybe too much?). And while it's not full sun, it's not far from full sun, and there are healthy tall weeds growing nearby.  I read that the Triple Crown won't fruit during the first year, and growth should be moderate, but at this rate they don't look like they'll be much taller than a foot by the end of the season. What should my expectations for blackberry growth be during the first year?   I haven't done a pH test yet, it's a new property. But I did apply this blackberry fertilizer. "
160,"Dyed circulars and cardboard, for weed barriers under mulch","[Box bottom listing dyes]  I have always saved and used layered newspapers (without the dyed circulars) as a weed barrier, under the mulch in my gardens. When I am done, the papers are not visible.  Now, I'm tackling a large area and ran out of the regular newsprint (even with friends/neighbors saving it for me). I'm considering using the sales circulars, magazines and dyed cardboard as weed barriers. We aren't growing edibles in this specific area, but it does flood. I've tried to research this, but all of the sites seem to strongly disagree about the pros and cons.   (i.e. Pro- They hold up longer than the regular newsprint, which can be helpful in some cases. Con- The dyes leach into the soil.)    So...Should I go ahead and use them in my own yard, or should I just put them in the recycling bin to go to the landfill and leach their dyes into the soil there? Everyone seems to be up in arms about these dyes! How bad can these dyes really be? "
161,Does eating fruits and vegetables watered with greywater affect your health?,"Does using greywater on your fruit and vegetable garden affect your health in a negative way?  Greywater is the run-off or cast off water that lolls about when you do normal washing around the home. The sink water when you're doing the dishes, the ejected liquid that comes from the laundry, etc. Most of it involves the suds and afterwash of soapy conditions.  Will eating the fruits of plants fed greywater do anything to a human that normal watering from the heavens above (rain) or from the tap (without rinsing through soap beforehand) won't? "
162,Two stroke engine throttle not working,"This may not be the correct place to ask this question, but I'm not sure a more appropriate place exists.  I have a Craftsman 32.8cc 10in tiller with a two-stroke Tecumseh engine. It ran fine the first day I used it, but then I ran inside to grab water and it tipped over and stalled out. I couldn't get it started again.  The next day, I was able to start it, but it kept stalling out. I don't think the idle was set too low, because the tines were actually spinning slowly -- but the only way I could keep it from stalling was to pull the tines out of contact with the ground and rock it forward periodically. On top of that, the throttle doesn't respond anymore.  I did notice a bolt had fallen out of the muffler, so I replaced that. A more thorough inspection revealed that the governor spring wasn't hooked to the throttle assembly anymore. I've tried reconnecting it, but it seems to unhook itself again every time.  I ordered a new governor spring assembly, but wondered if there was a way to jury rig it in the meantime. If the spring's hook is bent, can I solder it to the throttle? Or should I assume the spring has lost tension too? "
163,Which is a weed and which isn't?,"On the left side of my garden I have a lot growing and it is all mixed and messed up.  I'm not sure which of these is a weed and which isn't.

164,Moving lemon and satsuma trees?,"I have a lemon and a satsuma tree in my yard that I planted roughly 2 years ago. So they are still fairly young. I planted them in a bad location and realized that in a few years they are going to end up taking over the area. So I would like to move them, but a few people warned me that it is a bad idea to do so and that the trees would die.  While I know that is a risk, are there any steps I can take while moving them to put the odds back in my favor? What time of the year would it be best to move them? "
165,"I mulched before grass seed, is that a mistake? + how to fix?","I'm planting some new grass in a ~50 sq ft area, plus in the spaces between a hundred or so newly placed stepping stones.   Against all the advice I've seen, I mistakenly laid down my mulch before my grass seed. I had spread some lime and fertilizer before this mulching.  Can I just go ahead and spread the seed on top of the mulch? If so, should I do just that, or get some more mulch to place overtop again?  Or should I attempt to remove the mulch first, and then spread the grass seed? "
166,Okra will not produce pods,"I am attempting to grow okra around Portland, Oregon area, USDA hardiness zone 8b.  I am growing them in a makeshift greenhouse make of some clear plastic tarp over a raised garden bed. This was closed most of the time but I have left it open for the last few weeks due to high temperatures 80-90F+ I am using miracle grow raised bed soil and have mixed in some chicken manure compost  I have two plants that are around 6-8 months old (estimate). They appear to healthy however have failed to produce any pods. What happens is: a flower will appear and open, the flower will close and drop off, a small green ""nub"" will be left behind, then this nub and the stem that is attached to will dry up and turn brown and then fall off the plant.  I found some information about growing orka in my area which says that the night temperatures should be above 55F. I have measured soil temperatures with a temperature logger and the minimum temperature at night it 67F, max temperature during the day has been around 90F recently.  I found a person with what appears to be the same problem in this comment and the responses seem to indicate that there is some problem will pollination? Here is a video showing manual pollination of an okra flower with a q-tip. I attempted this, however I get almost no pollen to stick to the q-tip, so my guess is that the flowers are not producing pollen for some reason.  Here are some more pictures of the plant showing the dying pods flower (not fully open here, but I have seen them fully open) and my failed attempts at hand pollination note that there really is no powdery pollen as seen in the linked video above.  Screencap from video:  If anyone has any idea what could be causing the plant to not produce pods and/or pollen or has any experience with okra I would appreciate any advice as to what to try next. I was thinking at this point I may want to try some soil/pH testing, but I have no experience with this.  Update tried to remove most of the soil from around the plants and replaced it with soil that I had not added any chicken manure to as I think this would remove some of the nitrogen. Did soil testing, pH is around 6.5 and nutrient results:   nitrogen    very low phosphorous medium potash      high   So, I guess too much nitrogen is definitely not a problem now...because it appears that there is none...oops?  Also, the next few flowers appeared to have a small amount of pollen that I was able to put onto the stigma. Still pretty pitiful amount, but better than before which was nothing. Will see if I finally get any pods.  A few days later update: These two flowers with the small amount of pollen appear to be growing pods, finally. However I have observed other flowers blooming after this time that again have no pollen. So there is some problem causing pollen to not be produced. "
167,What's attacking one Lupin but not its neighbor?,"I have two Lupin plants next to each other in my front yard:    They are both Russell hybrids, both grown from seed and planted there at the same time in Spring 2009.  The one on the left is healthy, but recent growth on the one on the right is stunted and deformed.  The leaves are smaller, with narrower leaflets, and there are large gaps between individual flowers on the spikes.    I don't see any sign of insects on the affected plant (or on nearby plants, which include roses, lavender, Lithodora and Dianthus).  If it's any clue, I had several other Lupins near that spot that didn't grow this year, but that may be because it's been a colder than usual Spring here (Pacific NW, USA).  Is this curable?  If not, should I dig out the affected plant?  Can I replace it -- and the ones that didn't grow this year -- with more Lupins, or should I plant something else? "

I've tried maintaining a portion of grass myself in my garden that is part of a rockery. The grass grows very quickly. A lawnmower or strimmer isn't an option because of the size of my patch of grass (>1m^2) and it takes a long time to cut with ordinary scissors.  
171,When should I pile more dirt onto a growing potato plant?,"I've heard that I should be piling dirt onto my potato plants as they grow so that I end up with little mounds.  My potato plants have started to poke through the surface.  Should I totally cover them?  By how much?  What is the purpose of this, anyway? "
172,Is drainage important in Greenhouse beds?,"I just finished building my first greenhouse! I built in beds on the shelves along the wall that can have up to 10 inches of soil. (I'm planning on putting 8 inches in.) I lined the bottom of the beds with plastic because I don't want the plywood to get wet. I was about to put the dirt in when I had the thought that perhaps I would need drainage for my beds due to the plastic preventing water from draining. Then I thought that the water would just evaporate due to the heat inside the greenhouse. I'm in hardiness zone 3b.  Is drainage so important that I should drill holes in my beds and devise some sort of drainage system? Or should I be OK and just have to keep an eye out for mould or something?  Edit 1 year later  For what it is worth, this is what I ended up doing.   If I had to do it again I think I would just do plastic and dirt. The heat of the greenhouse pretty much vaporizes the water in the soil, even on cool days. This pretty much eliminates the threat of root rot. I'm thinking it must be the dry climate where I live. If I built my boxes out of spruce lumber instead of plywood I wouldn't even bother with the plastic.  All in all though they turned out great! "
173,How do I work with soil that has a high clay content?,"The clay content in my garden soil is rather high. Tilling it is a royal pain, especially if there is even the slightest hint of moisture in the soil. It just turns into big sticky clumps instead of nice fine dirt. Needless to say, this is less than ideal for planting.  Is there anything I can do to the soil to improve this situation? Any treatments or substances I should be tilling into it to make it easier to work with and more accommodating to my plants? Any special equipment that would make tilling easier? "

176,Can I ignore soil pH and just give blueberries chelated iron?,"As Why do blueberries need acidic soil? points out, it seems that iron is really the biggest nutrient to suffer in alkaline conditions. Even an answer there, despite a nice emphasis on the broader soil ecology, ends up focusing on this nutrient:     Acidic soil … to release phosphates, iron, magnesium which your blueberries love. The iron particularly is needed …   Similarly an answer to Is it really important to give blueberry plants acidic soil? quickly introduces a similar claim:     At higher pH, the bushes will have an iron deficiency…   So as much as I appreciate building good soil, I've seen doubts cast that I'll really be able to pull it off to the extent blueberries theoretically need. (E.g. ""pine needles aren't really acidic"", ""sulfur discourages worms and/or mycorrhizal fungi from thriving"", ""all your irrigation water is going to be alkaline anyway""… I'm not particularly intending to debate those claims here.)  I've got some chelated iron around (HEDTA if memory serves) that I use in my aquaponics systems. It is iron bound to a ""helper"" molecule such that [they claim] the plant can take in the iron and use it, at much higher pH levels than where iron is normally available.  What would happen if I simply gave my blueberries an occasional foliar application of iron, or periodically top dressed the soil with some of the powder, and didn't worry so much about changing the actual pH of the soil? "
177,Crop rotation theory v. practice,"Every guide to growing vegetables will have an early section on rotating roots, brassicas and legumes. There might even be a little diagram with neat evenly spaced and sized areas marked out for each group.  It always sounds so simple in theory.   But the guides are frustratingly silent on practical questions.   What if you don't tend to grow the three groups in even quantities (say you grow very few brassicas)? What if your vegetable plot isn't uniform in its distribution of warmth, light and soil quality? For example I always want to start off early salads, radishes and carrots up the warm end of my little rectangle in Feb/Mar. But that's crop rotation immediately messed up. Where do salads fit in?  "
178,"One of my apple seedlings is wilting, how can I rescue it?","Okay, so once, I was eating an apple, and all the seeds inside it had sprouted. So naturally, I planted them in two pots, and they all have been just exploding with growth ever since.  However, today, something happened to one of them. I found out it was raining, so I ran out to bring them back inside. One of them has not been buried deeply enough in the soil, I guess, and it was uprooted when I went out there, and wilty. I'm not sure what happened, except that perhaps the soil dried enough for it to be knocked over by a raindrop? The soil didn't seem dry enough for that to happen, though.  At any rate, I replanted it with the stem deeper in the soil and placed the plants under my plant light inside. What's the best thing I can do for the wilted plant to help it survive? Why did it wilt? It's always done fine out in the sun, as have all the others. Was it just because it was uprooted?  (I do not know how long it was uprooted for. So far I don't think it looks any better, it happened a couple hours ago.)  Thanks! "

183,Are there any fungal or plant counters to Juglone (walnut allelopathy)?,"I'm getting ready to begin building a food forest on the back quarter acre of my half acre yard.  However, my yard is absolutely surrounded by walnuts.  Walnuts release Juglone, an allelopathic chemical that inhibits the growth of most other plants, from their roots, rotting wood and nuts.  There are a number of plants that are Juglone resistant, but I'd rather not be limited in that way.  I could remove some, but not all of the trees, however I'd be great to keep them if I can.  Walnuts are a wonderful source of protein and oil.    I found an article on   indicating that a species of mushroom, Pleurotus sajor-caju, is capable of digesting Juglone and removing it from the soil very quickly.  However, there is no species of mushroom that is Pleurotus sajo-caju, rather there is a species of oyster mushroom (Pleurotus pulmonarius) that is frequently misidentified as Pleurotus sajor-caju and a separate species of tropical mushroom (Lentinus sajor-caju) that was previously thought to be a Pleurotus but is now a Lentinus.    Has anyone succeeded in using oyster mushrooms for Juglone remediation?  What species and where'd you get them from?  Are there any other species of fungus or plants known to remove Juglone from the soil? "

I had this before in other plants, and now I see it appearing together with my basil. They have a size of max 1 cm and are very porous and crunchy. We got an attack of little flies at the same time, so I was wondering if it might be the little eggs of those flies?

185,Can I grow a climbing plant as a trailing plant?,"We recently built a step-based garden beside our path. There are only a few wide levels, and the slope is not very steep.   I know of many plants that will work well there, including annuals; ground covers; perennials; and some trailing plants, like certain varieties of nasturtium. I'm also looking forward to making a rock garden, as I don't have one, and I have many ideas of what I can use for that.   Since I don't have a trellis or fence for climbing plants, I'm wondering if I can plant what's usually a climbing plant in that spot and let it trail down. My first choices are morning glory and wisteria, but I'm open to suggestions.   I can understand that the roots may be less supported if the weight of the plant pulls down rather than stands up. However, perhaps there's a way to set them into the dirt to avoid that type of strain. That may not even be an issue, it just came to mind.  It may also be that those types of flowers won't tolerate lying down, but I'm hoping to be wrong about that.   Is there any reason why I can't use those, or other, climbing plants as trailing plants?  As you look at the pictures, please note:   The pansy is something I put there this year. It's happy but easy to move if necessary. All the other things are coming up on their own and will probably be left alone, except for the specific areas I'll clean out to plant something else. The top step is always shaded by the house, and the rest are in full sun. Since I believe the specific plants I'm asking about are sun plants, they'd start on the second level.  Even though I do want some part of it to be a rock garden, the existing stones can be moved or rearranged if it would increase my options.    Click on the pictures for a larger view.    "

187,Creating Vegetable Mix Analog,"I have quite a lot of potting mix and compost, but no unused topsoil or similar.   I do, however, have access to a large quantity of used cocopeat blocks (they were used to grow Courgettes, and before that eggplants)  Is it feasible to mix compost with the cocopeat from the cocopeat blocks and use that as a vegetable mix ?   Should I add some slow release fertilizer granules to it as well ?  Not sure exactly what I want to grow yet, but they will be winter vegetables or leafy greens - which i'm going to throw into a .5m^2 plastic sandpit with holes drilled in the bottom.

Once I removed the top layer steam was literally rising off of it. I didn't have a thermometer handy, but I'm estimating that the temperature was at least 50 C (120 F) based on how hot it was to the touch.  Is this normal? Is it good/bad? How much hotter could my compost heap get?  (Note: I have a big compost heap, due to having a big yard that creates a lot of yard waste.) "

193,Glass vs plastic greenhouse covering: pros and cons,"When building or buying a greenhouse, it seems to me that the material to use is one of the first concerns. The two options I'm trying to compare right now are glass and plastic films. The characteristics that seemed important to me were transmittance, insulation, maintenance and cost (both purchase- and maintenance-). What I could find on the net was the following.   Transmittance  As Wikipedia shows, plants need mostly light from the visible spectrum:  ,  at which range both glass and most plastics transmit most light. A quick scholar.google search gave me The Radiative Effectiveness of Plastic Films for Greenhouses, with the following info.    The mil used here was strange to me, which I converted using the first converter Google gave me. It seems that there is hardly any difference between glass and plastic here, although there are special glasses designed to transmit >99% of the sunlight, as described in Transmittance of optical glass, which are out of reach for most people due to their cost. Insulation  As can again be read on Wikipedia, it is mostly (the lack of) convection that accounts for the temperature, and both glass and plastic stop this. Of course, glass insulates better than plastic, and double glass would do so even better (again due to the lack of convection in between these layers of glass), but I couldn't find any literature on this. Maintenance  Plastic changes colour over time and needs to be changed every few years (see The Radiative Effectiveness of Plastic Films for Greenhouses again for precise numbers), while glass lasts ages (look at the royal greenhouse of Laeken). I would thus say glass needs less maintenance. Cost  Plastic is cheap to buy, but needs to be changed every few years, as noted at the maintenance point. Glass is more expensive at first, but needs less maintenance. I could not find any thorough comparisons of the costs on the web. Other considerations  Glass just looks better. It does. It gives a different atmosphere, and you can actually see the rest of the garden when you're for example using it as a hangout spot in the winter.   From this intensive search of the web I can only conclude that glass is a little bit better at some points, but I have no idea if it really differs that much. The only point where I think the glass really wins is the maintenance, but that isn't really such a breaking point (I care more about which of the two is best for the plants). Is glass worth the investment? Did I overlook something? Does any of you have experience with both, or argumented reasons for why one of the two is better? "
194,How to transform an area of pasture to a vegetable garden?,"What is the best way to transform a 300 m2 area of pasture land to a vegetable garden? I do not mean lawn, but real grassland previously cut down regularly by farmers to feed animals.   [website]How would you tackle this and how long does it take for soil to become appropriate for crops? "
195,Does a painted lawnmower blade need any care before installing?,"I just bought a new blade for my Murray 30"" riding mower and I noticed that the new blade I bought (not an OEM one) was painted.   Will the paint be a problem?   The blade seems pretty sharp as it's new, but should I sharpen it further or leave it as is until it needs sharpening again? "
196,Clematis identification,"I once owned a Polish clematis which changed name approx 10-12 years ago &amp; since moving to Scarborough would like to obtain again. Unfortunately I only know it by it's old name which I can only spell phonetically -                                 Maximawenya?  It's a very vigorous, white plant, late flowering. Hope you can help?  "
197,When should I replant Home depot (Bonnie) tomato plants,"I've brought few tomato plants from home depot (Bonnie brand) and they are 5 to 8 inches tall and their roots start poking out from the bottom (and sides) of their (3"" and 4"") containers.  Seems like time to plant them in bigger pots. My question is, should i plant then straight into 20"" pots, or should i choose smaller intermediate container? The reason i'm asking, besides for lack of experience (first time gardener here), is that in this video plant tomato deep, for example, suggests deep planting of tomatoes, where the guy trims all the leaves besides for the very top. If my entire plant is 5"" tall, ""deep planting"" would not work.  I'd love to post an image to illustrate but StackExcahnge tells me I need 10 Reputation.  Appreciate your help. "
198,How is manure tea made without E. coli?,"As the title would suggest, I may or may not have given my kids e. coli by steeping a bag of what I thought was mushroom compost in a 35 gallon drum and watering my garden with it. (I know it was mushroom compost, I don't know how much manure was in it)  I don't believe I ever watered directly on the lettuce or kale leaves, but that's more than likely where they got it from.  I wouldn't water directly on the leaves regardless.  What I did was take a burlap rice bag, filled it full of mushroom compost and steeped it (or rather just left it) attached to the lid of the drum and used that water.  The next year I tried making vegetarian compost tea using thistles, nobody got sick but that somehow left my drum even dirtier than using manure and would clog up the faucet on the drum.  Anyway, I'm just wondering what the proper setup is for manure tea (aka compost tea), should it be done in the shade? how fast should you use it? do you need to clean the barrel after using it?  What is a good store-brand manure to use?  How can you be absolutely sure the manure is fermented before using it?    "
199,What Pest is That on My Rosemary?,"It's not as massive as it might seem on this picture. The insect is about 1 to 2 mm in length. The web is very fine, you don't see it if you're standing a meter away and only the upper shoots are affected.  It's located in North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany, has direct sun and its neighbours are sage and lavender. They have no signs of infection. Will it hurt them?  What are those insects on my rosemary and how do I make them go away?   A picture of the plaque. The brownish thing is not related to the pest:   I'm sorry for the low quality. This is one of those insects. They currently reside on the underneath of nearly every leave.  "
200,Twofold question about Burning Bush - Rudy Haag,"I purchased a few Rudy Haag burning bushes here. They arrived well and healthy-looking. I took care of them as instructed and for the first 3-4 weeks they did really well but after that they started deteriorating. New leaves would appear but quickly shrivel up and die. Leaves and branches would just get dry and die (even with regular watering).   When I contacted the farm I purchase these from, the horticulturist told me he didn't know what was happening and recommended me to move mulch away from the bushes and use less water. Well that didn't help.  I put two of them in plastic pots and brought them inside. One looks already dead and one still has some life. I did notice some spider mites under a leaf of the semi-healthy one (I think they're spider mites), but not too bad. I removed them and bought an organic herbicide at Lowe's that claims to kill over 100 common plant insects.  Question #1 - What can I do to save these plants if not too late?  This morning I noticed some very tiny objects doing parabolic jumps on the dirt. I have no idea what these are. Tried using a magnifying glass and still too small to tell.  Question #2 - What are those? If you look closely, you'll see what I mean in the video below. At first, I thought they were tiny specs falling from the bush, but no, they're tiny things hopping around the bush. I only see them in the pot with the semi-healthy bush, not the other one.  Please see images and video here: img1, img2, video1 "
201,At what point is a leaf dead?,"My little apple seedlings (from seed) have gone through a bit too much sun this week, as a string of 90-degree days after being indoor plants has been a shock to them. Their leaves were burnt along the top layers and they're curling quite a bit. Most of them are also significantly more faded from what they were a few short weeks ago. (This is just an example, and what incited the questions below)  At what point will the leaves be ""dead""? I mean, at what point will I know that they are useless to the plant? Should I trim them so that the lower leaves can get better light? Will they be able to bounce back from the stress that they've experienced? "
202,Should I insulate my compost heap?,"I understand that compost heaps have an ideal temperature for the bacteria to decompose the material into compost. Living in the changeable Great Britain, the weather can be windy, rainy, sunny and dry within a single day.   Given this changeability, should I be trying to insulate the heap against changes in temperature and humidity? It's currently a wood construction with gaps for ventilation. What materials could I use to insulate it without suffocating the heap? "
203,Why are my figs dry inside and not ripening?,"I have this several year old fig tree, should be coming up on 6-7 years. It's about 18 feet tall perhaps, and for the last several years it has produced figs. They get tender on the skin but when I cut them open they're always full of dry things that look like seeds.   Is the plant still gearing up to produce fully ripe figs a few years down the road or did I get a dud?   Is this dry interior a fleeting phase or is this some kind of male/female tree thing?  What sort of figs do these appear to be?      "
204,Adding clay soil to compost,"I just started composting (again). I added a bunch of greens to a big bin, and then I added some soil.  In the meanwhile, I was uprooting a bunch of grass for a vegetable bed, and without thinking, I threw a bunch of clay/grass into the compost bin. Actually, it's now half full of heavy clay.  Is this a mistake -- will this prohibit or inhibit the decomposition? Should I remove it? It's terribly difficult to mix it as is.  Also, I saw a couple of worms in the compost bin. In the future, should I add them if I see them, or leave them in the real soil? (My bin is covered.) "
205,How should I prune my vine tomatoes?,"I've been growing my tomatoes up a 6ft trellis of nylon netting for the last couple of years, with good results.  But they tend to grow out of control, eventually toppling over the trellis and breaking their branches, and parts of the branches will die out.  I've never really bothered with pruning them unless a vine looks diseased or like it's dying.  I've read that I really ought to be pruning the tomatoes to the ""main vine"", which will result in higher fruit yields.  But I'm not sure how to tell which vine is the ""main"" vine (or if it really matters), and which vines are just branches.  After a week, both vines look rather strong.  And when both vines have flowers, I'm anxious about cutting away potential produce!  Will pruning it really result in higher yields?  What rules of thumb do you use for pruning your trellised tomato vines? "
206,Material choices for DIY greenhouse,"  I'm looking into building a cabinet sized greenhouse for my balcony. I have a very limited income so its a low budget project. I have looked at ready-mades but none fit my budget or space.  I'm a bit unsure if the materials I have selected are ideal:   I was considering building the frame out of 45 x 45mm (1.7"") pine. For the back I was planing on a sheet of plywood painted black. For the bottom i'm considering a galvanized steel plate. For the glazing I considering using channeled polycarbonate (about 8mm).   Access will be by sliding the front panels.  Are there better choices for this project?   Aluminium could be an option but I don't have any experience with metalworking really.   What is the best way to fasten the polycarbonate sheets to the frame?  I only have basic hand tools to I'm looking to avoid tongue and groove.  Site  I live in an apartment building so I cannot fasten it to the wall. I can fasten it to railing on one side to prevent tipping. The balcony is south facing and on the second floor of 4. There is a balcony above it so does get wet in a storm but not soaked.  I live in northern Sweden. The Köppen climate zone is Dfc (Cool Continental / Subarctic). We often have snow from november to the beginning of may. Winter temperatures often drop down to -25°c (-14F)  The reason I want a greenhouse is that June, July and August are the only guaranteed frost free months and nighttime temperatures plummet down to 4°c (39F) during may and september.   I intend to bring it inside when winter comes.  What do I want to grow?  I want to be able to grow tomatoes, peppers and maybe physalis and kiwi berries and maybe cool down my indoor citrus plants in the fall.  My tomatoes, peppers grow ok at there now, but I have to haul them inside every night.    Size  The overall size is 320 * 1100 * 2000mm (12""*43""*78"").     "
207,Identify possible rooting tree?,"Are there any visual signs to identify if something can be rooted?  My mother gave me this ""branch"" off a tree and says that it can be rooted.  Do I wait for roots to appear then put it in soil? Do I put it in soil right away? Or like my initial question states, is there a way to tell if this can even be rooted!? "
208,How do I tell which direction a gourd is going to grow?,"I transplanted a 10 or so gourds seedlings growing around my garden (which somehow survived my compost [mainly because I composted them intact and smashed them with a brick later])  around a teepee that I want them to grow up so my kids can play inside (Idea from  Roots Shoots Buckets and Boots, although it doesn't say anything about transplanting).  I've got a feeling some of them are going to betray me and start growing where I would prefer they not grow, when do you know that they're going to send their first shoots out in the right direction?   Can you apply the same principle to cukes (a similarly seditious vegetable)?  "

210,Epipremnum Aureum clone has brown roots,"A clone that i had placed in water nearly a month ago has fairly long roots. However, they are starting to turn brown on the tips. Any idea what is happening? This clone took a long time to  root, around three weeks. The roots have been growing for about a week now. A second clone that i placed in a different bottle of water with fertilizer rooted quicker, about a week, however its roots are starting to darken too. Should i plant the second one asap? And is the first one saveable at all?   First Plant:      Second Plant     They are both kept in a window where light is available. Should i shield the roots from light?  I added miracle grow liquid fertilizer to substitute for soil in both of these solutions. "
211,White fungus growing on tree branches,"This tree has had a tough time recently. It was heavily pruned by a former resident, and until recently was buried in the middle of a dense bamboo grove. The bamboo visible to the right is 30+ feet tall and was completely surrounding the tree.  Click on photo for full size    Anyway, there what looks like a white fungus or growth covering large portions of the upper branches. I don't know if the tree's trauma contributed to the growth or what, but I want to know what I should do about it.  Is the fungus just natural and I should let it be? Will it resolve itself now that the tree has a better environment? Does the tree need professional help? It's not particularly bothering me, I just want to make sure the tree is getting the care it deserves. "
212,Do any bulbing bunching onion varieties multiply like potato onions?,"Do bulbing bunching onions multiply like non-bulbing ones and potato onions, do?  According to one source, there is a non-bulbing variety that does multiply (and is a perennial): the He Shi Ko bunching onion. I have yet to find such a source about bulbing types.  High Mowing Seeds establishes that bunching onions (not particularly bulbing ones) are hardy perennials that are for some reason usually grown as annuals, but it does not say if or how often they generally multiply.  Another source says that technically the non-bulbing ones are bienniels, but people often refer to them as perennials because they multiply, leaving a continual supply. So, are the bulbing ones the same in these regards? "
213,Can we plant grass over canvas weed deterrent?,"The previous owner put down canvas weed deterrent underneath a few flower beds. We are now trying to turn these beds into grass to increase the size of the lawn.  Do I need to try to pull up all of the canvas? It is deeply embedded in the root systems of weeds and plants and starting to fall apart. I've taken up a few chunks, but it is difficult to get it to come up in one piece without tearing. If I leave the canvas in the ground, will the grass be able to come in? Will the canvas affect the quality of the grass when it does come in?  The canvas is buried between 4"" and 8"" under the soil (the depth varies). "

216,Is it possible to grow the corn kernels from commercial popcorn?,"It doesn't seem like there's any process that would kill the kernels, as they're just being dried out. So would it be theoretically possible to grow the kernels into full corn plants? Would there be any difference between the kernels found in commercial, microwavable, bagged popcorn and corn kernels sold specifically for planting? "
217,Why is my jade plant dying?,"I got a jade plant from a local nursery, which was in good health. I was under the impression that I can keep jade plants indoors, so I kept it on my desk. In around a month or so all the leaves dried out.   Is it because I am keeping it indoors all the time? What should I do to make it healthy again?  Is it really not an indoor plant?       "
218,How can I grow ivy (or a bush or other plant) in my fireplace that is low-maintenance and bug-repellant?,"I've never gardened, but I do love design.  I'm moving into a new place that has an unusable fireplace, and I think it'd look amazing if it had a green, leafy plant filling the interior of it.  Since I've never gardened, I think one that is robust and requires little light and minimal maintenance, especially when it comes to bugs, is best.  Bonus points if it's a plant that is good for air quality as well.  Any ideas?  How should I go about it?  Preliminary research suggests philodendron or grape ivy: are these good ideas?  How long will they take to grow to fill a fireplace?  (I imagine the philodendron would grow up from the base, while I'd have to build a pot for the grape ivy and then it would hang down). "

220,What is this black plastic-looking drain hole in my lawn?,"I bought my house a few months ago and have noticed a long and narrow strip that is mostly bare of grass in my backyard.  I have no idea why it is there, but recently I found what looks like a plastic drain hole along that strip.  See pictures below. What is it, and why is it there?  What should I do about it?     "
221,Which basil has the strongest licorice flavor?,"This is my first year growing basil. I'm growing Spicy Bush Globe basil, this year. However, I've found that it doesn't have the licorice-type flavor I'm used to with basil. It tastes like a mix between mint and those spicy gumdrops that are coated in sugar, although the effect after having eaten it is more pleasant than that sounds, I think (and strangely, it makes my tongue a bit numb, and later it makes me salivate in a way that feels pleasant). At first, I was a bit put off by the taste, but I think it's growing on me.  Anyway, I'm looking for a basil variety with a very licorice-type taste, and a not very minty taste (although I know it's in the Mint family). I know there's one called Licorice basil, which is said to have a mild licorice flavor, and there's one called Anise basil, which is also said to have a licorice flavor (potency unspecified). I know there are a lot of basil varieties, and I don't trust implicitly that Licorice basil is the most licorice-like one.  Anyway, do you have any recommendations? Or if the question is too broad (considering the number of basil varieties), do you know if Anise basil has a stronger basil taste than licorice basil?  Thanks! "
222,Does seed from F1 hybrid tomato fruits grow?,"Some time ago, I wanted to grow tomatoes by using the seeds from the tomato which I was eating at the moment. I did some research on the internet, but then discovered you could not grow tomatoes from F1 hybrid fruits. When searching information about the meaning of F1 hybrids I got a headache, considering I have no background in genetics. There was also no information at all on the package of the tomatoes, so I just tried.  Now the question:  Tomato plants did grow, does that mean they were not F1 hybrid tomatoes from the shop? Or might I have been lucky, and do some F1 hybrid seeds germinate? Or is it they don't produce flowers? Or no fruits? (at some websites I find information about germination, others talk about no fruits...)  Can someone give me a simple answer and some easy explained background information? "
223,What kind of soil do potted sensitivity plants need?,"I bought a sensitivity plant (Mimosa Pudica) and noticed it was planted in an unusual looking soil.  I want to transfer it to a larger container, so I would like to know how to buy or prepare a suitable potting medium.    According to this site:     The University of Oklahoma Department of Botany and Microbiology's   website Plant of the Week recommends using a potting mixture for   sensitive plant that consists of two parts peat moss, two parts loam   and one part sand or perlite, a formulation used to successfully grow   this plant. This mixture provides the good drainage that sensitive   plants need to thrive.   Is such a potting mixture or reasonably equivalent available for purchase?  If not, are the components readily available in stores? "
224,Is this normal for a push reel mower?,"I have this mower. It worked great last year, but this year it's left my lawn looking like the photos in this album. Believe it or not, I mowed that grass yesterday (not even 24 hours ago).    It is definitely cutting, and cutting a lot (most of the grass is the right height, it's just those long shoots that are persisting). I had the blade set to about 2.5"", the notch shorter than what I did last year (an attempt to rectify the problem after the first unsuccessful cutting). I typically only cut when the grass is dry, though it's been raining 3-5 times a week, so I'm usually cutting the 24-48 hours after the last time it rained, but the grass has definitely been dry when I've cut it.  Is this normal for this type of mower? I didn't see this last year at all. Are these just weeds I need to manually pull? Is it the frequency of the rain and the fact that I can't get a day or two of non-rain before I cut it?  Why might this be happening and how can I fix it?  Thanks! "
225,Never ending problems with my Crepe Myrtle,"I'm growing a crepe myrtle to eventually make a Bonsai out of it. I've had to spray it against powdery mildew few months ago. Now it seems like I'm doing something wrong again as the leaf are curly and twisted, and the tips are burning.   The only thing I did was giving it a very small amount of fertilizer every week. Could that be the cause or is it something else?  Is my soil is lacking nutriment? It's the same soil as 1 year ago. How can I save it or quickly react to it? Because it's dying very fast since 3-4 days.  Thanks           "
226,Give up aesthetics for weed removal,"What are my options if I have to give up the aesthetics of the garden(currently with a little sod and a loads of weed) to control kill weed.  One option I'm considering is the following:   Mow the area to lowest height,  Use Sod cutter/Bobcat remove the top 1-2"" Water thoroughly for the seeds to germinate couple of days Cover the place with transparent plastic for 4-10 weeks to bake in sun Install landscape fabric Add 1-2"" of mulch   Plants I'm trying to get rid of (the ones I can find the names of):   Thistle Black Medic Crabgrass Carolina Geranium Yellow Woodsorrel Prickly lettuce Flatweed  (cat's ear)   How many times would I be expecting regrowth?

227,How to build a hugelkultur?,"I've got some spare wood from a downed pine tree that's been around for a year. I've asked the local garden labourers to cut the rounds up and stack it on the boundary so I could plant it out.   Should I just dump everything except invasive weeds, tree branches, leaves etc, and then cover it with a huge amount of soil, before planting? Was this a big mistake and should I burn it instead ( cut into firewood and sell) as I read somewhere that pine resins inhibit roots.  The pile is currently 5 foot tall and growing, with more native bush to be levelled and added. Is it too tall?   "
228,How much sulphur should be added to tomatoes?,"My potted tomatoes are developing a very pale leafs at the start of growing tips - typical of sulphur deficiency.   I am interested in how much sulphur should be added to soil? What are typical concentrations of sulphur in soil?  These are the images. They were taken once the progression already took place. At the start, only the growing tips were pale. The other issue that springed to mind is root space. This plant is huge and was cut down periodically to foster lateral growth instead of one apex.       "
229,Why have my lemon seedlings stopped growing and turned yellow?,"I planted some lemon pips in November last year, and they grew to about 4cm tall, and it seems as if they aren't growing anymore.

231,Is something wrong with my plants?,"I've planted some herbs on my balcony in hanging flower boxes. I live in Illinois so it's pretty hot and humid around this time of the year. My parsley has been showing discoloration my basil has some kind of brown spots on some of the leaves. Also, the rosemary seems to be unable to grow new stems and the base of the existing stems is somewhat brownish. I've posted images for all three. Here are my questions:   Parsley: I thought at first that the issue is related to the heat of the sun, but then I read somewhere that this could be fungus . Any ideas based on the pictures? I ordered a bottle of fungicide from amazon and it should be arriving tomorrow.  Basil: in a previous thread I asked a question about finding a lot of insects in my old bag of potting mix. After seeing the comments I ended up using the soil; the basil plant seems to be the one with the most ""infestation"". I am unsure if these dots are a result of the insects or heat/sun related. Rosemary: I suspect that the roots might have rot or something. How can I be sure? Could something else be the issue?   I would appreciate any advice on the matter! Thanks!

232,Relocating an apple tree - when should this be done?,"A long time ago (about ten years), I put some apple seeds in the ground, and now I have an apple tree. The only problem is that it is too close to the neighbour's house, and might do some damage to it with its roots. Moreover, it is too close to a pear tree. Here's a picture of how close the tree stands to the house.    On the left you see the apple tree, and on the right the pear tree. Now I wish to move this tree, relocate it to the other side of the garden, where it has more room, can get more light, and not be such a problem to the neighbour's house and the pear tree. The problem is that I have no idea when I should do this. Right now, the tree is blossoming.    What season should I wait for to relocate it? When would a few broken roots (as it is impossible to dig all of them out) do the least damage to the tree? And how should I do this? How much of the roots should I try to get out, and should I take some dirt from the old spot with it? Are there any problems that could arise? "
233,Long lived plant identification,"This plant has been alive for at least 25 years. I know this for sure, because it was here when my parents moved into this house when I was born. No one knows what it is. It has pink clusters of flowers when it blooms, not sure what time of year. Any ideas? From searching Google, I'm thinking some kind of Sedum?   "
234,Why does my Passion Fruit Creeper grow best in autumn and early winter?,"I live in Cape Town South Africa, which is a Mediterranean climate (similar to Southern California, I think). I'm growing a Passion Fruit creeper. Now I assumed this would grow best during summer (with a bit of watering).  I've noticed, for the second year now, that the creeper grows best from about April to May which is actually our Autumn going into winter. How can this be? The sunlight is weaker and the temperature is colder; it doesn't make sense to me.  The only thing I can think of is that it enjoys the higher relative humidity at this time of year. In summer it's dry here and in winter it's cool and humid but never freezing.  Any ideas or is this just an anomaly? "
235,What are these tiny white bugs on my houseplants and succulents?,"  I got a pot of mixed plants and succulents at a yard sale about a week ago for a buck! The lady was selling the pot because she said the plants were a lost cause. In order to keep the succulents alive the soil was too dry for the plant in the picture (not sure what it is). I decided today I would separate them so the succulents could be in cactus soil and these could have a chance a survival, and so I could water them without over watering the succulents.   When I uprooted them I noticed these white bugs. I'm assuming an aphid of some kind. They are even on my succulents and the decorative marbles on the top layer of the soil. Before, I have treated aphids on outdoor plants by mixing cayenne pepper, dish soap and water in a spray bottle and sprayed the plant leaves until they are dripping, and let dry.  This has worked and I'm going to try this on the unidentified plant in my picture, but am worried about spraying that mix directly onto the leaf of the succulents.  I know succulents absorb and store nutrients differently than ""leafy"" plants and don't know how safe this is. Even the cactus food I have is a spray foam instead of a water mix or spray. I don't know the biology behind it. Can anyone help?   Are these in fact aphids? Can I treat my succulents in the same manner, or is there a better or safer solution I should try? Are these pests specific to indoor plants, and if so, would putting my succulents outdoors help? All of the succulents I have are ""full sun"" succulents and can withstand the sun and the heat, they're just so pretty and I happen to have a large window that provides them with plenty of sun.  In addition, my other succulents that did not come from the same pot are thriving and producing ""babies"" and my two bromeliads are also doing well, neither of which have the white bugs. Should they be treated too in order to prevent spread? "
236,What is this plant and does it require a lot of sunshine?,"Could anyone help identify this plant? I had it in my previous apartment that was facing north. Now we placed it in front of the window facing east, where it gets much more sunshine that before.  Does this plant require a lot of sunshine, or should it be away from the window? How often should it be watered?  Thank you.  P.S. These pictures were taken in the morning:     "
237,Will the yellow stain from prodiamine come off of white landscape stone?,"I hired landscapers to do a ton of work at my house and one part was to fill a very large area with white landscape stone. Contract stated they would put paper under it then the stone. They did not put the paper down and with one storm weeds came up through the stone, so I complained. The landscaper applied prodiamine (I think this is the correct name?) on the stone and said on his way out ""it came out a little heavy in the one area and you'll see the stone is a little yellow; you can hit that with some water from the hose and it'll come right off."" Didn't say when to spray it (then or wait a few days). So I went outside and it was blinding neon yellow in one large area and then less yellow but still discolored going in spray patterns all over the rest of the stone. I was in shock--so I did what he said--hit the worst area a little with the hose--it doesn't budge. I emailed him and he said don't spray it, just bear with him, he sprays this all the time on patios and walkways, not to worry, the yellow is just the chemical and he'll stop by tomorrow to explain how it works. But so far I can't find anything online that assures me this won't leave a permanent stain. It's white landscape stone and it appears to have REALLY adhered to the surface. I brought in a stone and ran it under my faucet 5 min and even scrubbed it and that yellow doesn't budge. Is this some kind of thing where the chemical when exposed to sunlight changes or something? I don't even know what to do. It's like the whole area looks ruined. Thanks for any info.  "
238,What is in seed starting soil that justifies wearing gloves while handling?,I was adding miracle-gro seed starting soil to paper pots with my daughter a few months ago and was a little leery about letting her touch the stuff (let alone breathe it in).  What's in it that is dangerous? Do you need rubber gloves or just gardening gloves? Should children be kept away from it?  Are there natural alternatives?  
239,"Heeding ""use by"" dates on seed packets?","Generally seed packets have some kind of expiry date on them. I've got ""sow by"" dates on my packets of Suttons seeds and ""best before"" on Unwins.  Is it worth sowing seeds which have passed their expiry dates? And would the answer vary from plant to plant (e.g. can I be more relaxed about expiry dates for plants that are ""easy"" to grow, like salads and radishes)?  Also, if I persist with out-of-date seeds, will the results consist of:  a) fewer successful germinations   or  b) weaker, less productive adult plants  or both?  Is there any evidence seed companies apply these expiry dates cynically, in order to generate extra sales of newer seeds? "
240,Are ants in my raspberry flowers beneficial or harmful?,"I'm observing ants on my raspberry plants, especially in the flowers. They are diving head-forward into the flowers and stay there for a while. Just like flying insects on other flowers.  Is this ""normal""? Does it do any damage? Will this pollinate the flowers? "
241,Will potatoes in containers grow more potatoes?,"I am under the impression that people grow potatoes in bags, containers, stacked up tires and so on because they get higher potato yields this way. The way I've heard it explained is that you plant the seed potatoes on the bottom and wait for the plant to grow. Keep adding soil every few weeks until you reach the edge of the container. Supposedly the roots will keep growing upward as well, and the whole container will be filled with potatoes.  I tried growing this way this year, and all my potatoes plants initially grew like crazy. I added soil as the plants grew, and eventually, I reached the edge of the container. The plants grew a bit more but mostly stopped adding new growth. Fast forward and my plants are starting to die back, so I harvest potatoes. To my surprise, all the potatoes were in one layer in the bottom of the container where I started the seed potatoes.  Reflecting back it seems pointless for the potato to put all that energy into growing a long stem and tons of leaves if I am just going to cover them with soil. The container did make it easier to harvest, but I did not have potatoes growing upwards in the soil as I expected.  Is this an unusual result? Why bother growing in containers at all?  Does anyone have any evidence that potatoes will grow all the way to the surface of the container? "
242,Which plants/trees will benefit from using urine as a fertilizer?,"We know that urine can do a plant good. Certain plants (like citrus trees) will absolutely do well if you add urine to their intake.   But urine is very high in nitrogen and could potentially ""burn"" the plant. What are some common plants/trees that can flourish with urine as a fertilizer? Is there some way to tell which ones to avoid, lest they shrivel up and choke on the nitrogen? "
243,Would more concentrated solutions of soybean oil be better for insect control?,"If soybean oil is used in such low concentrations as .5%, why wouldn't using higher concentrations be better?  Is there something preventing a higher concentration being useful or effective? "
244,What's the best mulch material for a vegetable garden?,"I want to lay mulch down around my already established plants to help retain moisture and discourage weeds.  Is there a recommended material for this?  Or at least some materials I should know to avoid?  Update: The choices I'm looking at right now are hardwood, cedar, and cypress (all available from my local Lowes/Home Depot/etc and are pretty cheap.  Also, my city has a program that gathers wood that people are throwing away and shreds them into mulch.  It's free to take some and they'll fill up the back of your truck for you as many times as you want.  You end up with a random collection of wood...not sure if this really matters though. "
245,Hot composting dock roots,I've spent several weeks hand-digging out dock and other obnoxious weeds from our pastures.  There's a couple cubic yards of it now in the back of the pickup.  I was considering hot-composting this in a separate pile and covering it in thick black plastic to cook it sufficiently to kill off the roots.  Has anyone hot-composted dock or other hardy roots such as these?  Other ideas?  Aside:  We don't use herbicides here on the farm as a general rule so anything I do to these needs to be a herbicide-free solution. 
246,Catalpa leaves drooping. Is it from too much rain or something more?,"I have a five year old Northern Catalpa in my yard, zone 4B. Earlier in the summer and in prior years the leaves were held more erect, but now they are all drooping. We have had a lot of rain this summer, and in fact are under a flash-flood warning at the moment. When I compare my catalpa to other (full-grown) catalpas in the area, though, I do not see the same droop in the leaves of the other trees that I see in mine.   Other things to know about my tree:   When it was 2 years old, it did have a small (~1/16"") hole in the trunk, through which I noticed small ants entering the tree. This area has completely healed over, but I've always been a bit worried about it.  It does have some old, healed over weed whacker damage at the base of the trunk (photo below).  I have a major, major infestation of Japanese Beetles in my yard this year, and there have been some beetles in the tree, although I have not noticed the damage in the catalpa that I've seen in other trees in my yard. Soil in the area is clay and alkaline.    So my questions are:   Does this look consistent with a tree that has simply been overwatered? Or should I be worried about something else?  If it is overwatering, are there any steps I can take to help the tree, given that I've done no supplemental watering at all this summer?           "
247,Wormery failure in mass worm die-off ... any advice?,"Last fall our household of two people invested in a small, 3-tiered, commercially-available wormery that came with all components (bedding, lime, worms). All seemed to be going well until we brought it inside to protect it from sub-zero (C) winter temperatures.  It was at this point that a colony of what looked like white spider mites (the same size as, though far less active than, the red ones) exploded in the wormery and inhabited the inner lid and surface of the kitchen scraps.  The mites appear to like warm damp conditions so we did our best to control them by keeping the wormery aerated and by physically removing the mites regularly, although these efforts had little effect. The worms still seemed to be 'healthy', but when draining the reservoir, I often found several dead worms in the liquid. Once outdoor temperatures turned mild enough, the wormery went back outside.  At this point, the mite population decreased, but this was accompanied by a mass worm die-off resulting in failure of the wormery. We followed advice that came with the kit (not adding onion or too many acidic scraps; added newspaper to absorb water; added eggshells to keep the pH balanced; drained the reservoir regularly; kept temperature as stable as possible). Searching through wormery-related online forums resulted in no helpful advice.    Has anybody had a similar experience and knows why this might have happened?    Has anyone had a similar infestation of mites and knows for sure what they are?  "
248,Identify mint types and solve existing problems,"I have several mint types growing on my window sill indoors. I have noticed that some problems with them:   Leggy stems. I have found on internet that this caused by insufficient light. Curly leaves - one side of leaf becomes a bit twisted downwards and towards central leaf stem. Reason unknown Small discoloring towards yellow color on leaves. Reason unknown.   What may be the source to 2 and 3 problem? What do you recommend to solve them? I do water them regularly, tried to add some universal liquid fertilizer.  Also here are some pictures of mint that I have. Please help me identify them.        Thank you! "
249,What is this yellow coloration of cotton wool used as growth media for hydroponics?,"I have built a simple hydroponics DWC system, using a window box with aeration. Actually a system exactly like the below picture:    I am growing lettuce and cabbage, and a week ago I have transplanted my first seedlings into the system. I have grown the first seedlings in cotton wool, as you can see in the picture below.  Unfortunately some yellow stuff have shown up, and quite rapidly grew to what you can see below. It seems to only have affected this one seedling this much, but some of the other cotton wool shows slight yellow formations also.  It does not seem to affect the actual seedlings, nor does it seem to spread much more. But I am curious of what it is, and if it can be problematic? Or perhaps the problem is just that I am using cotton wool, and it becomes constantly wet when placed in the hydroponics system?  I have started using rockwool cubes, which does not seem to be affected in the same way.  Is the yellow stuff something I should be worried about, and what is it? :)   "
250,How do I prune long neglected grape vines?,"A previous answer doesn't answer my question. I have a similar situation with a new house and long neglected vines, except with my vines, there was no trellis, and the vines were growing high into the trees. I probably have 25 feet of thick old vine before there is any new foliage.   How drastically can I prune these old vines?   I decided to build an overhead trellis that I can walk under rather than a fence type, (but I'm not sure now if my idea will work right now that I have done more research and reading).   Any suggestions? "
251,Help identifying plant (supposed to be radicchio) and advice what to do with it,"Late last summer, I planted some seeds from a Burpee packet labeled ""Radicchio, Red Verona"". All but one sprouted and threw out some base leaves that did remind me of the cabbage I grew the year before. But then a white fly infestation and overgrown tomatoes conspired to destroy all but one.   In late fall I cleared the garden of all the annuals, but since that one ""radicchio"" was still hanging in there, I left it. It stayed green throughout winter. Then, in May, it shot up a tall stalk very quickly, which does not remind me of cabbage at all. Now it is developing a number of what look like flower heads.   So, what is it really, and what should I do with it?  My only theory is that it is out of control radicchio and this is what happens when it gets too early of a start. And if so, should I cut it off at the base, leaving a few leaves, in the hope it will grow a proper head of radicchio?   Or is it just a weed?   "
252,Onion seeds v. onion sets,"You see onion seeds for sale but the literature, TV and advice from fellow gardeners always talks about onion sets and it feels as if sets is all anyone ever bothers with.  So who are the seeds for? Are they especially hard to grow from seed?   Why is it that competent gardeners who wouldn't dream of buying anything else (salads, cabbages, beans etc) ""already started"", when they can easily grown their own from scratch, but when it comes to onions they do buy the ""already started"" sets? "
253,How do gardeners revive succulents and root them?,"For example, I picked these up from some rather poorly maintained succulents, and want to revive the leaves, somehow.   I'm soaking them in water for a few hours, then putting half in water, half out, in hopes that they'll absorb some.   On one particularly large dried leaf, I cut off a centimeter of material from the base of the leaf, and put it in a vase, half submerged, with the cut down.  Is it even possible to revive from a condition where the leaves are brown, but are still flexible and contain moisture?  If it WAS possible, what would increase my chances of successfully reviving and rooting these leaves?  That is, for an answer relevant to a more general audience, what ""leaf revival"" options are most likely to work for a given common variety of succulent? "
254,Removing concrete border around stone patio,"My husband and I are buying a portion of our neighbor's property. Currently, our back yard has this ugly brick wall right by the back, which we are going to tear out.  I also want to pull up all the stones in the patio and lay them back down, because they are warped and crooked from years of settling.  Here's a picture.    The problem is there's a concrete border around the stones. I'm assuming that we're going to have to hire a landscaping company to tear down the brick wall, and the concrete border that goes with it. I don't know, however, if that concrete edging is part of the house foundation. I don't know how to tell.  Should we have the concrete border torn out? If so, what should I use for a border?  I have never put in a stone patio or deck, so it'll be a first project for me. I want to add some area to the stone patio, too.  If we don't tear out the concrete border, what can I do to make it look better? Our yard is a complete mess because everything is torn up while we buy the property, build fencing, etc.  Oh, and I'm in Utah, where it gets quite cold in the winter, and very hot in the summer.  Thanks! "

256,What is the best method for trellising green beans?,"I have 6 rows of green beans that have now grown to about 12"" in height and I want to give them something to climb.   What is the best method of trellising them?   I was thinking about grabbing some more bamboo stakes (Already use them for tomatoes) and putting one at each end of the row with a string strung across and letting them climb up that. Will this work and if not is there a better way to do it? "
257,Are red cedar posts a viable option for freshwater dock pilings?,We are installing a platform/dock on a newly built freshwater pond. The property has a great amount of red cedar available for our use. How long could we expect red cedar posts to last if used as pilings? How much longer would black locust last? 
258,What's causing the bark on my maple sapling to split?,"I planted a Maple sapling in my front yard in November 2011, and it hasn't shown very much growth since. It gets leaves during the spring, but they seem to fall off earlier than all the other trees in the area, and I haven't seen any substantial branch growth. This week I noticed the bark near the base has a vertical split. The tree that was planted in the same place up until April 2011 also had similar symptoms, until it was damaged beyond repair by a tornado. I had a backhoe dig out the old root ball, so there shouldn't be any remnants of the old tree.   Is it possible that there's a soil-borne disease affecting the new sapling? If so, is there anything I can do to remedy its condition?   "
259,When should I transfer from pod to pot or ground?,"Since the pre-sprouted plant season is in full bloom, what is a good indicator of the time to transfer a pre-sprouted plant? For instance I have a mexi-bell pepper in a plastic pod and two basil sprouts. The pepper is about 8"" and seems primed to be transplanted now to a pot. The basil is 5"" and seems constricted.   Is height the best indicator; should I also balance that against leaf and stalk health?  Will certain considerations wither once transplanted? If so, what are the sure signs a plant is constricted and getting worse because it's not in the ground or a pot?  "

262,How do I water my full grown cherry tree?,"I bought a house three years ago, the cherry trees appeared to be fruitless. This year they flowered and now have cherries all over them. They are very large adult trees.    Do I water them?   How often and in what way do I water them?   Do I spray the ground around them? Do I dig a little ring around them in the dirt?  Do I just leave them alone.    I want to get the cherries and not destroy them. I live in northern California, just above Sonora at around 3000 feet. "
263,What are the practical differences between cucurbits grown from seed and cuttings?,"What are the practical differences between cucumbers grown from seed and cucumbers of the same maturity level and equivalent root maturity from cuttings?   Is there a significant difference between yield and fruit size/quality of cucumbers grown from seed, which have taproots, and cucumbers grown from cuttings, which don't?  I'm guessing the depth of the soil wouldn't matter as much for cuttings, since they don't have taproots, so long as there were enough soil. I have heard that cuttings from some plants will grow thicker and stronger regular roots to try to make up for the lack of a taproot. I'm not sure if that applies to cucumbers.  I'm growing cucumbers both from seed and from cuttings of the same plants. So, I was wondering if I should expect different sizes of fruit, different levels of production and such. The variety I'm growing, as far as I know, is one called Bushy (since that's the closest matching cucumber seed packet the person I got the cucumber that I saved the seeds from had). However, the plants get huge for that variety, but otherwise the cucumbers seem to be those. They're great for fresh eating and make the best tasting vertical pickle slices I've ever had.  Anyway, I've got an idea that cuttings might be more suitable for a raised bed with black plastic underneath than the seed-grown plants.  I'm also trying to root some watermelon cuttings (Mississippi Cobb Gem, and I'm planning to take a Ledmon cutting, today) in soil. After a few days, my watermelon cutting is still alive and looking well. So, that's a good sign. Hopefully it'll work. It's a large variety that normally probably wouldn't do well in a raised bed with black plastic underneath, due to it preventing the taproot from growing very far down. I've tried a somewhat large variety there before (Klondike Stripe, I think), and the fruit was pitifully small and soft. It's maybe 18 inches of soil. So, it would be interesting to see if they did better from cuttings in such an environment. (I mean, because they have no taproot, the soil depth shouldn't make as much of a difference, it would seem.) "
264,How do I avoid overfilling raised beds if I'm adding substantial manure annually?,"I've got some freshly constructed raised beds and I've filled them with a lovely load of well rotted horse manure.   The manure is so nice to work with, so rich and friable and easy to weed, that next year and the year after I'm going to want to repeat the process, adding in loads more. I've got no shortage of manure. And that's what all the books say - add in ""plenty of well rotted horse manure"".  So, this may seem like a dumb question, but aren't the beds going to fill up? Does settling alone take care of the problem? Or do some gardeners actually remove some of last year's beds to create the space to add plenty of fresh manure? "
265,Could a spider be causing my orchids and cactus to die?,"I had several small plants in the office (two orchids and a small cactus) that died. In a short time they began to dry.  Now a third orchid is beginning with similar symptoms and I wanted to ask what the reason could be:    The grey/black spot at bottom grows, the leaves becomes soft/burned and the the leaves fall off.  Looking at the picture I also noticed something that could be a small dead spider in the top left corner. Detail:    Could this be the reason? Do spiders harm my plants? What should I do? "
266,Should I pinch early pear blossoms to encourage stronger tree and better season?,I have a young pear tree that has several varieties of pears grafted on it. It is starting to blossom. Should I pinch these early blossoms? Will the tree divert resources to making more leaves and produce a second wave of blossoms? How many of these blossoms should I pinch? 
267,New homeowner with weeds instead of grass,"I bought a home recently (southeast US) and the previous owners were neglectful of their back yard. It is pretty much a variety pack of weeds: buffalo weeds, dandelions, wild strawberries, etc. There are a couple of types of ivy taken over several spots as well. I guess a couple batches of failed grass growing attempts also appear in small parts. Now that summer has rolled in, I can see that much of the back yard stays very shady throughout the day, while some spots are medium-level sunny.   I would like a grass lawn (which the neighbors have seemed to achieve), but I am very inexperienced. Should I buy an herbicide and kill off everything, and then throw down some grass seed? Is that the right move? Will herbicide harm my peach tree?  Looking for general recommendations and maybe some specific product suggestions.  Thanks! "
268,Can I grow a fruit bearing pistachio tree?,"I live in Zone 7 in Northwest Texas.  It's pretty dry here and the soil is mostly hard clay.  I'm very interested in growing fruit bearing pistachio trees, but haven't been able to find any local nurseries that know anything about them (maybe that's a bad sign).  Lots of people grow Chinese Pistachios, but that's not the same tree.  Anyway, according to my reading, (Aggie Horticulture Extension, Wikipedia, California Rare Fruit Growers, and others), the pistachio will do well in arid climates and is hardy up to USDA Zone 8a.  So, it's in the zone, however, I'm more concerned about my soil.    The California Rare Fruit Growers website describes the soil requirements like this:     The trees do best on soils that are deep, friable and well drained but moisture retaining. It can, however, survive in poor, stony, calcareous, highly alkaline or slightly acid, or even saline soils. The root is deeply penetrating.   Wikipedia has this to say:     Pistachio is a desert plant, and is highly tolerant of saline soil. It has been reported to grow well when irrigated with water having 3,000–4,000 ppm of soluble salts. They need a sunny position and well-drained soil. Pistachio trees do poorly in conditions of high humidity, and are susceptible to root rot in winter if they get too much water and the soil is not sufficiently free draining.   Is there anyway I can succeed with this venture?  What's the best way to go about it?  Should I amend my soil to make it more sandy or loamy?  If so, how deep and large of an area around each tree would be best?  Any other advice before I attempt this? "
269,What fluorescent bulb is best for my tomato seedlings?,"It has been suggested that my seedlings may not be getting enough light.  What are the best types of fluorescent lights to get?  I have a single bulb, and looking to get another light or two to add to the lighting.  I'm not sure where my wife originally got this bulb, but I figured I'd take this chance to get the ""best"" bulbs for this task.  As a secondary question, do you typically keep your lights on your seedlings 24 hours a day?  Or do you try to mimic daylight by turning the lights off at night? "
270,When and how do I trim these bushes?,"We moved in to a house with bushes trimmed neatly, but well over the sidewalk.  Do I trim this back all at once, or over a long period of time (months? Years?)?  We are in southeast Michigan, and will have several frosts before spring really hits. When do I prune these?  The branching inside appears to be fairly well filled in with thin branches. I'm guessing a hedge trimmer will be fine, cutting everything back. If not, how should I prune them?

273,Is there a way to keep hardy geraniums upright?,"I have some large hardy geraniums in my yard. At their best, they are about 2 feet tall and look beautiful.     However, after a storm, they flatten out and do not look nice:    We get heavy storms frequently this time of year, so the flattening happens every year. The plants do not bounce back; once they are on the ground, they stay there.  Is there any way to prevent my geraniums from flattening in the event of a storm? And if not, are there any tricks for making them look appealing again?  "
274,How to get rid of Smilax aspera,"I need to clean and restore an old olive plantation which was not cultivated for around 20 years and is now covered with weeds, bushes and spruce tree. I'm new to olive trees but have clean almost everything. But one ""pest"" bothers and comes back very quickly. It is a plant Smilax aspera which so far I was unable to eradicate. It grows very quickly and is capable to cover and suffocate whole olive tree.  What is the best way to get rid of Smilax aspera?  Initially I thought to do everything in an ecological way, but now this Smilax aspera is very resistant and I'm comfortable to use chemicals. Reason (frustration) for this is that olive plantation is far from road access, 1200 m (6000 ft) on very difficult to walk Mediterranean rocky terrain and even when Smilax aspera is removed from under the olive trees, it grows from nearby dry walls as on this image:   What other options do I have? Would burning and use of fire remove it permanently? "

280,How should I trim spent flowers from a sun star (Ornithogalum dubium)?,"I've read several online guides about taking care of sun star, Ornithogalum dubium, plants, but I'm confused about how to trim off the spent flowers. The instructions say to ""remove spent flowers from the base, and another guide says to gently pull them out (and that it wouldn't harm the plant).    I can easily pull the individual spent flowers out of the spike:    Or am I supposed to pull the entire thing out of the plant? I tried to gently pull one of them out (one without any flowers on it) but it wouldn't budge. Should I be cutting the entire spike off? How do I trim the spent flowers here? "
281,Units of nutrient uptake rate in hydroponics?,"I'm studying the nutrient uptake by plants in hydroponics. I found that in many literatures, the uptake rate was expressed as xx (mg m-2 hour-1). Does anyone know what does that per square meter mean? Is it per leaf area or per root area? You can find similar expression in this paper link, in Table 1., the uptake was expressed as xx mol m-2 s-1 "
282,Why build a worm bin? Why can't you have a worm heap?,"I understand the value of vermiculture, and grew up with a wormbox on the back patio that made beautiful castings. What I don't understand is the purpose of the bin.  If I kept a heap of worm-friendly scraps, mixed with some dirt and kept moist, and covered with a layer of dirt to keep pests away, wouldn't that accomplish basically the same thing as a worm bin?  In other words, wouldn't a poorly run compost heap that doesn't get hot basically turn into a worm heap anyway, no need for a bin?  I feel like I might be missing something important, but a heap is a lot cheaper and simpler than a bin, and wouldn't dry out as quickly or have as much susceptibility to temperature swings, and wouldn't rot and need replacing every few years. "
283,Will a branch on a small tree always be at that same height?,"We have a lot of trees on the farm (Apple, maple, pear, walnut, oak...) and I've been reading about pruning lately. One of the things I stumbled upon is that when a tree is say five feet tall and has a branch at 18 inches above the ground there will always be a branch at 18 inches (even if the tree grows to 50 feet). Is this true? I assume this would also apply to Y's in trees where the trunk separates into two different sections. If you want a good looking tree ideally you don't want a big branch 18 inches off the ground, so you'd prune it.  So, basically, is it true that when a branch grows in it will always remain at the height it started out at? "
284,Who is this tan mosquito-like flying insect hanging on various tree leafs in zone 5 northeast USA?,"I grow potted trees in zone 5 of northeastern USA and spend time watching the nature around them. I have been trying to learn more about the insects that frequent the plants, whether for good or bad.  In early summer I was regularly seeing the insect shown in photos below. I still see it sometimes, but not as frequently. I couldn't tell that it was hurting any leafs but it was putting its mouth to the leafs as if eating or sucking on something. Is it helping (protecting from other pests) or hurting (being a pest) the leafs? Its mouthparts and coloration are not like mosquitoes' but it otherwise its form is similar to one. It seemed to land on various leafs and trees in different areas of the garden but I noticed it most on hazelnuts (maybe just by chance).        A related question, maybe better a separate question, is how do you learn all the insects that frequent your plants? Are there good resources or methods to ID insects in a garden? "
285,What options except cutting the tree down do I have if a fir tree is growing too high?,There's a fir tree that is now about seven meter tall and continues to grow and will reach something like 20 meters height. The tree is too close to buildings and too close to plants and so the shadow it casts is a problem and also the perspective of it growing to 20 meters is also a problem.  Cutting the tree down at earth level is an options but it doesn't feel good - it would be nice to have some medium size or small tree there.  Maybe I can cut it at three-four meters height? What other options are there? 
286,Should I cut off severely bent stems (folded on darker line or spot) on my Peace Lily?,"I left my home for 11 days and told someone else to water my Peace Lily but she forgot. When I returned the plant looked dead, lying flat and hanging around the pot. I have watered it and cut some yellow leaves, and in two to three days most of the leaves stood upright again.   Yet the stems of some of the bigger ones have bent so much that they are not uniformly bent but they fold on one point that is darker and seems to be damaged (see pic):    Shall I cut it or is there still any chance that it will regenerate? And if have to cut it, should I do it just below the bend? "
287,Am I meeting the light requirements for indoor dwarf citrus trees?,"I've recently purchased 3 dwarf citrus trees that we plan to keep indoors for ~9 months of the year. We are in zone 6 so we can only reliably move the trees to the porch for June, July and August with time moving in and out in the spring and fall for acclimation.  The trees will be kept in 3 different rooms, all of which we regularly use. The individual trees are Dwarf Meyer Lemon, Dwarf Venous Orange and a Dwarf Key Lime.  Current available lights are 6 300 watt max can/spring lights that mostly have 100w equivalent 1600 lumen leds on the 5000K spectrum and then I purchased 3 200w Comp Fluorescent lights that initially will be running 6400k 200w lights that, on the safe side, we will estimate at 13,000 lumens. These lights will all be custom mounted on an adjustable bar and kept a little less than a foot from the top of the trees as they grow and be put on timers for 14-16 hours a day. Combined this calculates out to ~58,000 lux per tree given a 3'x3' area, using 2 can lights and the 1 compact fluorescent.   There will be very little window light access, maybe only a few hours a day from a southern facing window. I'm loath to do anything extra special on the color spectrum, since these are rooms we regularly use like the kitchen/bedroom/hallway. While I can direct the lights so that they are not at risk of shining directly in people's eyes, creating such a bright room that we would not want to sit near it without sunglasses isn't optimal either.   Questions: Is my current plan sufficient for light? If it is not, what is the most cost effective way of making it sufficient? Do any of the 3 have greater light requirements than the others? "
288,"Damaged Lily leaves: Brown, yellow and cut. What to do?",Damaged Peace Lily: shall I cut leave encircled in red?   What about the yellow-brown on the back right of the encircled one?   This occurred after the plant had not been watered for too long. But others already had brown elongated spots on the edge of the leave. Is this a sign of something wrong?    Thanks in advance.  
289,What is your method of protecting evergreens in the winter time?,"I am trying to get a small sense of what most people do to protect their evergreens in the winter.   I personally wrap about 15,  10' arborvitaes each year and going up and down a ladder and around and around just seems like I am doing it wrong. I was trying to kinda invent a solution because I could not find many alternatives. I posted some idea I had to a website that makes random stuff and if they like the idea then they will make it. It is kinda hard to describe, but it is basically kinda like putting a hat on each tree so the snow does not get down the middle. With the idea I posted a couple pictures and a bunch of product details to the site, and I am starting to think I did not do the best job designing this because of my lack of responses. It is not too late for me to edit anything I submitted. So I was wondering If anyone else who has to prepare evergreen trees for winter thinks it is a huge pain? I also have not tested my idea so I am kinda iffy. Does anyone have any insight on if they think this would work or not? any negative repercussions? I have to wait a long while before I can test my theory.  I know this is a long question so I answered as many of other people's as I could before I posted and if anyone takes the time to throw me a little insight into my problem I will gladly do my best to field any landscaping questions, I have a good amount of experience in the field. Thank You "
290,Peace Lily. Inside of stem protrudes (see pic). Do I need to do something about it?,"As you can see in the pic of this Peace Lily, the internal part of the stem encircled in red protrudes outside its cover. Is that normal? Should I try to push it in or do something about it?   "
291,How to replace lawn with rock garden,"I am not a big fan of mowing the lawn, and am planning to cover the current lawn with washed rock completely (also to prevent weed growth).   Do I need to prep anything beforehand? Or can I simply have to cut the grass, and leave the cut grass in the lawn as is, and then lay the washed rocks over them directly? "
292,"Will indoor-grown strawberries flower multiple times, if grown all year long?","My parents have a great garden that they started a few years ago with a bed of strawberries and a few other things. My dad built a box to keep out rabbits, but soon enough the strawberries had outgrown the box and then they started out growing the confines of the garden. We figured it was a good enough reason to not mow those parts of the lawn, but now we have an ever increasing field of strawberries. As a very willing member of my family, (and a bit of a scientist) I have decided to take up growing some in my dorm room next year, so they'll be inside, under lamp light from the end of summer until the start of spring. (And in upstate New York, that might be a long time)  My main question is:    Will my strawberry plants, taken from the runners of my family's well-established June-bearing strawberry plants (I'm not certain of a specific variety), flower and fruit over the winter?  How often/recurrently will they flower?  Is there anything I can do to have them flower more often?  What if they were ever-bearing? How about day-neutral?  "
293,How to take care of geraniums?,The leaves are turning yellow on my geraniums. Am I over watering them or are they getting too much? What is causing this? I have only had them a couple of weeks. 
294,What are the Coldest Spring Temperatures to Overseed a Lawn?,I know (now) that the best time to overseed a lawn is in the Fall.  I obviously missed that window so I have to make do.  I've read that the 2nd best time to overseed is early Spring.  But how early is too early?  I live in the middle of Pennsylvania and temps are currently running about 30-50&amp; deg;F.  What temperatures should I be looking for to overseed?  Will a heavy frost damage new grass seedlings?  I'm anxious to get going (it will be 60 &deg;F on Saturday) but I don't want to rush it if I'm going to do more harm than good. 
295,What is this weird growth on my cucumber?,"It is about 8cm tall and used to be green but is now slowly going white...  Is it some form of tumour?      Edit  Here is the picture of the whole cucumber (for you disbelievers). The growth can be found on the top left and you can find a growing cucumber on the bottom of the same plant:    Split up into the segments, it looks like this:    I have cut up the segments. While cutting, there was a distinct smell of cucumber - the same as when slicing a normal example of the fruit. You can also see some of the wet interior has some shared features with that of a cucumber.    I have also found a hole that could possibly be evidence of an insect being present at some stage of development of this growth, suggesting that Giacomo Catenazzi's answer may be right:   "
296,What happens if I cut some of the roots of a cottonwood tree?,"I have a large 54"" (1.37 m) diameter cottonwood tree that is 16 feet (5 m) away from where a storm sewer is to be installed. I am sure roots will be cut, but will this tree survive? If the chances are not good, how long would it take to show signs of dying? "
297,Spiders in my plant (not spider mites),"I am wondering if it is ok to let the spiders I have in my plants live?  The plants seem happy, going about its day (its a maranta leconeura and a calathea orbifolia)  Both plants don’t seem to have any illnesses or pest and they are giving me many new leafs.  I’ve read somewhere that letting the spiders (regular, not spider mites) live in peace in the plant is healthy and helping me keep the pests and flies away.  Is this true?  "
298,"When transplanting seedlings, why shouldn't I put them straight into the ground?","I just started gardening, and I'm getting really into it.  I live in an apartment and I've been planting seeds in containers and putting them on my balcony.  I read the instructions on the seed packet and some say to ""plant in a small container, leave in dark for a few days, keep moist, then transplant into bigger pot.""  My question is why transplant? Why not just put the seed where it's eventually going to go and you're done?  I transplanted a seedling into a larger container and I butchered it, it was my first time.  I think I exposed the roots, and I haven't seen any growth in a couple weeks.  I think they are in shock, or otherwise not doing well.  I can see if it's cold outside and you want to protect them from the weather, but that doesn't apply to me.  Why can't I just put the seed in where it's supposed to end up and save the added work and the risk of botching the transplanting? What is the benefit of transplanting? "
299,"proper drainage in aluminum foil dish, container","I have a bunch of aluminum foil dishes that are maybe 3"" deep:    I'm going to fill with soil and put on the roof of my apartment building.  How should I prepare the container?  Specifically, how do I take care of drainage?  I was going to just prick it with pin holes a bunch of times, and then rest it on a few sticks or something to keep it technically off the ground so it will drain.  Do I need to put anything in at the bottom of the dish?  I've heard mixed things about gravel (and I'm not sure I have the vertical room here anyway.  Do I line the bottom with newspaper?  I was going to fill the bottom half with normal potting soil, and then the top half with seed starting soil, and then plug it with arugula or some other vegetable.  Any recommendations on how to prepare the container, and how/what to fill it with would be greatly appreciated! "
300,"""Composting"" Temperature(s)","I'm doing soil improvement work in Santa Fe, NM.  I've dug down ~24"" in an area ca. 2'x 6', creating an empty pit sort of like digging a grave and mixing back in the native dirt in ~4-6"" layers with copious amounts of spent coffee grounds, very generous amounts of peat, wetted &amp; diced dried alpaca manure, as well as some fire ash &amp; sawdust.    It's very, very dry here, so I've been wetting down the finished product when I've completed a layer.  The mixture can get seriously hot in very little time --when I stick my hand down into the ""soil"" approx. 4 or 5 inches, it's often too hot too leave there for more than a few seconds, &amp; I'm an Aries who's used to playing with fire &amp; traversing hot coals.  (I'm repeating this process in adjacent spaces.)    I'm guessing that the heat is generated by some sort of chemical reaction within the ingredient mix.   So I have two (2) questions:    Is this high heat excessive i.e. can it do any damage to the soil amendments &amp; therefore be counterproductive? do you see any serious imbalances in my additive program?     The soil here tends to be pretty alkaline, &amp; the soil I've started with is poor-- a clay &amp; sand mixture with many smaller stones, which I've removed. "
301,What should I do after daffodils and tulips have bloomed?,I am new to having a garden as I have only just moved into my new house. I have some basic questions regarding flowers after they have finished blooming. My mother-in-law planted some daffodils and tulips which grew well and bloomed. The flowers have now died and I do not know what the best step is.  Do they grow again next year if I leave them planted? Should I trim them back? 
302,"Can snail pellets be safely used in a vegetable garden? If not, any safer alternatives?","Is it safe to use snail pellets in a vegetable garden bed or will these slowly leach into the soil? Is there a safer alternative that will keep snails out, but won't be absorbed by the vegetables? "
303,What size of plant pot should I be using for young chili plants?,"I have 4 small chili plants (sorry not sure what variety they are), they have 3 sets of leaves. I re-potted them from a seed tray about 2 weeks ago. I'm a bit concerned the plant pot is too big? When growing from seeds how many times should I re-pot and into what sizes?   "
304,How to prune roses with tall branches?,I have this neglected rose bush in my garden. It seems too long and spindly? How and when should I prune it?   
305,Non-flowering chives,"My chives are doing well, strong and disease free. But they are not flowering! Could mine be a late flowering variety? Is there such a thing? Or maybe a non-flowering variety? Thanks.  "
306,Can I separate this spider plant (Chlorophytum comosum)?,"I just bought a spider plant from a store recently. The plant is so aggregated that I can see many stems in a 8cm diameter pot ( 10+ ). I wondered if I can separate them. I tried to separate them from the soil, then I see their roots are so fat like a mini-radish, this is a pic from the internet:    What is this special root called?  This is one of my plant bought from a store:      You can see there are so many plants inside a single pot. Can I separate them without hurting them? "
307,Can propagation by layering be started in the fall?,"I have a thriving elderberry bush I'd like to propagate. Can I start layering, as in bury a shoot of the bush, in late summer/fall and expect to have an independent rooted plant which can be separated and transplanted in the following spring or fall? If so, are there any additional considerations for layering over winter that I should have in mind to boost chances of success? "
308,Germinating ALL vegetable/fruit/ornamental seeds in water before planting in soil,"Is it advantageous to germinate all your seeds in water till they sprout before planting in the soil? Or only some? If some, which ones and why?  I have seen people do this online to tomato seeds mainly... wondering if other seeds could gain from this treatment.  I had a dream last night where I received the idea that you actually gain MORE seeds than if you just sow directly into a seed bed. Germinating in the water has a higher success rate? Has my David Lynch inspired dream gotten it right? Is this true? "
309,How to deal with invasive Ailanthus (Tree of Heaven),"My neighbors have a great tall Ailanthus (Tree of Heaven).  Apparently, before I moved into my house, so did our yard.  We now have an enormous stump and a bazillion new shoots that come up from hidden roots all over the back portion of our yard.  I call it my ""weed tree"", because no matter how often I try to pull out new branches, next week I'll find six new three foot high trees popped up.  I don't think I can remove the stump without machinery, and I'm not even sure what machinery to use.  Making matters worse, it's on a hill-side which is steep enough to make my working on it a pain in the neck, and potentially dangerous.  Eventually I plan to terrace and cultivate this hill, but that won't be possible as long as the Ailanthus is still there.  Should I just give up and hire a landscaper to rip up the stump and the entire portion of the yard that's apparently a dense network of Ailanthus roots?  Presumably that would make the terrace work easier for me as well.  Or is there some (cheaper) way to prevent it from growing?  Although my garden and yard care is entirely organic, I might be open to a chemical warfare approach only if it could be targeted to just the weed tree. "
310,Sprinkling plants' leaves with water,"Is there a concrete rule for which plants like to have their leaves sprinkled with tap water (since distilled water is not at hand)?   For instance (and among indoor plants), do Ficus elastica and Philodendron qualify, and if so what would be a good schedule? "
311,What woods shouldn't be used for hugelkultur?,"I have a yard this year for the first time and I'm attempting various methods of building beds.  For my first bed, I used double digging.  But that was an insane amount of work and I'm not all that happy with the bed that resulted.  I've been reading a lot of permaculture literature and they all suggest gradual bed construction through sheet mulching.    But I don't have that much organic matter readily available to me.  About the only organic matter I have is a giant brush pile from a serious shrub trimming.  The pile includes an entire box shrub, as well as trimmings of box shrub and yew.  It also includes a large quantity of soft needle pine and tulip popular branches that came down in a storm.    I know pretty much all parts of a yew tree are toxic.  Will that prevent it from working well in a hugelkultur?  Will the toxin degrade or will it keep the yew from rotting and/or poison my soil microbes?  Are there any woods that shouldn't be used for hugelkultur? "
312,How viable will 5 year old or 25 year old bush bean seeds be?,"My Grandfather bred a bush bean for my Grandma.  They've been gone for years, but I would like to try and keep the breed alive for heirloom purposes.  I've got two sources of seeds, 1 source is about 5-8 years old, and the other source is 25+.  What are my chances of getting any of these seeds to sprout?  I assume the 25+ year old seeds will be less than 1%, but I'm hoping the 5+ year old seeds I might get closer to 50% or better.  Any ideas?   "
313,What extra benefit does air layering provide over just cutting it,"What does the air layering technique add to the rooting capabilities over just cutting it off and using rooting hormone.  If the air layer stops circulation in cambian layer what does it matter if I cut it off completely? There must be some transport still working in an air layering that is not, when its cut off completely? "
314,Is there a weedkiller I can use at the foot of hedges?,"I have mature hedging all round my garden, the hedging consisting of dozens of different plant species, but mostly blackthorn, holly, laurel (I think) and box (?).  Annually the foot of the hedge gets into a royal mess of nettles and brambles and some other tedious weeds. In previous years I've tried hand weeding but it's not all that successful. In the densest parts of the hedge the weeds can at best be decapitated (can't reach the roots), which is next to useless.   I want to tackle the weeds more aggressively. I'd like to blitz the foot of the hedge with weedkiller but obviously I don't want to harm the hedge.   Is that possible?  If recommending actual brands, UK brands please. I have in mind something like the broad-leaf herbicide which I currently use on pasture. Kills docks, nettles etc and leaves grass alone. "
315,Strawberry Plants from Home Depot not producing.,"This is the 3rd year and they have done ok, until this year and no fruit to mention. Planted nicely in ground on retaining wall of rock. Growing very large, should I cut them back or just let continue to let them grow??? "
316,How should I use corrugated cardboard for mulch?,"I tend to have a lot of corrugated cardboard boxes laying around, due to getting various things shipped to my house.  I have heard of using cardboard for a mulching material, but I'm not sure exactly how to do it (maybe I'm overthinking things).   Ignoring the option of shredding and composting it:  Should I shred it and treat it like I would straw mulch? Should I rip it into sheets and just lay it down flat on the ground between rows? Should it be covered with anything, or can it just sit out? Is there some other method that I haven't thought of? "
317,How to prune my sad rhododendron?,"We've got PJM rhododendrons at our new house in Michigan... a couple of them are absolutely flourishing, but two of the smaller bushes right next to them are not having a good time.  Some of the branches flowered sparsely this year, but about half the bush is woody and bare.  I see buds, but they didn't open, and no new leaves are growing on these branches now.  Two questions:  (1) Why?  What caused this, and how can I prevent it in the future?  Cold winter?  Soil conditions?  I got some Holly-tone but haven't applied it yet...   (2) How to fix it?  I understand that you can prune as long as you do so above a growing center, and the buds have not set for next year.  But some of these branches don't have a hint of green anywhere, all the way down to the ground.  Should I lop them off and hope the rest of the bush fills out over the next few years? "
318,Are there benefits to changing the direction you mow a lawn?,"This is one of those ancient bits of ""wisdom"" I vaguely recall from my childhood; and now that I have a lawn which seems quite happily established, I'm looking into keeping it that way.  So, I want to know if there's any truth to it.  Supposedly, each time you mow your lawn, you should change the direction you mow.  For example, travel north/south one mowing, then east/west the next mowing.  It's obvious if you look at a freshly mown lawn which direction the mower traveled, which I think lends this idea its believability.  But I can't honestly think of any benefit to the plants.  After a day or two they're all still happily growing ""up"" after all.  And with a motorized spinning blade, I don't see how you could say that a blade of grass was cut ""this way,"" anyway.  So, is there something I'm missing?  Is there some benefit to the plants?  Or is there some quirk of reel mowers which made it true in the past; and if so, is it still true? "
319,How can I correct a nutrient excess in soil?,"The soil sample I took last fall from my vegetable garden came back from the lab with this result:                                                   Optimum Range Calcium, Mehlich 3 (Ca)     2063     (ppm)  H   800 - 1200    Magnesium, Mehlich 3 (Mg)   416      (ppm)  H   60 - 120      Potassium, Mehlich 3 (K)    573      (ppm)  VH  170 - 280     Phosphorus, Mehlich 3 (P)   248      (ppm)  VH  30 - 50          Where ""VH"" means ""very high"" and H means ""high"".  Fortunately the pH is 6.5, which is about where I want it. However, all the lime and manure I've added over the past few years has kind of thrown things out of whack...  According to this handy chart:   Too much potassium ""Causes N[itrogen] deficiency in plant and may affect the uptake of other positive ions such as Mg and Ca"". Excess phosphorus ""shows up as micronutrient deficiency of Zn, Fe, or Co"".   Obviously, I don't need to add fertilizer except for nitrogen.  Is this something I should try to balance out? How? "
320,Does wood shop sawdust work well for mushroom casing?,"I have a friend with a home wood shop, and he said I can get his clean sawdust for free. Will this make good casing to keep things from drying out? Hay is a common casing for wine cap, so why not sawdust? "

323,How should I eliminate spider mites on my big boston fern?,"What would the best solution to get rid of spider mites on my big boston fern be?   I discovered beneath all the healthy beautiful fronds that there were dead leaves and webs with lots of white dots on them, and I saw a pretty big spider mite crawling about. It's the size of a baby spider.  Is the best solution to cut all the fronds off so it can grow new ones?   It is very digficult to take a photo of it but I tried as best as I could   "
324,How many bean plants will corn / sunflower support?,"I planted a section of my garden three-sisters style this year: corn, squash/pumpkin, and pole beans (for dry harvest).  I also have a 25' row of ""Mammoth Gray Stripe"" sunflowers (9-12 footers) in the back of the garden where I've planted beans among the sunflowers. I had to saw down a similar variety of sunflower last fall, so I'm pretty sure these are going to be sturdy enough to carry a heavy load.  I started the corn and sunflowers first, thinking that they'd get a head start before the beans start to climb.  My question is:  What's the right ratio of beans to corn/sunflower? I.e. how many vines is each plant capable of supporting? "
325,"What's the right way to cut a tall, narrow tree?",I have a messy holly tree with lots of trunks. They're perhaps 10m (30') tall and very straight but only about 10cm (4') diameter.  I've been learning about face cuts and leaving a hinge but on such narrow trunks is that needed/correct? The holding wood would surely be super-thin.  On the other hand if it kicked out and hit me in the gut or landed on my head it could be nasty so I'm nervous to just do a single cut.  What is the recommended way to take down this size of tree? 
326,How deep to dig for a new flowering pear tree?,Last year I planted 3 flowering pear trees. For those who have never heard of the tree (or do not grow these trees) they look like this:    For 2 out of the 3 trees it was very simple to plant the tree as the soil was very good and to this day both are living very well and growing very well.  The third one I planted was very difficult to plant; not only was there a LOT of clay but there was a TON of poured cement / crushed concrete.  It appears (since this was a newly built house) that the builder just dumped either crushed concrete or concrete itself in this one area and covered it up with some dirt / clay / soil.  I tried as best I could to dig a hole and was so tired in doing so I finally got enough dug to place the tree in the hole.  This tree was always much weaker then the other two trees and eventually this year died.  So because of the design of these three trees this is the first one in a row that has died.  So just taking it out and growing grass would look really odd as I am missing the first out of three trees.  So I have to replant one...so I dug this one out and have been using a huge pick to pick as much concrete out of this hole but it appears I am surronded by this crushed concrete.  I guess my question is how far deep or along the sides do I need to keep digging in order to plant this tree correctly? I do not want to end up with the same mistake the first time of my tree dying again.  Is there some sort of limit in depth or width I need to go before I can say stop then plant the tree and surround it with good dirt?  With this in mind besides top soil should I add some peat moss / wood chips to enrich the health and promote growth on this tree? 
327,Should the aerial roots be trimmed on my ficus tree?,"I have a couple 3 foot tall ficus trees which have some thin aerial roots descending from the branches.  I keep both indoors, and they do not get a lot of sunlight.  However, when I purchased them 2 months ago, they already had these aerial roots.  Would trimming the aerial roots have any major impact on the health of the tree?  If so, are there things I can do to offset these effects?  I have seen some trees that never seem to grow these types of roots, is this species dependent or environmentally determined? "
328,Adding dirt/soil to a compost bin?,"Reading multiple entries here and a few others onlne, I have noticed people writing about using dirt/soil in their compost piles/heaps/bins. I had never heard of putting either dirt or soil in a composting bin. I can understand using a low fertility blow sand/silt - dirt just to build a bulk or mass that the compost could improve upon, but why add soil?    Many sources tell that, ""Dirt is dead"" and ""Soil is alive"". That is taking things to an extreme; while I do agree that soil is vibrant, and yet dirt is far from dead because you can improve dirt into soil in a few months. Dead means dead. We need to change the way we word what dirt honestly means.   So why put either into a compost bin/pile/heap? "
329,How to tape a split cherry tree?,"I planted a flowering cherry this spring. A delivery of top soil ended up with it bend flat under a ton bag... After this was removed the tree wasn't smashed but is partially split where the trunk was grafted onto the rootstock.  How should I try to save this tree? 4 days on, leaves are still green... At what point will I know if it survived? "
330,What happens if you plant lettuce in hot weather?,"For whatever reason my lettuce (except for the mustard) in my mesclun mix didn't take this year.  I'm about ready to rotate in something else, but I'd really like a decent crop of lettuce.   I don't see any reason why I shouldn't be able to plant lettuce and pick it while it's still really tiny right?  I thought the reason you shouldn't plant it in hot weather was because it bolts quick.  Does it just not taste good?  "
331,Does anyone know the reason potatoes should not be added to the compost pile?,"There is a list of at least 13 things that do not go into the compost pile.  Most I know and understand.  I just found a list that included potatoes.  Potatoes do what to a pile of compost?  Feces, meats, dairy are obviously a no no but potatoes?    The only problem I can see is that a chunk of potato with an eye will grow.  Is that the only reason?   "
332,How can I waterproof garden walls which have bad damage to the rendering?,"Our garden is on an extreme slope, so I got someone in to landscape it. Unfortunately after one winter the walls are a complete mess. I'm not getting the person who did it back, so I am after any advice on fixing the problem.     The walls are made from breeze blocks and it seems that water is coming through from the inside and destroying the rendering. What would be a good way to fix this? I'm not too worried about it looking perfect, I just want it sorted. I've played around with the idea pulling all of the rendering off and painting the breeze blocks, but I'm thinking that will be a nightmare job as breeze blocks are quite soft.   Could I do something to the inside of the walls to waterproof it, or could it be that the water might be coming down from the top? Any advice would be great! "
333,Do I need to line my wooden compost bin?,"I've made a compost bin out of old scaffold boards - approx 80cm x 80cm square (say 30 inches). It has four sides, with no top and no bottom and it's sitting directly on soil. I've read that compost can get warm and should be kept damp. If I want the bin to last 5 years,do I need to line it to protect the wood? And if so, with what? "
334,Bonsai from tree cuttings,"Is there a way to make a bonsai from a normal tree cutting (not from a bonsai cutting)? I was just thinking for instance of making a bonsai maple from a normal size field maple, or ash, etc. What trees are suitable for this? (I am in UK) "
335,How to eradicate Ambrosia - common ragweed?,"Last year my property and surrounding area was rather free from Ambrosia ie common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) and now it is everywhere... probably because no-one in this country (Bosnia) is really trying to eradicate (regardless it is required by law).  Is there efficient way to eradicate or at least keep Ambrosia under control, since it is highly allergenic and very invasive?   Should I even bother to fight against it (mowing and pulling before flowering), if no-one else is trying? Would herbicides help (although I'd rather not use them)? Is this lost battle? "
336,Can we take out the whole root of Aloe Vera and replant it during transplant?,"I bought a Aloe Vera in a shop a year ago and I just use the pot that came with it, so obviously I don't know what is in the soil and their components.  Yesterday I felt that I should transplant the aloe because the plastic pot is broken and the soil should be aerated. So I took out the aloe and quickly found that the soil are mostly clay, stone and soil. The clay are so dry that they look like stone. This kind of soil is bad and I want to completely change the soil, however, the aloe has its roots holding on the soil.  Can we remove all of the soil from the root? If I remove the soil, the root cannot hold on the new soil immediately because the contact of the root with the new soil is no better than the case that the root hold on the soil by itself like a web.  Do you have experience of such transplant and come with no harm to the plant? If the root cannot hold on the soil, the plant will topple. "
337,Am I doing the right thing with my chilli plants?,"I have four chilli plants (Cayenne F1's) that I bought from a garden centre as seedlings back in April (I am in Scotland). When I say seedlings these plants were in tiny seedling growers and started life in my house as 4-6cm seedlings with a stalk and a leaf or two.  I transplanted all four into a large pot (in a mix of garden earth and garden centre compost) and to my amazement they started to grow to the point where I think they were competing for nutrients. The said ""large pot"" is in photograph #1 below.  Tonight I decided to separate all four plants and plant them in their own pots (approx 15cm x 15cm).   In each pot I used a mix of their original earth/compost mix and then topped up with a general purpose ""multi-purpose"" compost. I then watered each pot with 0.5L of water mixed with a teaspoon of ""phostrogen"" plant food.  The following photographs are the outcome of my transplant exercise:  Plant#1 - this seems to be the strongest of the plants - lots of flowers, started producing fruit (I've harvested a few which is why it looks barren):    Plant#2 - this was the second strongest looking plant - a fair number of flowers and has begun producing fruit:    Plant #3 - not a lot of flowers but has produced a couple of fruits    Plant #4 - this fella was the runt of the litter in the shared pot and despite me rotating the pot daily to make sure it got a fair share of sunlight, it looks a bit bent out of shape.    This is my first major horticultural adventure. The last thing I grew was cress back in  primary school when I was five years old.  The plants are growing on my kitchen window-sill (inside, not outside) in Scotland. My kitchen window is south facing so I get good sun from around 11am right through until 9pm in the evening. The windows are closed all the time and there are no draughts. We're having a very nice summer so far in central Scotland with outside temperatures in the mid 20's (ambient) and the kitchen is quite warm.  I have some questions:   Do these plants look ""normal"" and are they stuck at their pre-transplant growing size/flowering potential? I read somewhere that chilli plants need some kind of manual pollination. I've been transferring pollen from the flowers with my little finger from on flower to another. Is this necessary for every bunch of flowers that appear? I am new to growing plants that fruit, am I doing the right thing? Was I too late in separating the plants into their own pots?  "
338,Should i trim my avocado plant through the winter?,"I have several baby avocado plants that grew this summer. 2 of them i managed to get a first trim while it was still hot out, but at least 2 did not get a trimming. They are currently about 8-12 inches tall. Should i go ahead and cut them, even though its almost autumn? Or should i leave them till its nearer to spring? I will be bringing them inside, as it does get very cold here in the winter (northeast states in the US). "
339,"Keeping creeping thyme, or other ground cover, weed free (aka thyme vs. clover)","I have a path with flagstone, with the gap between the stones being around an inch or so.  I've had creeping thyme growing between the stones, but it's been a huge battle keeping other plants, specifically clover (which I think may have already been living in the thyme plants when I brought them home from the nursery).  I've spent quite a bit of time pulling up the invaders and as much of their roots as possible, but it's been a very time-consuming process.  I'm worried that the clover might crowd out the thyme, which hasn't always been as hardy as I'd like.  Anyone have any pointers on maintaining healthy, mostly weed free ground covers, especially gap-filling plants?  Any hints on blocking or retarding the growth of invaders?  Or should I give up on this plant and try to find something that's going to grow more aggressively in this space (clover seems to like this location)?  Also, I'd prefer to stick to an organic solution and not use any harsh chemicals. "
340,How should I deal with my willow tree that has been butchered by the council?,"This willow tree was pruned, and cut back to stump. I believe that whoever was cutting the tree didn't know what he was doing.  Today we returned home and were hugely shocked. The willow tree was somewhere above 3.5 meters (not sure exactly, maybe 4-6 meters) tall. It's on council land. The neighbours said it will take 5 years to regrow. The same thing happened 5 years ago. The thick branches were cut, not only the fine ones or the ones which could cause danger. The tree was starting already to sprout.   I think there is a lot of damage to the tree. In addition the birds have been living in a small hollow of the tree. Tree looks like a stump right now.  The council didn't even inform us that they are looking to do such a thing. Two years ago when we bought the house, the little branches had been going over the electric wires. They came and cut the unnecessary branches but that was it. Everybody has been happy.  Is this bad for the tree? How can I keep this from happening again?  click any photo for full size         Here is the tree I am talking about. In the first picture, you can see the hole where the birds used to live. Very upsetting. Yes, I do agree tree is not ours. At least informing people what is meant to happen would be nice. Because is very close to the house, the aesthetic look is terrible now, and they disturbed the habitat.  Also do you think the very top and the front branch was cut well?  "
341,Grafting an adult cherry-tree?,"I happen to have an adult cherry-tree which gives a lot of cherries but they are tiny and basically consist of the kernel and the skin.  One of my neighbors will prune his cherry-tree soon. As I'm helping during the harvest I know that its cherries are great.  I'm now wondering whether I can graft my tree with his branches.  If so, which kind of branches I should choose? Which method of grafting I should use? Is it the right moment, if not, is it a really bad moment? "
342,"Cucumber plants are healthy, but wilt badly in hot sun, then recover","If cucumber plants are growing well, wilt very badly in the sun, revive quickly in shade and over night, is the wilting harming them? Their soil tests okay for water. I am in northern California and the sun gets blazing hot with temperatures up to, and sometimes over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (~38 °C). I fear bitter cukes will result from this scenario. Should I throw cheese cloth over them or screen them in some other way? "
343,Where and when to pinch back for bushy basil,"I've read that ""pinching back"" or pruning basil plant (ocimum basilicum) will produce a bushier, less leggy, plant.  Where on the plant do you cut?  When do you cut? How often? Does age of plant matter? "
344,How are root vegetables grown in hot climates?,"In previous answers, I've mentioned our general lack of success growing root vegetables in North Texas. Carrots and beetroots do not do well at all - roots are few and small. Onions and potatoes do better but watering seems to be a problem.  Apparently we are 8a/7b on the USDA hardiness zones. That looks about right (8a, lows of 10-15F sounds normal, but this winter was more like 7b, lows 5-10F). Summer temperatures have highs in the 90s / low 100s. Last year (an extreme summer) had over four weeks of highs over 100F - usually it is just a few days or a week at a time.  Rain tends to be in the form of heavy storms during spring and autumn. Nice persistent English rain only comes if we are lucky enough to get a tropical cyclone large enough to survive 300 miles inshore. Unfortunately such events are large enough to make the international news.  Anyway, potatoes seem to work best if they are well watered and planted early (e.g. ones that started growing in the cupboard that get planted on a whim in Autumn). Onions seem to be a war of attrition with most sets eventually dieing but a few survive and become large enough to eat. In both cases, these are veg that don't mind being in the ground for winter - so I think I am giving them sufficient growing season before the dry hot summer strikes.  How can I improve my success with onions, potatoes, and traditional root vegetables (eg. carrots and beetroot)?  It seems a plant-early winter crop approach might be best, in order to maximise the growing season? "
345,My lawn is full of wild strawberries. What else can thrive in my soil?,"My lawn seems to have more wild strawberries than grass (especially in the shady areas), which means it needs some work.  But if it can support strawberries, there must be some great fruits/vegetables/flowers that will grow great in the soil.  What does this indicate chemically about my soil?  What else will thrive?  (Zone 5B) "
346,My second year garlic has flowers. Is it safe to eat?,"Apparently I didn't find all my garlic bulbs last fall and they grew to 4 feet tall this spring.  They have a large, white flower head.

349,Is there any way to know what you're getting when you plant seeds collected from hybrid plants?,"I collected a whole bunch of broccoli seeds last year.  I think they were packman hybrid broccoli.    This year my 'broccoli' grew prolifically, but bolted exceptionally quick. I thought I had planted kale instead. But then I remembered the source of the seed.   So, I'm keeping them in the garden while they flower because the bees love them, but what do I have exactly?  Is there any way to know?  Are they a new species of weed? "
350,Mysterious brown patch in our lawn,"Over the course of 5 days I suddenly have this brown patch in my front lawn. There are no grubs when I dug up the grass and the roots seem strong. I haven't fertilized since the spring. The only other thing I can think is that we just had roofers out at our house and they ran a gas air compressor. Maybe the hot exhaust was blowing on it? Any guesses of what could be causing this? I live in Denver as well, incase that helps. Thanks for the thoughts!    "

356,Are 3601 trays big enough to transplant vegetables to?,"This is the first year I'm growing my vegetable seeds in standard greenhouse trays and inserts. As a result I wound up getting some inserts I thought were something else and I'm trying to figure out if I should use them or not.   Instead of getting deep 606 or 32 deep inserts I wound up getting 3601 inserts which have measurements of 2.23"" L x 1.94"" W X 2.23"" D and can hold 7.32 cubic inches of soil. The amount of soil is similar to a 806 deep cell which is what's commonly sold in nurseries around here.  I'm starting my seeds in 98 cell trays. I have 3"" sheet pots that I plan to transplant most of my tomatoes to but wondering what, if anything, I can use the 3601 inserts for so I don't have to buy additional inserts this season.  Some of the things I'm starting from seeds include:   another batch of tomatoes that will grow for 2 weeks less than my main ones peppers eggplants zucchini melons cucumbers   Can I get away with using these wide shallow inserts or should I just get something deeper? What are good uses for these inserts? "
357,Soil of a potted plant is holding water. Should I loosen it?,"Each time I water my potted plant, I notice that the surface of the soil is holding water. Should I loosen it up with a small spade? Once I have loosen up the soil, is there anything else I should do? "
358,How to prune a 6ft avocado tree that has possibly never been pruned?,"  I received this as a gift and I don't think it's ever been pruned. I just learned today that for avocado trees to grow lateral branches, it needed to be pruned at 8 inches. Is it too late for this tree to grow lateral branches? If not, how much should I prune back to get lateral branches?   Also, this tree is outside in full sun and it can get really windy out here.   Thank you!  "

360,Advice on LED light periods for cactus,"I want to grow large cacti, see my previous question. So I start with small plants and to keep them growing in winter time I want to give them LED (special grow) light.  I was wondering about the best light periods for the small young plants. I am interested in finding the best daily light period (how many hours per day?), and as well on when to start giving them artificial light (which months?). I was thinking of starting to put them under a light from November till February? Does that seem right?  I live in the Netherlands (latitude 52). I hope anyone can share his/her experience with indoor light regimes? "

362,My chili's don't want to ripen,"My plant (Lemon Drop, sitting in a pot on my balcony) is making huge amounts of leaves, flowers and new chilis but the ones it already has seem to stagnate both in size and ripeness.  What should I do? Should I just be patient and wait. Fertilize more/less (currently once per week 1 liter of fertilized water)? Cut some flowers?  Edit: Fertilizer I use (10ml / Week): NPK 7-5-6 with micronutrients (Boron, Copper, Iron, Manganese, Molybdenum, Zinc)  Yes. Used potting soil. No, no compost.  I'm reasonably sure the oldest fruits are there longer than 80 days. I've had this plant since last spring. Last year it only managed to make 3 small chilis so this is essentially my first year...  Edit 2: I didn't have time to care for the plant the last few days and the leaves got really flabby in the hot weather. Watered it last night and this morning there were two yellow chilis on the bush. Some of the newer smaller ones. I guess we did have a bit of a cold spell around here.  Also I'm going to make more of an effort to let the soil dry out before watering again (It's a pot with reservoir at the bottom so I always just filled that up and let the plant draw the water it needed) "

364,Why can't I kill bamboo roots with bleach?,"This is a follow-up to my first question on the gardening stack exchange. Unfortunately the horrid bamboo continues to plague me this summer. To the point that I'm actually considering packing up and quitting this home: I really wanted a yard with minimal maintenance needs, and now with the bamboo's invasive spread, I seem to have ended up with the very opposite, taking away precious time from the more important things I ought to be spending it on.   A suggestion from the linked post was to apply glyphosate to the ends of exposed roots. Before trying that, I wanted to try a ""less toxic"" approach because of proximity to kids and carcinogenic concerns. A friend suggested offline to soak the exposed ends of roots in saltwater; the theory being that the saltwater would soak through the root system and kill the plant. I thought to go one step further and try soaking the exposed root ends in bleach, thinking to myself ""there's nothing more caustic than bleach - surely soaking a plant's roots in it will kill it."" Picture below:    So I filled a couple of spray bottles with 100% bleach, and dipped exposed ends of bamboo roots in it. I taped up the tops to ensure no spillage onto innocent soil. It's been one week, now, that the roots have been soaking this way, and there is no change in appearance to the bamboo roots! I expected some manner of shriveling or necrotization - but there's no change I can perceive at all! So I can't tell if this treatment is having any effect at all.  The reason I'm attempting this is that the root system has grown under the very thick hardscaping that covers most of the area of concern. So it is practically impossible for me to dig up the roots that have grown under in this manner. So I was hoping to find some way to ""kill the root system upstream"".  So, my questions for knowledgeable gardeners, horticulturalist, and maybe biochemists are: is soaking the exposed end of a bamboo root in a noxious liquid a viable method of killing a bamboo's root system? If so, was bleach a good choice? If so, how long should I continue the existing soaking treatment, and will I eventually see a visible change in the root system so I can know that it's dying? If bleach isn't the right thing to try, is there something else I ought to soak the roots in that will have the intended effect of travelling upstream and killing the root system? "

I hate the look of clippings on my lawn (and then brown clippings when they dry out).  I hate the extra work of carefully navigating my property so as not to blow clippings all over my neighbors driveway and my mulch beds.

367,Is my basil plant dead,"I'd like to begin by saying I'm devastated. I live in an apartment on the first floor and I recently got a basil plant. The problem is the window in my apartment has a tree in front of it and sunlight is scarce. So I thought to myself, ""it's plenty of sunlight in my car!"". So I took the plant and left it in my car for a few hours. I just went and got it and it looks like this:    Before I put it in my car it looked like this:    Is there anything that can be done? Is my plant dead forever? I cut all the leaves off now it's just the brown stems. Please help. "
368,Sansevieria leaves wrinkling and browning,"First time with sansevieria in the home. Got them primarily because of the low water needs and put them in rooms that aren't frequently accessed.   How should I water them? What I've read online suggest anything from every 2-3 days to once a month. Have one in a dimly lit basement room with slightly higher humidity and warmer than the rest of the home and it seems to be doing fine. Another was in a brighter, drier room which isn't doing too well. A couple of the leaves have what look like dry tips, and one or too that have wrinkled, darkened and feel dry and thin. One of them has also become limp.  I've barely watered them. The soil they're in is very fast draining. As soon as I pour water over the top it starts to drain out the bottom. It looks like some bark, perlite and maybe a little peatmoss but it's mostly large particles. The next day after watering the top bark looks dry. Keeping a moisture meter in it and by the next day after watering the needle goes down to dry.   How do I keep these plants healthy and will the damaged leaves recover at all or do they need to be pruned?    "
369,Why are my morning glories stunted/deformed?,"I planted some morning glory vines (Ipomea sp.) outdoors in a box about 10 weeks ago (mid-March, I'm in Zone 8) and they've been underperforming the whole time -- the vines are not even a meter long, and many of the new leaves have been small, pale, and twisted, while the older leaves are irregularly-discolored and sort of raggedy-looking.          Their planter contains a loose, acidic, slightly sandy topsoil, to which I've added a variety of liquid fertilizers over the past several weeks (see below) in a largely unsuccessful attempt to remedy these symptoms  The vines receive about 7-8 hours of full sun per day, and get watered regularly.    The morning glories share the planter with some of the most exuberantly healthy-looking nasturtiums I've ever seen, which suggests that these conditions are not generally inhospitable to plant life.    I suspected some kind of nutrient deficiency (though nothing in particular quite seemed to fit the symptoms) and at roughly weekly intervals I have tried liberally fertilizing with one of the following:   Miracle-Gro (12-4-8) Epsom salt solution Chelated iron Calcium phosphate suspension   So I'm assuming the plants aren't deficient in N, P, K, S, Ca, Mg, or Fe, at least.    Sadly, none of the above seems to have helped much.  If I had over-fertilized the container, I might expect to see some problems with the nasturtiums, but those just keep accelerating.  Moreover, the slow growth and pale-twisted leaves on the morning glories preceded the addition of any liquid fertilizers.  Does this look like some kind of disease?  A virus, maybe?  I don't see any pests on the vines, with the possible exception of an occasional red mite.  I have a microscope, in case examining the leaf tissue at higher magnification could be diagnostic.  I'd appreciate any suggestions, I'm running out of ideas.    UPDATE: Found some aphids hiding down by the dirt in the lowest leaves of the morning glories.  Maybe they came for the nasturtiums and stayed for the morning glories?  The worst-affected leaves are not the ones that currently have aphids on them though, and I've never seen aphids on the upper leaves.    UPDATE 2:  Grabbed this little bugger off one the worst-affected leaves -- looks like a thrip.  Maybe that's my problem.   "
370,Which kitchen and garden scraps can be scattered on a vegetable garden soil?,"I'm trying to make the switch to adding natural instead of synthetic fertilizer to my vegetable garden (and stop tilling while I'm at it). Besides compost, I'm curious whether I could use some kitchen and garden scraps for this purpose. I don't have room for a compost pile.  Googling it, some blogs suggest scattering tea leaves, peanut shells, grass clippings, leaves from the beech hedge and even shredded banana peels on the soil.  How do I know which and how much of these scraps to use? For example, using too much tea leaves seems to make the soil more acidic. And won't the banana peels attract fruit flies? "
371,How long should I wait to mow my lawn a second time when I try to avoid cutting more than 30% of the blade in one cutting?,"One key principle in maintaining healthy turf is mowing regularly enough that you never cut more than 30% of the blade length in any single cutting. In peak growing season it can be difficult to keep up with the growth. So say I find the grass to be 6"", and want to get it to 3"" (which is another tenet of healthy turf). Since I don't want to chop off more than 30%, I'll cut 1.5"" in the first cut, then another 1.5"" in a second cut at some later time.   How long do I have to wait after the first cut before making the second cut?  Can I do the second cut immediately? Later the same day? The next day? When?   I understand that if I wait too long the grass will grow more and require more cutting - but let's ignore that for the moment. "
372,"Why is my apple seedling shriveling up after like 15 min, every time I remove the plastic dome?","Around 7-9 weeks ago (maybe more) I planted a sprouted apple seed in a cup of potting soil that I placed on top of a low heat pad, and covered it with a plastic bag. I also have a full spectrum fluorescent on it, and both are on a timer for 12 hours per day.  It grew fast and well so a while ago I decided to remove the bag to slowly get it used to the room, which has a temperature of 72 degrees with 45 percent humidity. Shortly after I removed the bag the leaves shriveled up and died. I quickly re-covered it and the next day I saw that it had continued to grow. Being scared it would die off, I left it covered and it grew bigger. It's now 7 inches tall and has 8 big leaves. Yesterday, thinking it must be a lot stronger now, I again removed the plastic bag, but, sadly, in an hour (maybe less) the leaves shriveled up again.  Not wanting it to die again, I quickly covered it and added a little water, and my fast action saved most of the plant.  I want to know what I am doing wrong here. Why is it shriveling up under the light? Is the light too strong for the seedling to be exposed under it? Do I have to add fertilizer? Is it going into shock? Do I simply have to wait until it’s bigger?   I will add pictures later today. Thanks for all your help :)  This one is from the Apple seedling I have this uncovered for 10 min when I started to see the newest leaves start to curl:   This one is a pear seedling:   This one has 2 the closer one is a papaya and the other one is a peach:   Last but not least is a mango and as you can see I left it out a tad to long and some leafs started to curl:  "
373,What to do about mealybug infested soil?,"My plants (basil and mint) were infested with mealybugs. Nearly all of them perished (despite application of neem oil) and I am left with several pots of soil that have not been growing anything for several months now. Since the soil has not been growing anything for several months now, won't the mealybugs that were present in the soil have died off? Can I safely reuse the soil for growing now? I have also poured boling water into the soil to try killing them off too. "
374,Why is my mulching mower clumping and not mulching?,"Last year I had this problem. This year I'm having a problem with the mulching mower not mulching. The grass is clumping up and clogging whatever you call the 'chamber' where the blade spins and is supposed to chop up the grass.  It sounds like it's running high or faster, based on what I did last year with the throttle/governor spring. Could this have anything to do with it?  I've had the blade sharpened and balanced recently by a friend and it is plenty sharp. But I think he only sharpened the front main edge. Are there edges on the back edge where it's turned up that also need to be sharpened? Does this actually cut, or just force the cuttings up so they can be chopped up more?  I generally mow when it's dry.  I usually cut it pretty long, on the 2nd or 3rd highest setting, going by those notches and ridges where you manually change the height of the mower near the wheels. I've read you're only supposed to cut 1/3 of the height. I'm not out there measuring it, but sometimes it's been longer with all the rain we've had. "
375,What is this cactus with paper-looking spindles sticking out all around?,"I bought this cactus a while ago and never knew the name of the species. Can someone help me with the name of the plant?  A small clone of it is growing on the top of the plant. Should I cut it and repot it, or can I leave it in there?   "
376,What is this tree and do I need a pollinating partner?,"I recently moved and I found this tree/shrub in my backyard. It is about 1.2m tall     It produced a single fruit which looked a lot like a cherry, although it had plenty of flowers.  My main question is: what is this tree?   And in case it is an edible fruit tree:   why did it produce just one single fruit?  Is it that I need a pollinating partner?  If so what would be suitable pollinating partner?   Here are some more photographs:     "
377,Will peaches on a sapling grow into mature fruit?,"I planted this peach sapling in mid April in Western New York:    It's about 3 and a half feet tall. It's planted in an area that yields about 8 hours a day of direct sunlight and we have been watering it every few days since planting it. The nursery that sold it to us said it likely wouldn't yield fruit for a few years. But in the last week, these little walnut-sized fruits have sprouted!    Forgive my ignorance, but can we expect these to grow into mature, edible fruit from a sapling? They told us years and it sprouts fruit in a matter of weeks? I feel like I'm missing something. "
378,Shall I remove pea-sized rocks and gravels from soil before planting a flowering cherry?,"I plan to plant a flowering cherry (upright form) in the edge of my garden, but there are quite a lot pea-sized rocks and gravels in the soil (as shown in the pics). I wonder if I need to clean all of them before planting a young cherry?  As there was a well grow Jasminum nudiflorum in there , I wonder can flowering cherry grow in this kind of soil?  Thanks a lot for all answers!  Surface    There is a layer between surface and subsurface around the hole for planting tree. Should I remove it?    Subsurface    The plot and the previous Jasminum nudiflorum's root.   "
379,Why use landscape fabric in a raised bed?,"We just moved into a home that had three existing garden beds.  We're using them for vegetables.  Next year I was thinking of building a new and smaller bed to use for herbs.  I saw a video from Lowe's that seemed to show a relatively easy way to build a bed.  After removing the sod they roll out landscape fabric that will sit under the soil in the bed.  What is the purpose of using landscape fabric?  And more specifically, would it be useful in a vegetable or herb garden bed? "
380,"Do I have wood chips or mulch, and why do I want it?","  I'm a first-time homeowner and pretty naive and often overwhelmed by home-related upkeep, especially related to gardening (see my very first question on this exchange for what still continues to vex me).  So, my question: from the picture above, do I have woodchips or mulch? (That's a quarter in the picture for scale reference) Either way, why is it used? It was all over the lawn in our front yard and the small pockets of exposed soil in our mostly hardscaped backyard. I was never a fan of it - I kind of prefer lawns with just soil. But before trying to get rid of it, I wanted to learn if there is an actual use for it - or is it just an aesthetic choice?  I live in Orange County, California, so summers are fairly hot (80s - 90s F) and will occasionally get humid, but is mostly dry, and winters are mildly cold with relatively little rain. "
381,Is this a sucker? Can they grow above the graft line?,"I have a citrus tree of the Washington Navel variety, which is around 4 years old (and has been here for 2 of those). Naturally this means it's a scion grafted onto rootstock of which I don't know the variety.  A few weeks ago I got this branch shooting out from the middle of it, to the point where it doubles the height of the tree. The leaves are wider than those of the rest of the tree, and with its growth I worry that it's a sucker.    That's a close-up of the leaves. It also has some spines but they're not that exaggerated.  Now the thing is, from what I can see, it's coming from above the graft, which is what has gotten me confused. In fact it seems to be coming from the place all the other branches are.    So, is it a sucker? Should I have it cut down? Or is it just a branch which is growing very quickly? "
382,What are these raised brown sections on the backs of the leaves on my pear tree?,  I have this brown stuff growing on all the leaves on my pear tree in my garden.  Does anyone know what this is? I think it might be some plant disease.  Does anyone have any advice on fixing this? 
383,What is this beautiful pest that affects my garden?,"I noticed this butterfly in my garden recently. She loves to rest on gauras. At the same time, my Cornus sanguinea have been almost destroyed this spring by an unknown pest. Could it be that this butterfly caused this in her previous incarnation? Can you please id this butterfly to remove all suspictions? What is she doing on my gauras?       "
384,Should I prune or remove fruit before transplanting a citrus tree?,"I have inherited a beautiful Mandarin tree that has spent quite some time in a pot. It has a lot of fruit on it that is ripening right now that will be ready for picking very soon. The tree has been transplanted from the pot into the ground in the correct manner.  I have been told to pull all of the fruit off the tree to help the tree settle in.  Is this really necessary? When I transplanted the tree, it did cross my mind to pull the fruit off, but then I realised that the tree has not lost any roots or anything really. It has simply gained a new container (of nice lovely soil perfect for citrus trees).  The tree has been in the ground for two days now, and is showing no signs of stress. Should I pull all the fruit off? "
385,What's going on with my Aloe plant?,"I got it from Costco about half a year ago and it hasn't had many problems in the time that I've had it- in fact, it has flowered about 5 or 6 times since I bought it. I had to leave it at my old house for about 3 weeks after heading off to my university's dorms and during that time my family did not water it or anything- it just remained outside during the hot and humid wave through Missouri. Now, the leaves towards the bottom have turned yellow and brown and the newer growth is somehow shriveling but squishy at the same time and the tips are turning brown. And yet, somehow, it is growing a new stalk of flowers. Is it overwatered? Underwatered? Something else? Am I overreacting? note: Some of the leaves have been broken due to traveling. I did my best to cushion them but some didn't make it and have been broken for a while. "
386,My marigold is dying. Please help,"  So I’ve had this Marigold for a few months so far, and now it seems to be dying. Can I still save it? Shall I replant it? or cut the flowers ?

387,How can I fix a Water Mint invasion in my creek?,"I have a creek in the front of my home and Water Mint has invaded the creek. The past few summers it has gotten worse and worse. The water mint is clogging up the flow of the creek and gets so thick I can’t even see the creek bed in the summer.   How do I get it out off the creek? Anything I try and spray on it will just get washed away by the creek, correct? Is there anything I can do to kill it, so my creek and flow freely again? "

389,Does Tagetes Filifolia transplant well into an indoor window box for the winter?,"I have 4 Tagetes Filifolia plants from my community garden, and it smells pleasant enough to keep indoors for a Minnesota winter. Will it transplant well, since it's not likely going to flower before winter?  How do I transplant it? The same way as any other normal plant? "
390,"What is the name of this beetle, and is he eating my squash plant?","What is the name of this little beetle?    As you can see in the bottom right, the leaves of my two week old squash plant have big gaping holes with bite marks in them. Could he and his friends be the ones that have been devouring my plant basically overnight? Or could there be another culprit that's eating my squash plants' leaves, and seeming to leave most other plants alone?  To help narrow things down, this guy was found in middle of Illinois (a tiny town in the middle of a bunch of corn and soy fields) and that photograph was taken this morning (the beginning of June). "
391,How did black-eyed Susans get their name?,"Rudbeckia hirta, commonly called black-eyed Susans, are a native wildflower here in the US.  Typically, when it comes to naming animals and plants, their common names stem from either the name of the person who discovered it, where it was found, or by their attributes. For example, pitcher plants hold water in them, much like a pitcher.  How did the name ""black-eyed susan"" come about? Was it discovered by a blonde lady named Susan who had a black eye at the time, and thought the flower resembled her appearance? Or maybe that it would resemble her if she had a black eye? "
392,Are there any plants I should not grow near my rhododendrons?,"The author of this answer to this question mentioned that toxins in rhododendron leaves can prohibit growth in nearby plants. (This is a paraphrase, not a direct quote.)   I have six huge rhododendron bushes that have a variety of bleeding hearts, azaleas, hostas, forsythia, pussy willows, young trees, old trees, daylilies, daisies, other wildflowers, and some things I can't identify, growing under, through, and around them. Various groundcovers and low-growing plants, including vinca, catmint, lily of the valley, are all growing in abundance around the roots. It looks like a jungle out there and I love it!   Since everything is growing nicely, I assume the rhododendrons are not having a negative affect. However, if I understood the answer correctly, there may be some things I should be aware of for future plantings.   Is there anything I should not plant in the vicinity of my rhododendrons? If so, what?  "
393,Can I start a fruit orchard where cedars used to grow?,Looks like I have about 2 acres of cedar trees on a southwest facing slope. If I clear all this land and open it up can I start an orchard (apple and cherry) on it right away or will I need to do something to the soil first. I have heard that nothing grows under cedar trees but not sure if it's because of all the shade or it the dead needles actually do something to the soil. Anyone here ever done this?  What other things should I check for before investing in all this? 
394,Can I eat carrots with wormholes in them?,I started cleaning up and cutting two big carrots to make a soup when I realized worms had dug galleries in them. Is it safe to eat them even if I clean them? So far I have not found any worms but can I be certain that there aren't any that I have missed?  Thank you all in advance for your insight! 
395,Powdery mildew on oak (Erysiphe alphitoides?),"I have an oak (Quercus robur) sapling I've grown from seed in a pot (it is 2 years old) and its leaves are exhibiting a powdery white mildew.  After some searching online I think it's a case of erysiphe alphitoides (it looks exactly like the photographs I've seen online). The information I've seen online states that it can be treated with fungicides that contain sulphur, but the information contains the caveat     this can damage some plants   Would a fungicide that contains sulphur harm a quercus robur oak? If so, what alternative fungicide would be appropriate?  I am in the UK, in the South of England if that's useful information. "
396,Work mechanism and added value of higher speed of simple sprinklers?,What is the use of higher rotating speed of standard lawn sprinklers (assuming there is a large family of similar non-special devices) you see around in Northern Western Europe and many other places? Do they pump more water per hour then maybe? 
397,Identify begonia with variegated leaves and pink margins,"I saw this Begonia in a restaurant in Provincetown, Massachusetts, and was very impressed by it. What is it exactly? Is it hard to grow?     "
398,Which direction should I face my garden?,"This isn't a question that's really occurred to me before now, but I feel it will make a fairly big impact on my yield. For the most part, I don't have anything really tall in my garden, with tomatoes being the largest. I was thinking of trying some corn, this year and planting beans to grow up it. This would cause quite a bit of shade. I will also have squash, tomatoes, peppers, herbs, etc... I'm sure they'll be getting light, because I'll be spacing them apart, but if I was going to plant with the smaller ones at the front and the larger at the back, which direction should I face it to get the best sunlight? I hear a lot of people saying that if you have to choose between early morning and late afternoon sun, that plants tend to like early morning, so should it be facing east?   I live in the South-East in zone 8, I believe. Thanks. "
399,How do you adjust watering based on rain in the forecast?,"I have a few vegetables growing in containers.  Let's say the soil is starting to dry out, but it's supposed to rain tomorrow.  Would you fully water the plants now? Or just give them a bit of water to hold them over till the rain comes? "
400,Is this my Bee Balm or just a weed?,"I have a large open area in my backyard that is sloped where i dont want grass because it would be dangerous to mow. A couple years ago i went to a local gardening shop and asked for recommendations on a variety of flowering plants that will spread over time and take over the area. I was looking to attract butterflys, bees, and hummingbirds.  Fast forward a baby and an injured wife later, I simply didnt have the time to devote to weeding one year and it was overtaken in short order. Half of the plants have been choked out but I found the time recently to clean it up.  I have some Bee Balms like below:    I am not sure though if it is spreading very much, however there is this one plant that looks incredibly similar to me that spreads like crazy and comes back with a vengeance when i pull it. My wife told me to stop pulling these because she says it is the Bee Balm trying to spread but there are a few minor differences.  Where I planted the Bee Balm it has these beautiful red flowers however this spreading plant below does not seem to flower. The leaves and stems are very very similar but I am just not sure.    Are these the same plant? If not what kind of virulent weed is this? "
401,"Is there a difference between seeds that are for planting vs sprouting? If so, what are they?","Title is the question, question is close this one, however there might be more information available specifically for planting.   The price and quantity of sprouting seeds seem to, by and large, have  significant differences, spouting seeds usually are packaged in large orders on a much more reasonable per unit price, compared to one seeds offered at large home improvement stores. The difference seems to be, at least for this retailer, in the farmer/suppliers process deemed to specifically distinguish sprouting from for-planting seeds.  If there is a fundamental difference are there wholesalers for plant seeds?   "

Part of it was already done this summer but when are the good and bad times to do this?   I had theorised spring so it has the whole year to grow back? "
404,How to name/characterize climbing plants by climbing habit,"Some climbing plants need a support to climb. For example some (all?) Clematis species which climb a trellis but not a bare wall.  Other climbing plants can climb on walls without a support, for example English Ivy.   Do these two types of climbing plants have names/categories that differentiate this climbing habit?   Or otherwise do they have a common characteristic that differentiate them? "
405,What should we do with a 7-8 year old honey locust tree that has been damaged by disease?,"2009 diseased honey locust:   June of 2016 full view:    We have a honey locust that developed a disease within it's first year and an arborist saw it.  He told me it is what they call herpes for trees.  It had cankers of some sort on the trunk that had killed the majority of the tree.  He said we could cut the main trunk off and create a new main trunk with a zip tie, the nearest large branch, and patience.    After 7 years, it has flourished, somewhat. The trunk has grown around the dead part and it appears sturdy.  However, I'm afraid too much of the inner trunk is dead wood and will not provide a sturdy enough trunk as the tree continues to mature.  No branches really grow on the affected side of the tree either.      Do we bite the bullet and remove the tree now or will it be okay in the years to come?  We love our little sad tree...  Edit: I replaced the close up of the trunk with a full size view.  You can still zoom in to see the damage. It starts as a ""V"" near the base and moves up.    With this new view, do you still recommend removing the tree? And is it a disease or poor transporting/planting?  "
406,Is this plant with small white blossoms a weed or a flower?,There is a plant growing beneath our wine. What kind of plant is it? Flower or weed? Five little leafs are on the white blossoms. It is growing very fast. Leaves are large and heart shaped.    
407,Why did my pepper plants suddenly shrivel?,"I've been growing pepper and chili plants in a greenhouse on my balcony since March and they have been growing strong. However, I started a new job last week and have not had the time to tend to them. Now the leaves have curled lengthwise, some have turned yellow and some have grown a green moss on the soil. The soil near the plants is quite dry. Only the lower leaves are turning yellow on one plant. I have pruned some stems and found no discolouration within the stems.  Since starting the new job, I haven't watered or fed them, but the greenhouse has a fairly damp environment, with the walls and roof covered in drops of water. I've watered them with a little liquid food and left them out of the greenhouse in sun and light wind for 12 hours now and most of the leaves are starting to perk up. The yellow leaves on one plant have fallen but the upper leaves on the same plant have perked up.   Any ideas what might have happened to them?  Could it just have been lack of food and water? "
408,What is this bush with small yellow flowers and an orange substance in the stems?,"There is a round bush, which I didn't plant, growing in what is usually my ""annual"" garden. It's about two feet high and the same width. At the end of the stems there are clusters of small, bright yellow flowers, somewhat resembling buttercups. The flowers have no odor, although the leaves smell unpleasant in a way I can't really describe. In some areas narrow seedpods are appearing. The seeds are white, very small, and lined up in a row, like peas in a pod.   It has been blooming for about a month. I think it's pretty, and have been hoping it would stay for a while. To that end, I decided to deadhead the flowers and stems back to the next junction.    When I pinched off the main stems, I found that they're filled with a bright orange substance. It behaves like a line of paint from a tube, thick at the end and growing thinner and more pale as I squeeze the stem. The same substance is in the base of the cluster of seed pods. It is not, however, in the small stems which join the flowers to each other (I have a feeling stem is not the right word for those, and would appreciate a correction), or in the flowers themselves, even if I open a bud. It's odorless, spreads easily to any skin it touches, and, although not sticky, requires soap, water, and a bit of effort to remove.    I have a few questions:   What is this plant? What is the orange substance called? If I deadhead it, can I extend its blooming period? If I open the seedpods and scatter the seeds around some other areas, might they produce more bushes next year? I'm too lazy to gather the seeds and do what's necessary to overwinter them, so that's not an option. I thought about propagating from a cutting, but it doesn't seem woody enough to do that. I understand birds, other backyard visitors, and wind, might carry the seeds away. I just wonder if, in general, doing that might increase my chances of having more.

409,How to make a galvanized steel stock tank in to self watering planter?,"We got a galvanized steel stock tank (thanks Pinterest) to use as a planter for a raised flower bed similar in size and weight to this stock tank.  How would we add a self watering tray/container/tube system beneath the soil inside the planter?  What type of platform can we build or buy that's sturdy enough to raise our planter two more feet and support the weight of all the soil inside it?  Unfortunately, my wife nixed using cinder blocks. :(  Update: got this Tarter built John Deere branded stock tank that's 2' by 2' by 4'. It's tall enough so no longer need cinder blocks.        "
410,How much wiggling for trees is too much?,"I've heard wiggling is good for plants, because it promotes root spreading. Does artificial wiggling do the same thing? if so how much should I wiggle the tree artificially? "
411,How much sun for a hellebore plant?,"I have a hellebore plant that I transferred from the ground to a pot a couple of months ago because it didn't seem to be doing well.  The leaves were turning brown and crispy on the ends and it was getting too big for the area anyway.  I'd like to replant in the ground but in another spot next year.  I thought they preferred total shade (which the original spot was), but I've seen different opinions about whether or not they like a bit of sun.  Would a party shady/ full sun briefly at mid-day be OK?  I live on the coast in the PNW, so it never gets too hot or blazingly sunny.  I've also read that they prefer to be in the ground as opposed to pots, but don't particularly like to be transplanted.  Well, that's a dilemma.  I'd leave it in the pot but sometimes I'm gone for 2-3 week periods when it wouldn't get any water :/  1st photo is of hellebore in pot on deck  2nd photo is of the area where I'd like to eventually plant it.  It is a southwest location with lots of trees around it.  3rd photo is area where it was originally planted.  North side of wall with gravel scattered on ground.  Additional info: I originally planted it as a very young plant about a year ago in the area pictured in photo three.  It was in total shade but the soil had gravel on top of it.  Perhaps that is what caused the leaves to brown on the edges? It was next to a concrete walkway.  I planted it with garden soil amended with some bagged compost. No additional fertilizer.  I watered it weekly and it seemed to do well other than the browning.  It started to grow out over the edge of the walkway, so because of that and the browning I moved it into the pot about 2 months ago..  The pot is on my back deck, mostly in shade but does get a bit of sun.  The plant seems to be doing well there - no further browning of the leaves, just the old ones still there - but I'd like to move it to the area pictured in photo 2, which would get more sun, mostly filtered.  This area has concrete block around the edge, but surrounded by other plants and grass.         "
412,Is it a big deal if the upper parts of papaya roots are exposed like this?,"Water washes away the soil around papaya roots, leaving their upper parts partly exposed, like this:    Close up:    The tree in the photos is the most serious example I have. Yet it seems perfectly healthy, even though the roots have been like this for months. Is it a big deal? And whether yes or no, why? In the beginning, I tried packing earth around them, but the earth was so loose that it just washed away again quickly with the water. Should I do anything, and if yes, what? "
413,How to promote multistem tree growth?,"I planted a young liquidambar tree (which was basically just a single 2ft branch, plus roots off course) this spring.  For unknown reasons (transplant shock?), the tree soon appeared to be dead. However, three months later, new leaves appeared from the ground. Two more months later, the tree recovered fully its previous height, but this time it has three branches/stems. One of these three appears to be stronger than the other two.  I would like to have a multistem liquidambar. How can I prune this tree to encourage all three stems to grow approximately equally? "
414,Overseeding in Fall without Irrigation,"I live in Columbus, Ohio.  Dormant overseeding worked very well for me this last year as the wet Ohio springs are perfect for this method.  My lawn is so much thicker than last year.  The home was a foreclosure and the lawn was a wreck.  I am now getting compliments on it already and it has only been one year.  Unfortunately with this method, it pretty much takes using a pre-emergent weed chemical off the table.  The lawn is very thick so it is choking out most crabgrass and other weeds, but clover is still germinating.  I also have some poa annua that I don't want to keep dropping seeds year after year.  Overseeding in fall would allow me to use pre-emergent control in spring, but what kind of results could I expect in doing so without a lawn irrigation system?  Is there enough moisture in the soil during the fall months in Ohio to make it worth while? "
415,Is this a desease or pest on my pepper-seedlings?,"Today I noticed on my pepper seedlings that some of the leaves have on their bottom-side close to the steam some light-green-dots. To my uneducated eyes this looks like something is hatching inside the leaf. While rubbing and scratching I was not able to remove it.  EDIT: adding info as per Anubis request: Peppers are indoors using currently in a mix of self-made compost and garden soil.   Further inspection shows that only one kind of plant (but of it all seedlings) is infected: only the peppers are affected and not the chilis which are in the same mini-greenhouse (I didn't used the top of the green, only the pots).  What is it and do I need to intervene, if so how?  Click for a larger version    Related or not but some of the leaves show white/dried-out zones on the top. Is this the result?   "
416,Tomato stems mysteriously cut above the fruit,"I have good healthy plants with no signs of (obvious) trouble. Fruits are forming, but some fruits on some plants, and there quite a few of them, are mysteriously cut.  I don't see similar damage anywhere else on the plant(s).    (see exact place marked with white line on the picture).  Is it some pest? Bird? Disease? Lack of nutrients? I'm first time gardener, so pardon my ignorance please. "
417,How tall can Boxwood Green Velvet really grow?,I really like the 'boxwood green velvet' for privacy hedge but I ideally need at least 5 ft of height. Most sources for example here says it grows 2 to 4 ft but at least one claims it grows 4 to 6 ft here.  Has anyone grown it more than 4 ft? Is there really any chance it can grow 5 ft even 6 ft?  I am considering this for north east US (boston area) where it should withstand the harsh winter as well. 
418,What determines the year-to-year growth in girth of any particular tree?,"I'm growing some apple trees from seed and started this year. I'm worried that the width of their stems (or trunks, but they're too small to really call them ""trunks"") is too small in proportion to their size. This leads me to wonder how big a tree can grow in one year, with an emphasis on its first year, and what is necessary to make them grow the most.  To recap, my questions:   How much bigger around does a tree normally grow over the course of a year? Specifically its first year? What leads trees to grow bigger around? Nutrients, hormones? How should a tree be treated to promote the most outward trunk growth?  "
419,What is killing my lavender?,I planted a lavender hedge in the front garden last autumn. It's English lavender (Hidcote). Everything seemed fine and they were growing well. Then all of a sudden one plant just died. Simply went brown and kicked the bucket. I was a bit shocked as it seemed to be growing well and had doubled in size this summer.   I've now noticed another plant (at the opposite side of the garden) also starting to go brown and start to die off. Unfortunately I don't have photos to hand but one side is dying where as the other side is not. This happened to the previous plant and eventually the entire plant died off.  I'm a bit confused as to what's going on. It's a sunny part of the garden (North facing but not in shade). The soil is quite rich (loam) so I planted the lavender on a mound with plenty of grit added under the plant to prevent the root getting water logged.   I haven't particularly watered them a lot as I was wary of over watering.   Is this a moisture issue or some kind of disease/parasite? What should I do to save it?  Dead plant    Dying(?) plant    Soil is mounded (though this seems to of dropped since I did it). I added a good handful of potting grit under each plant to improve draining. Is this the problem then maybe?  __  |  ___ &lt;-ground level   \   /    ---    grit  
420,What is this plant? What is the white stuff on it?,"I've had this plant for a long time, and for most of that time it was outdoors, in a shared area with other plants and heavy sun. It didn't do well, so I dug it out and put in it's own pot, with a little less sun, and it seemed to thrive- it tripled in size and even put out, occasionally, tiny red flowers.  But lately I noticed that it has a layer of an icky white substance on it, and it isn't doing so good- dropping leaves and no new flowers.  What is it? What can I do about this?

421,What happen after nepenthes has flower,I live in Thailand and have my pet plant Nepenthes growing. I'm still immature so the pitcher mostly dried out but still it grows a bunch of flowers. I don't know what will happen after that.   Will its flowers dry out and drop? Will it grow any new leaves? Will it produce new pitchers? Will it grow taller next year? 
422,What type of clippers is suggested for berry picking?,"I was watching a youtube video on picking sea buckthorn, and was wondering what type of shears they were using.  Video about the tools I was wondering about: [website]another video: [website]"
423,Where to position dracaena in room?,I have a dracaena marginata plant in a pot in my room upstairs.  This room has a westward facing window which provides direct sunlight for some portion of the day.  Would it be better to put my plant in or close to the direct sunlight? or would this plant grow better in the corner of the room with much more limited sunlight? 
424,setting up raised garden beds for spring. what is best mix but affordable?,So I have raised garden beds (not touching the ground) and other garden beds that WILL touch the ground. what is the best mix for BOTH of these beds? most beds will be 3ft x 2ft to 5ft x 3ft  I have came up with   50% kellogs raised bed soil/potting mix 25% peat moss 25% compost with Fish meal and spread it out on the soil 50% raised bed/potting mix soil 50% compost with fish meal spreading out 50% top soil mix with 50% manure compost with fish meal and perlite   what are your thoughts?

425,Plant sitting two orchids and need advice,"I'm charged with keeping these two orchids alive this summer. Neither look really great right now. The first is a phalaenopsis that was a Christmas gift with beautiful blooms in December.    The second is several years old, and has a tag that says Lc. Maxima's Aflect 'Arbec'   Both look kind of leathery and the second one has some yellowing of two leaves.   They are indoors, in good indirect light.   What is the best way to water and how often? What else can I do to at least maintain them?  (I don't have a good track record with orchids.) "
426,What is a good watering schedule for an Argyroderma?,"I have a small Argyroderma I picked up from the local plant store, but I'm not sure when and how much to water it.  It is potted in a tiny (roughly 2"" cube) pot that appears to be filled with a sandy, stony material.  I watered it once, a new leaf grew in, and the outer leaf shriveled up into a tiny brown mess. It was pretty cool, but it's been a week or so and the new leaf is starting to shrivel a bit.  Some of the internet says to ""water when shriveling"", but other places I've read ""every couple weeks"", and some other places (sorry, no links) said a few times per year!  How often should I water it, and how much water should I use? If based on shriveling, how long should I wait between waterings to see if the shriveling is reduced? "
427,French drainage design for backyard,"I got a .2 acre (close to) rectangular backyard, slight slope. No puddle, yet the lawn feels wet. Or at least it takes longer to dry up after rain. Sometimes, when my neighbors started mowing, my lawn still is not completely dry.  So I am considering laying down some french drainage system under the lawn. In some YouTube videos, the handyman just dug trenches around the perimeter (fence) inside the yard.  [website]I am curious if the center part of the lawn is too far from the drainage. Wouldn't it be better to dig parallel trenches all over the yard to ""cover"" the whole lawn?  If that is the case, how far apart should we dig our trenches? Let's say we are using 4"" perforated PVC tubes. "
428,Killing weeds with vinegar/soap solution,"Hi there a friend suggested that we use a vinegar based recipe to deal with large weeds and brambles in our yard.  The recipe he quoted was  4 cups white vinegar 4 cups apple cider vinegar 1 box of table salt (1 kilo) 1/2 a bottle of sunlight dish detergent  From my research I understand it is indiscriminate (sp?) in killing all plants applied and that it should be applied while in direct sunlight.  Is this a good and safe recipe, and are there any other worries to consider? "
429,How crucial is it to measure pH of hydroponic growth solution for leafy greens?,"I was told I need to continuously measure the pH of my growth solution and modify it if it exceeds a certain range. Is it really that crucial? I mean no one pays attention to pH of soil in a pot...  If it is crucial, would once a day with litmus paper suffice or do I need to get a continuous electronic measurement? "
430,How to help our tall cedar hedge grow thicker?,"We have about 50 meters (165') of cedar hedge between our row of townhouses, and the row behind us. Depending on the trees around it, it is between 10-12' in height, approximately. I think they are white cedar, aka arborvitae; maybe a specie of Thuja or Leyland cypress.  You can see it on Google Maps here, and in those pictures. We are in Montreal, Canada.  Our problem with those hedges is that they are getting more and more sparse; we see more and more through it, every year.  We had very different opinions on what we should do with them, to help them grow thicker. Should we cut their head, maybe to something like 8-9', and give them enough earth+compost+fertilizer? We were told by some people that those kind of trees should not have been left to grow this tall, but that if we cut their head too much, they're going to die. Others are saying it's fine to cut their head as much as 3-4', as long as it's done in the autumn or spring.  Ideas?  Thanks. "
431,What drainage can we do for the area with utilities lines?,"There are an electric meter, a Dish TV stand, and other stuff at one side of my house.   The two downspouts are on that side. Both end with a splash pad to the ground surface. Over time, the lawn around the splash pads became rather soggy. I used some corrugated tubes to extend the downspouts to a farther exit from the house. But it is on the surface and the tubes are easy to be kicked away by passing people, like me.  What is a better design to add drainage to this area? Should I just dig trenches and lay tubes carefully, like with gloved hands instead of a shovel, to protect the utility lines? Or just keep this part of land untouchable, and get creative in downspouts redirection? "
432,How much water is needed using drip irrigation for Gold Mound hedge?,"Using drip irrigation, how long and how often should a gold mound hedge in Tampa, FL be watered during the the summer months?  Also, how often during the rest of the year? "
433,When is it ok to prune an overgrown apple tree?,"I recently bought a new house and I'm trying to get the garden in order.  It has an apple tree which has lots of low branches and appears generally neglected.  Some of the leaves are silvery and look ill.  It blossomed in late May and, now in late June has started producing some pathetic looking fruit. Is it ok to start pruning now? If so, how much should I prune? Below is how the tree looked in May:    I'd like to at least remove the low branches and ideally the high branch coming in from the left. Should I wait until winter or is it safe to do now/summer without damaging the tree?  "
434,What's happening to my tulips?,"I recently transplanted some tulips bought at wilko, in a mixture of irish moss peat, compost and a little vermiculite. The last week has been unexpectedly hot, but I tried to water them regularly and noticed a very fast drainage, actually. This is their condition now. Is this due to their exposition in the full hot sun? Or to lack of water? Or the mix I used? Thanks!    "
435,What is this weed and should I get rid of it?,"I just planted a set of very low water use grasses in my high desert zone 7B New Mexico yard. Some little spouts came up that I at first thought were one of the grasses, but it turns out they're weeds. Now I see that they're growing all over the neighborhood. Here's what a larger one looks like:    What is this thing called? And, more importantly to me, is there any reason why I should get rid of them? They're green, sprout without supplemental water, and are reasonably pretty. Unless they sprout thorns or totally die in the cold, I'm wondering if I should just keep them. "
436,Installing bamboo fencing,"Our patio is square with 8 foot sides.  For added privacy I was thinking about installing bamboo fencing on both sides and leaving the front open.    I came across bamboo material similar to this:  Sample Bamboo Fencing  My question is how would I secure this in the ground?  I'm assuming fence posts but how big and how many?  Also, how would you secure the bamboo to the fence posts?  Is there any other secure method I could use without using concrete? "
437,Crippled young leaves on pepper plant,"What is wrong with my pepper plants? Some of them are showing deformations on young leaves. See this picture:  Some of them are showing small holes or cracks, usually with brown edges. Some have irregular shapes, not the typical pepper leaf shape. I can not find any signs of pests, except that I had a very minor case of aphids (less than 20 insects per plant) in the past two weeks. They are 99% gone now. Is this damage caused by them?  I'm watering once every 1-3 days depending on temperature. The plants are in pots outside on my south/west facing balcony. I'm using 3g/liter of FloraSelf Tomato Fertilizer:  (N)     6 % (P2O5)  5 % (K2O)   9 % (B)     0,01 % (Cu)    0,002 % (Fe)    0,02 % (Mn)    0,01 % (Mo)    0,001 % (Zn)    0,002 %   I just pulled one plant out of its pot and this is what the roots look like:   Any Ideas?

438,What to do with my baby pineapple: Parenting 101,"I'm having a baby pineapple plant - it has been growing pretty well.  At this point the pineapple seems to become too heavy, the plant is leaning towards a side and the stick on which it is attached feels a bit softer than usual. Not in an extreme matter though.    I'm unsure what to do with it? Is the pineapple ripe for harvesting and should I just cut it off? How do I see that he is ready? Should I then use the top of the baby to get a new plant?  What to do with the old plant? Remove the stick? There are also smaller baby plants (without a stick) growing on the side of the mother plant. Should I just pull these out and put them in a separate pot?  Thanks in advance.  I attach another image to get a clearer view of the pineapple itself:  "
439,Will top dressing over moss kill the moss?,"I have some very mossy areas in my lawn, I began to address this with soil samples, aeration, branch removal for more sun and of moss killer last summer/fall.  This spring I plan to top dress areas of my lawn.  Specifically the really poor areas where the moss has taken the biggest foothold.    Do I need to kill the moss first, or remove it before top dressing?  Will a new healthier soil promote moss growth?   My intention is about 1.5 to 2 inches of soil over the very poor areas. So the moss would be covered.   I am interested in specifically what the effect of covering the moss with soil will do.  Will it kill it? Make it stronger? Do nothing?  "
440,What illness/pest has this dipladenia and what to do with it?,"I've successfully rooted 6 dipladenias 4 month ago, they are in pots since 3 month. All went well so far, but now it seems they have some illness or pests. (All the six, although in different progress)  I am an absolute beginner, so I just hopelessly see their day by day worsening condition, and I am a bit worried my original two older ones may also get infected.  Could anyone identify what the problem(s) is/are, and most importantly what to do to cure?  Is it virus, or pests? (I do not see bugs neither on the back side on the leaf, and when I try to touch or get something with my nails, nothing detected (but again this is the beginner speaking)  Detailed plant and environment info:  Location is Budapest, Hungary, it's autumn first month September now, temperature is approx 25 C / 77F,  now, the pots are in very well lit outdoor place. It seemed to me that dipladenia (both the older 2 and also the 6 rooted very flexible for water supply, never dropped a leave since spring, they got relatively less water.  Please note...  I prefer use only absolutely harmless chemicals and methods, as I have no appropriate protective gear.       "
441,Is there evidence that a deeply watered lawn will develop deeper roots?,"Everyone says ""deep and infrequent"" when describing how to water a lawn, but is there evidence to back up this suggestion?  I can expound on this several ways:  1) Why would one want deep roots if one has to water so much to get water to the roots?  Wouldn't a lawn with shallow roots then be easier to maintain, since not as much water is needed to get to the roots?  1a) If the answer to the above question is to develop a lawn that is drought resistant, then why is there a need to water deeply in non-drought weather?  If there is water down there in droughts (otherwise, why train roots to grow deeply), certainly there would be water down there in non-droughts... and if there is already water down there... why water deeply?  Wouldn't one just be forcing the water that is already deep, even deeper?  Isn't that a waste of water?  2) Oak trees are very deep-rooted plants, yet the vast majority of roots are in the top 6 inches of soil... Even trees that are 100s of years old.  If the roots of oak trees haven't managed to figure out that they should grow deeply in 100 years, how then can grass be expected to?  3) I am under the impression roots will grow because that's what roots do, like plants themselves.  They grow and press onwards.  How is starving them from water, then flooding them with water going to make them grow any better?  4) I am also under the impression that roots grow to find phosphorus, which is immobile in the soil.  Wouldn't it logically follow then that roots will grow as deep as they need to in order to find the P they want?  5) Areas of the country (US) where grass grows best (naturally), have rainfall around 20-30 inches annually.  Areas of the country having rainfall in excess of 50 inches annually, grass doesn't grow so well and trees dominate.  25 inches a year is 1/2 inch a week.  That doesn't sound very deep to me.  Additionally, many of those areas where grass grows naturally well, have drizzly weather.  Areas getting 50+ inches, have monsterous storms with flooding downpours, while remaining sunny most of the time.  Clearly, mothernature is not adhering to the ""deep and infrequent"" rule concerning her watering of the grass.  So, is there evidence to back up the ""deep and infrequent"" suggestion?  Personally, as a human, I would like a sip every now n then rather than go all day and be force-fed a gallon of water in hopes of developing some resistance to dehydration.  It doesn't seem like biology can be coaxed that way.  Update to illustrate the popularity of the ""deep and infrequent"" belief:  From [website]We have:     Too much watering can lead to fungus and a shallow root system; fewer waterings encourage the roots to grow deeper. ""You want to train the roots to go down deep into the soil,"" he says. ""I'm telling my customers if you're going to water, water every three to seven days once we hit summer. Water deeply and water infrequently.""   From [website]We have:     1 inch per week.  Deep and infrequent.   This site [website]If we start in Kansas with 20-35 inches of annual rainfall and kansas having predominantly grasslands, then move east into Missouri, which has 40-45 inches of rainfall [website]This was the principle observation of Dr. William Albrecht on the health of animals.  Places that get too much rain, protein-rich things (grasses, grains) don't grow.  The soil is overly weathered, which causes the soil particles to breakdown and lose cation adsorption capacity.  Plus, nutrients are washed away.     William A. Albrecht (1888–1974) PhD, Chairman of the Department of Soils at the University of Missouri, was the foremost authority on the relation of soil fertility to human health and earned four degrees from the University of Illinois. As emeritus Professor of Soils at the University of Missouri he saw a direct link between soil quality, food quality and human health    [website]According to the ""foremost authority on soils"", if you want grass to grow, you don't want more than 25 inches of rain annually... or less either.  Here's another one saying 1 inch of water [website]Finding someone who doesn't say 1 inch of water and ""deep and infrequent"" is quite a challenge. "
442,How can I prevent my neigbour's cat from marking its territory in my garden?,"We have various bits of garden furniture and this is the kind of furniture that can be left out.  Our neighbour has a male neutered cat that sprays literally everything, including our conservatory and now the garden furniture.  What can we do to stop this happening?  Is there a way to stop cats marking their territory or put them off?  We don't want to harm the cat in any way.  "
443,What is this pest I found on my chilli pepper?,"Last year, I found some brown spots on some of my pepper plants. I couldn't see any insects so I trimmed the affected parts quite aggressively. The plant survived the operation quite well and proceeded to grow and fruit.  Unfortunately, I've recently started seeing similar scars along the veins on the same plant. I've given it a thorough inspection and found a handful of these critters:    What are they? Can they be the cause of my pepper's scarring? How do I get rid of them? "
444,What are the effects of keeping a clumping bamboo in a pot permanently?,"I'm looking at buying a couple of 15 gallon Bambusa multiplex ""Green Hedge"" for privacy but want to keep them both contained and with the option of moving them around as other plants mature.  If I place them in a half whiskey barrel from Home Depot (approximately 27 gallons):     Will it restrict how much they will grow vertically?   How long should they be able to survive in a contained space?   Is it possible for ""parts"" to fall of and spawn new plants outside of the container? I wouldn't think so but I want to verify.   Is there anything specific I should do to ensure successful growth?     Thanks for any advice. "
445,Why is our grape vine setting new fruit all season long?,"We have a couple grape vines, which we've had for years. Normally, they'll set fruit once, early in the season, and it would be ripe later in the season. This year, one of them—and to a lesser extent, another one of them—has been setting fruit far beyond the normal period. I looked at it today, and it's still setting new fruit (we're near the end of the average growing season for my area). Is this normal? Why doesn't it do this every year?  The main one I'm talking about is said to be a black variety, or maybe it's dark purple (it doesn't have that extra fruity flavor like Concord). I don't know what it is. The other one is Thompson Seedless.  I'm in southwestern Idaho, my part of which has a BSk climate (with very hot summers and late springs). We had a hot and an extra-dry summer, this year, with a much cooler-than-average late spring.  The grapes are infested with leaf hoppers, as they have been every year for a few years. However, they seemed to be free of them for much of the season.  The main difference this year is that they have more sun, since there aren't any trees in the garden, now. We've had probably as much sun before, without this result—but it's been a long time. "
446,What bamboo species for a container-bound green wall?,"I have a boring grey northwest-facing-with-southwest-exposure concrete wall on my balcony, outdoors, in Vancouver BC, that I would like to turn into a lush wall of bamboo.  I have one container whose inside dimensions are 14cm × 81cm × 43cm deep (5½″ × 32″ × 17″ deep). The inside of it has been prepared with landscaping fabric, and the bottom is lined with metal cans to promote drainage and prevent rot. Holes in the bottom of the container permit water to escape.  Vancouver does not get very cold in the winter (temperature history), and these plants will enjoy heat emanating from the building walls, all year round.  This balcony is an alcove, rather than something that hangs off the side of the building. Sheltered, it experiences low winds. The building is concrete, and I would rate the load capacity of the balcony as functionally unlimited. There is a drain in the balcony floor for water runoff.     Which variety would you plant to grow a thick, tall screen? How would you prepare the growing medium?  "
447,"Does this orchid have a viable stem? If not, will it grow one if transplanted to a larger pot?","I received a Phalaenopsis Orchid as a Valentine's Day present. It was in a glass vase, and atop the straight stem, which was held to a support stick by a hair clip, were two lovely pink flowers. It looked great until last week, when the flowers fell off, and the stem started bending over.   I carefully lifted it out of the glass, and saw strings of moss coming out of the bottom of the little cup, so I assume what it needs is a transfer to a bigger pot. There are good instructions for that in some other questions here, but my question pertains to this plant's viability.   The tall stem is shriveling more each day, and I thought it had buds, but they're just empty brown pods. There seem to be two other small stems peeking up over the edge of the cup, but they don't look healthy either.  The leaves are a nice color and texture, though, and the plant base looks okay. Also, there are two bright green things in the moss, which I think are healthy roots. Currently it's sitting on top of an empty jar. I know I have to do something, unless it's too late.   Will any of the existing stems bloom? If not, will new stems grow if it's in a larger pot?         "
448,How do I remove one of two different plants growing in the same spot?,"There's a shrub planted in the corner of my property, that the previous owner put there to help mask the utility pole behind it. I kind of like this idea, but there is another plant growing in the same spot. I feel like the shrub would be healthier, fuller, and overall better-looking, if I removed it.  The problem is I i'm not sure how to effectively remove one plant without harming the other. Is this even possible? If you look at the closeup below, you can see the trunks - I want to keep the larger plant with the chunky-looking bark, and get rid of the smaller plant with smooth bark.  I've had some success killing hackberry saplings in my back yard by cutting them near grade with lopping shears and painting the top with glyphosate, but I'm afraid that if I do that, it could enter the root system of the larger shrub. Is that an actual possibility, or will the glyphosate remain only in the target plant? If not, how should I go about this?     "
449,Is there actually such a thing as a ripe green pepper?,"I grew what I thought was a green bell pepper (it was) from seeds that I grabbed out of a store bought green bell pepper but it ended up ripening to orange bell pepper.  While doing some research trying to find the best time to harvest I was usually met with a ""When the pepper changes color is when it is technically ripest"" but this didn't account for a pepper that didn't change color. (Which is what I thought I had)  So maybe I've just been a fool in thinking green peppers were ever a thing but from what I gathered, they aren't, technically. They are just under-ripe peppers?  Is this true? "
450,Is it bad practice to leave dead roots in soil?,"Is leaving them in there better or worse than taking them out?  What about for indoor vs outdoor? Is it okay to leave roots in a pot you plan to re-use soil for?  In my mind I am mostly considering harvestable plants like peppers, carrots, lettuce, etc though I am curious about the outliers as well. "
451,How long does it take for plant roots to break down?,"After a plant is removed/dies, how long does it take for the roots to break down if left in the soil?  Do they eventually provide viable nutrients?  In my mind I am mostly considering harvestable plants like peppers, carrots, lettuce, etc though I am curious about the outliers as well. "
452,How can I grow air plants in an arid climate?,"I inherited several air plants (bromeliads probably in the genus Tillandsia) from a friend. I know they are tropical in origin and lived in a greenhouse previously, but I live in a very arid climate. The plants seem to be drying out. How can I take care of them in this environment? Can I build a small greenhouse? "

454,What's the best way to cut leaf lettuces?,"The last few years I've had success growing romaine and other leaf lettuces. I usually try to harvest only as much as we need for a day (or couple days). That often means just a few leaves at a time Is it best to cut the leaves as close to the ground as possible and, if you do, is there any chance that those leaves will regrow?  Also, if I'm only taking a few leaves from a bigger plant is it best to take them evenly from the perimeter and slowly work inwards? Or better to do one section inwards so you get a mix of inner and outer leaves?  In short, what's the best way to harvest lettuce to insure maximum yield and the best taste? "
455,Heat and light a 6’x7’ room for plants,I have a 6’ x 7’ room (1.8/2.1 m) that I want to heat and light to bring my outdoor potted plants in for winter. How much light do I need? Will a 150 watt r40 flood light do the trick? Hibiscus mainly.  
456,What is this small red/green leaf plant?,"What is this plant called, and what height do they grow to? I've had it for 3 years and the roots are growing out the bottom of the pot. I normally water every few days, seems to grow well either in sunshine or shade. Should I replant into a bigger pot?    "
457,What pest is this and how do I treat it?,"  This pest appeared on the squash plants yesterday.  What is it? How do I treat it?  Zone 6 near Boston, Massachusetts. "
458,Do plants need to be re-hardened after being brought back inside?,"I have ~2 month old bell pepper and heirloom tomato plants that have been spending the last month outdoors in full sun. Unfortunately I'm leaving on a 10-day trip, and will be keeping them watered with Blumat watering stakes. Since the soil likely dries out too quickly outdoors for the Blumats to keep up, I plan to temporariliy bring them back inside under a skylight while I'm gone to reduce evaporation. (They're in fabric pots which are pretty easy to move around)  When I get back home and take them back outside, will they need to go through a re-hardening process after getting used to indoor conditions? Or do plants, once hardened, stay that way? "
459,Can I grow fava beans as a fall crop in New Jersey (USDA Zone 7A)?,"I grew fava beans this year for the first time and really liked them. The issue I had is that about half my seeds didn't come up, so I have a fairly small crop. If I started more seeds in July would they do well over the summer and produce a fall crop for me? I'm in New Jersey and my growing zone is 7A.  Update 10/12: As mentioned in the comments below I started a fall crop this year. The seeds were planted on July 25th after soaking for 2 or 3 days. They came up and started flowering near the end of August and still are. Despite all the flowers I haven't seen a single bean on any of the plants. I had other bean varieties that were flowering at the same time which I was getting quite a lot of beans from so this couldn't be due to a lack of pollinators in the area could it? In general I haven't had the best of luck with fava beans, mostly due to extremely low germination rates, but I at least got some beans off those plants. "
460,Emergency propagation of red currant cutting in early summer,"Due to a trimmer accident I currently have an entire branch of a red currant bush at my hands.   All sources I could find tell me that currants are best propagated in fall from one-year old wood cuttings. Instead I have ""old wood"" parts that were fruiting and ""very new"" soft green growth:   (click to enlarge)  Is there a chance that I could get at least a new plant out of the accident and how should I proceed? Where do I cut and should I keep or remove the leaves? How about the tips of the branches? Right now the branch is in a bottle of water (in the shade!) until the community chimes in.   Or should I dump it in the compost and mourn the loss in silence?    Just a quick update: Out of the five sticks I cut the original branch into, four are growing strong, even without special protection during the winter. They are even so bold as to bloom (which I will remove, to encourage growth not fruiting).   "
461,Stimulate lower stem regrowth of pepper plant,"I've got an indoor pepper plant that has already been through one harvest of 8 peppers. Nearing the end of the first harvest, many of the leaves on the lower stems died off. This may have been due to insufficient nutrients.  I'm fairly sure it has a vibrant root system as I have visibility underneath the grow bag it's currently in. The bag has been penetrated all over with root stems (maybe a sign of insufficient watering - working on that)  In any case, it's now part-way into a second grow cycle and I've reduced the pepper load to 4 max (I'll be clipping extras) in the hopes that the plant won't get over-encumbered.  I cut back a number of stems that the majority of leaves had died on as well as some of the more extended branches and am now left with a plant that's lower 50% or so is pretty much leafless stems (plenty of sunlight) and the upper sections (3 main ones) that have fresh leaf growth and peppers.  I noticed that many of the lower stem nodes have what appear to be new shoots of stems/leaves coming out (maybe 10 or so) however they aren't exactly growing.  It would be awesome if the lower section could be rejuvenated. Is this possible? How can I encourage lower section regrowth?  This is all within a climate regulated environment so time/seasonal changes aren't a limitation. "
462,Can I use the water that collects on our large pool cover?,"My wife and I have a large inground pool that we winterize and cover all winter. It collects a hefty sum of water and other organic material all winter and in the spring I end up pumping this bog water off into the yard and shoveling the solid stuff onto the brush pile to burn. It's not chlorinated or treated, it's just whatever hits the cover after we close it up for the winter.  I was curious if there was any value in spraying the garden with it? We start our garden from seed in the house so hitting it with some potentially good water from the get go might be swell.   Is there is some nutritional value from all the decaying leaves and pine needles? Is there any testing I can do with it? We have quite a few pine trees and I would be worried about the acidity? Can I salvage some compost from the solids?   It seems like such a waste to throw onto a brush pile or away. We're trying to be environmentally conscious and all. "
463,Can you use plastic mulch in the vegetable garden without drip irrigation?,I'm in usda hardiness zone 7a in NJ. Can you use plastic mulch for plants in the vegetable garden without drip irrigation or soaker hoses? If so how do you water plants with plastic mulch? 
464,When to transplant brassicas in legumes bed,"I am growing sweet peas, broad beans and chickpeas for the summer, in an outdoor raised bed. I bought some nice organic broccoli, brussel sprouts and kale seeds for autumn-winter harvesting, and in my mind I was going to sow them now and then transplant the seedlings out in the legumes bed, because I learned it is a good rotation practice.   But, on the seed instructions it is suggested to transplant the seedlings in May-June, if sowing them in March-April. How do I proceed? Can I transplant them in September, when the legumes will be almost gone? And, if I were to follow this way, should I sow them later than April? Thanks!    "
465,How do I set up a roof top garden in a tropical climate?,"I live in India. I have quite some space in the terrace. The roofing is of concrete slab with some weather-proofing done and red oxide tiles laid above. The climate is tropical ( Chennai ). I would like to know:   How to go about setting up a garden in the terrace ? Is there any threat to the building structure in the form of water seepages, algae formation etc. Are there any specific watering needs as the terrace can get quite hot during the day time. Do I use just earthen pots or is it better to construct tray-like concrete structures ?  Any other precautions to be followed while setting up roof gardening?  "
466,How to grow vegetables from kitchen scraps?,"I have heard a lot about growing vegetables from scraps e.g. using potato eyes, or sprouted garlic/onions to grow new vegetables.  I was just wondering if anyone had any experience with this? And which vegetables were the best to do this with? "
467,Identify ant-like pests under rock,I turned up a rock just outside my house in the garden and found these ant-like creatures.  Are these termites or ghost ants or what?    And see the video 
468,Options to kill/remove invasive buckthorn,"I have a large number of mature buckthorn shrubs in my yard that were there when I purchased the property.  This is classified as an invasive in North America.  Not only is it problematic in terms of spreading in my yard, it produces copious amounts of berries which birds then carry to other areas.  When I go hiking in the area, I see these plants taking over and I really want to eliminate them completely.  This summer I started by removing branches from half a dozen or so and cut them down to low stumps.  I then dug out the stump of one.  It turns out that cutting them low was a bad idea because these are really tough plants and there were multiple thick roots extending straight down into the heavy clay soil.  I really could have used the leverage to get at them.  I spent probably 4 hours on the one plant and was exhausted.  I have maybe 5, 6, 10 dozen more to go.  Meanwhile they continue to drop berries like crazy and all the stumps that were no removed are resprouting.  I tried driving some bits of copper wire into one on the off-chance that might kill it but that didn't seem to do anything.  I'm resigned to the belief that I will not able to remove them fast enough.  I need to somehow kill these plants to stop the spread.  The best resource I've found for advice on managing them is here.  It mentions putting a can over them to prevent re-sprouting but I'm hesitant to cut them low and lose the leverage I will want later.  That leaves chemicals.  The options listed on that site are:   Triclopyramine Triclopyrester Glyphosate (Roundup)   I would really prefer not to use conventional herbicides for various reasons.  I'm looking for other options that would be more along the lines of organic methods.  If that's not an option, are there any of the above that are considered more safe.  I say that knowing that often all that means is that we know less about newer chemicals.  I'm just looking for information at this point.  I found a page saying that epsom salts can be used to kill trees.  Anyone with experience using this approach?  Any risks to this for the soil?  There are some other plants in the beds that we would like to keep hoping they will fill in once the buckthorn is defeated. "
469,8 ft tall Poison Ivy?,"  I haven't rubbed it all over me yet, but can this 8 foot tree be poison ivy?  It's growing through my fence.  If so, any suggestions for dealing with it?  I have a dog and small kids!  Thanks. "
470,"Thornless Blackberries, can I root from cuttings?","I dug up and brought a Stalk Thornless Blackberry home in a big chunk of its own ground, and put in in my ground with a bit of manure compost on top about a month ago in Idaho, (Early May) and one of the big stems had leaves and broke off so I stuck it in a two litre soda bottle full of water and placed it on the back porch. Both get sun all day except the one in the bottle gets shade about 3 pm. Now,(early June), the one in the bottle looks healthy and strong, has a flower but no roots, and the one in the ground is just sitting there being a plant... no new growth. The mother plant where I got this from is blooming, so maybe its late because it endured a move? Will my flowered cutting root? Also, I'll take any pruning tips. (as I am asked to add tags to this post I see there is ""rooting hormone"" which I have not used. Is it necessary? Ill go read up on that. ;) ) "
471,What can you do with oak leaves within a garden? Are they compostable?,"We have a lot of oak trees on our property. Is there anything we can do with the oak leaves?  They never really seem to break down, and because of that, I am afraid to try and add them to a compost.  Are they useful in composting at all, or should I keep them out of any mix I make?  When I rake them, I have been chopping them with a leaf blower that breaks them up so I can fit more into a bag. I am not sure if that makes them more useful. I'd like to use them if I can, but if it's not wise, then I'll not try. "
472,How to crop rotate garlic?,"I'm trying to come up with a suitable crop rotation regimen for garlic. What are the plants suitable for planting on the ""garlic space"" the second and third year of rotation?   In particular I am interested in garlic-hemp (the one without psychedelic effect) combination. Hemp and garlic seems to be such a new combination that I've barely found anything written about it.  On other side, I've found out that potato and legumes are a no-go. When I hear legumes I typically think of beans. Does that mean that alfalfa too shouldn't be used as a cover plant once the garlic is taken out of the soil? "
473,"Can I harvest beetroot early as ""micro beetroots""?","I bought a pack of beetroot seeds today, but there are a lot more than I thought (250). Seems like farm sort of quantities far more than my window sill can hold.  Anyway, I had the idea to grow them all as micro beetroots. Can I pull them out at any time?  What sort of size am I looking for? "

475,How much soil to remove from root ball when repotting?,"I have a plant that I think had a high salt content in the soil, likely from watering it with tap water instead of distilled water. To fix this, I followed someone's recommendation to re-pot the plant using new potting soil. However, there was lots of soil in the root ball that I wasn't able to remove for fear of damaging the plant.   I tried to shake/brush off as much soil as possible, but how much is enough? Are there any other techniques or suggestions about how to handle the tradeoff between replacing enough potting soil vs avoiding too much damage to the plant?  I understand that this issue my be solved by getting a ""feel"" for it. But I'm a fairly novice gardener, so a thorough description about how to remove the proper amount of soil from the root ball would be very helpful.  Here are some pics from my repotting attempt:  Before the repotting:   The initial rootball:  Rootball after shaking off some soil:  After fingering through the rootball, here it is before replanting:  "
476,"My dog removed my yucca's bark, what to do","I bought a yucca palm yesterday, and when I woke up today I saw that my dog bit the plant's bark on one side.  The yucca's trunk is about 80cm, the highest leafs are at about 180cm and the trunk has a circumference of about 32cm, of which the dog removed a piece of about 16cm x 20cm.   The yucca seams healthy apart from that... Will it make it? Is there anything I can do?           "
477,Are there some plant-based erosion control ground cover options for Pacific Northwest US?,"Our driveway cuts through the side of a hill. The 'uphill' side in parts is at a perhaps 65 degree angle so steep, and there's a bit of erosion... enough to expose some tree roots.   Ideally we'd use some physical retaining wall solution (stone walls or gabion/reno mattresses) but given that we're broke at the moment, I thought I could at least maybe plant something to hold the soil together until we can afford bigger/better options.  The catch is that it's entirely shaded.  We're in the Pacific Northwest coastal climates.  Is there any sort of spreading non-invasive ground control that we could get to take hole on the hill? Or should we just figure that mechanical retaining walls are the solution?  "
478,How often can you produce cuttings from mint?,"If I create a cutting from my mint plant and begin to grow it in a container, about how long after it gets established should I wait before I create another cutting?  What is the minimum waiting period after the roots begin to become established that a cutting can be made without harming the health of the plant?  Assume that I am trying to create as many mint plants as fast as possible. "
479,80mm decking post into a 75mm metal post holder,"It appears posts designed for balustrades are 80mm wide whereas fence posts are only 75mm.  The problem being is wedge-grip post holders are made for 75mm posts.  Firstly I wonder:   Why are fence posts and decking posts different widths? Can I use a 75mm fence post for my balustrade? Is there an easy, and effective way to remove 2.5mm from each side (up to the height of the post holder so it'll fit in neatly.   Or:   Are there alternative ways to a metpost to hold an 80mm timber post upright safely - on a concrete platform with a 1m drop on the otherside?  "
480,Should I compost bindweed leaves?,"I have cleared a lot of bindweed from various parts of my garden. I'd like to keep it better controlled from now on.  I have read that it's a good idea not to compost the roots, because they'll survive and grow.   However, can new growth develop from leaves and stalks?  That is, should I quarantine all bindweed material for burning and/or hot composting by my council? Or is OK to cold-compost the leaves and stalks? "
481,What are the pros and cons of bagged mulch versus city mulch?,"For the last several years, I've been getting mulch from the city (for free!). It's been great for the soil and super cheap (obviously). But, it seems to fade really quickly in the hot Oklahoma sun. This year, I was considering buying bagged mulch because I assumed that it would retain its color longer. So, a couple of questions:   Will bagged mulch retain its color longer? Will bagged mulch offer the soil benefits that the city compost facility's' mulch offers?  Are there any disadvantages (or advantages) of one over the other?  "
482,Why did my tulips die?,"I planted three bulbs in a small vase, around 20 cm diameter, without a drainage hole. I planted them in November, outside under a roof, facing East, and watered them when the soil was dry. I'm in Amsterdam and the weather was cold, but not as cold as it usually is. Blooming was on time in the fields.  Since the season was particularly rainy this didn't happen often (even though the vase was under a roof). I got the tulip plants to grow up to 15 cm, with three green sprouts that seemed to be in perfect health, as the blooming period approached. Then, in just 10 days, some yellowing appeared on the borders and the tips, and it spread to the whole plants. This is the final, sad result that puts my efforts to grow something in the dust. Poor things.    What did I do wrong? It is the first time I tried to grow something. Also, do you think these bulbs can still be reused next year? "
483,What is a proper container to preserve seeds?,"I received seeds from various produces as a gift. They are in sealed paper bags, but they occupy a lot of space and I was thinking about opening the bags and putting the seeds into small transparent plastic containers. Is this a good way to store and not compromise them? If not, what is the preferred alternative?  "
484,"Webs, black spots, and dying leaves- what disease is inflicting my plants?","I'm trying to identify an plant disease that has infested my sage, rosemary, and oregano. The plants have have a few webs on their leaves and there are black dots all over the plant, which don't seem to be moving and don't look like insects from the naked eye. The effects are black spots on the leaves, yellow discoloration, some holes, and eventually death of the leaf. What could this disease be? How can I stop it from spreading and if possible, save the plants that are already affected?   Edit: This is in the Southeastern, USA "
485,"Peaches, plums, and brown rot","According to [website]  Wild plum thickets are an important source of spores for both primary and secondary infections. Wild plums bloom   before and during peach bloom, and the fruit mature continuously from early to late in the season, providing a   continuing source of inoculum. Removal of wild plums adjacent to a peach orchard is an important sanitation   procedure.   Unfortunately, I have lots of wild plums which are providing privacy for a place which I sometimes have fires.  I waited 5 years for these plums to get tall and thick enough to provide this cover, now I learn I have to remove them if I'm ever to expect a decent peach harvest.  Is there anything economical enough to spray on lots of trees for the sake of a few peach trees?  And that isn't going to kill my fish and frogs in the pond I have 500ft downhill from the trees?  I don't expect to ever be rid of the fungus, I just want to make it as uncomfortable for the fungus as I can and without spending much or going to much effort.  Ideas? "
486,Amend soil with wood chips - is there anything to be aware of?,"I plan to amend the soil with wood chips by tilling them up to 40cm into the soil(should I go depper?) , going heavy on nitrogen fertilizer and planting alfalfa while decomposition takes place. I did the math, and in order to increase the organic matter by 5%, I need to add about 25kg per square meter.  That is a lot wood chips. Is there anyting to be aware of regarding use of wood chips for soil amending purposes? Are there any bad side effects? Once decomposed, will the soil have too much fertilizer? "
487,What is causing my bark to fall off and is it normal?,"I’ve looked around at other posts asking this question, but none seem to address this particular scenario.  I had a tree planted a few years ago and a ring of landscaping brick and mulch placed around the tree. The tree has been thriving and doing well best I can tell. Over the last couple of months, the bark has started to fall off and I have noticed some ants crawling around in it.  Is this something I need to be worried about? If so what should I do about it?

489,Forcing a clover takeover of my lawn,"I have weeds in my grass lawn. Not an uncommon situation, I understand.  I have a few types of weeds. One type grows like &mdash; well, like weeds: quickly and tall. And unsightly. Then there's clover, which is neither tall nor, to my mind, unsightly.  I'm thinking of spreading the clover throughout my lawn in order to crowd out the other weeds. It will, I know, also crowd out my grass.   Will this work? That is, will the clover crowd out the other weeds, eradicating them? Will it be self-defeating in that the clover, if so plentiful, will grow tall? Will such a large amount of clover attract many cows bees? (We're not too fond of bees.) How can I go about doing this?     Related: Do clovers cause any problems? "
490,How to get more shoots after pruning Yucca?,"I have cut off the top of my Yucca elephantipes, and after a few months a new shoot comes from the stem. My question is, is it possible to get more than one shoot? And if yes, how to do that? How can I stimulate the plant to have more shoots (without pruning the new shoot)?   "
491,Watermelon leaves curled up and fruit were squishy. Is it normal?,"I planted Crimson Red watermelon seedlings (top) in a firepit that I converted to a garden bed. It's sharing space with a tomato (left), rosemary (bottom), and red pepper (right). Since there's 4 plants crammed into this garden bed, I decided to drape the watermelon vines over the concrete to make room. Is there any problem for the watermelon fruit to grow on a hard surface? I've been slowly building up this soil with a mixture of store bought soil and vegetable scraps, egg shells, fallen fruit, and nut shells for several years. I water this garden bed twice a week.   I noticed that the watermelon leaves are all curling inward. It looks wrinkly just like kale. Is this normal or a sign of some disease? The leaves are a decent green color. There's not much yellow. There's 3 watermelon fruit growing, They're all around 6 inches in diameter. The fruit started off squishy but now they're rock hard like the mature watermelons you find the super market. Is it normal for the fruit to start off soft?  I'm in California zone 9. It's been around 80 degrees Fahrenheit during the daytime for two months.     "
492,Ivy browning leaves,"I've had this ivy for years now, and repotted it last month, as it was with some other plants and the pot had gotten too small, not to mention the soil needed changing.  After the ""operation"", its leaves started going brown and falling off. I thought it was just shock from the transplant, as its roots had tangled up with those of a parlor palm and it was hard to separate them without some damage. However, it's still browning, and now I'm worried about it. It seems to be growing new leaves from the parts where it lost some, but some of the new growth then goes brown again...  What's going on? And how do I fix it?  "
493,"What ""gotchas"" should I avoid when building a raised garden?","I am planning on constructing a 2-tier outdoor raised vegetable garden.  I'd like to avoid any ""gotchas"".  I live in the US Pacific Northwest, so three non-summer seasons a year are moist.  My plan is:   Utilize/extend existing plans, i.e. leverage Sketchup raised garden plans Use wood (i.e., railroad ties) anchored by rebar Allow for drainage (per this raised flower bed question) Bottom layer filled with rubble/gravel Top layer dirt   My question: Are there any obvious ""gotchas"" with this plan? "
494,"Are ""minerals"" and ""nutrients"" the same thing?","Some good answers on this question: Is it worth spreading ash on the vegetable plot?.   But one answer says:     I can't think of any minerals that would be present   and the other upvoted answer says:     It has (varying depending on the woods that were burned) quite a few nutrients   I'm trying to work out which answer is correct, or whether they can both be right.  From a gardener's perspective, when we talk about nutrients, do we mean minerals?  "
495,Should there be a bottom on a raised flower bed?,"I am wondering if people usually fill a raised bed completely with soil, or make a ""bottom"" for the soil to sit on?  If a bottom is made, is it treated wood to avoid mold and deterioration?  And if drainage is necessary, how do I create that? "
496,How should I fill and reseed shallow depressions in my lawn?,"I want to level out a lawn that is roughly 4000 square feet. It has many low areas that vary in diameter and depth. Not sure what caused these holes; my guess is that they are from a previous owner gutting out bushes or trees. Some holes have a radius of about 2-3 feet or so and depth of a few inches. I dealt with some holes last summer (the large ones that had a radius of about 4 feet) using topsoil, grass seed and daily watering  but I'm thinking it will take too long to fill in everything piecemeal. My plan is probably to till and rake the whole lawn, add some grass seed, and then put down around 14 cubic yards of topsoil. Finally, rake the topsoil over the seed. I will then water it every day for a couple weeks.  Does anyone see any problem with doing the above? What is the most ideal times to do this? Is mid to late April in New Jersey too early (maybe the ground is still frozen)? "
497,How fast does a Thuja hedge grow after being burnt?,A fire destroyed about 40cm of the upper part of my Thuja hedge. I have 2 questions:   Should I cut off the burnt branches to help regrowth or can I leave it as it is? How long will it take to grow the 40cm back again?  
498,What is this purple plant with skinny leaves?,"I recently was given this plant and apparently it has a pretty bad history. First it was left outside and infested by snails and then it was accidentally mowed over. When I got the plant it was in a very small plastic pot with some horrible clay-like soil. I have now re-potted it into a slightly too big clay pot witch decent soil and better drainage.    The plant was left out during the summer in eastern europe, so it was able to survive around 10 degrees Celsius.    What is this plant and how do I care for it? Should I remove all the messed up leaves that are cut and have holes in them?      "
499,Base of flowering pear has its bark pulling away from the trunk,One of our flowering pears has the bark pulling away from the base of the trunk. It is planted in our front lawn and has done well till now. Afraid we're going to loose it. The crown doesn't show any problems yet. The side that the bark is pulling away is the shady side. We live in Northern California and it is very hot. Has been over 100 for about 3 week. With many days around 110. Puzzled though because we just finished a drought and there wasn't problems then. Hope I can get some ideas or answers. Also we water the lawn 2 times a day. Once in the evenings and once in the mornings. Also should I pull the bark away? Should I treat the bark?   
500,Is this oak powdery mildew? How can I manage it?,"I have just bought a new property that has a range of oak trees. Unfortunately, I noticed that some of the young trees in one area have a white discolouration of the leaves.    After some searching online, I think this is oak powdery mildew (erysiphe alphitoides).   In this question, the only answer discusses using a sulphur fungicide.  I would like to ask:   Is this powdery mildew? Are there any other options for managing it and can it be completely cured? Are the nearby mature oaks at risk?  "

503,Compost pile and bugs (2 questions),"First insect question: When I turned our compost pile yesterday, there was a lot of very rich smelling black soil, semi composted vegetables/plant/oak leaf matter, and a LOT of pill bugs. My wife said, ""They're doing their job well."" Are pill bugs good for the compost pile?  Second insect question: I've read in so many places online, and in Robert Rodale Press organic gardening books about; ""Anything that was once alive - is organic."" Would that include the hordes of grasshoppers we have here in Texas? If so, would there be a benefit to me throwing a few hundred of them (dead) into my compost pile?

505,How much water is lost in watering your lawn during the day?,I've always heard not to water your lawn during the day and that the fine water droplets will evaporate before it is absorbed by the lawn (either in the air or while sitting above ground).  But how bad is it?  Is there a direct correlation to the temperature outside? 
506,Is rain water better than tap water for plants?,"Is it better to water your plants with rain water collected in water butts? I mean is that better than water straight from the tap?  And is it just a matter of temperature (presumably plants don't like to be soaked with very cold water (as mains tap water is)? Or are there other factors?  I'm interested in the effects on plants, rather than the separate issue of the cost to the planet of using mains tap water.  See also Does water temperature affect plant growth?. "
507,Keeping up the chili pepper ripening process while suffering from drastic climate change,"With the frost approaching rapidly in my area, I brought inside a few potted chili pepper plants for overwintering. Some of the plants, however, still have lots of unripe peppers on them (hundreds in some cases), so before chopping up my plants for overwinter preparation, I would like to wait a bit for the peppers to ripen.  I however do NOT have great conditions for them (no sunny window), so they basically transition drastically from sunny days to low-medium lighting basement.   I am wondering what is the best and fastest way to achieve this, assuming I do not want the plants to produce new flowers, and that I’m going to chop it up a bit. I figured that topping the branches that have close to no peppers on them would be a good idea, but I have yet to find any information that confirms or deny it.   Also, what could be the downsides of this? Will the peppers degrade in quality? Or will it take ages for them to ripen? I mean, I could harvest them unripe and I’ll be pretty happy too, but I prefer ripe. If however it is not worth the effort, I’ll just harvest as it is and start the overwinter process.  Info: The plants are hot chili peppers ranging from mild to super-hot, in case that matters. "
508,Increasing Olive Pollination,"I have a Mission Olive tree, and I've read in several places that Sevillano and Ascolano will both increase fruit set as these 3 are good cross pollinators of each other. Unfortunately I cannot find any Sevillano or Ascolano in my area, all that seems to be available locally is Arbequina, Frantoio, Manzanillo, which from what I've read are either poor cross pollinators or not compatible at all.  My question is would buying a 2nd Mission Olive increase pollination rates? Is it just a matter of a greater amount of compatible pollen available in the area or is there something about the genetics of cross compatible varieties pollinating each other that gives better results than just having multiple trees of the same type?  (I know I could order a Sevillano or Ascolano online but I've been very disappointed in my previous mail orders, most arriving near death or disappointingly smaller than advertised, so I'm focusing on local trees I can inspect and approve of prior to purchase) "

510,What plant is this leaf I found in my rocket salad from?,"Today I bought some rocket at the supermarket (also known as rucola) and found this leaf (well, my tougue noticed those funny, quite stiff little hairs). It's got hairs all over.   Does anyone know what plant this is from? Is it harmless, considering it was found in a package of edible leaves?    "
511,Bonsai identification and pruning tips,"I purchased my first bonsai about 4 years ago but haven't taken regular care of it, mainly just watering it occasionally in the summer and rarely during the other months. I've been too afraid to trim it. During the last few months I've kept it by the window and watered it regularly and it began growing much more rapidly than in the past.  First question is, can anyone identify the type of tree?  Second, any tips on where and how far down to trim? The tallest branch is beginning to fall over from its own weight. I've watched a bunch of bonsai trimming videos on youtube, but the trees they trim are in much better shape than this.  Thanks!    "
512,How to prevent Sempervivum tectorum (Common Houseleek)  from growing in length and not width?,"I have torn a part of this plant twice at my hometown, brought it to where I live now and then planted it. On both occasions, the plant started growing fine at first, but at some point, it started extending its stem and growing in order to reach the sun as much as possible (the top level entirely left the pot). What happened next in both occasions is that the old leaves at the stem started falling off and eventually the stem rotted, dividing the healthy top of the plant from the root.  I've tried replanting the leftover in the first case, but it eventually died off. Currently, I have the leftover of the 2nd plant which I tried replanting, but don't know what will happen yet.  I'm keeping it inside my office. It's facing east. During the morning it's very sunny, but in the afternoon it's not. I water it once per week, or once per 2 weeks.  Question: What do I do with this plant once it starts growing in length rather than in width and how can I prevent that? Is the problem that I have it inside the apartment instead of outside?  I'm trying to get it to grow and look like the picture on the left, but mine looks like the one on the right.        "
513,Pepper plants developing strange leaves,"My pepper plants are at various stages of growth but nearly all of them are developing these really strange leaves that are curved downwards, elongated and hard to the touch.   I can't figure out what it is. This is most prevelent in my hydroponic Scorpian pepper plant where I pruned it but all the new leaves are coming out this way.   Could this be over fertilisation? Why would I have that in my other soil plants too though?   Image Links:  My Pepper Plants (1)  My Pepper Plants (2)      Please Help. Can't find the answer to this!   Thanks K "
514,Beetle infection,  Having the infestation of the beetle above in the gardening pots. The grub of the beetle is causing trouble to the young plants and the soil loses water retention due to the pupa stage which forms soil shells.   Could any one recommend a way to eradicate or control this in organic way?  What could be done with the current soil? Should it be completely removed? 
515,Sudden Outbreak of Yellow Leaves on Tomato (and Other) Plants,"My mother was in a panic this morning. She called me over to help her with her garden because many of her tomato plants had suddenly developed yellow leaves, many of which (but not all) also have brown spots.  Here are the facts and observations:   Developed almost overnight (few if any were yellow the previous day) All of them are potted (with drainage holes) About half of them have the problem Some have no brown spots, some have one, some have many Some have a lot of yellow leaves, some only a few Most of the plants are clustered together, but one on the other side of the garden also had yellow leaves Her eggplant and strawberry plants also have one or two new yellow leaves Her pot of shamrocks has many yellow leaves, most with brown spots It has rained a lot this past week I didn’t make a note at the time, but I believe that most of the affected ones were on the outer row of the garden while most of the inner row was affected less so, if at all (i.e., they could have been shielded from the rain by the outer row if it came down at an angle) It has been pretty hot, humid, and muggy recently (whenever it wasn’t raining that is)   Worrying that it was a disease, she pruned every yellow or even yellowish leaf that she could find on all of the tomato plants as well as the eggplant, strawberry, and shamrocks.  I pointed out that it rained a lot recently and that it seems to have happened to different kinds of unrelated plants, and so could be hyponatremia (like with blossom-end-rot).  Using this information, I managed to find a few web pages that seem to indicate that it could indeed be too much rain, but the same symptoms (well, at least the yellow leaves/brown spots) were indicated for several other things (this similar sounding question didn’t even mention over-watering as possible cause).  Does anyone know what this is? Can anyone confirm if it is over-watering and whether they can recover if she can find a way to prevent them from getting soaked the next time it rains?    "
516,"Rubber plant propagation, move to soil","I’m new here :)  I’ve been tasked with propagating my mom’s rubber plant when we chopped off the top. I started with leaf propagation in water but after about 6 weeks there were only a few little nodules but no roots. So I moved them each into perlite/tent and most leaves have been progressing well for the last 2 weeks.  I’ve never done this before so I’m a little nervous about the next step.   One of the leaves has new growth coming in, but has not developed even one root. How should I proceed with this? The new growth started around 5 weeks after cutting.   Another one has a good little cluster of roots and new growth as well. How do I know when it’s time to move to soil, and what’s the best way to transition?   Thanks for any help and please excuse my lack of knowledge.    "
517,How to safely protect my raspberries from pests,"I have a flourishing crop of raspberries (I live on Long Island, NY) but last year and now this year I am seeing tiny little worms or caterpillars inside the raspberries.  The insects are white and much, much smaller than the berry. I think the berries infected by these pests become very mushy, not to mention rather gross.    I sprayed the raspberry vines with an insecticidal soap, but it had no affect. I have a more powerful insecticide, but the directions say you cannot harvest fruit for 14 days after application. If I need to go that route I will, because last year these little worms spread to the whole crop and right now they are confined to one area. But since the vines are yielding a bowl of good fruit per day, I would rather not have to waste two weeks worth of fruit.  What could these little worms be? How can I get rid of them? Would food-grade DE be a good option? Should I just use more of insecticidal soap since it is fairly safe?  Related question: I recently discovered a large number of small flying beetles around the vines and on the berries. Could this be the same species as the little white caterpillars? "
518,"How can the ""soils"" be improved on coral atolls.","My Parents are currently living on a small pacific coral atoll. Coral atolls, for the most part don't have much soil. Mostly they just have coral sands. These ""soils"" are very well drained (and they get hot during the day), and highly alkaline, with very little carbon or nitrogen. There's some salinity too, but even just 10 meters back from the coast, the water table is fresh enough to drink. Getting anything to grow other than native plants is pretty difficult, although my mum has succeeded with some things, including egg plants, tomatoes, and pumpkins.  Does anyone have any recommendations for quick improvement of such soils? Compost is the obvious one, but the source material is somewhat limited (by how much we eat). Mum is also mulching with leaves of a native that grows pretty fast. I'm also going to try making some charcoal, although the answers here are somewhat discouraging. Are there any other things we could try? "
519,Shallow root thorny plant zone 6 (NE Indiana),"What are some thorny plants that will thrive in zone 6 but also have shallow roots? The reason I ask is my neighbors, despite everything else I've tried, wont keep their dogs out of my yard. I can't plant anything large close to the road, and anything with deep roots would risk my sewer and gas lines. Alternately, is there any plant that will simply repel dogs by scent?   The area is full sun, the soil is clay but sits on a slight incline so it drains fairly well.   EDIT: Thinking about it, I suppose it need not be thorny if it grows thick enough as to be impenetrable. Whatever a dog wouldn't like to walk through and squat on. "
520,"When, and how far, to prune down a massive overgrown rhododendron?","Our new home has several rhododendrons that look to have gone unmanaged for many many years. The largest, in the pictures below, has grown well over the roof.   When should this get pruned? How far down should it get pruned at a time? What's the ideal height for a plant like this?    "
521,How to grow plants from the aster/daisy/sunflower family? (by example of Launaea Arborescens),"I brought a piece of an Launaea Arborescens (see also my other question) with me from Gran Canaria. The plant is part of the Asteraceae/Compositae family, according to Wikipedia ""commonly referred to as the aster, daisy, or sunflower family"".  Before transportation, I kept the piece for some days in earth with only little water, trying to replicate the rather dry soil in which these plants prosper. When I carefully packaged the piece, I realized that no roots whatsoever had been developed.  Is it somehow possible to grow the plant from that piece? Should I better get another piece? Or - more broadly - what is a good method of growing plants from the aster/daisy/sunflower family, taking some piece of a plant?  Unfortunately, today, someone accidentally put the piece in garbage. When I recovered it, it was covered with some milky grease, possibly yogurt, which I removed with water. I hope this didn't damage the plant. The picture was made after the accident.  Update: I now cut the piece just below the lowest node and put that in water, according to an article on bush daisies, which are of the same family.  Update 2: After some weeks, the piece had cached fungus, and I threw it into garbage.   "
522,Growing *Sarracenia* in a pond in the Southern Plains,"We have moved to Wichita Falls, Texas. This is Hardiness Zone 7b. We're at the southern end of the Southern Plains, near the Oklahoma border - 2hrs from Oklahoma City, Lubbock, and Fort Worth.  The garden has a pond and a reasonable amount of shade. Can I grow Sarracenia in these conditions? I'm thinking it should be possible to grow it as a marginal in a pot that is on a pond shelf (ie. base is submerged), but raised up so that the soil (or coarse sand) surface is an inch or two above the pond surface.  Is that possible? Has anyone tried something like this?  I was thinking of Sarracenia alata because of the size (18-24in) and I have seen it growing in the wild in East Texas (shaded bottom-land forest/swamp). "
523,Why are leaves falling off of my Prickly Pear cactus?,"I just moved into a new home in Phoenix, AZ, and now have a lot of cacti to tend to.  I do not know their care history, or how much/how often they are watered.  One of the largest Prickly Pear cacti is dropping its leaves (pads?) at a seemingly high rate.  Is this a sign of over watering, under watering, a lack of pruning, or something else entirely?  Some of the pads look wrinkled, which I'm told can mean either over or under-watering.  Here is a photo of the cactus   Here is a photo of the place where the most recent leaf-bunch detached   Here is a photo of the broken segment on the ground   This most recent break (the one pictured here) occurred about 24 hours ago.

525,"what are effective, non-chemical, ways to control japanese beetles?",I'm beginning to see adult Japanese beetles on my dahlias and other flowers.

526,Re-evaluating my relationship with Gorse,"I live in north Auckland, and bit off a lot more then I can chew in terms of a rural block.   Because of its prickliness, density and label as a weed, I formed a negative opinion of Gorse - which grows on the back of my lifestyle block (lifestyle block = small holding)  - mainly near the stream and far side of my property - unsurprisingly the difficult area to reach.  I have clay soil.  I recently drove down to Wellington and the Wairarapa and noticed that (a) Gorse is everywhere and (b) It is actually quite pretty in bloom.   This has got me thinking if I should be re-evaluating my opinion of it, and if so what values it brings  Questions -   Should I be considering Gorse as a weed or a beneficial plant - if the latter, what benefits does it provide ? Is there a natural way of displacing gorse without spraying it with  weed killer or hurting myself in the process?   What can I displace it  with? Is my tentative observation that Gorse does not really take hold in  a mowed area, or in areas with other dense weeds/grasses.  Is this an accurate perception?   "
527,Brown/Black spots on Jade Plant leaves,"I noticed some brownish spots on a couple of my jade plant leaves? Is this serious? I water the plant once ever 6-10 days depending on the weather (When the soil is dry). The plant gets lots of indirect light and a couple of weeks ago I fertilized it with some cactus/succulent specific water soluble fertilizer.      If you are wondering why the jade has so little leaves it is because it used to look like this: What is wrong with this Jade Plant? (Yellowing Leaves, Spots, White powder)  I decided to pick off most of the damaged/yellowing leaves and let the plant start over. I know its probably not the best choice but the plant has been doing significantly better and is growing very fast. "
528,Scorpion Pepper growth,"Backstory  Hey everyone, first post in this stack, so sorry if I didn't see an answer to these questions (I did check though).  So I have a Scorpion Butch T plant that I bought about 2 months ago (63 days). It was already grown to ~9 inches tall, but with most of the stalk trimmed of leaves. Only foliage was at the upper 4-5"" mark.  Anyway, it's grown to about 16"" now and is finally starting to grow a new leaves. In the past 2 weeks it dropped 6 large leaves that were lower down, so now it's looking like a poodle or something. This Seems quite slow considering that my wife's plant (1 week older) has more than tripled in size so far and is producing ~50 chillies. Now hers is a pepper pequin plant, so I'd expect them to grow differently, but this is just silly.  So, not only does my plant seem to be growing pretty slow, but it's been dropping every flower bud, many of them even before flowering. At the moment this is my biggest concern. What is interesting to note is that they were flowering before the large leaves were dropped and since they haven't even really opened at all.  My wife and I have just been using regular old Miracle-gro and some acceptable soil I got from work. When I started looking I found that there's a lot of science being applied to pepper growing! So I got a soil test kit.    Plant Environment  The one I got only goes to a value of 4 at the top... so yeah.  1. pH: 6-6.5  2. N: 4+ (I estimate ~12 based on darkness)  3. P: 4+ (I estimate ~12 based on darkness)  4. K: 3-4  Los Angeles area 12"" potted-plant, so temp now is ~65-95F for the most part. Humidity can get pretty low, but the environment on my balcony has been pretty good. Where my plant sits it get ~10-11 hrs of direct/full sun. Wind is hit or miss. If it's windy, they it will get a gentle breeze at least, but the walls on the balcony keep it from getting too violent. I have played with my watering practice a bit and found that it seems to like a good soak that fully drains away, but what's odd is the soils stays fairly wet for ~5-7 days.  Added Info  The soil is a mixture of potting soil, natural Los Angeles earth (which can be pretty sandy) and some manure that got mixed in a couple seasons back. There are some rocks in the soil, although I've been removing them when I come across them, but I didn't add any rocks.  On watering, the last 2 weeks I've kind of experimented. The pot does have holes, but the dish underneath seemed to have been blocking them a bit. I put some bottle caps between the pot and dish so there's more space, and that seems to have done the trick. Today when watering the water took ~10 seconds to drain (and didn't drain that much water). Also I did let the souls get drier than before.  My wife and I have basically done the same practices with regard to watering and fertilizing, although I've used less of the Miracle-gro. I'm thinking of changing the soil soon cause we bought some fruit/veggie soil which looks much better.    General Questions  So I suppose if anyone has experience with Scorpion peppers in particular, let me know what stands out to you. For anyone whose cultivated fruits and veggies, I imagine you may be able to impart some relevant knowledge, and I definitely appreciate whatever you've got!    Specific Questions:  Why is it dropping blossoms and not growing peppers at all!?  Is NPK of 12-12-3 (or 4-4-1) bad for chili/pepper plants?  Is the soil not draining well enough or being overwatered?  With my NPK this far out of whack, should I try to balance it with specific fertilization (like  potassium sulfide, phosphorus etc.) or let the plant stabilize the soil before beginning proper fertilization?   If doing targeted fertilization of the NPK, what tricks or methods work best, especially considering that I do want to consume the fruit yield?    Images  My Scorpion Butch T      My wife's Pepper/Chili Pequin       UPDATES  So I reported by pepper (thoroughly washed my hands and wore gloves to avoid tobacco contamination ;) ) with new soil and did a new set of tests on it. It's now    pH ~6.5-7 N: 4 P: 4 K: ~3.5   I also did some trimming of the leaves that were most yellowed and took care of a new little cluster of aphids.  It's looking better and while checking for aphids, I found 2 flowers that have started fruiting!!!  So I'll keep monitoring it and see what's what. Thanks for everything so far!  As of yesterday...  Plant's also got about 6-10 blossoms that are opening up. We had a hot spell a few weeks back, but now that it's getting more temperate, to doing quite well. So excited!    So just to update, here's my plant as of this morning!   So I think the solution for me was a number of factors:   Putting actual potting soil, not garden soil. Learning the plants preferred watering schedule (this does fluctuate with temp/humidity changes) which seems to be about weekly with current weather. Sparingly using any kind of fertilizers/nutrient supplements!!! Using dissolved epsom salt every couple weeks. (The one thing I can't control too well) the weather in my locality. If I had more space, and no pets, I'd be willing to put my plant inside as needed with extreme heat or cold, but it's not really feasible. :,( So, this plant seems to be quite happy in the 68F - 83F range.

529,Why are mineral fertilizers not allowed in organic farming?,"Recently I've read an article stating that easy soluble mineral ferilizers are not allowed in organic farming (with a few exceptions).   By that I mean that there are some laws that restrict you from having a ""organic farmer"" certificate if you use mineral fertilizer.  Why is that? What is so bad about using such nutrients? I understand that you are not adding any organic matter to the soil, which is beneficial to the soil organisms, but if you already have a 20% organic matter in your soil does it even matter? "
530,Can I grow blackberries (brambles) from cut back stems?,"We have been removing a thicket of brambles from one area of our garden in the UK, but have another area we would quite like to be a thorny wilderness as a natural barrier.

He is about 6 inches tall now and has been transplanted from his little cup to a bigger cup!  I am wondering, when would be a good time to start pruning his foliage and roots? Should I give him a year, two years, or should I start soon?  Looking for information from someone who has successfully grown bonsai. "
532,Growing bonsai using artificial lighting,"So I bought Japanese ELM seed to grow my own bonsai. The thing is, I read everywhere that it need a lot of sun, especially in the morning. But where I live, I the sun doesn't reach the window until late afternoon and almost the same if I put it outside in the morning...  Will my bonsai be happy if I use an artificial light to replace the sun? And what are your recommendation for such use case? "
533,Japanese Maple: Overwatering or Underwatering?,"Uh oh -- Problem with my Japanese Maple! See leaf pics below.  I planted it spring 2016, so it's been in the ground over a year.  We have heavy clay soil. The soil wasn't super amended when I planted it, but I planted it well and kept it watered. No problems last year and this year it's been great until the last 2-3 weeks. I do not currently have mulch on top of the soil.  Thoughts? Overwatering? Underwatering? Something else? The pattern on the leaf seemed distinctive enough.    "
534,What's causing my potatoes to wilt?,"I'm growing yukon gold potatoes. They've been growing like gangbusters, but this week I noticed some leaf yellowing and wilt on at least 3 plants out of 9.   Why are they yellowing? Is it anything to be concerned about?  I check the soil daily, and it's damp down to at least 4 inches.  I'm in zone 6a, if that helps any.   "
535,Do you know of ways that help a plant to produce more flowers?,"  In Crocus sativus, or saffron crocus, the most commercially important part is stigma of flowers. Each plant produces one flower (so there is more than one plant in this picture) and each flower has three stigmas (stigmas are red in this picture).

541,Why are the leaves of my french marigold wilting and causing the flower to droop?,"The leaves of my french marigold are wilting, and the flower droops over due to its weight and skinny stem. (I have positioned the flower to lean against the glass this time).  This is the 2nd time already!  Why do the leaves keep wilting, a few at each time? Is it too little watering, air too dry or insufficient sunlight? I have tried to spot for pests and signs of infection... nothing!  I live in Singapore, the pot is 6 inch deep. I used to water it once every 7 days until the water runs out from the bottom. Right now I poke my finger in every 3 days and water it when it feels dry.   The pot is placed at a south west facing window (in my office around 25 degree celsius) which will get around 5 hours of sunlight behind a glass pane.     "
542,How is an Avocado plant started?,I find ourselves buying one or two Avocados twice a week.  It's one of these things that I've been wanting to do for a long time: grow an avacado plant.    What is the ideal climate or exposure to sunlight that an avocado plant needs?  Also what is the best way to germinate an avocado plant?  Or how would you start growing an avocado plant?    The only other related thread i found was about an already growing avocado plant: How to prevent avocado from drying out indoors?  UPDATE:  My plant started growing but wanted to let people know that it doesn't do very well in the cold weather. 
543,How should I speed up the decomposition of sickly sweet smelling giant compost heap?,"I have created a monster of a compost heap on my property (3 meters, by 2 meters, by almost 2 meters tall) next to an old granite rock wall. Anyway, I mostly put all my grass clippings (primary offended of volume of material) as well as leaves and other material. I just started doing this because I didn't think it would be good to have the local rubbish company haul this off.  As of late, the pile has started getting a bit bigger than I want it to, and it exudes a sickly sweet smell.  What can I do to speed up the decomposition of all this vegetation?  I don't mind the smell that much, since it's pretty far from the house.  However, will any process I initiate cause any other odours to come from it that may be more noticeable than the current smell?  I'm not after dirt, just trying to lessen my impact a bit (and stop that smell).  Will some of those organic disintegration agents work (like a stump dissolver)? "
544,My Dracaena reflexa (Song of India) is dying. Help!,"Help!  I got this dracaena over a month ago and it was doing well up until this week. This plant stays in an office with just fluorescent lights and is watered once a week. Last week it started getting some new growth up top, but I started to notice some of the leaves were browning. It was mainly the bottom ones so I thought nothing of it.  However this week, more and more leaves started falling off daily and today the center part (with the new growth) just fell off! What am I doing wrong? How can I save my plant?   "

547,Brown spots on herbs - treatment and are they ok to eat?,"The leaves on all my garden herbs (mint, sage, oregano, thyme, lemon balm) get yellow-brown speckles from late spring, which by late summer almost entirely cover the leaves.  What might this disease (or diseases - the mint looks like rust but I've not heard of rust affecting thyme) be, and how can I treat it?  And can I still eat the affected leaves?      "
548,Can I harvest vegetable seeds and store for the next year?,"This discussion of seed storage got me wondering if it is feasible to harvest seeds from vegetables (I'm partial to tomatoes) as I cut them up for consumption.   Generally, I buy seeds each year. But if I have a steady supply, and it's not ill-advised, could I not save seeds for the next year? If so, what steps should I take? Is there a reason not to save vegetable seeds? "
549,How to grow aquatic floating bladderworts from seed?,"Along with my previous question about Sarracenia, I'm also thinking of growing floating Utricularia (bladderworts) in the pond. Still not quite decided on the species (there are invasive issues to consider), but I am looking at suppliers. If I chose seed instead of plants, how would I germinate them?  Would getting a jar of pond water (should be full of microbes and daphnia) and dropping the seeds in, be sufficient? I don't want to drop them straight in the pond, because I think the fish will eat the seeds. "
550,How long does it take for mint sprouts to grow true leaves?,"I have planted some mint seeds in a couple of pots and fortunately they germinated within a reasonable length of time (4 or 5 days, if I remember correctly). But the sprouts are somehow slow to grow: it is a week now but they seem to grow very slowly. I wonder if that is natural for the mint?   I have used good quality soil - at least I was told so - and water the small pots every day. And I have put the pots behind the window on a table.  Here's a photo:   Any suggestions for their faster growth?  Thanks "
551,What are these viny plants? Are they poisonous?,"These plants are located alongside a fence in my backyard. What are they?     My biggest concern is that they might be poison ivy. However, the plant in the first picture closely resembles a vine that is growing in our front yard and has several single-leaf offshoots. That suggests it is not poison ivy, as I've read that poison ivy always has its leaves in groups of 3.  The first picture looks similar to the second, but I can't tell what it is -- perhaps a juvenile plant of the same species as #2, or perhaps poison ivy.  Does anyone have an idea of what it is? I get a severe reaction if I touch poison ivy, so I'd prefer to err on the side of caution. But the previous owner of this house was a botanist, so we have lots of unusual plants.  "
552,Best way to grow and tend to Cucumber plants,"I have a few cucumber plants growing in my raised bed.  Instead of training them and providing a vertical trellis, I am allowing the cucumber to grow horizontally in the soil.  Is that a fine approach or not recommended?  If that is a fine approach, do I protect the cucumbers that are lying in the soil by putting some mulch or other material so it does not touch the soil?  This is all organic gardening so no chemicals in the soil. "
553,How do I know if a fertilizer treatment is burning my trees?,"I started using fertilizer spikes on my dwarfed citrus trees in small pots.  (Details may be found in this question.)  As suggested, I used half a spike for each pot and I put the spike as far from any roots as possible.  My understanding is that the risk I'm taking is that the fertilizer will burn the roots of these trees.  But I don't know what to look for.  Should I check the color of the leaves?  What color would I expect from fertilizer burn?  How long might it take to see symptoms? "
554,What plant does this seed pod shaped like a bulb with tendrils come from?,What is this plant or flower? Does anyone know what sort of seed/bud this is? I have not seen it before and it's not ringing any bells.   
555,What are these marks on pepper leaves?,"My wife and I have noticed this on some leaves. Her plants had ~30 leaves like this, and mine had one that showed up yesterday (I think I'm gonna clip that leaf just in case).      These pictures above are all from her plant. The marks on my leaf (which I can get a pic of later) looked like the the same pattern of a caterpillar eating it. I know it's not, but is it maybe a venom or infection from an insect? Or more likely bacterial/fungal/viral or nutrient related (deficiency/over-surplus)?   If these are ""leaf miners,"" how do we go about getting rid of them and preventing them further? Neem Oil?  Both plants are peppers on a balcony in  Southern California. Wife's plant is a Pequin variety and mine is a Trinidad Scorpion.  What other data would be helpful? "
556,Can I safely remove glued gravel on top of my bonsai plant's soil?,"My friend has a bonsai plant that they won at a door prize and it is in a container where it came in and all the little pebbles are glued together. Is there a way to unglue the pebbles? Or if I were to take it out and break away the little pebbles, would the plant be fine or go into shock? I want to know because one day it is going to need the roots taken care of. "
557,How do I plant potatoes that sprouted in my pantry?,"I'm gearing up to plant some red potatoes from the grocery store that sprouted in the pantry. When I plant them do I plant them stem-side-up? And, should I plant them shallow so the stems poke out of the soil?  And last, would this be considered planting or transplanting? "
558,How badly does Goji berry spread?,I've read here that goji berry spreads.  How badly does it spread?  Should I worry about it spreading? 
559,Can you cut and transplant clippings of Autumn Joy Sedum?,"I have a very nice mixed pot with Autumn Joy Stonecrop (Sedum) and some unknown red beachy looking grass (possibly red fountain grass). It's all been doing really well on my ""full sun"" porch but we've had heavy rains 4 different days of this past week while I was out of town. It appeared to be in perfect condition until my dog brushed up against the Sedum and I realized, that  a large stem of this usually sturdy plant knocked over... Could it have uprooted? No- the bottom of it is soaked and some of the leaves have turned to mush. I inspected the rest, which seems to be fine, but this strand, like most of it has at large clump of buds on top that should bloom over the next few weeks.  Like other sedums, am I able to clip off the bottom that's basically rotting, give it time to callus and transplant the stems elsewhere? I've done this with Sedum refexum and coral carpet, but they weren't upright sedums, so I am unsure... And everything I've read about transplanting the Autumn Joy talks about gently moving the entire root structure. Does this mean I have lost this entire bit, it is there still hope? If I cannot clip it, is there something I can do? Is it possible to submerge the bottom bit that's damaged with sand or something else to soak up the moisture?   If it will help, I will edit this post with pictures in the morning, when I have proper light.       "
560,How to tie tree trunk and branches for support,"EDIT: 2017/09/09 In the end I trimmed pretty aggressively and I don't think any support will be necessary. The walkway is no longer obstructed. I hope I wasn't too aggressive. Thanks to both Bamboo and olantigh for the advice!    ==========  Original post:  How can I tie a tree without harming it?  I have a juniper/cedar tree with several trunks/branches that are diverging now that the tree has gotten taller and heavier. The result is it sprawls out a lot, taking up space, especially when laden with snow.   I'd like to tie the main branches more tightly together to reduce the sprawl and give support. However, I've read that using rope can choke the tree and cut its ""circulation."" I suppose any answer will require spreading the force over an area, but what material and method should be used?  Pictures available at: [website]Front view showing tree encroaching on walkway.   Side view showing sprawl, which gets worse when laden with snow.   Trunks/branches that might be braced together to reduce sprawl and give support.   For tree identification. Notice needles in lower right of image, and smoother young stems in upper left.  "
561,Why hasn't my strawberry plant produced any fruit?,"I have a plant I bought that was started from Home Depot. Unfortunately it hasn't grown any fruit, even after a whole year.  Around May this year (my second year), it produced two small flowers and it grew another runner and a child plant but still no fruit.   What are some things that I can do to have it start growing fruit?   Where is it planted?  It sits on our balcony outside where it gets a lot of indirect light from the hot north Texas sun. It's in a 12 or 14 inch round plastic pot. It's about 10"" deep. Since it's really hot during the summer we've had to water the plant two times a day to avoid drying out.  "
562,How much water does a grape vine need?,I have a grape vine in southern California (only rains in winter).  How much water does it need?  I have seen advice ranging from nothing to several gallons a day. Does anyone have any concrete numbers? 
563,Why are the leaves on my money tree droopy?,The leaves on my money tree (pachira aquatica) are green and droopy. I do not water it often. I don't have it indirect sunlight. Is it not getting enough light?   Also if i wanted to repot what brand of soil mix should i get? 
564,Why is my flowering crab stunted?,"I have two flowering crab apples planted 2 yrs ago beside each other (20 ft apart). When they went in they were identical. However for two years the one has flourished and the other is anemic, such that one has a 2.5 inch dia trunk and the other one has a 2.25 inch trunk. The most striking difference is the leaf size: the healthy one has many leaves 2 inches long and the anemic one has only a half the number of leaves about 1 inch long.   Is this a serious problem?  Should I just wait for the weak tree to pull out of it?  Any suggestions for the weak tree? "
565,What's a hardy plum tree for prunes?,"I'd like to plant a plum tree (or two, if I need to have two varieties for pollination).  The goal would be to have some fruit for fresh eating, but there's only so many plums you can eat when they're in season. So I'd like to dry them so I can have some home-grown fruit out of season. I've read that there are varieties that are better for prunes (higher sugar content?) but nobody ever gives specific variety recommendations.  It gets cold here (Zone 5b, -10°F winters with lots of snow are typical), so it has to be hardy.  My questions:   What are good plum varieties for making prunes that are also hardy to -10°F? Where can I find a reputable supplier? Will my ""prune tree"" need a buddy for pollination?  "
566,Could rain barrels be considered suitable substitutes for rain gardens?,"My county requires rainwater management to be incorporated into lot plans for new construction if a certain percentage of the lot is impervious. This seems a sensible measure.  We are under the impression that rain gardens are the only approved method for managing runoff (if a percolation study determines that the site's soil can support one). Rain gardens benefit the community by reducing erosion and filtering pollutants.  It seems to me that rain barrels can achieve the same benefits. The only significant differences between the mechanisms that I can think of are    the storage capacity and  retention time.    Rain gardens ""store"" water temporarily and have a much higher capacity; rain barrels store only about 55 gallons but can hold that water indefinitely.  Because I'm an avid gardener, I'd much rather have rainwater available for watering my garden and reduce my reliance on municipal water. There is also some concern that rain garden performance degrades over time unless well-maintained. I don't think there's a similar risk to rain barrels, but if there were I imagine it'd be much easier to rectify a failing rain barrel than a failing rain garden.  Can rain barrels be considered to be suitable substitutes for rain gardens? Why or why not? Under what conditions? "
567,Why is my phalaenopsis' keiki (orchid) not thriving?,"About five years ago, I bought a fully grown and blooming Phalaenopsis orchid. After a month or so, the blooms fell off as expected. I continued to care for it as directed, but it never flowered again.  Instead, it produced four keiki, which I carefully transplanted into their own bowls with moss. None of them ever grew leaves larger than about 3.5 inches. Four of the keiki and the mother plant eventually died after about three years.   I have just one of the keiki left, and although it seems healthy, it has not grown much. It has three healthy, green leaves, none larger than 3.5 inches. I fertilize it about once a month, change its moss when the moss gets green, and keep it in a constant temperature with some sunlight throughout the day. I've starting watering it with ice cubes to see if that makes a difference, but it hasn't.  How can I get this last survivor to thrive? After five years, shouldn't it have at least grown to a full size? "
568,Importance of night in hydroponics?,"So I've been experimenting for the last few months with hydroponics, the general goal is to have an entirely automated system. For the most part I have this in place but I'm not too happy with the results and I'm trying to eliminate potential cause for not great growth.  So I'm in Ireland, and during the summer we only really get about 6 hours of darkness at night time, and during this time, both a bit before and after, my grow light is on. Essentially my plants are getting light 24 hours a day. Now things are growing, but not as fast as they should. I have done research on nutrients and I'm monitoring on that side, but I'm wondering if perhaps the plants need a nighttime cycle? Am I over doing it by the plants essentially getting 24 hours of light everyday? "
569,"What is this vine (with purple flowers), and can I transplant/spread it?","Can anyone help identify this climbing vine with purple flowers in our backyard? It was there when we moved in, and started blooming when it got nice out (and we gave it a little water).  Someone said it might be a Rose of Sharon, but I looked at some pictures and I'm not convinced.  We love the look of it, and would like to get a matching one for the other side of the trellis, or maybe get a cutting to grow it elsewhere too. Is this a good idea?    Here is a close-up shot of a flower:   "
570,Why does sedum turn red? Should I do something about it?,"I have a green roof covered with sedum plants and I noticed that in the late spring and summer many sedum plants turn red. The same plants placed in our garden (in the shade) stay green all summer. I suspect the cause of the sedum turning red is either a lack of nutrition (fertilizer?) or water.   The red sedum does survive but I'm worried that it may cause problems in the long run. Can sedum turning red every summer become a problem, and if so what can I do about it? "
571,How are peppers and mulch used in a desert environment?,"I have a couple of pepper plants that I've recently procured.  Since I do not want these to go the way every other plant that has been gifted to me (i.e. death), I transplanted them into some large planters and used ""moisture-control"" potting soil, and applied a 3"" layer of mulch to the surface. Being that I live on the surface of the sun (Phoenix, AZ), I've had to rescue my poor peppers from the sun a couple of times, despite advice that peppers love the sun.  The planters were getting too hot, the moisture seemed fine, and the planters were in shade most of the time, but I could see visible signs of stress on the plants. I had to water them to cool the soil.  So what I'm asking is:   Should I remove some of the mulch to allow the soil to dry (recommended by people for peppers)? Should I put them in an even more shaded area? Should I be concerned about plant diseases germinating in such a hot and humid environment?  "
572,Is it too late for row cover to help with insects?,"Last year I used row covers on PVC frames to effectively keep cabbage worms off my broccoli and cabbage. I put the covers on in spring as soon as I put the seedlings in the ground, and then took them off when the plants were larger. There were some worms in the broccoli when I harvested, but they don't do much damage and come out of the heads with a good soaking when brought inside.  This year I didn't put the covers on early like I should have, and I'm wondering: is worth my time to put covers over more mature plants that already have cabbage worms? Will I just be ""locking the bad bugs in""? What if I first spray with Bt, which seems to have been effective at controlling them so far, and then cover? "
573,How can I connect a hose to this tap adapter?,I run a hose from my house and have one of these taps.    Is there a connector I can get to connect to the source part of the tap? It's really hard to search for as I can only find tap to hose connectors and not hose to tap fittings. 
574,Should I replant same year onion sets?,"In the early Spring, I planted a bunch of these seeds. I just threw them out there and they grew very close together. I picked them last night after most of the bulbs were exposed   I was just going to go ahead and replant them, but in the answer to this question, it is stated that      Onion sets are the bulbs from onions that were planted the year before   So should I wait until next Spring to plant them? If so, how should I keep them?   "
575,"Chinese Elm Bonsai lost leaves apart from a few, tried everything","I have a Chinese elm that came in at spring time and placed it in the same location as the other Chinese Elms that came in on the same order.  This tree had lush growth on it and after a week or two the leaves started to curl up and turn brown / yellow until they fell off.  I have done the following and now struggling to understand the issue.   I placed it in a 5 litter pot with well drained soil. Allowing the soil become almost dry between watering. Treated the tree for fungi infections. Checked roots for rotting Checked for pests and insects Tested the soils PH Levels No fertiliser has been used   Contacted the supplier asking for information on where it was kept ie. temperature amount of sun and matched it.   Any chance during transit this tree got its dates wrong and think its winter?    I am not new to bonsai, I just think I might have missed something and if this tree dies least this question might help someone else.  Update  A few weeks ago we placed a few weeping willow cuttings around the tree as they give rooting hormone into the soil, just encase there was unseen root damage. This morning when i went to take a photo for this question i noticed a green bud...   "
576,How can I speed up germination of habanero chili pepper?,I planted some habanero seeds a week ago. Most of the websites said it need 2 weeks to 3 weeks to germinate. What is the best condition for its germination?  I am in Hong Kong and having a 29 degree Celsius temperature on average. How much water does it need? Water once a day or twice a day? 
577,Do I need to manage my tomato cage?,"We have a potted (Roma) tomato plant which is coming along nicely. People told us to get a tomato cage, so I did and set it up. Do I then need to manage how the plant grows into and around the cage? Or do I just let it grow on its own once the cage is in place? "
578,Are stinging nettles commonly used for security?,Stinging nettles are known to be a common annoyance. Are there any examples of nettles being used to deter intruders in combination with other methods of physical security (perimeter fences)  Also are they practical considering the speed at which they grow?  How do nettles compare with thorny bushes? 
579,What can I do for my burned almond tree?,"My husband and father-in-law planted an almond tree 2 years ago. It is about 9 feet tall and was growing really well and was healthy. Lately it has been covered in beetles and the leaves have been getting chewed on. I am not a gardener by any means but I told my husband I used Dawn dish soap water mix on a rise plant I had, and it kept the bugs away and grew really nicely, so he tried it.   The very next day, all the leaves were wilted and turning brown. Did my not so expert advice kill the tree, and is there anything that will help revive it? I Googled the mixture and it says that hot and sunny weather can overheat the soap and burn the tree. This has been the case in Wisconsin since he sprayed it.   My father-in-law was pretty partial to this beloved tree! Can you please help me decide what to do next?  "
580,What are the disadvantages of having creepers or normal plants indoors?,"I never had indoor plants before. Are there disadvantages to having indoor plants in a dusty environment?  If the plant is a creeper, is there a way that I can clean its leaves? Probably by spraying water on the whole plant, but that might spoil the walls!   Whenever we have to put water in the flowerpots are we supposed to take it out of house every time? "
581,Prickly Pear Cactus is growing what looks like rot (need help),Prickly Pear Cactus is growing what looks like rot (shown in the attached pictures) where it's getting a yellowish color in the place these things appear.

Is it a weed? Getting quite a few growing around my garden and not sure whether to pull them out or not.    Thanks! 
583,How to deal with suckers on a Bradford Pear Tree?,"I have two Bradford Pear Trees at the front of my yard.  They were planted ~1997.  (The HOA requires all lots in the development to have them.)  Little sprouts that keep popping up from the ground around the trees.  Both trees do it, but one tree does it much more than the other one.  They appear to be sprouting from the roots of the tree itself.  They have leaves that do not match the tree at all.  Almost looks like a different plant, but they are absolutely growing from the tree itself (I dig into the soil to check).  I heave read online that these sprouts are called ""suckers"", and are a common problem with Bradford Pear trees, due to the shallow root system.  If left unchecked, the suckers will grow a few feet high and turn into bushes unto themselves.  So, I have been periodicaly cutting them down.  Currently they are low enough that the lawn mower keeps them in check.  Is simply cutting off the suckers the best way to deal with them?  Is there a good way to keep them from sprouting in the first place? "
584,Can I build a raised bed from cinder blocks without using mortar?,"I have a cement platform edged by wood next to the wall of my home (? purpose). I would like to create a raised bed to grow vegetables there by using cinder blocks (6x8x16) on the 27x60 in. platform. I will line it with 2 layers of landscape fabric to keep the dirt in, but I do not want to have to use any mortar. It is only going to be 2 levels of cinder blocks. Will this be structurally sound without joining the blocks with mortar? Because the platform is cement I can not drive stakes into the ground for added stability. "
585,Will over spray from Ortho Weed-B-Gon Max kill my flowers?,"I was spraying some Ortho Weed-B-Gon Max  on my lawn, and some of the mist/over-spray got in and around my flower bed (on flowers).    Are my flowers doomed, or is there still hope that they will live on?  "

If it is possible, what kind of store cupboard herbs spices can I use?  "
588,Should I remove the small leaves growing out of the bottom of my pepper plants?,"My peppers plants are doing well (I hope...), but while looking closely at them today (I was looking at the flowers (or fruit?) poking through at the base of the leaf stems), and I've now really noticed that near the base of each of the plants are two really small leaves, branching out like a centimetre above the soil line.   Generally they seem healthy, so I've been ignoring them, but they're obviously tiny in comparison to the rest of the plant, and I've now noticed that these still have little buds forming at the base of their stems.  Should I remove these tiny leaves? Ignore them? Or what?  Because it will be much more effective than any explanation I can form, here's a photo of one of the plants, with the leaves at the base highlighted:    And here are the leaves up close:   "
589,Is it okay to pile compost on to the base of a tomato plant?,"In previous years, I've noticed my tomatoes have root-like buds towards the base of the stem, but haven't wanted to experiment in case I wreck them.  Anybody had any experience of this? Is it worth it? "

591,Indoor Peace Lily soil suddenly covered in white spots,"My 3 year old peace lily has been in this clear pot for almost a year and within the last few weeks these spots began appearing near the roots and now cover the soil on the top layer. The spots are in clusters and are greenish-white.  The peace lily blooms regularly and seems to be fine in terms of its leaves.  I took it outside for the first time since I repotted it a few weeks ago, around the time this started happening. I live in Brooklyn, could it be something in the air?  Can anyone identify what's causing this and how bad it may be?   "
592,Office plant identification and care - my 2nd plant,"Since my previous question about the plant at my office is so well received, I thought it would be nice to get some information about another plant at my office.  A picture of my plant can be seen below.  So, by that, I have the same questions from my previous:   What's the name of this plant?  What is the best way to take care of this plant?    "
593,Desalinating plants (the botanical kind) which create fresh water,"Are there any plant architectures or permaculture schemes which can filter seawater and create fresh water?    I imagine a saline pond or bore, flowing down through a series of ponds to a lower freshwater pond.  Which plants would be best suited for this type of application?  I'd love some links or further information, but ""desalination plants"" brings up the wrong results on Google.  "
594,How long can rain water be stored in tanks?,I plan to collect rainfall (this autumn or next spring) from roof into plastic tanks (1 m3 capacity) and use collected water later for watering vegetables.     My question is for how long can rain water be stored in such tanks? Will it be safe for watering purposes after 3 or more months? What can be done to keep collected water good for extended period of time? 
595,What should I do with unharvested berries on my loganberry plant?,"I've inherited a loganberry bush, and failed to harvest a crop of berries before they shriveled up.  What should I do now? Is there any benefit in picking them anyway? Would that encourage a new crop? Or should I just leave them for the birds? "
596,Interestingly deformed protea flower,"I have a protea growing in my garden. It has many young flowers on it at the moment (September 2018, early spring in Melbourne). One of the flowers is deformed, growing in an interesting almost fractal shape. Is this sort of deformity common? What causes it?  I have included a picture of a normal flower from the same plant below.     "
597,What's the best way to thin delicate seedlings?,"When thinning seedlings (salads, beetroots, spinach etc) I will normally pull out the entire plant (root included) of the discarded seedlings. Like it's a weed.   Where my seedlings are densely packed this is nearly impossible to do without disturbing and possibly damaging the remaining ""good"" seedling.  So is it sufficient to just pinch out the discarded seedlings and leave the root system in there? That way I've given the remaining seedlings the space they need above ground. But presumably they also need the room underground too? Will the left over roots make way and/or die off fast enough?  So is decapitation a valid thinning strategy? "
598,Orange spots on Polypodium,"A few months ago I asked a what kind of plant my office plant is and how to take care of it. I got a clear answer on that recently, but I just discovered orange spots on some of the leaves (NOT ALL!).  I've made 2 photos to give you a clearer idea of what I mean.  Does someone know what those spots are (and if they are dangerous or something)? And does it need some kind of a cure?     "
599,"What is this weed, found in UK, with serrated leaves and small green flowers?",It's growing everywhere in my garden and it pops up faster than I can pick it.  I'm told it could be dog's mercury or gallant soldier. I'm not sure it looks the same as those.  What species could it be?   
600,Should I trim my conifer hedge with shears or an electric trimmer?,"Are there reasons to select hedge shears vs electric trimmers when trimming a conifer hedge? I have about 30 meters to trim, and haven't purchased either of these yet. Which option would you choose for this situation?    "
601,Do pineapples grow more than a single fruit when grown from seeds?,"I read somewhere (here, actually, but it's in Hebrew) that when planted from seeds, the pineapple plant will produce fruit multiple times.  In the English appendix on page 71 it doesn't mention that seeds, but says:     The plant produces multiple crops. The first crop [i.e. the plant crop], is produced from the central stem. The second crop [i.e. the ratoon crop], is produced on shoots [or suckers] that rise from the side of the central stem. It is possible for the plant to produce multiple fruit [each fruit on it’s own shoot] during the ratoon crop, but in practice, only one shoot is left on the plant.   The third crop [i.e. the second ratoon] grows on a shoot that rises from the first shoot [that produces the first ratoon].   Is that factually accurate? Everything else I've read assumes it's common knowledge that pineapple plants only produce a single pineapple, and some shoots from which others can be grown, if the shoots are planted.  What's the reality? "
602,Which root edibles can be harvested in the following years after they are planted?,"I would like to plant some root edibles (is it correct to call these vegetables?) near my house which will either remain a viable food source for longer than a season, or propagate so that there will always be a viable source of food in the area.  I have read that yams grow fibrous after the first year and some onions don't last long in the wild.  Could you give me a list of plants that could fill this purpose?    I live in the south eastern united states, zone 7/8. "
603,Pruning an Avocado Plant/Tree,"I live in western Arkansas / eastern Oklahoma. There are generally mild winters with snow and hot, humid summers where the temperature is often over 90 °F  For the past year I have been growing an Avocado that I started from a seed. About 6 months ago the original stem lost its leaves and turned brown, but it is still there in the pot. Right after this happened another ""plant"" started growing in the same pot. Since we moved a couple of months ago, I moved the entire contents of the pot to a much larger 20"" pot and kept it outside for the summer. I've already looked at many of the other posts about avocados but none of them look like what is now growing in my pot.  Link to pictures  My questions are:   Is this plant still an Avocado or is it something totally different? Do I need to prune it back or should I continue to let it grow?  "
604,What is causing my Gladiolus blooms to open withered?,My glads are blooming but the majority of the flowers are opening withered like they are already fading. They are wrinkled with grayish discoloring. The blooms pictured below are newly opened or opening.  Click photo for full size    What disease is causing this? How can I prevent it in the future? Since I live in USDA zone 4 I dig up glads. Are these corms worth saving for next year?  
605,How can I tell when a cutting has developed roots?,"Is there any way to tell if a cutting has put down roots?  I've had cuttings with healthy-looking green leaves that just never create roots (despite using root powder).  I'd like to discard cuttings that don't root, but I also don't want to break off young roots by tugging on the stems.  Is there any trick for this that won't injure the plant? "
606,How should I move a plant indoors without bringing in bugs?,"I live in a mild climate area and occasionally move indoor plants outside or vice versa.  One succulent I brought into my office seems to have a colony of some kind of tiny flies in it. I've been waiting a few weeks hoping they will die out, but they're still climbing all over it. Oh well.  Another potted plant I intend to bring inside has numerous spiders living and hunting in it. In the garden this is fine but I don't want them in the office.  What steps can I take to get harmless but bothersome insects and spiders off a plant before it comes indoors? Will an application of neem oil work? "
607,How should I trim back a neighbor's Japanese red maple bush?,"My neighbor's Japanese red maple bush (tree) is hanging over my yard line and I'm planning on putting a fence up soon. I have to trim it back and here in Pennsylvania it is my legal right to do so, but I don't want to kill or harm the tree. I have to put the fence up soon because I have two large dogs and I don't want them following my kids out the front door and wandering off.   What is the best way to do this? Do I paint where I cut it back or let it go?  "
608,Which of these Air & Pollution cleaning plants best fit a window/ balcony in Mumbai Weather?," Most of the previous threads around such plants are centered/ biased around western nations, so finding ones that fit this Asian/ Indian city is different and key.

609,Bonsai losing leaves,"I'm a bonsai beginner; I purchased a 15-year-old tea tree 2 weeks ago. It began losing a few leaves each day since. I keep it by a window and keep the soil damp. Today I turned it 180 degrees and noticed the window-facing side looked much healthier. Small white flowers have been blossoming over the last 5 days.  Any explanation as to why the leaves are dropping off and is this natural or is the tree looking not-too-healthy?  I just read [website]Thanks.  Edit: I'm in Billings, MT. Temperatures have been 55-95 this summer.    "
610,When to trim ivy-full hedge to avoid bees and wasps,"It's early October in the UK, and my mixed garden hedge (some box, some hawthorn, lots of accidental ivy) needs the top trimming off. Unfortunately for some reason this year the ivy is attracting a lot of bees and wasps (yes, it definitely is both).  While I'm happy the bees are there, I'd really like to trim the hedge without accidentally hurting them, or angering the wasps and getting stung. If I wait a few weeks will they go away? Or is there any other trick or time of day, or something? "
611,What bugs are these that are infesting my pieris and what do I do about it?,"These bugs are all over my Pieris. What are they? The plant is close to my house. Can they cause damage to the house or the plant? I don't see them on my other plants, but all three pierises are covered with them.    "
612,Can I use ladybug larvae to get rid of aphids?,"I have basil on my balcony, which I eat. However, lately the leafs have white dots or lines on them. After inspection I found out that it is caused by Aphids. Just the normal light green type.  I don't want to spray my basil with chemicals (not even soap), because I like to eat it. So I was thinking of buying larvae from ladybugs (Adalia Bipunctata). Does anyone knows if this works? Does anyone has experience with this approach?  My situation is a balcony of 1 x 6 m with many plants (palms, bonsai trees, other plants), on the first floor facing East, in the Netherlands. "
613,Vanderwolf pine root rot,"I have a Vanderwolf pine tree, Pinus flexilus 'Vanderwolfs'. About a couple of weeks ago some of the needles started turning brown. Didn't pay too much attention, but then I noticed it was getting worse. Most of the needles are brown but still attached. They don't fall off when slightly pulled on.    I looked up the symptoms and the best issue I could come up with was root rot.   I'd like to know, based on my above description, is this a root rot? If so, how can I treat it? "
614,Toro lawnmower won't start,"I have a Toro push lawnmower with a ""Ready Start"" engine (similar to this one); I just pull the cord and it starts.  I was halfway through mowing the lawn when suddenly a ton of white smoke came billowing out of it. I read that this could be due to the air filter being clogged, so I cleaned it out as best I could. Now, the mower won't start at all, no matter how many times I try.  It has oil, it has gas, the air filter is now cleaned (or at least, cleaner than it was)...what could the issue be? I've had the mower for three years and this is the first time I've ever had it not start.    UPDATE: I tried it again later and got it to start. But here's what it does: it'll run for about 5 to 10 minutes with no problem, and then a ton of white smoke will start coming out of it again. If I turn it off, wait a minute, and start it back up, the smoke will clear up. Then it'll run for another 5 to 10 minutes before doing the same thing again.  From the comments here, it sounds like oil is getting in, but why would it happen on and off like that?  Regardless, I think I'll take it in for servicing since it probably needed it at this point anyway. "
615,How can I help a rhododendron with yellowing leaves and a dead section?,"I have a rhododendron which was healthy last year, and produced gorgeous white flowers.     Today I noticed that many of the leaves are turning yellow, and a section appears to have died.       There's plenty of new green growth, so perhaps it's just a natural part of its lifecycle.     A large rhododendron a few feet away looks quite healthy, though, so I fear that's not the case.    I see tearing along the edges of some of the leaves, causing me to wonder if it has some sort of infestation, however, I examined it closely and didn't see anything. We've cared for it pretty much within the parameters of this answer.  Note that our winter has been unusually harsh. We've had long cold spells, and a lot of moisture, mostly in the form of snow, which only melted a few weeks ago.   What's wrong with my rhododendron? How should I proceed in order to help it thrive?   Update- My bush has been diagnosed with an infestation of Black Vine Weevil. See answer below for information.  "
616,Jabily/elephant tree (Operculicarya decaryi) bonsai,"I have an Operculicarya decaryi. I got it about half a foot long, and now it has grown quite a bit.  It seems reasonably healthy and not in danger of dying, though I don't know much about these trees and can't say if this counts as prime health. It is about 2.5 ft long and 1.5 ft high. I like the plant but I'd like to improve its appearance. My issues are:   Branches are too long and wild, looks like a bramble and not a tree. Leaves are too spaced out, looks ""unhealthy"" like a desert tree in a barren environment, not like a thriving plant pampered with active care. Trunk (as well as branches) curving in strange spiral way, makes the tree look crooked and unstable. The bulb looks too small.   I'd like to make it more compact and bushy by trimming and pruning. Ideally I'd like a lush, bushy, nicely rounded appearance like these:   [website][website]Although alternatively, a more ""stylized"" look like these would also be fine (if it is easier):   [website][website][website][website]I have no bonsai experience - I realize that the pictures I posted are probably the result of years of work and extensive skill. However, even small improvement would satisfy me. In particular, I would really like to improve leaf density (if even a little) and make the leaves more evenly distributed with less long, naked branches everywhere.  Are there any simple principles I can follow when pruning to slowly move in the direction of my goal? How frequently should I prune? Should I start cutting only the tips of undesired branches and slowly work my way in, or just cut the branch at the trunk? How do I encourage leaf growth in the middle of a long, bare branch? How do I avoid pruning too much and stressing the plant? Should I plant in a bigger pot to encourage more robust leaf growth?  EDIT: After looking at this question about bonsai styles, I think I probably want either a moyogi or chokkan (whichever is easier), hokidachi or kabudachi style. I definitely don't want any slant, windswept or cascade appearance, and more complicated styles like incorporating rocks or sharimiki would probably be beyond my ability. "
617,Organic Gardening: Best Practices,"So this is a kind of open-ended question, if it's too broad I'll try to be more specific, or remove the post.   Do any of you have good resources for information on organically growing peppers? Do you have any pro tips that you've experienced yourselves? Do you have experiences growing in climates like Los Angeles? Why are some things to consider as Best Practice with regard to growing food plans, while keeping them healthy (i.e. organic).   Basically, I have a mild amount of experience growing plants, but mostly flowers and such - not edible plants. I did do a small amount of farming, but that was up in central Oregon, and all you basically have to do is plant the seed and water occasionally (and put a lot of effort to keep deer away).  Now, my wife and I are trying to grow some of our own peppers and herbs for cooking. Since we have an apartment, that means potted plants only ( 😢). It's very different than my other experience growing anything.   Anyway, all that said, our primary challenge now is dealing with pests and fungi/illnesses as they show up. Some isn't bad, but too much has resulted in 2-3 of my wife's plants dying. F we can put together a good enough collection of data, maybe we can make this into a wiki or something.  Thanks in advance for any contributions you all may have!! "
618,Rat proofing lawn in the city,"We live in the city and have a roughly 10' by 10' grass/dirt area. Rats are living/nesting in it and there are burrows everywhere. How can I redo the area in such a way that it's rat proof? I'm really trying to avoid cementing/paving it or filling it complete with stones/gravel.  Has anyone used [website]My other idea was to dig out about 18"" and dump about 12"" of stone and then put just 6"" or so of dirt on the top for the grass.  Or I could do a combo. Stone, then Xcluder Geo frabic and then dirt.  I'm looking for feedback on the above ideas and other ideas. Cost and time to implement are definitely a concern, but most importantly I want something that works well and permanently. I might do it myself, but am open to hiring someone if I can find the right company for the job.  Note that we're in the city, a restaurant is nearby, and there are neighbors with rat problems too. I know that I can't solve all these problems, but I think I can at least prevent them from living in our yard. We have two kids and I'd like them to be able to play out there safely (no fear of rats jumping out of the ground, which has happened to me multiple times when digging). "
619,How much of the peach pit must be broken for successful germination?,"I successfully removed 1/4 of the pit of a peach seed. About 1/2 a cm, what I was told is the root, grew out of it.  Is that 1/4 opening enough for the non-root part to grow out of it or should I take the risk of fully opening the pit?  In other words, can the non-root part grow out of the same 1/4 opening of the pit or can it only grow out of the other side, which is still covered by the very tough pit? "
620,"Growing ""Laurus nobilis"" in scandinavia","I planted a Bay laurel (Laurus nobilis) in my garden in Sweden (60°8'33.86""N, 16°9'46.62""E). I am aware the climate here is not ideal for this tree, but I have hope it can adapt.    I planted in the summer of 2015 and this has happened since:  Summer 2015: Planted it from a small (baby tree). In the winter it dried out.  Summer 2016: It came up a new branch (I thought it had died!). The branch became around 60cm high, looking great. In the autumn a raindear ate its top leaves and in the winter it dried again.  Summer 2017: 3 branches came up, I put a fence (like this one) around it quite high so no animals reach it.  Question:   How can I make the branches survive over winter? (In Sweden there is quite litle light during winter and temperatures can drop to -25oC)  I thought about covering the small tree during the winter, should I cover just from snow, or close it more hermetic? "
621,How should I remove long grasses/roots to prepare a fresh bed?,"I am currently attempting to remove a bunch of dead grass in a roughly 5'x5' plot. When the grass fully grows sometime in early-to-mid summer, they are like very small, long-grassed shrubs, sort of like this but smaller and closer to the ground. It basically covers the area in numerous bunches.   The area also has a lot of of weeds - some sort of thistle, I think - which I also would like to remove.  I tried doing it by hand but it took a lot of effort to remove the sod, particularly because the roots are thicker than the average lawn grass root and because they extend around 4""-6"" into the soil.  I was wondering what the best method would be to go about doing this. I was thinking about renting a soil tiller to rip up the roots, since I have another clear plot on which I plan on using. If I do it this way, should I remove all the weeds first before tilling or can I rake them out after the roots are pulled up? (The weeds have just emerged and will not go to seed soon.)  Additionally, if I should remove the roots by continuing to use a grub hoe, how can I loosen the sod of its soil so that only the roots remain? I'd like to leave as much matter in the area as possible. I also noticed the roots had nodules, which I assume are for nitrogen fixation. Is there any way to take advantage of that, perhaps leaving them in the dirt to decompose?  Or should I just smother the area with tarp/cardboard/newspaper/mulch and make a ""lasagna garden""?  Pictures for clarity: Section that I've already removed, with the suggested tool; removed sod; roots; close up of roots with nodules.    "
622,Can I propagate a hosta from a leaf?,"My friend wants some of my hostas. I have about ten varieties, and they've been growing pretty much wherever they want for many years. As you can see in the pictures, the locations and sizes rule out digging up as an option.   If I cut some leaves can she propagate them?  If so, where on the stem and how should I make the cut?  What method should she use for rooting and planting?   Does the timing matter? I'm in Massachusetts, and they're about midway through this year's growing cycle. They won't bloom until about two months from now.  Also, some are in the shade, others in the sun. Would it be correct to assume that she should place them in the same type of conditions in her yard?   Here are just a few! Click on them for larger size.       "
623,How can I discourage my chives from flowering?,"I have several chive plants in the garden. In the past, I've been able to use the chives before they started to bloom, but this year the plants are only 4inches tall and are already covered with buds. I grow them primarily as an herb, so the flowers are not a welcome sight. What can I do to discourage the plants from blooming so early in the future? I think a high nitrogen fertilizer might help, but are there other tricks I should know? "

625,How to cover a backyard with mulch?,"I would like to turn my small backyard (currently 200 sq ft occupied by dead grass, nearly to the point of dirt) into something similar to a dog run, where the ground is just covered in mulch and/or bark. I tested a small area with a couple bags of cypress mulch (which is about $2-3 each) and it seems to work well-- dogs don't get muddy, puddles don't form, and dog poop is easy to see and cleanup.  I have a few questions about how to proceed:   Do I need to remove my dead grass first? What do I need to consider in terms of drainage (mulch drains really well)? Do I need to layer with different sizes or types of mulch, and how thick should I make it?  "
626,What is light when it comes to plants?,"I often see and hear people saying ""this plant needs light"". What is light? Just sunlight(direct and indirect) or what else? My room doesn't get a bit of sunlight, direct or indirect, but there is light.   Can anyone help me with all this light requirement by plants?  EDIT:    Plant 1: Under indirect light?   Plant 2: Under direct or indirect light?  This is the actual confusion. Wouldn't it be weird to say that Plant 1 is under no light, Because there is light, and that's why we can see it, right? "
627,Why isn't my lemon tree bearing fruit?,"My lemon tree used to bear lemons, but since my brother pruned the branches, there are no lemons growing.   What did he do wrong? Did he cut too many branches, or is it something else? "
628,"Core aerate, top dress, and overseed in the fall","I'm trying to figure out the correct way to overseed this fall in MA. I want to do a few things in the process: core aerate, top dress, fertilize, lime, and overseed.  I normally mow my lawn at 3.5"" so am I supposed to cut it much lower? How low, 2.85"" (that's my next height down) or 2.25"" (that's the next one after)? Once I have the lawn mowed, then I was going to core aerate and top dress. Do I top dress with topsoil, loam, compost, or the loam/compost mix I see advertised often? I was planning to top dress me entire yard which is 9,000-10,000 sf. Is it uncommon to do the whole yard? At 0.25"" of top dressing that's about 8 yards which is a few hundred dollars.  Once I top dress, I assume I can then fertilize, lime, and overseed together and then get the lawn wet and keep it that way. I would then want to make sure it's always moist, so put my irrigation system on for a few minutes a few times a day to keep it moist, right?  When is the best time in the fall to do this? Early or mid September? Late September? "
629,Do all plants emit CO2 at night and day?,"Do all plants emit CO2 at night? I heard that plants do respiration all the time but in sunlight they utilises more CO2 and releases more oxygen. During day with sunlight: CO2>Oxygen. At night or plants that are in shade, they don't produce oxygen at all but produce CO2? Correct?  Also, If suppose a tree is getting light but only one part, What will be the consequence of this?   (I am okay if this question migrates to Biology if this is not suited here) "
630,How do I get rid of phragmites in my lawn?,"There are some wetlands in our subdivision which are overrun with phragmites. Some of these have established themselves in our neighbor's backyard and now they're spreading throughout our lawn.  I've tried pulling a couple of them out, but they have these hefty runners under the ground and pulling them out (when possible at all) totally rips up the lawn.  This is our backyard. You can see the phragmites peeking over the top of the fence and shooting up in our lawn.    Here is a closer view.    What is the best way to get rid of these? The only thing I can think of is to mow them down (again) and apply an herbicide (RoundUp? Rodeo?) directly to the stems with a sponge brush or dropper so I don't kill the grass, and possibly to try to put a barrier along the fence (which would probably involve trashing the lawn).  As an additional complication, our yard appears to be poorly graded, so that corner of the yard is constantly soggy, which I'm sure the reeds love.  Does anyone have suggestions? How can I get rid of these? "
631,Mulch that doesn't wash away,"I have mulch from last year that seems to wash a way a lot on my slight hill. There are other homes I've seen that have a similar slope but their mulch doesn't appear to wash away. The mulch I got was the Home Depot Earthgro brown mulch which is sort of larger in size. I have seen some mulches at landscape stores that are much more finely chopped. When I re-mulch in May 2018, Is it better to get more finely chopped mulch and pack it down and that may help with preventing it from washing away? "
632,Does it make sense to mix dead fig leaves in my soil?,"I garden in an ""arid desert"" zone, with almost no rain and little vegetation. We have a number of fig trees, which I recently cut back. I separated the leaves from the twigs.    I've read that desert soil generally tends to contain little organic matter (obviously) and tends to be on the alkaline side (I should do a pH test, I know!)  Under these circumstances, does it make sense for me to crumble the fig leaves after drying them a couple of days, and mix them in next time we start a bed? Would it be beneficial for the soil, and would the soil have to be permanently moist for it to have any effect?  "
633,What wild water plant is this? Is there a domesticated versions?,"I saw this plant in a swamp in central Maine, USA.  I think it is a type of wild hyacinth.  Are there domesticated versions? Anyone know how to grow one in a large planter pond?  The spear shaped leaves belong to the plant.   "
634,Separating plants with entwined roots,"Let's pretend that I, hypothetically, planted a couple of seedlings in a fairly small pot and waited too long with transplanting them to a larger one so that their roots were now completely entwined.  If I wanted to give each plant more room, would there be there a way to do so without killing them off? How careful would one have to be with the roots?  If the species matter for the discussion, let's say they were tomato plants. "
635,"What is this whispy grass stalk, a red base and thick woody roots, and how can i Genocide it?","This grass is slowly taking over my yard, and its highly irritating as it grows at 3-5 times the speed of the rest of the lawn. I'd dearly love to get rid of it, but broad leaf weed killer is not effective and pulling several hundred if not thousands of them is less than ideal. What is it, and can I kill it without killing the surrounding lawn? It has broad leaves that grow off a circular red stem with a red base. It also has a very thick root that I believe hosts several shoots. Most blades I pull pop off with a dozen or so short thin roots, but after I pulled a couple out that had much thicker woody-er roots I realized I wasn't going to do much good by pulling alone. What is this crap, and how can I get red of it?  An example of the plant...    And an example of the root   "
636,What is the difference between watering your plants early in the morning and late at night?,"I've heard that you shouldn't water mid day, but should you water more during the day, or night?  What is the rule of thumb on what part of the plant you want to affect more? "
637,Succulent Disease Identification (kalanchoe beharensis),"Album of pictures  Another album of updated pictures  One leaf before being ""washed"" with a mild soap/water mixture   Another leaf after being ""washed"" with a mild soap/water mixture   I purchased this plant a little over a month ago, and all of a sudden, these spots have begun to show up. The spots themselves are dry and can be popped out of the plant leaves where they've appeared (as a result, there is now a circular hole in one of my plant's leaves).  As the pictures indicate, the spots are roughly circular with black centers. Up until yesterday, the plant was kept in a mostly-shady, west-facing room and was watered ~1 time per week (when the soil was completely dry. Thinking the spots might be due to a lack of sun, I moved the plant over to a south-facing window (6+ hours of sun per day) yesterday.  Perhaps this is Cactus Anthracnose? If so, how do I treat it?  EDIT (More Information): As far as I can tell, the leaf edges are normal for this kind of plant (part of it's appeal imo). This plant lives indoors near a window, but not one that has been sprayed with anything recently. Additionally, none of the other plants in the vicinity have any issues. Two days ago, I wiped the leaves down with a mild soap/water mixture. I also treated one leaf with an alcohol/water mix, and another with a copper fungicide.  "
638,What should I do with hot pepper seedlings which are less than an inch apart?,"I am trying to grow hot peppers seedling in 16 oz cups.  I made the mistake (did I?) of putting 3-4 seedlings in each cup, mainly because I sprouted too many seeds.  In a few cups I have 2 seedlings growing about 1"" tall, in others I have 3.  My plan was to transplant these to larger pots once they grow a few inches.  What should I do about multiple seedlings spaced close together, as in less than an inch apart?  I am unsure if I should leave them alone or do something like cut the ones that are anything less than the tallest in each cup, which would mean that the tallest one survives and the rest decompose...  Separating the seedlings would lead to many more plants than I can probably afford in terms of space...  Any opinion would be appreciated!  Oh these are hot peppers: Thai dragon hybrid, Another Thai variation, habanero, and I think Guntur sannam chilies. "
639,Is rice water good for a hyacinth plant?,"I'm not sure I did the right thing to my hyacinth plant. It's growing in a pot with dirt brought from Whole Foods. I poured cool water that I'd used for rinsing rice on it, and the next day the flower was partially dead. I don't know if the flower is going through its cycle, or if the rice water is killing  it.   Can the water from rinsing the rice harm the hyacinth? Is there anything I can do to help it recover? "
640,"What's wrong with my ""sonic bloom"" weigela?","I have two ""sonic bloom"" weigela bushes. They were both purchased at the same time and planted at the same time. There is a rose bush in between them and they all receive lots of sunlight and equal water. I'm in zone 7A.  One has stopped growing and instead is sprouting a TON of small buds all clustered together.  The other weigela has become huge in a few short months and this one is half its size. The other one also has started to flower. But not this one. Could it just be nutrients ? How can I save it?    "
641,Broccoli seedlings are way too tall but thin and weak,"I just started sowing broccoli indoor this month and after a week or so, I saw this    They are almost 4 inches long but cannot stand straight. Did I not push the seeds in deep enough? Or is this kind of broccoli like that? I bought from a Chinese grocery store. They are so long and weak, some started to break now.  But they seem not ready to plant down the outside garden though, right?  UPDATE 1  According to the article, Leggy Broccoli Seedlings, looks like it's lack of light or too hot. I don't think it's lack of light because it's next to the window and it's sunny all day. The temperature is 70-85 range. So maybe it's too hot in the house? "
642,I think I planted seeds too deep in Jiffy7 peat pellets - How do I fix this?,"I planted a 72-spot tray with a variety of things, mostly herbs, some veggies. I've had only a handful of things germinate. About 10-12 of the peat pellets have sprouted. I'm concerned that I probably planted the seeds too deeply, so I'm wondering how I can fix this? The tray has been planted for about 2 weeks, perhaps a little more.  Is it likely that the ungerminated seeds are mouldy by this point? Should I leave them undisturbed in the environment they're in and keep hope that they'll pop up?   Environment: Basement, in my computer server room. Temperature: 81F (held constant by environmental control equipment) Relative humidity: 34% (but the plastic lid is on) Lighting: Four 32-watt T8 fluorescent bulbs hanging about 3"" over the tops of the seed trays.   Seeds planted:   Tomato Basil Kale Fennel Cucumber Artichoke Winter squash others   For comparison, here is a different seed tray with some different stuff planted, but the seeds are nowhere near as deep; they are almost sitting on the surface. This second seed tray is in the exact same environment, the only major difference is the planting depth. Both trays have a wide variety of stuff in them.

644,Are these 'fluffy' cacti healthy?,"My wife and I have had these cacti for a little over a year now. Since change happens slowly I assume we never really noticed, but now it seems like it has gotten a lot more..fluffy.. for lack of a better word. 'Very dense spikes' perhaps?   Either way, we know very little about cacti (which we should change) but I was wondering if these look 'healthy'. Yesterday we noticed that it seems we have a baby cactus. I'm also curious as to this one is healthy.   It seems like the baby one is trapped between larger cacti (growing close to the mother I assume). Should we repot this?  It's kind of two questions, but my main one would be wether or not they look healthy.       "
645,Tilling in oak stump grinding chips for new sod lawn,I have a fair amount of live oak chips/dirt from a stump I just ground. Is it a good idea to till these grind 'spoils' into the dirt of an area we plan on laying new sod into? Will the decomposition of the oak deplete the soil to the point that the sod struggles? Is the oak too acidic for sod? Should I incorporate top soil or another amendment as well? Thank You 
646,What is causing brown and yellow patches on the leaves of my bush beans?,"These bush green beans have been champs, continually producing even though they look like they should die (and it's mid-August in Zone 5, having had some massively warm spells).  However they have looked like this for a long time now, but they keep flowering and producing - we've gotten about 20 pounds of beans from ~20 linear feet of them.  Is this something that is common to beans? Or is this just them trying to die due to heat? I understand beans aren't exactly all-summer producers normally.   "

Does anybody know the radius from the tube that red wrigglers will travel and spread their castings? (I'm guessing that the real question that I'm trying to get an answer to is: ""Where does the worm tube need to be (proximity) for a fruit-tree to derive benefit from it?"") "
648,Can I Combine Pre-emergents,"Some pre-emergents are good for stopping things like crabgrass and annual rye-grass (e.g. Halts) while others are better/made for broad-leaf weeds like dandelion and clover (e.g. Gallery).  Question: can I combine two types of pre-emergents for a single application, assuming they are mixed in correct ratio for square foot coverage needed?  Or alternatively, can I apply one and then the second directly over the first? "
649,Did my Dogwood die because it was planted with wire around the roots?,"I hired a less than spectacular gardener to do a brand new landscaping job for my house after it was built about 3 years ago.  Since then almost half of the 30 some plants and trees he had put have died or are very unhealthy.  He has long been out of the picture.  Likewise, of the 10 plants that I had personally placed, only one had died.  I recently dug up two of his dead Dogwood trees and noticed that the root system seemed to be surrounded by rusted steel wire.  Is this normal to plant a dogwood with this surrounding the roots?  I can understand it being there to hold the roots and dirt in place over transport but shouldn't he have removed the wire before planting it?  Is this normal for a landscaper to do? "
650,Identify plant and things on it (Possible Scale),"I've looked at other questions and I'm quite sure the plant outside my house has a scale problem.  But I don't know much about gardening so I'd like some advice please.  I found these other questions with photos that look similar:   White stripy things on trunk are killing my plant What is this black spotted disease on my orange tree? Can anyone identify this abnormality that is on my dwarf citrus?   These are my main questions:   What is the plant? What are the things on it? Can you guess how long the plant might have been like this?   To be honest I've not really paid much attention to the plant, I rent the house so I only need to keep the garden generally maintained. I found another website that suggested if it's a type of scale they could increase over months.  Most of the branches I cut off were covered in them and I filled 2 average sized bin bags of cuttings.  After the first image the others of the plant are of parts I cut off.  It was only half way through trimming the plant back when I noticed the things on it.  The second image below show more of the white things.  The third image shows a bit more of a mix of black and white things.  The fourth image is one of the higher newer looking branches that doesn't look to have as much of the things on it.  The last image show my cutters, I noticed a yellow/orange looking substance on them.  Basically I'd decided the plant looked to need a bit of trimming, more so on the right where it was growing near the neighbors window.  I have one last question and feel free to tell me if I'm being daft.  Is there any chance whatever they are could cause irritation on human skin or anything else unwanted?  Would it be an issue to animals around the plant?  We have quite a few cats on this street that walk under the plant.       "
651,How to reseed grass after killing weeds?,"My lawn is overrun by clover and all sorts of weeds. I have lawn grass spots here and there, but the majority is weeds.   I was going to spray with ""Ortho Weed-B-Gon Max"", then spread some top soil and reseed, but I'm not sure if that's the right course of action.   The soil is kind of rocky and I suspect probably weak.  I'm located in Maryland, USA. The area is about 200 sq. ft. and I have no idea what kind of grass it is.   What would you recommend for weed control? Is Ortho OK, or should I get RoundUp, or something else? Do I spray only the weeds or the whole lawn? How long do I have to wait after I spray to reseed?  "
652,What kind of bug is this and is it harmful?,"My wife noticed this bug in our raised garden beds.  I know it's hard to see scale, but they were about the size of a very very small pebble, or a large grain of sand.  Is this bug a problem?  Any ideas what type of bug this is?  Thanks!   "
653,Will black knot fungus harbor in the roots of a recently cut down tree and infect another tree planted in its place?,"I purchased a house last November with a beautiful tree in the front yard. I don't know what breed it was, but I believe that it might have been a type of plum tree. (see photo at bottom)  Unfortunately, that tree turned out to be completely covered in black knot fungus (looked like poop turds hanging from branches). After consulting with a few people, it was decided that the tree had to come down, as the fungus was on all limbs.   The tree was fairly young (~10 yrs from what the neighbors tell me). I cut the tree down a few weeks ago and am now considering replanting another tree in its place.  Do I need to remove the roots completely, or should grinding the stump down, say 4"" down be ok?  Is the fungus something that could be still 'living' in the roots of the old tree, and could it possibly infect a new tree that I plant in the same place? If so, what can I do, short of trenching out all the old roots?   "
654,Deer trimmed my arborvitae for me!,"I bought a house in Hudson, NY in November. The previous owners had screened it from the trailer park next-door with a row of Arborvitae. They're maybe twelve feet tall, and they'd already suffered some deer damage the previous year. This winter, 2014-15, the deer simply turned the whole row into a salad bar.  I tried to fence, but they just laughed at my efforts.   The damage is pretty bad. Should I prune back to the growth line, if I can figure out where that is?  Could I just let the trees keep growing and plant something more deer resistant at the base?  Suggestions?  I'm 61 and haven't lived in the house since I was 18, so I'm really on new territory here. Any help will be greatly appreciated! "
655,Dead Dogwood post-mortem: How to ensure these next plants do better in clay,"This question is accompanied by this previous question...  Did my Dogwood die because it was planted with wire around the roots?  So clearly my two dead Dogwood trees didn't do so hot in clay.  The previous landscaper recommended them and planted them but just tossed a bunch of clay on top of the root ball and sent me the bill.  When I asked about why they quickly became so sickly he accused me of not watering them and refused to follow up on his guarantee to replace any dead plants in the first 2 years.  I watered them for hours everyday when it didn't rain and they were pretty sickly that first year regardless.  They never came back the next spring.  The previous answers to my question suggested that Dogwoods just don't do well in clay so I blame my landscaper for not knowing better when he was clearly aware of the clay situation.  I dug them out as well as about 10 other dead plants and shrubs he originally planted, and I wanted to put the following plants in their place.   Green seed rollouts of Lavender 2 Crepe Myrtle's A bunch of small flower plants that won't come back next year   Any advice to ensure the best success with these plants? "
656,Will a scion with removed leaves dry earlier than the one with leaves on?,I want to know which one of the two branches will dry earlier. The one with leaves or the other that has removed leaves? I want to transfer a bud for grafting from some distance and i want to keep the bud fresh. So is it better to remove the leaves from the scion or keep them? Will the leaves dry the scion earlier? 
657,Is mold/mildew in the stalks killing my lucky bamboo?,"I've got a lucky bamboo with two stalks. One stalk (right to the bottom and left at the top - blue turtle) looks green and healthy, but the most recent leaves started look yellow-ish. The other stalk (left to the bottom and top at the top - purple turtle) turned pale and after inspection I found the wounds. The bamboo doesn't smell bad but certainly looks harmed and weak. Is this some kind of mold/mildew on the stalks? What could I do to cure my plant?  Edit. To be more precise, I'm not worried about the yellow leaves. I'm afraid my plant is suffering from some kind of mold or mildew. Please see my last picture in detail and you'll find some similarities with this picture: the skin of the plant is getting hurt and some small black dots are growing over the scars. How can I cure this?         "
658,Pomegranate splitting: Why is it happenning and how to prevent this,"Why do my pomegranates keep splitting every year?   I have read some articles that they need even watering, with drip irrigation. Also too much nitrogen can cause the fruit to split. Does anyone have experience on this problem?         Edit:  We have to make more tags in this community like Natural-problems, plant-difficiencies, etc "
659,Aloe plant is browning and the leaves are thinning,"I have recently received a small Aloe plant that I wasn't able to identify past the genus. It does not look healthy, some leaves have become brownish, and their ends thin, as if squeezed out.  The plant is an offspring that has been separated and repotted in an IKEA substrate made of coir/coconut husk. This question describes the thinning and the answers identify a possible culprit in the soil, which I plan to substitute with the mix suggested in the accepted answer in this question.  What I wasn't able to find an answer to is the browning. It is likely that after repotting, the plant has received little to no sunlight for a month. Currently it receives a half day of sunlight (as much as Denmark can offer, anyway). Could the browning be related to sunlight deficiency(or excess)?   Another possibility I have considered is watering. I try to water according to the accepted answer here, but the soil type might be offsetting that. Should I adjust the watering to fit better with the temporary soil mix?  And finally—in case my assumptions are missing the mark—what other reasons there might be behind the browning and thinning of the leaves? Can I expect a recovery?     "
660,Wanting to plant shade plants? But where?,"My house is a north facing house.....however I feel like there isn't really an actual shady spot anywhere? Even the northside gets the morning sun for quite a bit of time.  I have a bleeding heart plant that is on the northside of the house that does well, but Im wanting to plant ferns and lungworts/astilbe and im not sure if it would be shady enough.  Is there anything I can do? My house is only a one story so it isn't particularly tall? I mean the north-side SHOULD be the ""shadiest"" part correct? "
661,What plants is this?,I recently got this plant and I looked up on internet but couldn't find one. I don't know anything about this plant and so my question. What plant is this? Corn Plant or Janet Craig or none?

663,storing my electric lawn mower over winter,"I live in southern NM where it is dry most of the time, for this winter I must store it outside. Is encasing it in plastic a good idea? Should I cut a slit to let out humidity or water condensation when needed? Or will it just sweat in the plastic and deteriorate? Thank you for any suggestions... "
664,Is this Trinette plant?,"I googled, and it looks exactly like a Trinette plant. Am I correct? or is it different?   "
665,Hot pepper hybrids: are the seeds of the same fruit the same?,"When chilies are cross pollinated amongst different cultivars, it's unclear whether the seeds will be true to the parent generations or something new entirely as I understand it as it depends on if the dominant or recessive genes were expressed.  Is it the case though that all seeds coming from the same pepper fruit exhibit the same characteristics?  Ie, are the seeds of that fruit copies of each other ignoring the possibilities of mutations? "
666,Will my squash ripen off the vine?,"I'm a first time gardener so I'm not sure how this works - I may have picked my squash too soon, I also think I may have mixed squash together which would have made a hybrid (from my understanding).    Will my squash ripen over time now that it's picked? I think it was suppose to be spaghetti squash. How do I know when it's time to pick? "
667,Are these insect eggs on the bonsai?,"We bought a bonsai tree in Houston, TX and we spotted something on the branches.  What is it? Should we remove them?    As suggested I've taken more pictures and investigated further.    I removed more:       I cut one open:    I decided to look at the contents with a small microscope:   Some of them move:      So what is the best way to kill any that might be left once I remove them? "
668,Are there specific lawnmower spark plugs?,"My mower needs a new spark plug. It won't start and the plug is covered in crud. It has been cleaned a couple of times before so I think I will just go for new.   The spark plug model needed is NGK BPR6E.   My question is whether there are different spark plugs for cars and mowers? Or whether I can buy any BPR6E and it'll do the job?  I raise the question because, for example, Halfords site lists the same model number in both auto and gardening sections, in different packaging, but specs seem the same.  "
669,"Is this ""Tall Grass"" dead? Should I clear it out to make room for new growth?","Not sure what this is called but for now I'm just calling it tall grass. I have a couple of things around my house. To me these grass stalks look dead from winter. Am I good clearing them off? I already cleared off one section will it regrow in the next month or so as spring hits hard?  Taking a look down at the bottom I see some fresh green coming up, but not much.  Thanks for the advice!       "
670,How do I revive a couple shocked trees?,"We've got a few 15 year old decorative broadleaf evergreens around our house as hedging. We're selling, and had to get the foundation fixed as part of the sale. While the foundation contractor was working, he uprooted two of the trees to gain access to the foundation, and replanted them when he was finished.   The trees are not dead (we cut some branches and they are still green around the edges) but all of the leaves have turned brown and died due to transplant shock. We pruned off the dead leaves and are hoping that it will bounce back in the next 3 weeks before closing.  We plan to water the crap out of it obviously, but is there a fertilizer or soil additive out there that we could use to help it along? We live in middle Tennessee if that helps.  If this doesn't do the trick, is there a cheap 7-8 foot broadleaf evergreen we can go out and buy that will make a suitable replacement to the untrained eye and is resistant to shock?  EDIT: Pictures of the healthy trees (looks like 2 species, maybe Cleyera, and some kind of Holly?):  "
671,Questions About a Sycamore Maple,I just bought a house that has a Sycamore maple in the backyard.  My questions are:   What is the life span for this particular type of tree? when is a good time of year to trim the branches and a good rule of thumb as to how much to trim? Is this tree known to invade water pipe and destroy plumbing? Is there a certain fertilizer I can use to strengthen my tree? The roots of the tree are coming up above ground.  Is it alright to cover them with a rich soil and possibly plant some type of vegetation around it? (my sister says it's not good for the tree)  
672,What is the heat tolerance of English Lavender?,"I live in India (Bombay). It is very hot here in summers. I wish to grow Lavender on my balcony, however I am not sure if it will survive the heat.   What is the heat tolerance level of English lavender? Are there chances for it to survive if I plant it during winters when it is pleasant (16 to 28 &deg;C)? "
673,Mowing 2+ acres of pasture,"So I just bought a tiny farm (2+ acres, mostly of pasture land). I rented a flail mower yesterday, but it took a good 7 hours of mowing to get 3/4 of the land done - and the thing bogged down probably 50 times.  So I'd like some advice. I need to keep this land somewhat maintained (probably mowing bi-weekly or a little less), as well as the area directly around the house well-maintained (weekly mowing). The 2 acres of pasture land is flat, but not smooth. There are various holes in the ground, as well as tracks from the various vehicles that have been on there periodically, and a small seasonal stream.  The land also has a couple of trees, but no small trees. The majority of the growing stuff is thistle and grass. There are little to no rocks on the land.  The land around the house which needs to be mowed weekly is perfectly flat and smooth, with no branches/rocks/other obstructions.  My question is: What type of mower should I buy to be cost efficient? Should I pick up a cheaper riding mower and just mow the entire property more regularly? A combination of heavy duty brush cutter and riding mower? Something else? "
674,Thickening trunks of bonsai,"I wish to thicken my trunks on a few ficus hawaii, ficus benjamina, maples and juniper trees in a shorter space of time. What species of bonsai and to what effect will vertical cuts thicken the trunk? Does wiring the trunk tight create a thicker trunk? Is it best to grow it in the ground instead?  What techniques can be used to thicken trunks without compromising the health of the tree? "
675,Do I need to wait a year before harvesting garlic?,"I'm confused about how to grow garlic. I'm planning to grow it from a clove.  After it grows, do I take the seed from the flower and plant it again, waiting for the second year to harvest the garlic?  Or can I harvest  it in the first year, straight from the clove which I've planted? "
676,Albino citrus seedling? and 1 year old grapefruit plant,"A few months ago, I tried to get some citrus seeds from flea market fruit to sprout, but they didn't so I just buried them inside the pot of my grapefruit plant. Last week, I noticed that there was a new plant growing from 1 of the seeds! But it was white? Any Idea if this is normal? I believe the seed might be from a Mandora citrus.  There is also another plant growing very close, when should I seperate them?  Also, here is a photograph of my 1 year old grapefruit plant in Toronto. Its been kept at the window since I planted it last July, mostly because I'm scared that a squirrel will dig up the plant, or insects will infest it.  Its been growing in spurts, last month over 2 weeks it grew 5 leaves, but then stopped growing. I also noticed that there was a growth on the top of the plant that appeared to be tiny leaves, but it dried up and fell off. Will this affect the plant later on?  Thank you for your time. "
677,How can I help my permaculture garden that's being overpowered by weeds?,"   My permaculture design garden is being taken over by horsetails and other common 'weeds'. I'm spending hours every day or two on weed control.  I believe they are choking my fruit trees and bushes, and would like a solution to lower my time commitment while addressing the 'weeds' for good.   Sheet mulching is the best solution I have found. Do you have any suggestions or advice as to the sheet mulching? Is this a bad time of year to apply it?  "
678,"If I use synthetic oil in my lawn tractor, can I go more than a year between oil changes?","I have a riding lawn tractor with a 460 cc Kohler engine. The manual says to change the oil every year. This year, I noticed the price of conventional and synthetic oil was about the same, so I wondered if I could buy synthetic oil and go perhaps two years between oil changes. Would that be wise? Are the any pitfalls in using synthetic oil in a lawn tractor? "
679,Is late April too late to plant herbs from seed in the US Pacific Northwest?,"I am trying to plant an herb garden in the Puget Sound region (USDA Zone 7b) of Washington state. I wanted to get some perennial herbs going from seed, but I am wondering if it is too late now? (late April/ early May) I have access to a heated greenhouse and would be growing starts in a 72-cell seed tray, rather than direct seeding.   The herbs I was planning on incorporating into the garden are listed below. Can anyone tell me if there are certain herbs on here that I should not grow from seed at this time? Which of these would I have to get going from starts now? (I'm hoping that the herbs that can survive as perennials in this area would be able to survive the winter outdoors).

So I'm wondering now do I cut it off (and if so how far down from the flower) or do I just let it go? Not sure if the flowering is eating up resources that could be put towards vegetative growth, or if its good to let it go to help further develop the main stalk?   "

I got this more succulent lavender after some more delicate french lavender had died on the same sill. This plant has lasted longer, but some of the leaves have gone silver and wizened.  I am trying to water it quite infrequently, as I believe the last lavenders died from overwatering. We've oscillated between very hot dry weather and cooler damp weather in Brooklyn over the past month.  I have three questions about it:   What is causing the leaf damage?  How can I mitigate it?  Should I remove the wizened leaves? (By cutting them off at the stalk, I assume?)      "

The white fungus is pretty bad so I'm using a suggested spray, and I hope it works.    The spray is 1 tablespoon each of baking powder and vegetable oil per gallon of water.    Questions: Will the spray kill the flowers? Can I safely spray on the main trunk going into the ground? (The leaves around trunk have got it.) It is powdery mildew.  Pretty sure its so bad because the plant is growing over grass creating the perfect dark damp environment. "
703,How can I fix my garden turf?,"When the wife and I bought our house a few years ago, the garden was an over grown mess. We hacked it down to make it presentable short term. When we came to sort it properly last autumn, budgets were tight and we probably didn't do what was best.  We had a handyman use a machine (a verticut?) to rip up the old turf (and seemingly about an inch of the topsoil) that was then skipped. They then went over the dirt with a rotavator to make the garden flatter.  We then had a friend come and sow grass seeds onto the soil. He raked the dirt and pulled up loads of little stones before sowing the seed and fertliser.  This has resulted in some beautiful grass, but I think because of the poor quality of the soil, the grass it pretty patchy and the soil is very hard and quite bumpy.  You can see a bit of the patchiness here where it has just been cut. It is worse near the bottom of the garden. I have tried seeding the patches but the ground is so hard any little bit of water just pools and the seeds float off.  The grass is really high quality so i'd rather not dig it up and start again if possible.  My plan is to cut the grass a short as possible (2cm?) and then get some half decent topsoil and just rake it on top of the existing grass, gradually building up a decent layer of topsoil that will be easier to sow where its patchy, but also a little softer to be on.   I suppose my question is;  Is putting Topsoil on-top of existing grass a safe and effective way to to level the ground and help combat patchy grass?  Thanks "
704,Stone Fruit trees vs cherry-blossoms,"I'm considering planting a row of trees primarily for their blossoms (I'm in rural Auckland - occasional temps down to -4c, typically high of 25c in summer) - which leads to 2 questions.  Are there any easy-to-grow fruit trees which will have lots of blossoms for a long period like Cherry Blossom trees but also yield edible fruit?  How do clay soils fit into the picture, and how is there a significant difference in maintenance work to the trees ? "
705,Cut the iris stem to the rhizome or only as far as the bottom leafs?,"I have bearded iris growing at 7,000 feet.  I want to see which of the iris will rebloom this season, and when the blooms are finished, to split and propagate the plants.  In either case, it's my understanding that the steps are to (a) cut the stem as close to the rhizome as possible while leaving at least two leaves, (b) do so quickly (days, not weeks or months) after the iris stops blooming, and (c) fertilize.  But the bottom-most leaves of the iris are tightly wrapped up and around the stem. I tried loosening the leaves to cut the stem closer to the rhizome, but only succeeded in tearing the leaves.   So bottom-line, I can cut to the rhizome, making the plant leafless, or I can leave two or more leafs intact by cutting several inches above the rhizome.   What is the real importance of the two leaves? Is it just for looks, or critical to health and propagation?  If I need the two leaves, will they unravel from the stem, making it easier to cut to the rhizome, if I wait several weeks? Are re-bloom and propagation two different problems with slightly different steps? I.e., do I need leaves only for propagation?  "
706,How to cure brown lawn. Grass stalks look too long,When I try to mow my lawn to a normal shortish height it looks yellow as the stalks  (stems)of the grass are too long and the green leaves are cut off. It's there any way to make the grass put it's green leaves out at this lower height? Can't see how to add a photo sorry.Anyone know how? Grass is about 2 inch when I lift it straight but it doesn't stand up straight by itself. The stalks kind of lie down a bit in all directions.      
707,Will a hebe bud from old growth?,"I have fairly mature Hebe (albicans, I think) which suffered badly in the late frost this year in the UK. After trimming back all the clearly dead growth, there are some big gaps. All the active growth appears to be just at the tips of the branches. Is the plant ruined, or does it have a chance of recovery?   The other option might be to prune it all back at the end of the season - is this worth trying? There is roughly as much healthy growth as dead (now cut back)   "
708,Broken Saddle Tee In Irrigation System,"I notice a broken line in my yard and when I dug the line up I have a white tee connector. Looking online it looks like a Poly Pipe Kwikseal Saddle Tee. The nut is missing, which I assume has caused the leak. I am wondering what the best fix would be. Should I replace it with the same tee or is there another way? Thanks!       "
709,Should I leave early rootstock budding in place?,"I have a male and female pistachio tree. Both are grafted trees. At the base of the tree, on the rootstock, it buds and produces new branches and leaves 6 to 12 weeks ahead of the grafted section of the tree.  I have been allowing the rootstock branches to continue to grow until the grafted section buds. Then I cut it back. I'm not sure if this is the right strategy and perhaps it's delaying the grafts from budding and growing. I've been thinking of the rootstock branches as nurse branches keeping the tree healthy and alive. They may be taking energy that might have allowed the grafts to bud earlier.  What is the correct strategy here? i.e. is there a case when you'd allow the rootstock to grow in this situation?  (A quick aside: I have allowed the rootstock on some apples to grow so that I can cleft graft new varieties onto those branches. With the pistachios above I have no intention of grafting anything new onto them so the rootstock branches aren't needed for this.) "
710,Flowers are growing on the inner branches only,Some flowers appeared on the inner branches of a tree. What type of tree/flower is it? Should I trim on the outside? What else do I need to do to promote its growth? Will the flowers also grow on the outside?

714,What is this big caterpillar in my yard?,"Does anyone know what this big caterpillar is? It is bright yellow with kind of geometrical triangular grey strips on the back, and also black points. It is huge for the region: 5 to 7 centimetres long and maybe 1 centimetre large!  I never saw this in the region, for the 40 years I've been living here (East France, 600m altitude, hardiness zone ~7).  I found it at the bottom of a boxwood I had to completely cut. (due to an attack of another newcomer insect, the box tree moth ). Now is that one going to start attack other plants in my yard? I think there ain't many there yet, since I saw it only once last week (end August).  Here's the beast (you can click to enlarge, a little scary).

A rose bush is growing in it. We will get some frosts over the winter but not every day.  I can only find advice about smaller containers. This advice is generally to bring the container into a garage or unheated room. We do not have a garage and the container is much too big and heavy to move.  What should we do to care for the plant now that frosts are due? Can we keep it safe or will it die? "
718,How close can dyed mulch be to a vegetable garden raised bed?,"I have a raised cedar garden bed, roughly 10 inches high.  In the surrounding area is black dyed mulch.

721,Is there any way to save delayed tomato plants before temperature gets too low?,"We are entering fall, with rainy conditions and daily temperatures below 20 °C, and my tomatoes, though (or because…) tall and robusts, are just starting flowering.  Even if next weeks are more clement, I don't expect fruits to get ripe before first frosts.  Is there something I can do to save them ?  I don't have greehouse.  I was thinking of maybe cutting flowered parts and transplants them into potting soil or maybe compost and get them indoor, would that help, and if yes how to optimize it (where to cut, when to transplant, water-only first or direct soil, or even pure compost, etc.) and get tasty fruits ?  PS : I know I could harvest green fruits for some recipes, but that's not the point of this question, and actually I don't see many fruits yet. "

I've heard that people usually use English lavender for ice-cream, but not French one. Any idea? Especially the foliage, because it has abundant foliage. "
723,This basil plant has strange spots (almost shiny?) and I can't figure them out,"I've been growing this basil plant for a couple of months.  I started it from seed in a rockwool cube.  Here's its environment:   It's under full spectrum lighting for ~15 hours per day, and I recently switched from a 35W fluorescent to a 24W LED, both are designed for horticultural lighting.  No sunlight unfortunately. It's been growing in a well aerated deep water cultivation fed by Botanicare Pure Blend Pro (the Grow 3-2-4 formula) at about 5ml per liter of water, as the bottle suggests. The nutrient solution has been completely replaced once, and that was a few weeks ago. It's in an apartment that varies between 22C and 26C, and the nutrient solution reservoir seems to stay between 23C and 24C. Relative humidity varies between 20% in the late afternoon and 80% in the morning. The system's pH is currently just above 5 (tough to get accurate readings with tester drops), which is where I adjusted it to after changing the nutrient solution, so it's steady.   Here's the plant next to its cilantro neighbor:    It's growing well, the leaves are fragrant and full, and I notice new growth every day.  Happy days.  But I've noticed some light spots on the leaves that don't look healthy to me:      The first picture shows small light spots, and the second picture shows small dead spots that are actually a bit reflective/shiny.  The affected leaves otherwise appear healthy, with good color and not even slightly wilted.  Many leaves on the plant are affected, and the issue isn't localized in any one area of the plant.  I've looked very, very closely at affected leaves, unaffected leaves, the stem, the growing substrate, the surrounding area - there are no visible insects crawling or flying or worming around.  I had a good look through some related threads (here, here, and several others that weren't related enough to link to), and decided to actually dissect a couple of leaves to look for leaf miners.  But I saw nothing of the sort.  Even with a magnifying glass,  I saw no sign of anything alive.  Nothing that looked like ""trails"" of eaten leaf.  No bumps in the leaf or veins where they might be hanging out.  No dark spots or anything that looked like frass.  What else could be causing those spots?  Does anything listed in the plant's environment look out of wack? "
724,"How can I determine when to pick a spiny cucumber, without touching it?","We have a friend who occasionally brings us vegetable plants, as she has her own garden/farm thing where she cultivates plants to sell to restaurants. This time around, she brought us some tiny red and yellow tomatoes as well as some cucumbers. The tomatoes were easy to work with, the cucumbers less so. We're currently at the point where we're trying to figure out when it's time to pick them. Unlike store-bought plants we've dealt with in the past, our friend did not leave us any seed cards or other kind of information that could help us.  The problem is that they're particularly prickly. The largest one, on the left, is probably ready by size alone. The picture on the right is one of several smaller ones. You can probably see a fair amount of spines, mostly near the bottom, but the entire fruits are positively covered in shiny barbs. It's not limited to the fruits themselves, though. The stalks and the leaves of the plant are also covered in coarse hairs that can even puncture our gardening gloves. If there was such thing as a cactus cucumber these may very well be it, haha, but I've actually heard of spiny cucumbers for a long time. Mom says these are worse than dealing with rosebushes.  A quick search online has shown up mostly ways of checking if a cucumber is ready to pick is by the firmness of grasp. This is decidedly not an option as I enjoy my hands being relatively smooth and hole-free, and thicker gloves mean I won't even be able to feel the fruit. Resources I've found on dealing with spiny cucumbers all seem to be about how to cook and peel them, not how to harvest them off the plant in the first place. So I ask, how might I ascertain that a cucumber is ready if it is too spiny to feel? With touch out of the question (lest there's a means to touch them without needle death), what means can we use to check on them and decide to snip them off the plant for eventual cookery?

726,How Do I Determine The Best Watering Schedule For My Lawn?,"I just bought a new house and I want to program the irrigation system. I don't know anything about the lawn or the system because I just moved in.  I want to know how often I should water the lawn, both on which days of the week and how long to water per zone.  I assume that I am not giving enough information to answer these questions, so I guess what I'm really asking is what do I need to find out and how do I find it out?

728,How to prune a fiddle leaf fig tree,"I have had this fiddle leaf fig tree (ficus lyrata) for about a year and it has grown a lot of new leaves along three of its branches, but not on any others. In fact, many small, dry leaves have fallen off of the other branches.  The three branches are getting a bit long now so I was planning on chopping them back about half way to the trunk. Will the tree cope with this? Is there a good time of year to attempt it?  Ideally, I'd like to encourage a few other branches to grow, but they look rather dead. Is there any way to get other branches to grow, particularly to grow upwards rather than sideways?  Thanks for any advice! :)       "

736,Is it possible to use micro-sprinklers to irrigate the lawn?,"While trying to solve the same problem I’ve inquired before — using shrub sprinkler heads in drip-irrigation system to water narrow side lawn — I am coming to realisation that even if pressure is enough to use them, 13 mm mainline drip tubing could simply not be able to provide enough flow to supply three or four of those at once. So I am looking at alternatives.  One such alternative I am considering is to use drip-system micro-sprinkler heads. They seem to be able to provide enough coverage (some of them can do up to 6 m (20 ft) radius), and with flow rates of 50 to a 120 litres per hour (14‒32 U.S. gph) should be able to deliver water at a rate of quarter to a half that of a shrub sprayer.  In theory it seems like a viable solution, if I simply set them to run, say, three-four times longer than conventional sprinklers to provide enough water. But I had been reading books, brochures and articles on micro-irrigation for a few days now, and hadn’t seen any specific recommendations for that application. I’ve seen some questions like that been asked on gardening forums, but either links were broken, or no useful information were present.  So, is it possible to use above-ground micro-sprinklers to irrigate small sections of turf lawn? Is there limitations on soil penetration by this method of water delivery? Are those sprinklers sturdy enough to withstand relatively heavy use over at least few seasons? Would more drought/resistant grass species be required?

For Christmas cropping it is advised that you protect against frost, I was wondering if placing the grow bags in something like the Gardman tomato growhouses would be a good idea.  Would the extra warmth throughout the end of the summer be OK? is this likely to offer enough warmth in winter? It should get around 4 hours of sun in mid winter.

744,How can someone minimize negative health effects from using a lawnmower?,"So lawnmowers pollute significantly more than cars. Thus, using a lawnmower is basically the equivalent of breathing in auto exhaust (if not worse).  So I'm wondering - is there a way to minimize the negative health effects from using a lawnmower? Are there certain types of lawnmower gasoline that are cleaner than other types? What about high-octane gasoline?  Also, what about protecting oneself from all the particulate matter in the gasoline? And what about some of the emissions from the lawnmower like VOCs, nitrogen dioxide, and benzene? I'm not too concerned about carbon monoxide as it doesn't really have chronic health effects. The others do, though.  Also, I live under parents, so many of the options don't really exist "
745,Will repotting a cactus after flowering affect the fruit?,"It is generally advised against repotting a cactus while it has buds or flowers on it.

749,Closed bin compost collecting water at the bottom,"I have a closed-bin compost bin (because of location/equipment, I don't have anything open and I can't tolerate the smell). My compost is almost entirely greens, now black and rotting (I didn't put enough browns).  Even though I'm starting to add browns, what confuses me is the water quantity. I put fresh greens (eg. orange peels) every day or two, and every time I look, I can see the bottom portion of the bin has liquid in it. I can see the liquid in it.  I'm trying to compensate temporary by adding more browns (shredded newspaper, dried-out weeds), but is there a deeper problem here? Is this normal to see water collecting at the bottom of my closed bin?  (It's a ~13 gallon dark blue plastic garbage can that I leave outside. I can move it into the garage if indoors is better for composting.) "
750,"Pepper tree suffering, leaves drying out at the tops, apparently from cold and wind","We have a pepper tree, about 7 to 8 feet tall, that has never been totally well but this winter it started doing especially badly.   It appears weak in general, and it is drying out from the tops. In the photo below, all the tops used to have leaves, they have all gone over the past 2-3 months.   They are exposed to constant wind, and the winter was relatively cool for the region (with low points about 10°C, 50°F). This coincided with the tree getting so much worse.  It looks like we're now in for a very hot summer, with temperatures already in the thirties C (nineties F).  We've tried watering it generously, but are at a loss what else to do. Should we use fertilizer? Does anyone have any ideas?       "
751,What to do with 2nd season beetroot?,"I planted some beetroot last year and obviously should have harvested it before winter but as I didn't have a use for all of it at the time I left some of it to grow. Now it's May (Spring) and I've got mature plants... Should they just go on the compost heap or are they still good to eat? Or perhaps, am I better off waiting until later in the year?  What are my options? "
752,How do I get grass to grow in what looks like pure sand?,"The previous owner of my house had a 1 ft. wide strip of mulch next to the walkway.  I'd like to just have grass grow up to the edge of the walkway instead.    However, the ground is extremely sandy.  Under the mulch woodchips, there's about 1/2 an inch of dark soil that is probably remnants of the mulch material, and then sand underneath.  To my novice eye it basically just looks like pure sand.  I'm sure that's not actually true, but it definitely does not bear any resemblance to anything that could be called 'soil'.    The good news is that I can get as much compost as I'd like from the town dump for free.  Will mixing the sand and compost at some ratio produce reasonable soil?  What ratio would that be?  And how deep of a trench should I dig and replace?  Are there any other options that people would recommend? "
753,Grafting black walnut onto English walnut,"I have a healthy three year old English walnut.  It is about 8 feet tall and 5 feet wide.  It was purchased at one of the large home improvement stores (I don't remember which) so the tree itself may actually be grafted onto a black walnut rootstock.  I have read that this is common for trees sold commercially.  On a local property there is a 5-year old chance seedling of a black walnut tree growing out of some old farm equipment.  The property owner plans to tear out the seedling, but is willing to let me take as much of the tree as I want.  I'd like to convert about one third of the tree to black walnut if possible, but I'm wary of damaging an otherwise healthy tree.   How do I graft a branch from the black to the English walnut? Should I attempt large (1/2 in diameter) branches or just smaller twigs/buds? When is the best time of year to perform the graft (I have until next spring)? What type of grafting technique should I use (whip, splice, bark, T-Budding)?  "
754,Is it necessary to purchase seed potatoes?,"I recently tried growing potatoes using a method I saw on TV. This is just cutting up potatoes into reasonable sized sections and placing them several inches down. The results have been fantastic.  While doing some research on how to grow potatoes I have read that I should be using seed potatoes, not cuttings from store bought potatoes. The main reason given is disease.  How high is the risk in using cuttings from store bought potatoes? Are there any other reasons that I should use expensive seed potatoes (considering a bag of potatoes is inexpensive and one potato cut up can produce 4 plants)?  Even Yates suggests that it is not entirely necessary:     It’s best to buy the certified   disease-free seed potatoes that are   available at this time of year, but   you can choose healthy potatoes from   your vegie drawer  "
755,What should I do with these young tomato plants in the middle of august?,I have a bunch of young tomato plants (grown from seed since the beginning of May)  But if I'm not mistaken it's too late to plant them out into the yard.  August is halfway through and it's not uncommon to get the first frost at the end of September/beginning of October. I'm in Belgium.  So what should I do with them?  Keep them inside? Grow them under some special light?   
756,Oak Leaf Blister (Taphrina caerulescens),I'm pretty certain my oak has Taphrina caerulescens symptoms. There is yellow bulbs on it since the beginning of the summer. Can it endanger the tree health? How can it be cured?   
757,How should I use one courgette plant for both consumption and seeds?,How should I handle the fruit-harvesting of a courgette (zucchini) if I also like to collect seeds?  In principle my understanding is that I just need to leave a fruit long enough on a plant for it to develop seeds. How will this influence the creation of new flowers and fruits if I leave the first one untouched?  Will it be better to wait for the end of the season and let the last one ripen until the plant is almost dead? 
758,"Is there a difference between Aspirin, Tylenol, and Advil when growing tomatoes?","In this YouTube video people are suggesting planting with Aspirin, but would Advil, and Tylenol do the same thing? "
759,When to pot on courgette seedling?,I think I made a mistake: I put (~15) seeds of courgette into a big bowl in seed-compost (low-nutrition).  Now one week later they are starting to sprout and I realize that this was maybe not the best choice as they will grow fast and develop roots quickly.   Can I wait one more week before potting them on into a small pot but this time with garden compost? Or should I act now before too many sensitive roots have developed?   
760,How to stop small black worms from eating my strawberries?,"I planted strawberries a couple of years ago in a small patch of my back yard (in Sacramento, CA) and this year they are finally producing lots of strawberries. However, something is eating ""divots"" into them, as if something scooped out maybe a quarter to a third of the strawberry.   I have netting to keep out squirrels and other larger critters. However, many of the strawberries have divots eaten into them and I found one or two of these with what looked like a small black worm in them. The worm was maybe 3/8"" long and less than 1/16"" wide and its body looked smooth and featureless to my unaided eye.   Does anyone have an idea of whether these are the creatures that are eating my strawberries? If they are, what can I do to stop them? If something else is eating them, what could it be and what can I do about it?   Thanks for your help. "
761,"Are glass containers suitable for ""air plants""?","I recently received three Tillandsia ionantha plants as a gift.  The set came with some teardrop-shaped glass ""terraria"" in which to display the plants.  Each container has a large hole to put the plant in and a few small holes above that, presumably for ventilation.    The kit also came with some sand and goofy ""sea life"" decorations, not shown here.  I know that cacti and succulents are often sold in similar containers, which are actually quite harmful to the plants.  Is it safe to use these containers with my air plants, or will I be dooming them to a slow death?  And if I do use the containers, what can I do to maximize their suitability? "
762,Are my pineapple plant and papaya plant saveable?,"I have a white pineapple (sugarloaf pineapple), and a papaya tree that that were growing all spring and summer in Salt Lake City, UT. They were both doing very well, and I was planning on taking them down to my parents who live in a warmer climate for the fall and winter. However, we unexpectedly got a cold front recently and both plants were subjected to temps of 28 degrees F (-2 degrees C), and both looked sick the next morning. Since then I’ve been bringing them inside at night, and back out in the warm sunlight during the day. Do you think they’ll survive? Or is it too late?     "
763,My mint is dying out?,"When it became a bit warmer again I put my mint plant outside after it stayed inside for the winter. However, after I came back from a short vacation, almost all leaves turned black. I don't know what is wrong...  Also there are white grain-like, chalky thingies in the soil. They are not stones, if I take one and squeeze them they pulverise and it is like chalk. Can this hurt? What is it?  Can it be that the transition from inside (~20˚C) to outside (~8˚C at the time) was too sudden and it died of cold? What could I do now to save it?       "
764,What else besides calcium deficiency could be causing tomato blossom end rot?,"I've been using ""Tomato Maker"" (4-2-6) fertilizer, which supposedly has enough calcium to prevent blossom end rot, but I'm still getting blossom end rot on my super marzano tomatoes (no BER problems on any other varieties I'm growing this year).   Are there other things that can cause blossom end rot besides calcium deficiency? Is the super marzano variety (or plum tomatoes in general) particularly susceptible? Could my plants still be suffering from calcium deficiency even with the Tomato Maker fertilizer?  In case it would be helpful to know, I live in the California Central Valley, which has hot, dry summers, but spring this year was unusually cool and rainy.   I'd be interested in any advice on what, if anything, I can do now to reduce blossom end rot on this year's crop and also what I can do in the future to prevent BER from turning up at all. "
765,How to stop ax getting stuck in log when splitting wood?,"As a noob wood cutter I've watched a bunch of YouTube videos, but the thing I never see is the person getting their ax stuck in the log.  I know you can turn the log upside down to free the ax but why am I having this issue (very often) and how can I avoid it?  I wondered, could my ax be too sharp so it sinks in too deep? I don't mind lots of hits needed to split the log, but having to keep freeing it is a real pain. "
766,Blueberry spacing in a raised bed - how dense can I go?,"I'm about to construct a 4ft wide x 16ft long raised bed, 6"" height, for planting blueberries. The space where this bed is going has a chain link fence on the back and one end, although I can walk around to the other side to pick fruits.  How close together can I place the bushes so that density is maximized, but they aren't overcrowded?  I could make the bed 5ft wide if necessary. I was thinking of using some type of zigzag pattern but I also don't know how close to the edge of the raised bed the blueberry can go? "
767,Can These Plants Be Saved?,I believe the more dead one is sage. How should I help it? Also the plant with brown ends on the stems is mint. Should I cut off the brown bits? I don't care about harvesting or eating them I mostly just want to help them but I'm not sure how.  I would gladly appreciate any links to some good sites for learning how to care for them. There's so much info and I'm not sure where to start 😬       
768,"New construction, horrible lawn","We moved into our new house in late March and started with mud. The builder put down seed with a hand spreader and put straw down on the sloped parts of the yard. He then told me to only water it every few days but not if it rains. I moved from a condo so I took him at his word.   My lawn is a wreck now, and despite doing a ton of research, I don't feel 100% confident in a good plan on how to deal with it.   The parts of the yard that did not have the straw down are seemingly 98% crabgrass. It's horrible. There are also lots of weeds, which I think are categorized as ""broadleaf weeds"" all over. From what I understand, weeds are common when you have soil brought in, and crabgrass when there's a low density of good grass and high heat and/or no shade. I've been cutting the grass at 3"" for the last few months to give the grass a chance to survive, but it means I only have a non-embarrassing yard for 3 or 4 days and I've been mowing weekly throughout the summer just to keep the crabgrass length down.   My yard has zero trees, is pretty flat in the front and back, and slopes down maybe a total of 8-10 feet as it goes from the front of the house to the back.   After I bury some irrigation pipe for drainage from my downspouts next weekend, here's my plan:   [power]rake to clear up debris (straw is everywhere!) from the soil rent an aerator and run it over the yard and dump in new seed water aggressively for a few days, then daily for a couple weeks fertilize in mid to late September continue watering regularly fertilize in November   I have no idea if this will be effective. I also don't know if I should aerate and seed again in the spring or if that would just damage the new seedlings.   What advice would you give to me?  TL;DR - new lawn is a mess of crabgrass an broadleaf weeds. What's the best strategy heading into the fall and next spring? "
769,Should I stop runner beans climbing too high?,"I realise I've put runner beans close to an overhanging damson tree.   The beans closest to the damson have scaled my supports and have bridged the gap between support and tree and started to climb on into the branches of the damson.  Leaving aside unsuitability of growing vegetables close to trees (loss of light and nutrients), is there a problem with the beans climbing on and on into the tree? (apart from the obvious one of it being hard to harvest the crop of course).  What I mean is, will the plants put excessive effort into climbing and set fewer flowers/beans?  If so, should I just pinch out the tops? "
770,What's the difference between drop spreaders and rotary spreaders?,"Why are there two kinds of spreaders and which one should I get? This is not a question of product recommendation, but rather, which kind of spreader is more popular and why? Or should I have one of each? "
771,Plant potting mix has green balls,"I have a potting mix from a majestic palm that I'm attempting to reuse, it has some odd small green balls in it that are maybe one or two mm large, perfectly spherical and uniform.  I opened one and it appeared to break like plastic and was hollow inside.  What is this, a slow release fertilizer?  Is it biodegradable or is this plastic ball going to be in the soil forever?  Thanks "
772,Will interwoven espaliered fruit trees of different types hurt or inhibit each other?,"Suppose I want to espalier a row of trees into a woven boundary, something like this:   Would it matter if the trees were of different types (e.g. apple, pear, cherry, plum)? Will the interwoven branches interfere and cause problems, or will they play nicely together? "
773,Are black spots on Areca Palm contagious to other flowers?,"I read here that those black spots caused by either bacteria of fungus aren't bad for my Majesty/Areca palm, but are they bad for other flowers which will be next to the palm? Will they become contaminated and have issues? I have basil, mint, aloe vera, bamboo, rose and some other plants on the bottom racks underneath the Majesty/Areca palm. Would it be better to keep the palm on the bottom rack instead or completely separated from other flowers? Thanks a lot!   "
774,"What does ""hardiness zone"" mean?","Several questions here refer to (hardiness) zone 6a, 7, 5-8, and others.  What is a hardiness zone exactly? Is it determined only by the temperature (maximum, minimum) or are there other factors? "
775,How to sanitize used paint buckets before gardening?,"A neighbour told me not to use empty plastic buckets that earlier contained paint (for painting the house) for gardening because the chemicals still stuck to the sides would leach into the soil and be absorbed by the plants. While it seemed plausible, I just did a bunch of internet searches and didnt find anything that specifically mentioned it.     If it isn't safe to use the buckets for growing veggies, would it help to wash it with kerosine or a paint thinner? What about placing it under the hot Indian sun and scraping off the dry paint? Has there been any credible research that shows that the chemicals from a paint bucket converted to a gardening pot can leach into the soil and be absorbed by the plant, thereby being harmful to us?    The main question is the one in the title. The other questions could either be ignored or answered while building up a case to answer the main question. "
776,Yellowing leaves on some hibiscus plants,"We moved into a new house in SW FL (the Cape Coral area) a couple of months ago, and the front was landscaped with 5 hibiscus plants. All of them are flowering nicely (a nice, fuchsia color), but 2 of the plants have begun to have more and more yellow leaves. They all have gotten the same fertilizer, and get the same amount of water from the irrigation system, and probably were planted at the same time when the house was rehabbed. The only difference is that the 2 plants on the end get an extra hour of direct sun. Can this extra sun be causing the yellowing leaves? Can anything be done to help bring these plants back looking like their cousins? "
777,Can cereal boxes be used for mulch?,"This question asks about using corrugated cardboard for mulch. In the comments and the answer there are some questions about glues and inks possibly having ""bad stuff"" that you might not want in the vegetable garden.  I'm wondering about cereal boxes (this type of cardboard in general). They're printed with glossy inks, which from what I read probably have heavy metals? Does anyone know of literature about what's in these boxes/inks and whether it would be safe for mulching around vegetables? "
778,How to branch out rubber tree,"I am new to this site and I already got some great information. I had this rubber tree for a few years now. It has not been re-potted. I would like it to branch out a little bit.  What would be best thing to do? I also thought about cutting it down, propagate and plant all the cuttings in the same pot to get a “new” plant? Would that be to cruel? It sits in the south facing window, with some afternoon sun. I am relatively new to plants and have a lot to learn...    "
779,Is there a good technique for transplanting medium-maturity pumpkin vines?,"Pumpkin vines tend to drop roots at each major leaf along the vine.   I need to transplant several pumpkin vines that have dropped established roots in 5-6 spots each.  For the vine below, the black box is where I will be cutting the vine. However, there are established roots further out on the vine.   Am I better off severing the outside roots, thus keeping only the main root system in the black box?  Should I attempt to take each root-bunch to the destination? (May not be possible without damaging the vine in transit -- several heavy soil-heavy clumps)  Other ideas?   "
780,How do I get rid of this white stuff on my pumpkin leaves?,"The leaves on my pumpkin plants have what looks like a white mold growing on them.  What is this?   If it is harmful, how do I treat it? "
781,"Why would my basil leaves have a sharp, unpleasant smell?","I have a basil plant that's getting plenty of sunshine (it's around 29 &deg;C today, with clear skies). It's in a big pot, not shaded, and the soil is damp. We had a lot of rain a few days ago, and I've never seen this basil plant wilting. The leaves have been yellow in the past and then they turn green again, but a darker green, and now, when I rub the leaves, I get a smell that is sharp and unpleasant (but still somewhat like the basil smell we all know and love). Is this a problem for the plant as a whole? Should I discard all affected leaves, or will they recover?  Edit: The plant has not flowered, and the stems are all green and supple. Here are some photos for those who would like to take a look:   "
782,How do I roto-till without leaving a trench?,"I have a 4' (1.2m) three point tractor roto-tiller which I've been using to prepare garden areas this year. I noticed that the tiller always moves soil backwards, and when at the end of the section it leaves a trench, as can be seen in the picture.    The previous owners had a large garden, and I can tell the direction they always tilled in because they've created a ridge where they start and there's a significant dip where they ended. I'm working on reversing that to flatten the area better and avoid the mush in the low level area, but I'd like to avoid doing this myself.  Is there a technique I can use when tilling that will leave soil in the area where I intend to stop tilling?  I've tried lifting the tiller while still spinning, stopping right when I get to the end, and a few other things, but I'm still not leaving sufficient soil at the end.  The closest I've come is slowly raising the tiller over the last several feet of the run. Still not great as it's tricky to perform, and leaves that section poorly tilled, all while not completely eliminating the trench/lack of soil.  Will I simply have to live with it as a consequence of the tiller I have, and move the soil by hand each time I use it? "
783,Handling a Cherimoya Tree,"Does anyone have any experience with Cherimoya Trees???  We have one in our backyard.  Last year, it produced some decent size fruit.  This year, it seems like there are more fruits sprouting, and the tree is bending over almost to the ground.  Do I need to tie it to itself to keep it more upright?  Stake it?  Accept that it and its branches with fruit will need to be pruned short?  Also, I am not familiar at all with its watering needs, and if anyone has any recommendations.   "
784,What is this low growing plant with pink flowers?,I'm still getting to know my garden. I see these pink flowers growing and can't decide whether they're growing at random or they were planted intentionally. What type of flowers are they? Should I get rid of them along with the purple ones?   
785,Is my Schefflera arboricola getting the right amount of light and water?,"I have a Schefflera arboricola (also known as Strahlenaralie in German). I've placed it in my office so that it receives some sunshine, but not directly - I've put it behind a plastic plant (on the right on the photo). The blinds are often closed in the office, particularly in the morning.  I've been watering it with half a glass of water every week, or every two weeks. Currently the ground is a little bit moist.  The plant has been doing OK for around half a year now (I bought it and brought it to the office in the winter). Recently, I've noticed that its leaves have been falling off and it's a little sparser than it used to be.  Is this due to the location? Should I put the Schefflera somewhere else? Or should I water it more often or less often?   "
786,What sort of feeding schedule should I use for pepper plants?,"I've been trying to find out about feeding my peppers plants. So far the information I've found is very inconsistent, so I'd like something as definitive as possible.  When should I start feeding my pepper plants?  And from then, how frequently should I feed them? "
787,How often should you mow a growing lawn?,"During the warm months when my grass is growing, is there a mowing schedule I can use to encourage the lawn to be green and healthy? Mine often seems ""unhappy"" when it's been cut (goes pale, some browning), which makes me want to mow it less-often.  Is there anything I can check to know when it's best to cut the grass? "
788,What are the absolute most water-thirsty plants?,"I have a balcony that gets about 4 hours 1 hour of direct sunlight a day (but several many hours of indirect sunlight bouncing off a building in front) that has an A/C unit where the water condensate drain line from the unit can only go into a bucket on the balcony.  In Summer, this large 3 Gallon bucket fills in about 24 hours from having the A/C on 24 hours a day.  The condensate drain line drips water into the bucket 24 hours a day, but at a faster rate during the day when it's warmer.  So instead of having to empty the bucket every day, I'm looking for a plant that can be placed on the balcony that can consume a full bucket-load of water every 24 hours in Summer without dying from over-watering.  Do such plants exist?    If not, then what are the absolute most water-thirsty plants?  Perhaps I can have several of them next to each other to absorb the full bucket-load of water every day.  Ideally, I'm looking for a plant that is ultra-thirsty when water is available, but very hardy when there is a lack of water (e.g. no A/C in winter) so it can survive for several years rather than just in Summer when the A/C is feeding it water.  I hoping nature can solve my problem! "
789,Peony and Ant Symbiotic Relationship?,"After reading this identification question, I remembered we had peonies in our back yard when I was a kid. I noticed a lot of ants would congregate on the plants and was worried they would destroy them. I talked to my Mom about it. She told me they shared a symbiotic relationship and to leave the ants alone.   Is this true? If so, what is this symbiotic relationship about? "
790,How do I keep mosquitos out of my fountain?,I found lots of mosquito larvae in my fountain. How can I get rid of them?  A local store has the doughnut thingies but they are expensive. I'd prefer a homemade solution if possible.  I tried vegetable oil. It worked but looks ugly.  Any other suggestions? 
791,Did we somehow accidentally plant an oak tree on our balcony?,"My wife had a poinsettia on our balcony that died in a surprise frost while we were away. The empty pot stayed on our balcony for a while, and new sprouts gave her hope that it had managed to survive in the roots.  But it soon developed leaves that were clearly not poinsettia. I took one look at them and thought they looked quite like traditional oak leaves, though I don’t see how that could have happened. Friends all concurred that they look like oak leaves.  At this point, they look a little more pointy than the traditional knobby look, but still, pretty oak-like:    So, is this an oak tree? Any idea how it got there?  This is in Arlington, Virginia. "
792,What's the next action I should take with this rootbound plant?,"After some help with what I should do with this plant, I've neglected to check its roots of for some time. I believe it to be a species of asparagus grass, though if someone wants to correct that belief feel free.  As you can see from the images, I may have left the roots alone for too long (in fact I had to literally cut the old plant pot away from the bottom of it, because they'd grown through and formed a circle underneath it The plant itself seems to be fine (in-fact flowered for the first time in the 6-ish years I've had it, though they were very small, and dropped off at the slightest touch).  Is the answer to the question ""How do I prune the roots of a rootbound plant?"" still appropriate with such a root-locked plant? What's the next size up pot to put it in? It was in a 6' (I think, the next up is a 7' at any rate) pot.    "
793,What's wrong with my indoor Areca palm with leaf blight?,"I just received a small areca palm (about three feet high) in the mail that has some leaves showing signs of stress. Could someone help me identify the culprit? I'm wondering whether I could address the problem myself (inexperienced with Areca palms) or whether it's too diseased to salvage? If this plant is beyond repair, should I contact the nursery and try to get a healthier one?  I'm also wondering whether this palm might infect my other houseplants with scale or fungus? I have a nice pothos, aloe plant, peace lily, rosemary, cilantro, and mint in the same room.   All advice would be greatly appreciated!  Thank you!         "
794,What products should I fill raised garden beds with?,"I've built a raised garden bed and would like to know what types of soil or mix I should use to fill it with?  Should it be a mixture of top soil and compost?  I'm looking for an affordable option.  I'm in Birmingham, Alabama and the bed is 3' x 6' x 16"".  I have 3 of these beds.  Mostly growing veggies (spinach, beans, carrots, etc) and herbs. "
795,"Peace lily leaves with small, round bumps. Is this normal?","My peace lily (purchased and repotted two months ago, kept in medium light environment in town with hard water) has some leaves exhibiting round bumps along the main stem.

796,What should I do with yarrow once it has stopped blooming?,"Do you deadhead yarrow? If you do, do you just tear of the tops, or do you cut them all the way down the stem? Or do you simply save seeds somehow? "
797,Garden Hoses: how safe are they?,"After noticing that some garden hoses carry a warning, ""Not to be used for drinking water"", I recently switched to one labelled ""non-toxic"". Does this only mean that the hose is lead-free, or also that it is free of the other chemicals in PVC that are thought to cause cancer? Those of us who grow our crops organically, believe that they are (relatively) uncontaminated. Are we unwittingly introducing harmful chemicals into the food chain, every time we water our fruit and vegetables?  Does anyone know if there has been any research into this, and how safe our hoses are? "
798,Automatic Watering System for VERY small pots and seedlings?,"As the title suggests, I'm currently germinating a bunch of lemon balm seeds in an egg carton. I heard they grew better uncovered so I didn't cover them, however, they seem to dry out rather quickly, so I was wondering if I could make a simple DIY self-watering system for such tender plants. I searched for hours on Youtube but found nothing that was suitable for small containers and plants. I'd prefer: -It doesn't drown and overwhelm the seeds -It doesn't require a lot of materials.   If possible, I'd want: -A Video Tutorial perhaps? -A step by step tutorial in words? Thanks "
799,What's the fastest-growing variety of cherry tree?,"I really want to add a tree to my garden, but logistics and budget demand that I plant a sapling and nurture it into a healthy tree.  I really like cherry blossom, so a cherry tree would be ideal. It's not necessary that the tree bear fruit, though that'd be a nice bonus for the local birds.  What's the fastest-growing variety of cherry tree that will give me lovely cherry blossoms? What can I do to encourage growth and keep the tree healthy? "

And at the rest of the time it is a shady place. We used to change the water after 3-4 days, still its leaves started turning yellow. How do I preserve this plant? I want to see it growing big!  When purchased from the shop, it looks exactly as shown below.   "
801,What is a good strategy to fix up a lawn in winter?,"I have an issue with my lawn.     There is a huge patch of dead grass just below a covered area. The area gets plenty of sun, but I guess it just does not get enough water.   What is a good strategy to fix this ugliness now that winter just started?    Should I bother fertilizing the dead area?  Should I buy a few more rolls of grass?  Should I add top soil?  Should I invest in a sprinkler system for the dead area, if so what? What about de-thatching?  "
802,What plants can I use to reduce soil humidity?,"I live in Chile where the land slopes up into the hills just a few meters from the coast. I have a garage at sea level with the back wall in the ground and there's a little river flowing inside it. I am told it's from leaking sewage tanks above and a normal phenomena. It's like a liter of water per hour - it's significant, not just a wet wall.  Knowing that some plants require a significant amount of water and considering behind the garage is just a lawn, would it be possible to remedy the problem with plants? There's around 10 square meters of space and it's pretty sunny. The roots would need to go 2-3 meters down. Are there plants suitable for this? Which plants evaporate most water? Does it even make sense? :-)  Edit: A bad vertical panorama of the location from above:   It's not ground water, it's leakage from sewage water tanks on the hills above. Or so I'm told, but it can't be ground water, the levels aren't that high here.  EDIT: Late revelation: It actually IS ground water. The slope was artificially created and apparently they dug a bit too deep. I guess it's time for a pond. :-) "
803,Identity and give care instructions for mammillaria cactus,"  Hi, I think I just bought a mammillaria cactus. What is the subspecies and how do I care for it best? What colour flowers to expect? What should I do with the fruits sticking out (propagation instructions)? Will the plant's spikes change over time (e.g. Will it grow central spikes, change colour, etc.)?  Thank you.  "
804,What is the maximum number of trusses for a tomato plant?,I have 6 tomato plants of different varieties grown in planters outdoors. I have heard that there is a recommended limit to the number of trusses (bunches of fruit or number of branches bearing fruit) on a plant after which you should crop the top of the plant. I believe this is to focus growth on the remaining fruit.  Is this correct? What is the number of bunches/branches I should limit my plants to? 
805,Sterilize parking strip,"My elderly neighbor has a parking strip that is infested with goat head weeds. With my neighbor's permission, I'm planning on ripping out the weeds and replacing with weed cloth and mulch. To prevent needing to do this again in the near future, I'd prefer to sterilize the ground before laying the mulch.   The parking strip is on a hill that drains into a major road. I'm not at all concerned about the runoff damaging plants we want to keep, and my first inclination is to salt the ground.  How much salt/foot of parking strip will do the trick? Alternatively, are there any better ways of accomplishing the goal of sterilizing this soil?  Again, this is all with the consent of the homeowner, who would have preferred that the city just paved the strip in the first place. :-) "
806,Book to understand how plants work,"I'm looking for a book that helps me understand the basics of botanic and horticulture. I'm mostly interested in trees but if treats other kinds of plants that's great too.  What I'm looking for is not a reference of different species but something more general. It could include advice over some topics but it should come with a scientific explanation justifying it. Some of the topics that it could include are:   How do seeds work? How are they triggered to germinate? How do roots develop and interact with the soil? How are different nutrients used? How do plants react to pruning? What triggers the creation of flowers and fruits? How do plants interact with pests (insects, fungi, etc) Interaction of annual seasons   Of course, I'm completely OK with a technical book, as long as it doesn't presume a lot of previous knowledge in the field. I am also OK with recommendations that don't cover the full range of topics, focusing on some of them.  Any suggestions? Thank you! "
807,Is there a traditional method/style for pruning a Chocolate Silk tree?,"I have a containerized Chocolate Silk (a.k.a. Summer Chocolate) tree that is two years old (i.e. it was planted in its present container from a branchless and rootless stalk two years ago).  It has grown robustly each year, but the foliage seems unbalanced in the sense that there aren't many leaves or branches near the trunk and it keeps growing out but not adding interior growth.    Is there a traditional look or style for Chocolate silk trees, and if so how should I prune to achieve it? (My Google image searches mostly resulted in close-up pictures of the leaves; most of the tree-scale pictures were of obviously un-pruned plants or copies of a single picture showing tight foliage.  Is there a certain time of year when I should prune (i.e. it's early July, is it too late)?  More generally, do overall guidelines for pruning trees (such as prune when dormant) apply to this varietal? "
808,How and when to plant young grafted fruit tree?,"Our backyard is in a Mediterranean climate (Adelaide plains, South Australia) and we've been gifted a young grafted apple tree which has its root ball still wrapped in plastic. It's about 1.3m (4ft) high now. It's a Pink Lady cultivar grafted onto some unknown rootstock.  Remembering it's midwinter right now here:   How long can I put off planting the apple tree? How much sunlight would it need? Would it be wise to put it up against the eastern fence so it doesn't get the nastiest amount of sun in midsummer? Any tips to help it survive? Mulch? Fertiliser? How much watering early on?   One last bit of info is that the soil in an area like ours is not great. It is geologically ancient so there's not really much organic matter in it except what you add. It is mostly red, clay-type soil. "
809,White flies / aphids on Parsley and Herbs in Winter,"Help needed to confirm if these are indeed whitefly larvae and what I can do.  It's October (going into winter here) so I brought my herbs indoors a few weeks ago, only to have this pest.   Questions: 1. Can anything be done to remove the white spots from the leaves? I think this is the larvae. Right now I've moved the herbs back outside and the whiteflies have disappeared (too cold), but as it's currently 45-55 F here (7-12 C), I'm worried how long my plants (esp basil and parsley) will last.   Can I eat the parsley with the white dots? Even with aggressive spraying, vacuuming the leaves, and scrubbing with water, I can't remove them. I doubt they're harmful, but not very palatable. I'm seriously considering chopping off the parsley early for the winter to end this pest. Will these spread to other herbs? There's also snow-like shedding in the soil. So far, these have not spread to my other herbs beside it (basil, rosemary, thyme, mint, chives). Are any of these others significantly at risk, or just parsley? Should I trash the soil (these are in pots) completely rather than risk larvae next season?   Please share if you can help.      "
810,How do I harvest acorns from a Palestinian Oak (Quercus calliprinos) for planting?,"I've got one of these growing by my house, and it's full of acorns. Some have fallen, but most are on the tree and are green (starting to turn brown at the end.)  I want to grow a bunch of them for a permaculture project.  Should I pick them from the tree as they turn brown and separate from the branch easily?  Do I need to germinate them in the cold? "
811,"Is July  too late to replant tomatoes in North Georgia, USA?","I started my garden this year with 8 tomato plants. Between disease, over watering and a misadventure with a plastic softball I have lost about half of them. My wife wants enough tomatoes to can some salsa and probably some spaghetti sauce and I don't want to disappoint her.   Is it too late to grab some more tomato seedlings and try to add some more? Is there a late summer/fall variety I should look for that will produce a good number of yummy tomatoes? Our falls are fairly warm and we don't get much frost until October or sometimes even November.  "
812,"Ivy, that can be used for fence, which is healthy too","I can read that in general, the leave/berry of an Ivy (Hedera Helix) is poisonous if we would eat it.   But: The question is: can it be poisonous, if we are close to it?   Example: it is all over a fence, and humans are next/very close to it for 60 years.  Can it be, that it is poisonous over air too? Since it is already poisonous if we would eat it.   Just searching for an Ivy type in ~middle Europe, which can be used to let it grow all over the fence, without fearing that we will get sick.   Googling around for hours, days (not joking), I didn't found any useful document that describes, that can an ex.: Hedera Helix cause any harm via air or not.  "
813,What is more important: lumens or PAR value?,"Grow Lamp manufacturers provide several pieces of information about their product:   PAR (Photosynthetic Active Radiation measured in W/m2) Photosynthetic Photon flux density (measured in µmol/s ) Lumens comparison to HPS lamp   I found that you need around 70000 lumens/m2 for best results. I also found lamps that have significantly higher PAR, even though they have 50% less lumens.  I would expect that PAR is the most important so I am confused why some literature states lumens as important factor. What should I aim for?  Lamp that matches lumens recommendation or lamp that has the biggest PAR number? "
814,How to safely use insecticides for Gesneriaceae plants?,"I migrated some of my Gesneriaceae plants out of my home. They include episcias, Streptocarpuses, and a few African violets. All of these plants grow from stem cuttings and thus, taking more space in my house. I noticed that grasshoppers and some unidentified insects eat their leaves and they turn ugly in just a couple of days.  I usually make natural insecticides from some garlic juice combined with little soap if necessary. And this works like a charm to tomatoes some and other fragile plants outside. However, if this is done to a my Gesneriaceae family plants it works, but it causes permanent brown spots or areas on the leaves in just couple of hours. These kind of plants don't tolerate water on their leaves even if it's pure water .  Perhaps, anyone ever encounter a similar case and know how to handle it? Tricks? Better insecticides? "
815,Can I take the seeds of the plant Strychnos nux vomica out of its packet with bare hands and sow them in my farm with bare hands?,"Can I take the seeds of the plant Strychnos nux vomica out of its packet with bare hands and sow them in my farm with bare hands? Or they(i. e., the seeds) would cause me a poisonous effect due to touching with bare hands? Or if the gardening gloves are to be used, then which type of gardening gloves should I use to sow them? "
816,How should young honey locust trees be pruned?,"I have four young (2-3 yrs) Honey Locust trees which seem to be doing very well this year. By that, I mean they've shown lots of growth and the leaves are very green and healthy.  The trunks of these young trees all have many new shoots of green leaves, and I wonder whether I should prune these off, or if it will be damaging to the tree.  I want them to grow tall, but also to provide ample shade. If I cut off the new lower branches, will it cause adverse effects?  I found this information:     In order to encourage your tree to branch out on top (to create a mushroom or umbrella style) you can remove the basal limbs. This will keep the base open and bare. You can also remove the top straggly limbs to encourage wide growth on top. (Source)   So, I think I should remove these lower new branches. If so, when would be the best time? If not, why? "
817,Xeriscaping and noxious weeds,"I purchased a home in Utah with an existing Xeriscaped landscaping area, and discovered later that some of the ""native"" plants were, in fact, Myrtle Spurge, a ground cover that's considered a noxious weed in at least Colorado and Oregon, but other states are quickly becoming wary of the plant.  It tends to grow quickly and spread, and I find that I am removing the new plants each year.  I'm thinking of eradicating all of it, but it does have some aesthetic qualities. I don't mind replacing it with another succulent plant, but I wonder if the noxious weed status is fully warranted?  Should I remove all trace of this plant from my xeriscape? "
818,Is this beetle on my apricot tree a pest?,My apricot tree is infested with black and white beetles on the branches. They are 2-3 cm / 1 inch long. I can't find an identification on the web. There is no visible damage to the tree. Is this beetle a pest? Should I be removing them?  My location is the Mediterranean / Middle East.    
819,how to fix a weedy lawn,"basically, I have had constructions and my lawn is killed. I hired someone around may to fix the problem and put new lawn for me. I am not sure what steps he did or didn't, But not only almost no grass grew there, but now it is filled with weeds, and feels bumpy and I can see small and big rocks. I didn't see that originally, because he covered it with straw and told us not to walk on it, just water it. I do not know what do I need to do now. I used grass and weed killer to kill whatever it is there and start new. but the more I read online the more I get confused. should I use power rake to remove the old grass and weeds, will it remove them all? should I till the yard, or not necessary? do I need to remove all small and big rocks and if yes, how? how do I make it even? I will be in and out of town till mid October, is it okay to plant the grass then? should I have the lawn ready and then plant the grass as soon as I come back on October, so I know I will be there to water it? if anyone can help guide me of what to do, I will really appreciate it.  "
820,Are there methods to grow adventitious roots at an arbitrary point of the stem?,"Tomato plants are known to grow adventitious roots.  I experienced it myself when a forgotten stem lied on the soil for a while.  Now I am curious if there are methods to cultivate such roots, other than that ?  That is, to make roots grow at an arbitrary location on the stem ?  I was thinking of tricks like a bag of water or soil, but it doesn't seem very convenient. "
821,What should I do with a leaf that was almost torn in half?,"I'm growing pepper plants on my window sills, and yesterday had a minor incident.  While reaching over one of the plants in the bathroom, to close the window above it, my foot slipped and I caught myself by grabbing the window frame, while doing so I crushed a leaf between my arm and the frame, and tore it almost all the way down the middle, lengthways.  Should I remove this leaf it? Leave it alone? Something else?  Here's a picture of the damaged leaf:   "
822,How can I reuse soil that mixed with crushed stone? (overall moderate content of crushed stone and brownish color),I just removed an old shed from my property. It had a base made of layers as following: -first layer: gravel -second layer: crushed stone -third layer: precast concrete slabs     It din not have the landscape fabric and the soil mixed with some crushing stone. The original soil in my yard is closer to clay. After I carefully removed the what I could as crushed stone I started separating the gravel from the mix of soil and crushed stone. The result was two heaps one of crushed stone which I plan to reuse for building a path and another of this mix between crushed stone and the finer particles (almost sandy) of the crushed stone. I was wondering if there is any way to use this as a base for some rocky garden or something of this sort. I live in Toronto and I often go to visit Edwards' garden where I can see hen and chickens or something similar planted in a sort of wall made from sand and ...bottle bottoms like below   I love this arrangements a lot and I wold like to be able to build something like this in my garden   Questions: -can I reuse the soil mentioned above to plant something like this? -are these (chicken and hens) perennials going to survive the harsh weather of Toronto (Canada)? I have seen then in Edwards Garden for years but I have not followed their evolution closely to see if they are actually struggling or thriving...  Edit: here you can see what the soil that I want to reuse looks like (last picture of the three showing soils and limestone crush or screed) 
823,Holes in hardy kiwi leaves,"On my balcony I have just planted my hardy kiwi. I found that some leaves, particularly smaller ones, have holes:    I'm using universal soil (ph 5.5-6.5). I'm watering it everyday as the flowerpot is quite big (40x40x40cm). Can it be that the soil is missing some minerals? Should I use some compost? Or this is a pest?     EDIT: I've just found that the buds of new branches have black tips. Is that relevant?   "
824,Will I get lemons from a tree grown from a lemon seed?,"I have planted seeds of a lemon and want to know, if I have to graft the lemon plant so I can get lemons?  Or will they in time grow without grafting? "
825,Crab apples haven't flowered this year - could a warm winter be to blame?,"We have two well-established crab-apples trees on our street, about 15 years old. The last few years they fruited pretty heavily and we were looking forward to harvesting fruit this year.  However there are no flowers at all this year. We had an unusually mild winter with hardly any days of frost and I wondered if this might be to blame? Do these types of trees rely on cold weather to 'reset their calendar'?  I know trees sometimes just don't fruit but there are two of them and these aren't saplings - and literally not one single flower on either! "
826,Do tomatoes produce seeds that are true to the parent plant's characteristics?,"I had an unusual tomato plant this year with off leaf formations.  It seemed to fruit reasonably well despite this.  If I collect and grow on seeds from this plant can I expect to see similar characteristics in its offspring?   I know that some plants produce wildly different characteristics in the seeded offspring, such as apples.  I do not know if tomato plants are generally ""true to seed"", ""true to type"", included to ""growing true"" or however else you phrase it.    The plant in question was the subject of an earlier question I had Why does my tomato plant have tightly shrivelled green leaves?  The conclusion being either virus, stress or genetic mutation.  If it is a mutation, it might appear in seeded descendants.  I would expect that a virus or stress would not show in descendants.   "
827,How poisonous is Oleander?,"I know that Oleander ( Nerium oleander ) is poisonous. Almost every book and webpage about this plant warns the readers. But how poisonous is this plant? I can touch the leaves without any skin irritation. I can prune it without using gloves. What happens if somebody ( a small child, a dog ) starts chewing a leaf? "
828,How much and how often do I have to water my potted plants?,"I have several potted plants. But my question is relate to general fact rather than about specific plant.   Do I have to water my plant when the top layer gets dry? I mean, I wake up in the morning and water my plant, which has dried soil by then. By noon the top soil again becomes dry. Do I water them again or the next day?  My pots vary in size from very small to medium an few big. I fill every pot 1-2 inch with water. Conditions are neither too hot, nor too cold.  Some of my plants are Ponytail Palm, Bamboo Palm, Norfolk Pine, Dracaena, Snake, Lime Plant, Sago Palm, Weeping Fig. "

831,Can I save my Dwarf Umbrella (Schefflera) Tree?! It's suddenly dying (possibly my cat?!),"Wondering if I can still ""save"" this dying branch on my dwarf umbrella tree (Schefflera) houseplant?? I've never had much luck when it came to house plants but this one was really growing on me (ha! no pun intended!) and now it's suddenly dying! I've had it for about 3 months and recently put in a couple of those fertilizer sticks (for the 1st time since I bought the plant) about a month ago.  ALSO, my cat has recently ""escaped"" up here to my office where I keep my plants.  It's 2 floors above where the cats live and it's closed off so there's a slim chance of them getting in here usually.  I didn't see her nibbling on the plant but it is possible she tried playing with it at least.  Not sure if she's the culprit or the fertilizer or something else?? Notice how the branch has turned an ugly brown color about 3/4 of the way up. I'm afraid it it will continue all the way up and kill off those last 2 ""bunches"".   Several leaves fell off at once (suddenly) only one other time and it was before the fertilizer. Other than that it's been healthy &amp; growing. Any advice/suggestions would be greatly appreciated! TY!!  "
832,Preventing invasive roots in raised garden beds,"Every year I remove and clean out the raised garden beds and add to the soil. This is the second year using the raised beds. I've noticed that when I mix in new soil and hit the soil, mostly clay, that the beds are sitting on there are tons off roots coming from the clay and spreading out within the raised bed soil. Is there a fabric of some kind that I can lay between the clay and the soil to prevent the invasive roots from getting into the bed? Also is there an alternative way such as placing stone, or some other type of organic base to prevent the roots? "
833,What should I do about standing water in potted plant?,"I have a large (70L?) moulded plastic pot which is filled with topsoil, and has a freshly planted lilac bush in it. I had noticed this pot did not have drainage holes at the bottom, but had thought that the large volume would allow for a fair amount of water to be locked away in the soil.  I've quickly noticed that I am getting a fair amount of standing water on top of the soil, even after fairly modest watering.  Should I drill drainage holes in the bottom of this pot, or is there another suggestion on how to deal with this situation? "
834,What is the minimum amount of space needed to grow a poppy?,"I live in an apartment in the city (located roughly central east-coast of US) and really miss my father's garden in the suburbs.  As such, I have figured out a scheme for window boxes that has allowed me to grow some nice herbs (basil and oregano).  I would like to make this work with a similar set-up for flowers on my other window sill. I have grown poppies before in the ground and they are just so beautiful and fun to grow that I would like to try to grow them in my current situation.  Now, I know they get very big and typically need a lot of space to grow to their full size, but I was wondering if it would be possible to grow a single poppy plant to at least a medium size in a standard window box (say roughly 500 cubic inches)?  If not, what flowers would you suggest to grow given my circumstances?  NOTE:  My windows get pretty good sunlight throughout the day.  After about 4 pm, there is a tree that kind of blocks the sun but for the most part light still makes it through. "
835,Can you have a shade-loving plant under full sun?,"While looking for information about caring for monstera deliciosa, I've sometimes read that they prefer shade. It seems this is the case for other plants as well, but I find it puzzling and I haven't found any explanation for it. Why would a plant prefer to receive less light? (NB: I'm not talking about how monstera deliciosa finds a tree when young by growing away from light, but rather in general for adult plants.)  My theory is that the culprit is actually heat, but then why just not say so? Has anyone tried to grow a shade-loving plant under intense light?  I want my monstera to grow well, is a shady spot really better than under a general-purpose LED light? "
836,Can I plant a Nordmann Christmas Tree in my garden?,"I have a lovely Christmas tree that is in a pot, is it ok for these to be planted in a garden ? Not sure how I post a photo?  "
837,How can I prevent squirrels (or other small mammals) from eating my tomatoes?,"Something has been eating my tomatoes just as they begin to ripen. Each day I've been finding one or more tomatoes half-eaten but still attached to the vine. On a couple of days I've also found bits of tomato skin scattered around a wooden chair a few feet away from the tomato plants.    I haven't seen the critter(s) in the act. I'm guessing it's a squirrel, as we have lots of them in the neighborhood, but it could be some other small mammal.  I've grown tomatoes in the Sacramento region for years and this is the first time I've had this problem. Does anyone have any ideas on whether it's likely to be a squirrel or some other animal? More importantly, is there anything I can do to keep the critters away?  Update: I've selected a ""best"" answer, but please feel free to add your suggestions if you have a better idea. I'd love to find a way to deter the tomato-eating critters without going to the trouble of enclosing my tomato garden in a net. "
838,Do you uproot plants in a no dig garden with mulch,"When using the no dig gardening method with mulched vegetable beds, what do you do in fall with the old plants?   I know that in no dig you do not want to disturb the soil. Also when mulching it's best to leave the mulch at the surface.  But now it's autumn and I have to take out some annual vegetable plants. Some of them are quite big and have developed large root systems. When I pull them out a lot of soil comes away with the roots and some mulch gets mixed inside the newly created hole.   Should I keep uprooting or should I just cut the stalks where they meet the ground?   That seems less disturbing to the garden bed, but with some big plants it's leaving a lot of big hard roots in the ground. Since the ground is frozen in winter where I live I don't know if they will have time to rot down. "
839,Planting on pit started avocado,"I have a couple of avocado seedlings that I started roughly at the same time, one suspended over water and one planted in soil.  The water method seems to have worked slightly quicker, but it will soon get to the point where it needs planting on. I'm comfortable with doing that, my question is:  Should I remove the pit from the sapling? If not now, when? Or should I ever?   They are both to become house plants, not produce trees.  "
840,Can I touch the leaves of my pinguicula?,Is it safe for both me and the plant if I touch the leaves of my pinguicula plants? Are there any precautions I should take or things I should avoid doing? 
841,What is this white discoloration on my lemon tree dirt (picture)?,"Below is a picture of one of my indoor lemon trees. They are all in self watering pots, and they drink ~3 litre of tap water per week.  What concerns me is the white/orange stuff on the dirt. To the right of the picture have I dug a little bit down, and it seams to only be at the serfuce.  Question  Does anyone know what this is? And how to prevent it?   "
842,Dionaea miscipula (venus flytrap) laid over the ground,"First of all, I live in Valencia, Spain, where the temperatures now are about 16-20°C.  I have a dionaea muscipula that I bought at Lidl store and I moved it to a plastic pot. I bought it being the half of it size. The plant is indoors next to a window with about 4-5 hours of full sun at the afternoon.  I bought the plant with its leaves already lying over the ground, and since then nothing changed. It's growing new leaves, that, at the early stages of the leaf, are straight and pointing up, but when the leaf become wider and the traps grow the full leaf falls to the ground. Some pictures attached.     Is it normal? Maybe its related to this variety of Venus Flytrap. Should I do something? When I search pictures on google every image shows plants growing straight up, none as mine.  Thanks in advance! "
843,What is the garden wire used for?,"I noticed that the wire named Twist tie is also named Garden wire. But I can't find such wires used in gardening when searching ""Garden wire"" on Google images.  What is the typical use for this kind of wire in gardening? For joining plants? Or for making small fences? "
844,How low of temperature can hot pepper plants tolerate?,"How low of of temperatures can my hot pepper plants (I have a few different types) tolerate overnight?  What about the fruit (some is ripe, some is not) on the plants?  I have a few nights forecasted as lows of 38 F coming up and am wondering if I need to move them indoors or into the garage.  All the plants are in pots if that makes a difference. "
845,My lettuce is flowering - does that mean it has bolted?,"I planted a batch of ""zesty blend"" lettuce seeds. They seem to be doing fine, but suddenly they started flowering:    Have they bolted? They look healthy otherwise. Still edible? "
846,How can large Sassafras trees be dug and transplanted?,"We have a client who would like to plant a number of large-ish (5""+ caliper) sassafras trees on his property on eastern Long Island, NY. Planting small container trees and waiting for them to grow in is not an option.  Can Sassafras this large be dug? When is the best time to do so? Are there any tricks to maximizing success rate beyond the standard practices? "
847,Black spot on leaf of cardboard cycad (zamia furfuracea),"I live in Korea.  I think that my precious cardboard cycad has some problem.  Where the plant came from?   I purchased cardboard cycad on the internet. It was delivered in 36hr. When it was delivered, it was okay.   How did I transplanted it?   After one week, I transplanted cardboard cycad to the larger terracotta pot. I used purchased soil from the gardener. Also, I gathered the pebbles( for the drainage, I spread it the bottom of the new pot) from the mountain. But the pebbles were sterilized using boiling water.   How I managed it?   I placed the pot inside the house. The location of the pot in the house was  near the window of full-bright direct sunlight. I watered it whenever the top of the soil (3~4 cm deep) of the pot is completely dry. Temperature of the house is 15 to 20 degrees Celcius.   So, What is the Problem?   At first, small black spot arises on the back side of the leaf. Like the picture on the below. (It is not brown fur of the cardboard cycad.)      Then, gradually, the black spot gets bigger and bigger. And finally, center of the spot burns. At this point, black spot shows on the front side of leaf. It looks like the pictures on the below.      What do you think is the problem? Is it my mistake? Or it is some kind of disease? "
848,Can I revive my basil that wasn't watered for a week?,"I went on vacation and left a generous amount of water in my supermarket bought basil pot that I keep outside of the window. But it is very sunny in that spot as it's high up and facing South, and the last couple of days have been hot I think, so the water was far from enough.  Most of the leaves are yellow or brown and the plant looks very thin and dry. But there are also some very tiny green new leaves and the blossoms it had are still there.     Is it worth trying to revive that thing or should I discard it? If I try to get it back up, how should I best go about it? I already added water yesterday night, but that disappeared completely, so I added more this morning.  "
849,"Roots growing out the top of plant, last attempt?","Some of my coworkers found a mismanaged plant and gave it to me to rescue.  It was very dry and upon further inspection roots had grown over a small plastic pot, completely covering it. Then someone had put it in another pot. Some larger roots started growing out the top of the plant... Do they do this as a last attempt to find water?  I carefully cut out the inside pot and soaked two of the roots in a glass of water for a few hours until I could get soil and repot it. Did I take the right steps? Any suggestions? "
850,Does having pebbles around the base of my Jade plant cause problems?,"For looks, I have the soil around my Jade plant covered with small rounded pebbles for a different textured look.   Does this actually cause water or moisture retention? Should I simply have the soil open to the air to dry out properly between waterings? With this pebble cover on the soil, could I be introducing other issues about the plant, such as disease, bugs, etc? "
851,Part of my bamboo is dying & Small bumps near the branch growing from the node,"I have noticed over the past few months that one of my 3 bamboo stocks is turning brown, but strangely only part of it is brown while there is a small sliver on green that remains. Is there anything i could do to stop this?  I have also noticed that on all of my stocks, in the same place that there have been small tan/brownish bumps that are hard to the touch in the area where the branch connects to the node. What are these bumps? Is it scale or some other disease? Or is it new growth?         "
852,Are Scaffolding Nets are good options to put on my Trees to protect them from Birds and Squirrels?,"I was recently planning to buy some bird netting to protect my trees from Birds and Squirrels, but found a cheaper alternative , ""Scaffolding Net""  I have never seen or touched one , in a close up situation. But they seem to be a good alternative to the bird nets.   Has anyone tried them for their trees ?  Questions I have is mostly inclined towards  .Do they allow enough Sunlight through to the Trees . Do they work well for the use mentioned ?   Adding another question to this :  Does the size of mesh matter in those nets ? As long as it allows enough air to pass through.  "

855,How can I propagate a rubber tree plant from a cutting?,"I wanted to propagate a cutting from my rubber tree, so I followed the instructions in the guides below:  Garden Guides eHow Gardening Know How Garden Web Forum  I trimmed a long branch off of my rubber tree, cut it diagonally about 5"" from the highest bud, dusted it with rooting hormone, and set it in some potting soil. I then enclosed the pot and I have been keeping it watered and humidified with a water sprayer. Pictures are below.  It has been about 2 weeks since this procedure, and I am wondering if there is anything more that I can do to ensure this cutting thrives. The instructions say that I should pull the plant from the soil and check for new roots, but I'm afraid that doing so might hurt the plant. Also, the leaves have become floppy and are now touching the sides of my enclosure.  Should I pull up the cutting to check for new roots? What else can I do to help my cutting take root?

858,Will pre-germinating grass seed produce a green lawn in less time than just seeding and watering properly?,"I have heard and read quite a bit about the benefits of pre-germinating grass seed in terms of getting a lawn growing quicker than it would if you simply seeded.   The procedures I've seen involve several days of soaking, rinsing, draining, changing water, etc. before spreading the seed, but it seems like they all start counting ""time till green"" from when they sow. But if the preparation time is factored in, is there still a time savings compared to seeding into good soil and maintaining proper moisture?   And are there other benefits/costs that might affect a decision to pre-germinate? "

861,Is my cactus dying? Or what is this?,  So I just bought this cactus two weeks ago. First cactus or plant I’ve ever had. When I got it the plant was dry af. So I watered it a little bit and every 2 days or so I put it on the window sill slowly introducing it to sun since I have no idea how long it’s been sitting inside the Home Depot section. Now I noticed it’s got there weird brown stem looking things that look like it’s growing out? I have no idea what it is. These additional brown stems (they aren’t like the stems growing thorns) form a ring around the cactus.   Update: here are some photos of a few I managed to remove.   Any idea what it is?

864,Will mint die if planted within a month of early frost?,"I'm trying to propagate my mint plant, intending to eventually transplant the main growth (maybe next year). For now, I've taken some cuttings and I'm waiting for them to root.  As of writing, it's now end of August. According to my local area notes, early frost is the first couple of days of October.

It's humid to the touch and alive but green in color.   I'm watering it and I noticed it has new purple flowers on the same stem. Should I cut the green flower? Should I leave the plant alone? It's September and I thought there wouldn't be any more flowers for the rest of the year, so this is a nice surprise.    "
866,How to halt the growth but leave the tree?,"I have a twisted /contorted / japanese/ willow tree (it is I'd say about 20ft high at the moment )next to my small garden pond. My son planted it (from a cutting) over the resting place of a deceased pet 14 or so years ago. It has grown very fast has no main trunk but four main parts, predictably perhaps, growing outwards rather than straight up. It has now been pollarded back twice. I am now wondering as the garden is small whether I ought soon to think of cutting it down and somehow stopping the root growth (chemically?) but I would prefer to retain the body of the tree in order to; a) to install a platform- balcony affair where I can sit, and b) thus to provide some shade and cover for the pond and it's inhabitants. Is this even possible? "

The plants and flowers look healthy, at least to me, but some of the flowers at the bottom of the plant appear to by dying. I also haven't managed to get any beans yet.  Questions   Should I be doing something to stop the flowers wilting at the bottom or is this part of the process, if so, what? Should I be getting beans yet? the plants have had flowers for about 4-5 weeks now. Is there a pollination issue? There have also been some ants on the plants, is this something to worry about? Should I be pinching the tips off the plants yet, as some sources recommend?   Photos  Note the dying flowers at the bottom.  "
868,Young Indoor Lychee Trees: Do I prune?,I germinated some Lychee seeds when it was really hot and humid in NYC this summer (~13 weeks ago). They grew really quickly and healthily until mid October when a new layer of leaves sprouted. The new ones struggled to grow and older leaves started to get brown spots. I thought it was either due to lower light levels or lack of plant nutrition. I bought an LED UV light and put some miracle grow plant food in their pots and now they seem to be doing ok. See pictures:  Question:  Does this look like a nutrition issue that i have solved or does it look like disease? should I expect the brown leaves to get healthy again? Should i prune them off or just leave them where they are? I have no gardening experience. No idea when pruning is required. Any background info on looking after a young tree would be great! 
869,Spring onion regrowth and seeding,"I have been growing spring onions and am not sure whether or not I am regrowing them the best way. I have a few questions.  I have been cutting the spring onions at their base so that the regrow and I don't have to plant more spring onions. Can I keep doing this forever, or will the taste or size of the spring onion start to suffer if I do this a number of times.  I also want to be able to let the spring onions go to seed so that I can regrow them. I have one Spring onion plant that has just developed a 'bud' like object. (Early Spring) Will this flower and seed? If so, how can I get my other plants to do this too?  Can these two methods be used in combination? For example, can I cut the spring onions at the base until taste starts to suffer, then let them go to seed and replant the seeds?  Answers to any or all of these questions would be appreciated.

870,Affect on Netting on Fruit trees that have Flowers and Bees,"I am looking to use a Tree net for my fruit trees to protect them from Birds and Squirrels . One of the trees I plan to spread it over is the "" Manilkara zapota "" Tree. I had some good production this past month but most of them were lost being eaten up . But it still has a lot of unriped fruits and I was planning to apply the net over it.   Now , While I was standing under it yesterday, I saw it still has a lot of Flowers and literally over 10-15 Bees on those flowers , which are needed for pollination. Now if I was to use the Netting, then I am guessing that would also affect these bees from entering the tree to help in pollination .    One Option I was thinking of going with is the one with a larger mesh size to allow bees through, but small enough for squirrels and Birds. But before I went ahead, wanted to ask the community how important would those bees be for the fruits ?  Can I proceed with netting without worrying about them  ?  "
871,Blueberry bush not looking very lively,"I have been growing a blueberry bushes and am not sure that I am having much success. The plant doesn't appear to have done much since it was planted and just appears to be slowly loosing leaves and flowers.  Would anyone have any recommendations? maybe the soil is not acidic enough? Maybe the plant is not getting enough water? Is it just not the right time of year? (mid winter to early spring) I also think I might have planted the plant too high up and some of the roots are exposed.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.  Photos (click to enlarge)  These are photos of the blueberry plant soon after being planted (14th July - Note southern Australian climate):     These are photos of the blueberry plant now (10th September) The first one is an overall shot and the second shows the exposed roots, I understand that this is not ideal, but I don't think that it is the main issue:    "
872,Is my rubber plant unhappy?,"I bought this ficus a week ago. Already one leaf has dropped and another has these weird spots – but at the same time one new leaf has come through green and another looks to be on its way.  Are the weird spots sign of a fingus or something else terrible?    It was dusty, so I washed the leaves (plant-based eco washing up liquid I figured would be ok).    It's still in the pot from the shop, and the soil seems to be just as damp as it was seven days ago.  It's about three metres from a big window, the light isn't intense at    all.   Never owned a rubber before so maybe I panic too soon?           "
873,Storing bare root trees short term before planting in permanent location?,"If bare root trees are dug up to be sold or moved and planted, how should they best be stored until planting if it could be a few days (e.g. 1-7 days)?   I usually buy bare root trees with roots wrapped in plastic bags, often with some substrate (wood shavings, sand, soil) and plenty of moisture. I understand if I'd have bare root trees waiting a season or more to be planted, they need to be heeled in or temporarily planted in an actual bed/mound. For just a few days, can the bare root trees just stay in that plastic &amp; substrate they originally come in? Is it better to pot them so they can be watered &amp; drained well during the few days until planting?   Closely related question, what substrates are suitable for bare root trees when they're waiting a few days before getting planted? The ones I'm aware of, in order of most to least optimal (maybe some incorrectly):   loose, fluffy loamy soil sand wood shavings mulch finished compost   In all cases, they'd be kept slightly moist (some watered more often than others to achieve that).

874,How to reopen a raised bed,"Last year my wife and I built a small 4' x 8' raised bed and were pretty happy with our success (both first-time gardeners).  Last October I reached out to a 'master gardener' in our area and asked for her advice in closing the bed for the year. She instructed me to:   Pull out all organic matter (roots, vegetables, weeds, etc.) and discard Aerate the top soil by turning it over a few times ""Seal"" it with a layer of leaves   I followed the advice. Now I'm in the process of reopening the garden, and the leaves are still there, as well as a few plants (weeds?, baby trees?) that I didn't expect to see.  I'm wondering:   What should I do with the leaves? Remove them? Put top soil &amp; compost mix on top of them? Roto-till the first six inches of dirt and effectively 'mulch' them into the existing top soil? And what do I do with the weeds that have already sprouted up? I could rip them out but am worried that perhaps their roots have already grown deep into the bed.  "
875,Is it common to only sod a portion of a lawn?,"In relation to this question, I have leveled a big portion of my lawn and am looking into laying sod now as opposed to seed, mostly b/c I don't want to wait for the seed to fully grow.   However, it will only be portion of the lawn, in which case part of the lawn will probably look brand new, and the other portions will look worn (until next year when I do the rest!) My question is, is this common practice? Or is sod only used for small patches or an entire lawn? "
876,Losing chamadorea elegans stalks,  So I’ve lost about two of these little stalks over the pas couple of weeks and I’m not sure what the problem is. They are sitting in a place a couple meters from a window but there is enough sunlight to make some sort of shadow behind the plants. (Indirect sunlight) they certainly don’t get overwatered as I don’t water them everyday. Could I be underwatering the plants? I water them a couple times a week but I may be waiting for the soil to be too dry before I water it. Could this be an underwatering problem?

878,Clearing composted matter from weed seeds by using heat,"I successfully created several composts over the last two years using, what I believe is the ""cold compost method"". I have an open heap which I turn from time to time during the initial year. I used it in the second year for all kind of things mainly for enriching the soil, compost tea and for a seed-starting-mix (I even used it pure). In my eyes it works well in these three kinds of applications.  However there is one thing which I'd like to improve. Especially for the seed-starting-process I noticed that there is plenty unwanted germination most likely coming from unwanted seeds in the compost.  Is there a way to clear, posterior, the compost from weed-seeds?  I read somewhere that putting the soil into the microwave helps. With that I assume that the applied heat will kill at least the seeds and maybe other unwanted ""things"". Can I use an oven as well? Is cooking the compost-soil over an open fire a possibility? What would be the highest temperature allowed? In other words, is there a risk of reducing the quality of the compost when it gets too hot? "

881,Replanting and propagating old Lucky Bamboo tree with newborn stalks,"I have had two Lucky Bamboo trees for the past 5 years now. I grow them in water and they have been doing well. Four months ago the two of them started growing new stalks. The new growth is causing a weight problem and I am afraid they will not be able to sustain the growth in their current situation.  I watched a few videos on replanting Lucky Bamboo; however, I couldn't find any cases similar enough to my own. Is there any chance that cutting this new growth and replanting it will result in a healthy and productive plant similar to the two plants the stalks have been cut from? If that is the case then how should I go about the process?    "
882,What happens when tomato seedlings are overwatered?,"Some of my tomato seedlings received too much water and it shows. Some of the lower leaves on them have yellowed and the rest of the foliage looks a little lighter but otherwise healthy. Yellowing of the leaves doesn't look like disease just what you get with too much water.   I put them in the ground a couple of days ago. First snipped off the lower yellow leaves (which had even started to grow suckers) to bury the stem deep as well as to get rid of the yellow leaves.  Soil is adequately fertilized and calcium, magnesium are high. Iron is in the acceptable range but on the low side (3.5 ppm).  Are there going to be any adverse affects? Is there anything I can do to help?  Edit: Forgot to mention the roots looked good with no foul smells. Picture has a bit of a color cast but roots looked white and clean from what I could see.   "
883,"My particular geranium situation for winter (must keep it at desk at work, can't do it at home)","I have a geranium which I really like, and I need to do the right thing for it this Fall/Winter. It's too cold here to keep it outdoors, but I can't keep it at my house because we have a cat who will eat it (despite being the greatest cat ever).  So my only option is to keep it at my desk at work. I have a fluorescent lamp under my shelves, which keep light on the plant during the day. I don't have access to direct sunlight at my desk.   The room temperature here is about 70 Fahrenheit. It is living in a pot that is meant to hang and drain, and I can water it and let it drain into my trashcan anytime I like.   Meanwhile, it is very long-legged, and I'd like to trim it way back to allow for more bushiness. I can't put it in a paper bag and hang it, like I've read online.  So here are my questions, pertaining to this particular situation, and please see images below:   How often should I water it? How far back should I trim it? Is it even possible to keep it like this without it dying?      "
884,Boy this rubber tree has issues,"I've had this rubber tree for about five years and it looked great during its first year.  However I moved around a lot and I moved the Pheadrus around even more (yesterday I learned what a stress it is for these guys). At some point it started to lose leafs and then from under the ground grew what seemed like his children. Three years ago I remember there being three separate stems. Now it's seven.  Most of the older stems are now pretty bare, as some of the new ones. Only one or two have some good leafs. I'm thinking of cutting six of the seven right where they stick out of the soil. Can I do that?  Now, there are other issues. The upper leafs have whitish stains on the upper surface. Most of the leafs are yellowish on the bottom sides of them. Some of the leafs have dry patches on the edges. I'm not sure if there's fungi or something like that...  Can someone please give me some tips on how to bring this plant back to good life? Ideally it would have one long stem with nice big leaves and no branches. I don't mind if it takes another five years to help Pheadrus grow into its best version of itself :)   "

I pinched off the first set of flowers and pruned the plant a bit, but the leaves are still drying out towards the top. I'm afraid of pruning too much even though there is some new growth near the bottom. I noticed that the bottom of the stem is also becoming more 'woody.'  Does basil require more liberal pruning to thrive? Would the temperature of the soil in the black pot be negatively affecting its growth? Perhaps I'm just not watering it enough. What is the typical life span of a basil plant? Any tips/suggestions are appreciated.   "

894,How should I increase the amount of water coming from my irrigation system?,"Over the last weekend, I installed the irrigation system for our vegetable garden which is square-shaped. I used 1/2"" poly tubing for the main water supply line and then used 1/4"" drip line with built-in 1 GPH emitter (12"" spacing) for each row. For the connectors between 1/2"" and 1/4"", I used 2 GPH emitters.  Two problems however:  a) Very little water comes out of the emitters. The size of the spots watered by the emitters are so small.  b) Many vegetables still do not receive the water because no hole exists on the 1/4"" tubing around those vegetables.  I am wondering what would be the easiest solution to fix this. Would just punching more holes on the 1/4"" drip lines solve the problem? Or, should I use a larger drip line than 1/4"" to deliver more water?  Also, I ran the irrigation system for 10 minutes. Should I run more? "
895,When should I prune espalier apple trees?,"I have a row of 5 beautiful espalier apple trees (Jonagold, Granny Smith and Gravenstein) that are about 4 years old, and they put out huge amounts of growth over the summer. I've been pruning the first growth back in late June, but when should I prune the growth from the rest of the summer? Is it better to do it in September when there's still light and the trees still have some leaves, or wait until mid-winter (February?) when they have lost all their leaves?  I'm north of 45 degrees latitude, so winters are dark, but we do not get down to freezing for more than a few days in the winter, and there is frequent rain.  I've read the excellent answers in this post When is it ok to prune an overgrown apple tree? but I'm not sure how I need to think differently about espalier trees.  "
896,What plants/trees will help (or hinder) bind a river bank together?,"Our garden border is defined by a steep bank about 4m high, into a small river - not quite a cliff but so steep you would struggle to climb it. The river bends into our border at one point which raises questions of erosion over time.  We're in the north of England in a fairly wooded area so the bank here is in partial shade.  I wondered if there are particular plants or trees which would be good to encourage to grow at the top and on the slope of the bank, which will help bind the soil together and reduce erosion risk?  Equally, if there are things which would be detrimental - whose roots might break the bank up, or whose weight/height make them likely to be blown down and the bank damaged?     "
897,Is Mike McGrath correct when he says vegetable scraps shouldn't be added to compost?,"I'm composting for the first time this year, in a back-yard composter. I have some leaves in there, and I regularly throw in my coffee grounds. I also occasionally throw in vegetable and fruit scraps.  When I look online (websites, TED talks, etc.) it seems that people often say that it's ""okay"" to put in vegetable and fruit pieces, but then they act like it's not going to do much for you in terms of end-of-process compost. The common thing said here is ""the only thing worth mixing from your kitchen with your leaves is coffee"".  However, fruit and vegetable pieces have a C:N ratio of somewhere between 25:1-35:1 it seems, which is almost perfect with the 30:1 ratio that people say is ideal. So from this information alone, one might guess that fruit/vegetables are actually really good for your compost pile, not just tolerable.  So which is it? Are they good or are they merely okay.

898,Can I plant the Lychee plant from the Fruit Seed ?,"I am not a pro at gardening or farming, and some people do tell me not to plant seeds from the fruit, and rather buy them and plant them.  But what do you guys think about planting Lychee Fruit seeds directly ?  Is it fine to just remove the pulp(from the fruit) , Wash - Dry and Plant the seed directly ?  Or should I buy the seeds from the market and plant them ?   Thanks!  "
899,What are the consequences of not removing all the buds on my young lemon tree?,"I have a potted dwarf Meyer lemon tree which is just entering its first flowering season (well at least the first that I've had it - I don't know how old it was when I bought it from the nursery.) I have seen a lot of things which say that it is very important to remove all the buds from citrus trees in their first year, or even their first few years.  Is this true? Would there be bad consequences if I left a couple of buds? "
900,What type of weed is this and what is an effective way of removing it?,"This weed kind of took over my front yard (around 300 sq ft). I'd like to remove it all and then mulch most of the area  What type of weed is it and what would be an effective way of removing it? In the past, I have used vinegar with success, but right now it is cold and humid here (Pacific Northwest) and I feel like vinegar does best on hot and sunny days. No toxic stuff like Roundup please.  If I go the vinegar + salt route, is it effective in the weather conditions described above? How careful do I need to be in order to not harm existing plants?   "
901,What type of soil for transplanting bamboo?,"Do you need special soil to transplant bamboo? Also, do you have to keep it in water or can you use potting soil? I have tried regular potting soil, but the bamboo died. "
902,How to grow Trailing Rosemary as a ground cover in very heavy clay?,"I want to cover a large area that is on a steep slope with ground cover. There is absolutely no soil at all, it's all pure clay: hard rock when dry and soft when wet.  I was thinking of putting a large pipe (20cm to 40cm diameter) in a hole and filling it with good soil as shown on the picture below. I will also add a small pipe that goes out of the bottom end to drain the excess water.    Will a 20cm diameter x 40cm deep pipe be enough for the roots? My goal is to plant a Trailing Rosemary.  Does anyone has a better way?  Here is the Trailing Rosemary:   source: nzplantpics.com "
903,Caring tips for a new lawn,"I live in El Dorado Hills, CA (northern CA). A new lawn (~150 sq ft) was laid ~5 month ago. I was told by the builder that they planted 90/10 fescue/bluegrass sod for grass.  I have been trying to take care of the lawn by mowing it once a month and watering it regularly. However, the condition of the lawn seems to have deteriorated. A recent picture:     I am seeing a lot of dead grass spots appear. Don't understand why this is happening. I believe I made a couple of mistakes.   On a couple of occasions, I mowed the lawn too low. I've corrected that by moving the setting on my lawn mower to maximum height. For fertilizer, I am using Milorganite (organic). In early August, I applied about 2lbs with a spreader (instructions say 35 lbs / 2500 sq ft). This was the first application. Instead of 'greening' the grass, a lot of it seems to have died. For watering, the sprinklers are set to 20 min at 6:00 AM for every other day. I will reduce that as we get into the fall/rainy season. The soil underneath is mostly clay. Temperatures have definitely been high (100-105) in the previous month so maybe that has caused stress on the grass.   Given the picture above, what am I potentially doing wrong? Any recommendations for any corrective actions I can take for the lawn to recover back to health?   Update on 4/18/2018:  Here are two pictures shows the update. I overseeded twice (once in Sept/Oct 2017 and once in late Jan 2018). We have gotten quite a bit of rain in the last 2 months and the grass has come back quite strong (I think). Still some bald spots in a few areas but I will add more seed to those areas in the coming fall. Will fertilize in May. Started mowing once per week. Things are looking much better! Thanks.     "
904,Vine specific pruning and training,I planted a vine a year ago and it's doing fine and growing well.  I am training it to go over the fence to reach the pergola on the other side.  How should I prune it for next year's growth and when?  ? 
905,Should I bury my blackberry/raspberry canes in mulch over winter?,"I have some blackberries and red raspberries, and I'm not sure how to winter-prep them. After pruning (which I'm skipping this year, since the primocane raspberries are only in their first year), how should I mulch them?  Should I take them down from the trellis and lay them flat on the ground, and pile straw, leaves, and woodchips on them by about an inch?  I'm in USDA zone 6a.  And if I get cow manure, should I put it under the mulch? Likely I won't get cow manure until spring. I don't have compost.  Do I also need to add mouse-traps/rat-traps around to kill rats as some suggest?  Will the rats damage the plants? If not, the plants are far enough from my house that I don't care if the mice are there. Are poison traps alright (the bait stations with solid blocks they munch on), despite it being near plants I care about? "
906,Should I rub my nasturtium seeds with a nail file before planting?,"I bought Burpee Nasturtium Fordhook Favorites Mix Nasturtium seeds. Yesterday I planted a few, using the sowing instructions for depth and distance. I obviously hadn't looked closely enough at the package because today I noticed this message above the sowing instructions:       NOTE: To aid germination, rub seed with nail file.    I've planted these same seeds for a few years, and they've grown well, so I'm wondering about the importance of that advice. It makes sense that the seed might sprout more easily if the coating isn't too hard, so maybe that's the point. However, I'm afraid I might damage the seed by giving it a manicure!   If that is indeed important, how much rubbing is enough? Also, should I dig up those that I just planted or let them be?  A picture of the seeds still in the packet shows all different sizes and shapes. The textured outer shells are fairly hard, and the dark brown seeds look like they've fallen out of the shells. In the past, I've just planted whatever I've found in the packet and ended up with lots of healthy plants.   I have a feeling I'm overthinking this, but am just asking since I've never seen this before, and of course I want maximum germination success.      "
907,What is acid soil?,"Everyone talks about acid soil, but what does it mean when someone says my soil is acid?  How does soil get that way?  Is it a good thing?  Is it a bad thing? "
908,How can I encourage the side growth of a mango seedling through pruning?,"I have a mango seedling that I started from seed about mid-July, so it's a few months old. It is now about a foot tall and just sprouted few more leaves. I also have an avocado seedling growing, and looking online I see that it's recommended to cut the avocado back to about half its height when it reaches about 6-8 inches. Perhaps my Google-fu is a bit weak when it comes to horticulture, but I'm not seeing too many recommendations when it comes to mango seedling pruning, but I do see some tips on pruning(tipping) trees in general.  My question is, how much should be pruned, just the first few inches of growth, or a more dramatic cut/half the height? Also, is pruning a seedling that is a few months old too hasty of a move? I don't want to end up with a leafy stick, or worst, a dead stick.  Also, FYI, I'm growing this indoor year round since I live in an apartment, and I have a few grow lights set up as well.     "
909,Painting concrete pots to help conserve water,"I asked this question about my potted lilly pillys. I have another separate question.  I live in a temperate climate zone. I have plants on a east facing balcony- they get  sun from about sunrise till the middle of the day.   I have Syzygium smithii, lilly pillys native to Australia, planted in square concrete planters. They are approx 2.5 foot wide and deep, and  2.5 foot tall.  They are unpainted (I had wanted to paint them before they were planted and was talked out of it).. they dry out very quickly.   Would painting the outside help conserve water, and if, so would an oil based paint be the best?  Would it have been better to paint them on the inside?  What sort of material is good to retain water, ie terracotta, concrete?   "
910,Opinions on combining shredded bark and compost as mulch,"I'm having a hard time finding anything through search and I'm hoping others here might have experience or opinions doing what I want to do.  I really like the look of black mulch (hardwood mulch dyed black commonly used in the USA) but dying my existing mulch is not practical and I'm not too keen on adding dye in the first place.  I have some garden beds that are currently mulched with cedar bark mulch. I'd like to start mulching with compost instead for a number of reasons, not just color.  I don't want to have to go through the hassle of removing the old mulch first and was hoping I could just start applying compost over top of the existing mulch (maybe 2-3"" of existing mulch).   Has anyone done anything similar to this and has info on how it worked out?  I'm specifically looking for any information from people who have tried this such as will the compost help the cedar break down faster? Will the compost seep down between the bark after a few few rains and look nasty? Will the combination cause problems such as poor water infiltration?  It looks like I might be doing a little small scale test as a critter decided to dig up a shrub I recently planted and scattered the compost that was in the whole around the mulched area. :( "
911,Hard potatoes harvested,"First time grower in Michigan, partial shade and probably not the best soil.  The red potatoes I got out first were very hard.  Why?  What can I do to prevent this with the rest of them before they are harvested?  Anything I can do for these dears? "
912,Corkscrew Willow Bark Peeling and Bugs,"We have a Corkscrew Willow tree which currently has bark peeling off. We took the rest of the bark off to allow the tree to dry (to prevent moisture in the tree). I was wondering if we need to spray something on it? Also, we have been seeing some smaller dead branches on it lately, not sure if this is normal or not. Here some pictures of it, there's a bunch of random things we seen on it, including bugs, some sort of mushrooms (from the moisture?), and bumps:  Click for a larger version:          "

Is someone able to identify what kind of plants it is ?  Is this plant can cause trouble to my bonsai ?  (bonus) In the second photo, could someone identify the really small sprouts?   Thanks a lot for your help.     "
914,How can I control umbrella grass?,"How can I get rid of my umbrella grass (papyrus, Cyperus alternifolius) completely? Will glyphosate kill it? Or do I have to dig it out? I've cut it to the ground. It was taking over too much space.  "
915,Common causes of burnt tips on herbs,What are common causes of these burnt tips?   Over/under fertilization? Too much/little light? Nutrient deficiency?  This is Korean shiso/perilla growing in a deep water culture. I've also seen it on basil grown in soil.   
916,Tiny shot holes in leaves of salad bowl crop,"I've got a crop of mixed lettuce, raddish, carrots, kale growing in my 'salad bowl crop'a 6'X 6' area.  I just noticed the tiny shot holes of (flea beetles) all throughout the different varieties.  Never have had flea beetles in this garden so I was a bit surprised. (Could have come in via the bales of not so decomposed compost that I used to improve this pumice soil)  Could be something else as I couldn't find a live beetle in the soil, roots or the leaves (during the day).  I'll be out there tonight.  What else could it be other than flea beetles, any ideas? What I pulled up on the internet was kinda lame but I didn't search that hard.  The information said they fed during the hot temps of daylight? And yet all I could find were tiny possibly beetles dessicated in the soil.  Does anyone have any ideas so I don't have to use NEEM?  Gee, would that even work?  How about Bacillus thuringiensis made with beetles in mind?  I know they were working on one decades ago but haven't heard anything. There was one for caterpillars the one we know best, one for flies and mosquitos and one for beetles.  Three types of BT.  Have not yet seen the beetle and fly varieties yet.  Wouldn't it be a good thing to be able to have the BT for flies and mosquitos NOW? Let me know if you've heard anything about BT.  These beetles must come out at night...the leaves are completely peppered with some damage to the crowns of these lettuces.  Anyhoo, I am in the middle of majoring canning and dehydrating and getting frazzled.  I thought I'd ask for  help.    I'll send a picture by tomorrow of course...but tiny tiny little holes...shot hole only 1/4 the size and smaller.  Seem to love the arugula and a red leaf lettuce best.  Thanks...stormy "
917,Cutting Back Leggy French Lavender,"Seattle  I've got a whole string of french lavenders that I've sort of 'trained' to be sort of like short hedges.  Unfortunately, they've fought back by getting woody and leggy. How hard can I/should I cut them back to re-shape them properly?  -Sometimes- they seem get new growth from the wood, but mostly not. How do I tell what new growth will come from and what won't?  Finally, is now the time of year to consider this? "
918,Help identifying a bug that's attacking my Mimosa pudica,"I have a sensitive plant (Mimosa pudica) that has gotten infested with tiny  black bugs. They're roughly 0.76mm (3/100ths of an inch) long. I'd like some help identifying what they are and how to treat them. I've sprayed them with Neem Oil. That seems to kill them, but then they appear again. Something is wilting the leaves on the plant, turn them brown, and making webbing (similar to a spider) on the leaves--especially the new shoots. When I poked the black bugs with a pin, some of them would disappear (jump, perhaps?).  I've circled one of the bugs with a ballpoint pen for size comparison:   Here's the little bugger under a microscope:   I found this in the webbing:   I also found this mite on one of the dead leaves:    Also on the dead leaf was this (an egg?):   All the microscope images are at the same magnification.

920,Hog fuel on newly prepared lawn bed- horrible idea that can be saved?,"So not thinking too swiftly, we have just tilled hog fuel (very large shredded bark/wood fibers) into our soil in prep for seeding lawn.  This is soil that was previously farm land.  We laid down a layer of hog fuel to keep down the mud for the winter (dogs) with our new build house.  The company we bought the hog fuel from told us it would be a wonderful soil amendment to till in at planting time this summer.  The landscapers who put in our sprinklers were horrified when we showed them our newly tilled yard with the hog fuel all nicely mixed in.  After research, I now see the error of our ways and the nitrogen problem.  We REALLY need to plant grass ASAP for mud control for THIS winter, if at all possible.  Please tell me there is a way around this mess without digging all of the soil out and bringing in new soil??  Unfortunately, this is a very large yard. "
921,How can I get rid of the pennywort that is taking over my dwarf mondo grass?,"I have a strip of dwarf mondo grass down the middle of my driveway.  Pennywort has started to grow in amongst it, and is gradually spreading and taking over.  I have tried manually weeding it out (was spending 10 or 15 minutes each day), however it's coming back as fast as I can remove it.  Because of the mondo grass roots, it's very difficult to get all the pennywort roots out.  The mondo grass is growing quite well in areas the pennywort hasn't reached yet.  Is there anything I can do?  Can I change the conditions to suit the mondo grass more than the pennywort and give it a better chance?  I don't mind using a herbicide if required.  I'm not much of a gardener so any help is appreciated.   "
922,"Found this beetle in a pile of wood chips, harmful to my plants?","I found this relatively large beetle in a pile of wood chips in my garden.  I found smaller individuals of the same species living about an inch underground in my garden.  I live in central NJ.  The beetle is about an inch and a half long.  It has a hard exterior, and is entirely black except for some things that are orange: hairs on the middle pair of legs, the gap between the head and the midsection, I don't remember where else.  The beetle makes a quiet sound, kind of like a hiss, when it gets flipped upside down.  As far as I know it can't fly.  My top guess is that it is a black ground beetle.  Whatever kind of beetle it is, I would like to know:   Does it post any threat to my vegetables/potatoes? Will it bite me?    "
923,How to install irrigation for an unstructured garden,"Last year my wife and I were veggie gardening rookies: I built a 4'x8' raised garden bed out of cedar, we planted, and actually didn't do half bad. At the end of the season we spoke with a ""master gardener"" at a county fair who told us why we lost half of our harvest: our irrigation method. I had, in my ignorance, been watering our plants via sprinkler at the end of the day. According to this gardener, this ""top-down"" irrigation method was leaving moisture on the leaves, allowing mildew/rot/disease to creep in. Apparently it also makes it harder to get the water directly to the roots, and so its inefficient as well.  This year I wanted us to learn from our mistakes. We went out and bought all our seeds and transplants, some extra top soil and compost, etc. Last weekend I got the soil/compost in the garden, and I thought we would be planting everything together this coming weekend.  Turns out my wife couldn't wait. She went ahead without me and planted everything in the garden basically according to the space each plant needs around it as well as by aesthetic appeal:    I was planning on doing soaker hose-based irrigation this year, that is:   Putting everything (essentially) into an (x,y) grid Snaking a soaker hose back and forth betweeen the ""axes"" on the grid   But as you can see, we now have a hot, unstructured mess where instead of a neat, easily-irrigatable grid, we have ""plant clusters"". So I ask: is there any way for us to stay with soaker hose irrigation? If so, what might it look like and what special hardware would I need to snake around all of these ""plant clusters""? If not, what is our best option for irrigation here? "
924,"Which will produce a neater block of low mass planting, Lonicera pileata or L. nitida?","For massed plantings, with the aim of clipping into a neat ground-covering block 500-600mm high (not a hedge), is Lonicera pileata or L. nitida species superior? What are the best cultivars for this purpose? I am not interested in alternate species, just these and their cultivars, as I've never really got a clear answer off the internet.  Differences in hardiness, pests, diseases, soil/light/water requirements would be very useful as would individual decorative merits (best scent for example). "
925,Does anyone know the name of this purple flower?,"I got this flower from a small bouquet and dried it, but I don't know the  name and google hasn't been usefull yet. Does someone recognize it? Thanks in advance.    I have another picture of the plant, dried opside down, so it's not flat. I can definetly say that the leaves were not needlelike, in fact, there weren't barely any on it. It has a deep purple colour, almost wine red, but a bit more purple. If I look at the pictures of the different kinds of heath or heather, it seems that they are a collection of stems, and each has many flowers on it, but here you can see that there is one stem, that itself has many branches with many flowers. Would it stil be some sort of heath/heather?   "
926,What are the spots in my leaves?,It is mid-September update in New York state. The leaves are already falling and have spots on them. Neighbors' trees are still green.  Is it normal? Or my tree is infected with some disease?     
927,Japanese box hedge failing to thrive. What to do?,"I have a Japanese box hedge which is not exactly dying, but is definitely failing to thrive.  When I moved in (5 years ago) it was looking much better.  So it's not about the location, but that the previous owner knows something I do not.  It is on the north side of the house and receives plenty of sun.  I have used sugar-cane mulch to keep weeds to a minimum.  Nearby roses are fertilized with chook manure and commercial rose food.  The roses are growing well as is nearby murraya hedge.  Over the last 6 months I have tried a few different things:   fertilizing with blood and bone,  fertilizing with cow manure, spraying with a fortnightly mixture of Seasol and Powerfeed.   There have been periods of steady rainfall for weeks which have not seemed to help.  Do I need to test the soil?  Treat for pests?  I took a couple of pictures so you can see what I mean.  Some observations:-   on the shady side, there is a green tinge to the bark leaves appear to be yellowing from the tips first and then going brown some unhealthy looking leaves have small brown dots along the edge of the leaf, more prominent on the top of the leaf than the bottom cross-section the root does not appear to have a blue tinge (my mobile phone camera is not too good a close-ups) the soil looks good (noticed few worms when I dug this up).  Soil is clayey       "
928,"Can garlic be planted in the winter, in hardiness zone 5 inland northeast USA?","I got a bunch of garlic bulbs to plant a couple weeks ago but winter struck early and I didn't manage to plant them yet. We've had a foot of snow and 2 cycles of snow/thaw so far, and for at least two weeks we've had minimum daily temperatures below freezing.  I will check how frozen the soil is - the top layer has been frozen at times but it may not be frozen very deep. I read that it can take until January or at least December for the top inch of soil to freeze, so that gives me some hope.  Can the garlic bulbs be planted in late-autumn winter conditions that are happening already in much of zone 4 &amp; 5 of northeast USA? Under what condition is it too late for garlic bulbs to be planted due to onset of winter? For example if it can be planted as long as the soil isn't frozen, does that mean they can be planted in mid/late-winter during a warm spell?  "
929,Can mint survive indefinitely in water?,"I put some mint cuttings in a plastic cup, along with tap water and a few pebbles. It's been a few months now, and the mint is still alive and kicking. Rather than getting some soil and a pot for the mint, would it be possible for the mint to survive indefinitely given adequate water and sunlight? Or would the mint eventually die from lack of nutrition? "
930,What is this bush/tree that has clumps of little green berries but also sometimes apples?,"I've lived in my house many years and have always enjoyed this bush/tree plant in the front that looks a lot like an apple tree (blossoms, leaves).  It has clumps of little green berries (I'm sure not edible) but also every so often produces a couple of apples.  what the heck?  I've (carefully) eaten one or two of the apples and they seem just like regular old apples.  But why are there clumps of green berries (multiple, on little stalks, like cherries grow, only much smaller than cherries). I was just pruning it today and noticed there are a couple of apples on it.  But the little green berry things are confusing me.  Is this thing grafted?  I live in the Pacific Northwest.  Any idea what this shrub is?  Additional photos are at [website]Click on photos for larger view.        "
931,Are Daminix tick tubes locally effective in controlling ticks?,"This is a very appealing option for low impact tick control, but do they actually diminish the local tick populations significantly?   Do they control more than just the deer tick? "
932,What is the maximum depth a seed can be planted?,"When planting a seed, it is covered with a thin layer of earth. The initial shoot penetrates the soil and starts photosynthesis.  Are there plants which can be planted (as a seed) much deeper than a few centimeters? What is the maximum depth a seed of any plant can be planted and still sprouts? "
933,"Can trees be propagated/started over winter indoors, or would that 'tire them out'?","I found a calendar of propagation activities which seems very helpful, and it says that hardwood cuttings can be taken and started for deciduous trees throughout winter. I imagine those cuttings would freeze and be destroyed if left on their own poked into some soil (if the soil is even unfrozen enough to receive them). That makes me think those hardwood cuttings should be grown in a somewhat protected space, either kept in cool dark conditions (in a garage or maybe outdoors with a thick topping of mulch) or nursed to life under a light, with a heat mat, etc.  Any clarification about the above would be appreciated, but my main question is this: can propagated trees that would normally be dormant over winter be started out indoors? If not, why/what bad outcome would they eventually reach?  Example: a bunch of seeds or hardwood cuttings of deciduous trees are planted in air-pruning pots or beds and grown indoors over winter. Around/after last frost in the spring, they're either planted into a larger pot/raised bed to be transplanted or heeled in after 1 year; or planted into permanent beds to grow for 2-3 years before transplanting; or planted into their permanent location to live out their life. For every winter after the one they're started in, they'll be outdoors in the ground exposed to zone 4/5 conditions.   Will baby trees grown this way be crippled by having grown in nursed conditions the winter they're started and then all through summer, basically experiencing a much longer growing season than they ever will in the future? "
934,Plants not growing well in containers despite taking all the measures that I could read about,"can people please help me out on what can I do in order to grow the plants in containers. This summer, I had planted bitter gourd as well, as bottle gourd and lemongrass in different containers. These were in large grow bag containers measuring about 3 feet in height and 2 ft in  breadth and  length (one plant in each of the containers). I filled them with potting mix. I also made the holes at the bottom for drainage and in fact made holes in the side also. I placed them by the side of a bed where the same plants were planted in the ground.   The bitter gourd produced only a few fruits though it did flower quite a bit but none of the fruits ever grew. The bottle gourd was similar. While the plant, which was in the ground produced almost 30 KG of bottle gourd, the plant in the container produced around three KG. For the lemongrass, the one which was planted in the ground looks like a thick bush. The one planted in the container did grow, but it is a far cry from being dense.  All I could understand from reading about plants being grown in container was that the drain it should be good and therefore we made sure that the soil was properly aerated. What else can be done?  Are there any case studies or even papers anywhere on this? Most of the knowledge that I have got is by watching YouTube videos and reading about it and none of it is helping so I thought maybe getting more technical perhaps will help.  Please advise. Thank you for any inputs Edit : as required in the comments, I am appending the photographs. The first one is the image of the lemongrass planted in the ground. The second is the image of the lemongrass planted in the container. You can see how dense the lemongrass planted in the ground is as I was not even able to capture the entire plant with the camera standing at about the same distance as I was when taking the picture of the lemongrass in the container. The third picture is that of the larger container that I had used with the same results for the lemongrass as in the smaller container     "
935,Suckers on dormant tree,"My oak appears to be dormant. I am in Cape Town, its winter and around 6- 14°C overnight.  My oak tree sprouted 8 suckers and they are growing strong. Why would the tree not sprout from the trunk or branches (buds are not swollen) but sprouting suckers with leaves?  Suckers look extremely healthy, should I take them off the tree to preserve the energy for spring? Why would they sprout?   "

I live in a house of 2, and a fairly large garden, in Australia, and I am renting (therefore do not want to spend a lot of money on something that I can't take with me).  I was googling at the various approaches to DIY compost bins and was not sure on a clear winner.   What is the best approach to begin composting in my situation?

938,Will a forest trail that's not regularly used always become overgrown?,"This question belongs more to forestry than to gardening per se, but as this seems to be the Stack that's closest in subject matter, I'll go ahead and ask anyway.  I'm writing a story where the main character, while walking in a forest, stumbles upon an old, long-forgotten mule trail that nobody uses anymore. But then I asked myself, is such a thing even possible? I mean, if a trail isn't used for some time, won't it eventually become so overgrown with vegetation as to be completely inaccessible as well as indistinguishable from the ambient shrubbery? If not, what would be some naturally occurring barriers to prevent this overgrowth from happening?  Many thanks for any insights! "

941,How to fix my indoor potted avocado plant?,"MY plant history:   Tree planted 2 years ago. Once I cut the tip, so that plant branched. Some time later I cut those two branches again. New stems appeared, but after some time, something happened to the leaves (see pictures). I see some new leaves are going out now, but there is some issue with tips of those new ones too.   Plant is grown in a pot, only indoor. Pot is 28cm in diameter, and 30cm high. I would like to keep the plant relatively small, as it is grown indoor, so frequent trimming is a must. I live in Poland, in Europe, and now heating season is already started, but issue started before.   What to do to save the plant? Is it possible to grow it like a bonsai, with frequent pruning?     "
942,What is this Bean Sprout looking plant?,"I have a section of my garden that has been covered by a wooden board. The area underneath this wooden board was very damp and dark. There was this strange plant underneath the wooden board and I was wondering if anyone could identify it (click to enlarge):    To me, this looks like a bean sprout. But I don't know where it would have come from. I am in Canberra, Australia and the other plants in the garden are parsley, lettuce, broad beans, blueberries and spring onion. "
943,Do legumes provide nitrogen to their companions?,"It's common knowledge that legumes (clover, beans, etc) can (with the help of Rhizobium bacteria) fix nitrogen from the air and hold it in the soil.  Much is made of this fact -- advice that we should plant clover in our lawn to give the grass a boost, ""three sisters"" plantings of beans with corn so the beans can provide the corn with nitrogen, etc.  But I've seen a couple of mentions that the nitrogen that legumes fix from the air is ""locked up"" on the roots of the plant until it dies. Thus they don't help their companions while they're alive -- so while clovers in a lawn have other benefits, they do not provide any nitrogen to the grasses. According to this contrary advice, the only nitrogen benefit these plants provide is to a following crop -- e.g. a soybean crop or clover cover crop will provide nitrogen to whatever follows.  Which advice is correct? Does it depend on the legume type? (I.e. are there some legume types that fix extra nitrogen that would become available for companions?) "

945,Rats! There are rats destroying my pumpkins!,"I have a plot in a community garden, and this past summer I planted New England pie pumpkins. They did VERY well (I had close to 20 fruits on 4 vines), but just before I harvested them some rats moved into the garden and destroyed them. The method they used is very interesting (and I'm sorry I don't have photos) - they scraped/ate a hole into each pumpkin, then scraped out all the seeds, and then left the seeds, pulp and hollowed out pumpkin just lying there! In one night they went through ALL the pumpkins!   My questions are:  What do you think they were doing, since they didn't eat all of the tasty food left behind?  And, for next year, do you have any suggestions for how I can protect the squashes from the rats?  There are some good ideas here (Keeping rats from eating my plants), but I don't think these will protect the individual pumpkin fruits, and there are limits to what I can do in a community garden space.  Thanks for any and all creative solutions!  "
946,How can I grow maple trees from seeds?,"I have a mature maple tree in my yard. Every year it drops seeds which start growing in the most inconvenient of places, like my gutters.

948,Why is an indoor pepper plant flowering but not producing fruit?,"One of my pepper plants has started to flower, and the petals are falling off to reveal a pepper growing from that stem - well, at least the first two have, and the other flowers seem to be bulging somewhat in the middle and I assume will therefore produce fruit.  A second of my pepper plants is also flowering, but when its flowers drop off they drop off entirely, stem and all. So far three of its flowers have done this, and there's a few more flowers that don't appear to bulging like my more successful plant.  Should I be concerned about the second plant? And if so is there something I should be doing about it? "

950,Are these signs of tree trouble?,"We moved into a house a little over a year ago. We really love this particular small tree that's in the front yard. One day I noticed that it had two holes in it, one towards the center and one near the ground. Both of the holes looked kind of juicy. Now, the upper hole has dried up a little bit but has some slug looking things in it. The bottom hole is growing a ton of tiny mushrooms.   Is this a sign of something serious to the tree's health, or no need to worry? If serious, is there anything that can be done?      "
951,"Black spots, curling leaves on potatoes, help identify problem","First, some relevant information:  I am growing Yukon Gold potatoes.  I am in hardiness zone 6b.  The weather over the last month has been dryer than normal for the area I am in (Northeastern US).  I have four potato plants, all near each other.  In my shared garden I don't think anybody else has potato plants.  About a week ago I saw some leaves curling on one of my potato plants.  The leaves weren't dry; in fact, they felt kind of spongy.  This happened after I had buried the plant for a second time in dirt.  The plant is now buried about 12 inches up from where the original dirt level was, when the potato first sprouted.  Then yesterday I noticed some black spots appearing on a few leaves, and some of the newer leaves having large black spots and more curling.  See pictures below.  Text of question continues after pictures.        My largest plant is the one with the most spots, while one of the other plants is starting to show similar symptoms, and my other two plants are showing no symptoms.  What kind of disease is this?  From my Google results my best guess is leaf curl or early blight, but I am not sure which one.    What should I do to treat my plants?  Or are they goners?  Is it worth pulling out the two infected plants to try and save the two healthy (so far) ones?  Also possibly relevant:  I saw two species of bugs I haven't seen in my garden before on my potato plant today.  One was a red/orange kind of beetle, about a half inch long, which I was unable to get a good picture of.  The other is shown in the picture below. "
952,How to help an avocado plant recover from plant transplant shock?,"I have an avocado plant which has sat and grown happily (well probably not) on a windowsill in my flat for ~ 2 years.  I paid it no attention except to water it occasionally when I noticed it needed it as it was left here by an old flatmate.  I decided last weekend I wish to take better care of it as it looked like it wasn't doing so well, so I went to the garden centre and bought a new pot, soil and some filter type stuff and repotted the plant.  It has been a week since repotting and the plant looks very sad and thirsty.  I read up about plant shock after repotting and was aware this would happen.  But that after a week or so there should be some improvement, it only seems to be getting worse.  Here is a picture of the plant as a whole: .    I repotted the plant as it was in a much smaller plant pot and the tips of the leaves had started turning brown which I read that probably means the soil of the plant has a concentration of salt in it that is too high.  What's more I think the plant was just planted in soil taken from the garden which I also read is bad for an indoor plant.  Repotting the plant disturbed the roots significantly.  I cleaned all the existing soil from them (I don't know whether this was a good idea or not) by washing them in a bucket of water but did not trim any of the roots (as I didn't know to check for root rot).  I put it in a new, bigger, clay pot following advice from the garden centre with the following structure (sorry it's in german but the picture shows how it is set up).    Since repotting I have watered it a few days after repotting, letting the water drain through the soil as I read this should help the plant settle.  The soil is moist to the touch and does not feel like it needs watering again but as you can see the plant does look thirsty.  Should I water it more or not?  Is there anything I can do to help the plant recover and adapt to its new, hopefully better home?  The plant is in a warm room with ambient daytime temperature of ~18 degrees celsius and is above a radiator next to a window.  The window is east facing but this is not something that can be changed, nor can the plants location to another facing window.   "
953,Should a citrus tree growing very close to the house be killed?,"The previous owner of my house grew a citrus tree less than 1 foot away from the house. I don't know the exact species of this tree, but it produces orange-colored tangerine-sized fruits that are sour. It is about 8 feet tall now. I'm worried that the roots will continue growing and damage the foundation of my house or rupture water pipes. What do you suggest me do with this tree? Kill it? If so, how? With pesticide or with a chainsaw?   "
954,Why does my cilantro have thin leaves? Why is my parsley not growing?

When should I expect it ready for harvesting?  My parsley (same planting timeframe and location), hasn't grown more than about 1-2 inches.  When should I expect it to be ready?  Should I be placing these in the sun?  Are they better off in a more shaded location?  Are they getting too much sun?  Not enough/too much water (I water pretty regularly - like once every 2 days)?  I've added some pictures of each below. The parsley is on the left and the cilantro is on the right (click to enlarge).                          "
955,Is it okay to line the top of a container with plastic to hold water inside?,"One of the problems with container gardening in my area is that you generally have to water the plants every single day in the summer (except on occasion) or else they have a high likelihood of dying from lack of water (even if you only miss one day). This is not because the plants drink lots of water. It's because the water evaporates fast. (Edit: I know because the containers dry out whether or not there are any plants in them, and I've never had mature plants in them, since they tend to suffer in those fast-drying conditions; the climate is hot and arid in summer, with lots of sun.) I imagine the containers have been between 2-8 gallons.  Anyway, I know about self-watering containers, but I'm looking for other easier and less expensive alternatives.  One idea I have is to cover the top of the containers with plastic and just have a small opening to plant the plant. That should in theory hold much more water inside. Do you think this will work? Why or why not? Have you or has anyone else tried it? Assuming there are no weed seeds, do you think clear plastic would be better than black plastic? "

960,My basil stems are cracking and turning brown,"I'm growing Basil indoors hydroponically. Most of my plants look fine (other than them tipping over because I used too small net cups and/or didn't pin them in), but some of the stems appear to be cracking and turning brown (picture below).

961,What type of potting soil is most suitable for indoor herbs?,"I've tried a few times to grow potted herbs in my apartment with varying success, and I suspect it is related to the potting soil. I have basil and rosemary that are thriving in pots filled with MiracleGro Potting Mix, but I planted chocolate mint, spearmint, ginger mint, thyme, and tarragon in pots with MiracleGro Moisture Control potting mix, and those all died extremely quickly (within a week - one of the mints turned completely brown and shriveled within two days).  I followed the directions from the tags the seedlings came with (regarding sun exposure and watering), and I was careful not to damage the root bundles when I potted them, so the only thing I can guess is that the Moisture Control potting soil did not get along with these plants.  Does anyone know why that is? Is there something about the pH level or nutrient levels in this particular soil that make it ill-suited for herbs? Are there certain things I should look for on the labels when purchasing potting soil in the future? (I live in a city and have a very limited selection of potting soil types and brands in my local hardware stores/target.) "
962,How to stop my courgettes (zucchini) rotting?,"I've tried growing courgettes (zucchini) for the first time this year and the plants have been delightfully easy to grow.

Should I be putting straw or something else dry underneath them to stop them touching the soil? "
963,Why is my Dracaena leaves turning yellow?,"  So I've had this plant for about 4 months now. I'm wondering why the bottom leaves are beginning to turn yellow?  I'm almost certain it's not root root. I don't over water it. Im always sure that I do the soil check because I did lose one to root root.. only because my other half insisted that it needed watering and instead of arguing I just watered it until unfortunately I showed him it didn't need that much water and showed where the leaves got mushy from the inside out..  There are no small white fuzzies which I believe are the spider mites I've heard of.. I know I probably need to trim the leaves because they're kinda big.. but will that actually cause the leaves to turn?? I'm just worried to make the leaves look funny but ive put it off long enough.  This plant is very special to us because it come from his mother who initially kept it outside. Colder whether and us not having any shade,  It's now inside.  Please any suggestions are appreciated!

964,Dying Peace Lily,"I have a Peace Lily which has done well very a year in front of sliding doors. It has started drooping like it needed water to which I watered it and usually it perks right back up. It didn't this time and I thought maybe it got too cold in front of the sliding doors so I was going to move it. I took it out of the basket it was in and there was water standing. Maybe that was the reason..... There were roots growing along the side of the pot and dirty dirt so I cleaned all that off along with the roots and moved it to a warmer area with indirect light and it did worse. Did I kill it completely and is there ay coming back from this? I have trimmed all the dead leaves off of it and when I watered it the other day, the water which dripped out of it was very dark reddish brown. Does this mean anything? Help me if possible.  Kim "
965,Why do my newly planted arborvitae keep dying?,"I planted arborvitae a year ago that died (five total). I replanted all of them (new trees) this year and three of them are now dying again.   Soil Conditions  The dirt up here is practically just sand and clay once you get 3-4 inches down. According to a geographical survey, soil in my geographic region is ""clayey till, and sandy and loamy till, with areas of sand and gravel. Other deposits include lake clay, silt, and alluvium.""  How I Planted Killed Them All The First Time   I dug a trench for them that was 12-16 inches deep (so the entire base of each tree would be below the ground).  I figured that since my soil was horrible I would need to give them fresh dirt in order to survive. So each tree was planted in and surrounded by fresh potting soil (with MiracleGro in it because I know nothing about trees!). I watered them almost daily (I even paid a neighbor's daughter to water them while I was away for a short period of time).   Reflections on Death (Round One)  I was very surprised that all of the trees died in round one. So I talked to a landscaper and she told me that I made two major mistakes:   I drowned the trees in water (12-16 inches is too deep for these trees). I 'shell-shocked' them with good soil as this was not their natural habitat (I should have let them grow into the natural soil from the start).   Round Two   Not having time to give my arborvitae swimming lessons, I created a berm and planted the trees on the berm so that only the bulb/tip of each trees' roots would be below ground level (at the recommendation of the previously mentioned landscaper). I used mostly natural soil (I had to use some fresh dirt for berming, but I bought the cheap stuff which smelled like manure). I have been watering every other day or so, but three of them (one on the end and one in the middle of two other trees) are starting to turn brown. I've exhausted my knowledge (which is zilch). The berm soil has been eroding unfortunately.   Photos  All the trees:   A closeup of one of the browning ones:    Questions   Did the landscaper give me good advice? If not, what do you recommend? Is there any hope for my browning trees in round two?   UPDATE  All the trees in round two have since died. I also found out that my neighbor had planted his four times and they died every time, so I'm wondering if our soil conditions are the culprit here. Anyways, both my neighbor and I have given up on arborvitae and he planted bushes (I just covered my holes with dirt and am actually now trying to sell the home&mdash;so I'll probably just put down grass seed). It's really unfortunate, because I have a warranty for five new trees&mdash;I just don't have time nor the patience to kill another batch. Unfortunately the advice I received here conflicted and no one fully answered my questions. If anyone knows how to make these grow in my soil conditions and can offer an authoritative and canonical response that fully answers my initial questions, I'll gladly accept the answer. But until then, I hope this post and its answers help someone else.... "

969,Our cat is digging up our lawn,"We have two cats (both female, 6 &amp; 4 yrs old). The older one is becoming less mobile (can't get over the fence), and has started taking to digging up the lawn to do her business. Whenever I see her do it I run and shoo her away, which seems to work for a day or two, but then she starts again. There is a border along the edge which we don't particularly care about, and I've seen her use that before.   I saw a related question for dogs:  Is there anything I can put on my lawn to prevent my dog from digging? but I don't think that answer would work for our cat.  We could go back to using a litter tray but that seems an awful pain. Does anyone have any ideas on ways to encourage her to go elsewhere? I saw this article Natural Cat Repellents which suggests growing catnip plants and/or a sandbox. But how healthy would a catnip solution be in the long term for the cat? And I'm not sure about a sandbox, since we have a young child (and another on the way!) who would probably make a beeline for that as soon as our backs are turned!!  Any help appreciated. "
970,What's eating my pepper leaves?,"I'm have two bell pepper plants that seem to be attracting a hungry pest. I'm in Phoenix AZ.   What insect is causing this damage? Is this a significant threat to the health of the plant? So far it looks like the plant can do just fine with this level of damage. How do I stop it? I've never caught the culprit. I've checked around and under the leaves, and I've never seen any bugs or eggs of any sort. I removed a caterpillar once a few months ago before the damage started but that's it.   I do know there's some sun damage there - I was out of town during the worst of the heat and it got burned a bit.      Also, on another note - I planted these from seed in March. The package said around 70 day harvest. The larger plant is about 18 inches tall. When can I expect first flowers?

974,How to identify emergent Eau de cologne mint flowering stem?,"How to identify an emerging flowering stem and prune it before it bolts? I am new to growing, I had seen pictures of already flowered mints. I googled and read and decided perhaps it is a good decision I shouldn't allow it to flower lest it wastes its energy too. I spotted 3 thicker very purplish stems, unlike usual very smooth (to touch) stems not as dark purplish. Moreover, the leaves(?) don’t look like normal leaves. They are rounder, have more pinky veins(obvious from underside). Leaf tip look unusual. The stem sprout strongly all the way out. With the ""(pale dark green pinky roundish) leaves"" at all intervals remaining tiny hardly growing bigger.  If these are flowering stems, is it advisable to cut them off? Cut where?

All the instructions I found suggested one of two approaches:   Put it in a bag in the fridge for 10-12 weeks, or Plant it in cold soil outdoors in late fall or early winter   Both approaches suggested a clean (no plum flesh), dry seed. So I scrubbed and washed them, and refridgerated them for 24 hours to get 'em dry. I didn't crack them though.  Now, I've planted it in the backyard under some soil (technically, compost). What do I do now? I didn't find anything other than ""water it when it grows, it doesn't like wet roots."" Am I supposed to water the seed?

And while writing this I've just spotted that one (and only one!) of the leaves has what I guess might be aphids on the back of it. So I'm now even more concerned than I was.  I first spotted the bugs 2 or 3 days ago, and it's definitely the case that the black flies are living on, or around, the plant given their behaviour and location. They are most often walking around the soil or pot, occasionally sat on the lowest leaves.  The plant seems healthy at the moment (as much as my negligible experience can tell) and doesn't look like it's being eaten or anything, but I guess this might not last long.  Note that there is another pepper plant about 30cm away, which is showing no signs of similar pests or anything on the leaves.  What should I do? Having started doing research on the web, can I just say that the plants are indoor potted plants and I have no external garden whatsoever; introducing another insect that will eat these is not possible.

985,Can I thin grapes/vines in July?,"I have bought a garden in Austria (Central Europe) which has some grape vines (I don't know the exact kind). The previous owner told me they harvested 20 kilograms of grapes last summer. Currently (early July) the vines are bearing a good handful of grapes -- still developing of course, less than 0,8cm each -- but a friend told me that the grapes would not be good unless I remove some of the fruit, so that the remaining fruit will be better (sweeter, juicier). I found this similar question which says to prune in early spring. Since I didn't prune then, my question is:  Can I thin the fruits in July? If so, how? If not, will the grapes be any good this year?  Considerations of how the vine would grow next year aren't relevant because I will be building a house here next year and the vine will have to be sacrificed. This year, I'd rather have few but enjoyable grapes than buckets full of bad ones, so I would not mind pruning ruthlessly, to get any good ones this year. I'm just hoping it's not too late for that?   There is apparently only one vine growing; another one or two seem dead. "
986,What are some low maintenance plant choices for apartment (indoor) living?,"I'm not an expert on plants, but would like to add some plant life to my apartment. I'm looking for good choices that:   don't require direct sunlight require minimal watering survive for at least a few months at a time have low risk of attracting pests   Bonus points for ""interesting to look at"". Cacti seem low maintenance and resilient, yes? What other choices are there that I might consider? "
987,What is this flowering shrub from Algonquin Park?,"Saw this plant growing to heights of three to four feet (one to one and a half metres) in a mixed pine and deciduous forest in Algonquin Park (USDA zone 3).  The berries or drupes are black.  The leaf is almost ready to drop and is pictured on the left.  The leaf on the right is from Viburnum trilobum ""Wentworth"" from my garden.  What is this plant?  It looks like a native viburnum but I don't know which species.   "
988,Ant colony in my compost bin: are they beneficial?,"I've got a smallish black plastic compost bin in my garden and I recently noticed that an ant colony has taken up residence. This has happened a couple of times in the past, but they tend to move on when I turn the compost (not surprising, given I'm ruining their home).  However, is their presence actually good for the compost? Do they speed up the composting process by aerating it and dining on the 'food' therein? And if so, should I leave them be for a while?  The ants themselves don't bother me. "
989,Can tiny fruit bearing trees be grown in flower pots?,"Is it possible to grow a tiny tree in a flower pot that can produce fruits in house environment? Specifically, I'm interested in tangerines, pomegranates, bananas and lemons. How do I turn their fruits into growing plants? Even if some or all of them can't produce fruits in a flower pot, I'm still interested. "
990,does fruit tree absorb pesticide and fungicide from the root level and will persist inside the fruit it produce? (specifically lime and date trees),"The specific situation is where there are two trees -- one lime and another date tree plant among the grass in the backyard where the grass area will get sprayed with conventional pesticide and fungicide for grass as well as the root of the trees.  I wonder in this case, will the chemicals inside the pesticide and fungicide will reside inside the trees' fruits? Even when the chemicals are not sprayed onto the fruits or leaves directly?  Thank you "
991,Is light direction or proximity more important when considering indoor natural light for plants?,"I'm trying to provide my houseplants with as much natural light as possible inside my 2nd floor apartment.   I have 2 large bay windows that face north, and can put my plants directly by the window/on the sill. Here they're very close to the window but almost never get direct sunlight, due to facing north.   I could instead put plants in rooms with a large east or west facing window, where they'd have access to more direct light depending on the time of day, but in each case the plants would need to be significantly farther away from the window itself (6-9ft).   Does anyone know which would offer more/better light to my plants? I'm sure there are other factors to consider (my latitude, size of window, perhaps even paint color/reflective surfaces in room) but I'm curious if there's a more general principle/formula at play, with proximity to window trumping light direction or the other way around.   Would an exposure/light meter help me figure this out? "
992,Shaping my new bonsai,We are working on this bonsai and would like some expert advice.   Should we cut more sub-branches? Is it ok if the main branch is bending towards one side?

993,Aloe plant needs rescuing,"  I just had my kitchen repainted and while moving my adopted aloe plant back to its sunny south facing spot on the kitchen window sill his long stem broke. Well it really just creaked, not actual snapping... (has my lack of plant knowledge come through loudly enough?)  Is the big part done for? I know the little guy is good where he is. And will probably grow better with big brother making a mess of the pot.   Do I just break/cut it off? Can I stick that in another pot and will it grow?  Anything I can do with the leaves if the big guy is a goner?   P.s. the snail is just a shell we picked up hiking in Vermont.  "
994,Chamomile lawn feed & winter care,I have a Chamomile lawn that in its 2nd year is beginning to look the business.  Was wondering if there is a recommended 'feed' for it.  Also wondering how much care i should take regarding winter and frost danger? (is it hardy enough to survive?) 
995,How does vacuuming beetles work?,"I've seen advice in books and online that I can deal with my striped cucumber beetle infestation by vacuuming. Unfortunately they don't get into details. I'm ready to drag the shop vac into the garden, but I'm wondering if there are any gotchas... and I'm a little worried about too much power ripping the leaves right off the plants instead of just the bugs.  Has anybody here done this successfully? Anything I should watch out for? Any tips to ensure success?  (If this works, it would be great -- I try to avoid spraying as much as possible, and I don't want to kill bees/beneficial pollinators with pyrethrin.) "
996,Spots on lemons,"I've got quite a few lemons covered in dark spots. They don't seem to go deep and the lemons don't seem to be spoiled inside. I've never picked lemons before, so I'm wondering - are they safe to eat?  (the spring just started here)     Requested follow-up: The tree looks mostly ok. There are few leaves which don't look healthy and they're mostly around the lemons with spots. The spots on the leaves look either very similar to the ones on lemons:    Or small white dots (mould-like?):    Otherwise it looks ok. Bark is fine and there are no persistent bugs that I can see around. Very few leaves have been nibbled on - likely a long while ago. "
997,"Should I leave an indoor areca palm in dense, thick soil, or change it to regular potting soil?","I am repotting my houseplants. When I took an areca palm out of the pot, I noticed that its roots are planted in what looks like loam. I can't identify it well, but it is very different from the normal houseplant earth I use. It is greyish-yellow, grainy and dense. It doesn't crumble at all, it smears.   I inherited the plant years ago from a neighbour who moved, and I have no idea whether it has been planted in this soil on purpose, or whether somebody without a clue has planted it in any old soil years ago. Is this good for the plant? Should I leave the roots in it and just put some new earth around as usual, or should I try to remove most of it and plant it in soft earth?  "

999,Leaving tomato roots in the ground,Soon my tomato harvest is done and I wonder whether I can leave the roots in the ground for rotting or whether I should get them out.  I heard that for some other annuals leaving the root in the ground as adding nitrogen to it. Does this apply to tomatoes as well?  Are there any risks? Are there any benefits?  UPDATE: Thanks to a comment I forgot to mention that I assume that the roots won't survive my -10 °C winter. 
1000,"Do I need to winterize my large rain cistern, and if so when?","We have a large roof-fed rain cistern, approximately 1500 gallons. Make, model, and material were not obvious to me, though I can look harder if needed. It looks similar to this:    It would be nice to use it for collection of snowmelt, as some of our trees need water over the winter. Also, springtime can be very dry here, so I would like to collect in late winter / early spring for use in late spring.  I don't mind if it freezes solid for a while. However, I do mind if it is broken by freezing.  Therefore, my questions are:   Do I need to winterize it at all? If yes, when would it need to be winterized? (For example, I could winterize when the average temperature goes below freezing, and un-winterize as soon as it rises above.)   It's in a fairly shady spot in our yard. On the coldest day of the year in our climate (northern New Mexico), the average low is 23°F and the average high is 36. Record low is 6 below. Almost all winter days are sunny. "

1004,How close can I plant a new climbing rose to an existing mature plant?,"I have a mature climbing rose. It's about 5 years old, so I think it has probably reached its maximum size. It's a little over 6 feet (~2 meters) high and about 2 feet (.6 meters) at its widest point.  I'd like to plant a young rose of the same basic variety next to it, as close as possible. The preferred spot is to the right of the current one as you look at it, in the space before the fence post, which is about a foot away from the widest part of the existing plant. The leaves and flowers can spread as far as that fence post, or a few inches beyond, but the base must end at or before it.   Would that be too close? If so, what's the minimum amount of space I should leave between them? I don't mind if the foliage overlaps. In fact, I'd prefer it that way. I'm just concerned about crowded root space, especially for the younger one, which I haven't purchased yet, but is about 1½ feet (.5 meters) tall, and still quite narrow at the base.   Unfortunately, I don't know the variety of this rose, so I'm hoping the pictures will help. I'd have to go back to the store to check the variety of the new one. I didn't want to buy it without getting some advice, and since it's at a department store, rather than a nursery, I couldn't find someone with good knowledge of its growth habit. Actually, I'd love to cover more of that ugly fence, but assume that means a bushier plant with a bigger root ball, which I didn't think would fit.   Kevinsky's answer made me wonder if the companion plant really has to be a rose at all. I'm open to something else, if it meets the criteria.   The pictures are from before it's in full bloom. It's usually prettier than this, with lots of flowers all the way to the top!! (Yes, I'm aware of the holes in the leaves! I thought I should either ask about those separately, or do some research on the site, where I'm sure I'll find some good diagnostic and treatment information.)     "

1006,How to protect a lawn against frost?,"It is winter time in Sydney Australia and the first frost came this morning.   Is it true that the sun rises and the frost crystals act like magnifying glasses and that is how the grass is damaged?  How do I protect my lawn against frost?  A friend suggested watering the lawn before the sun has a chance to ""burn"" it.  I missed my chance this morning. I have an automatic watering system that can do this for a minute or two daily before sunrise.  The grass is a broad leaf buffalo. "
1007,Will my Aloe vera plant survive after all of the leaves broke off?,I have made the same mistake as the person who asked the question Can I save my damaged Aloe vera plant?: my Aloe vera plant fell off of its stand and all of the leaves bent and broke off except for a tiny new one on top. The stem didn't break though.   Will my Aloe survive? Will it grow new leaves again? How should I care for it at this point? 
1008,Is music good for plants?,"I was watching a documentary on plants, and I came across this section that tells about the effect of music on plants. It says that Rock music kills plants while some other type of music encourages growth. One such music was composed by Roger Roger named ""Rhapsody in Green.""   Are these plants music really helpful to plants? If yes, how often do I make them listen, and for how long?  Here is the documentary: [website]"
1009,What are the proper conditions and watering habits for rosemary?,"I have tried twice now to start Rosemary from seed and failed both times. Last year I planted them in a self watering window box with a number of other herbs. It never really came up well and never thrived, then we went on vacation and it died.  This year I tried again in a different pot and it still came up slowly or not at all (most seeds did not germinate it seems). Then I knocked the pot over and that was the end of that attempt.  I am ready to try again. I am going to use a 6"" self watering container and potting mix and a new pack of seeds.  What are the pitfalls and hangups starting rosemary from seed? What can I do to improve my chances or even ensure success?  My weather: Hot during the summer (mid 90s during the day mid 70s at night). Some rain. "
1010,How to handle this chili plant?,"This Chili was a present and i am not really good with plants actually they keep dying. But I want this one to stay alive. So I have the following questions.     What is this plant? (I know a Chili, but I guess there are different kinds of them) How to handle this plant? How do I know when I can harvest the Chilis?   I was told to water it twice a week. Still the leaves don't look healthy to me. Plus I put it into a new/bigger pot with fresh soil, maybe the pot is to big?  Thanks in advance. "
1011,Cause of plants dying,"I am in the UK, midlands. Have these seedlings in a greenhouse and they were doing quite well. Almost getting ready to stick them in the ground for winter.  Almost overnight they have died. Can anyone note what the problem could be?  To much water? Not enough?   Temperature has been reasonable in the greenhouse, 16'C overnight. Warm days it can get up in the 30's but I open it up when its sunny to avoid it getting to hot.  I have been using a general feed for veg once a week. There is also a lot of slugs :/  Some pics, one thing that is strange is that it only seems to be the Brassicaceae family that is affected. The carrots in the second pic are still fine.  The third image is the same plants as the second image a couple days before.     "
1012,Is spent cat litter an appropriate source of nitrogen for compost?,"Is spent cat litter an appropriate source of nitrogen for compost?   The cat litter used is made of recycled paper pellets so is rich in carbon. It doesn't contain the cat faeces because that is fished out once or twice daily with a net to make the litter last longer, so should not contain any significant source of pathogens. It has quite a ripe ammonia smell to it (hinting it's rich in nitrogen, thanks to cat urine) by the time it's replaced in the litter tray, making me wonder if it could be added to the compost to hasten the breakdown.   If not good for compost, could it be useful anywhere else in the garden? "
1013,What are the black flying things and why do the leaves look like this?,"    These are photographs of my dahlia, marigold, and nasturtiums.   I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. But my plants are dying, and I'm unsure why. I've tried giving them a good wash previously, and cutting off diseased foliage, but it doesn't seem to have helped a great deal. There's also some flying black things, kind of like midges, I guess.   The plants sit on a south-facing windowsill, which is fairly sunny, with a radiator below and to the side. I am usually fairly careful with making sure they are kept watered, and I trim dead leaves and such once or twice a week.   How can I treat this? Would it be easier to just start again, given I have no real facilities to properly isolate the plants? How do I prevent this from happening again?  Thank you! "
1014,How to get rid of bermuda grass without using chemicals,"I live in Northern California. I have found that Bermuda grass is extremely invasive and am ready to give up the lawn.  We want to move to a native plant garden instead.  I have been reading about Bermuda grass and the fact that the roots go down many inches.  And that even just a small piece can regenerate and start invading again.  In looking on line many people suggest round up and multiple applications of it.  I would prefer not to use round up as there are several people in the area raising bees in the area and there is some evidence that round up may impact insects in a negative way.  I visited a Master Gardener, trained by University of California at Berkeley. She suggested robbing the Bermuda grass of light for several months.  She said to put down layers of newspaper (10 or so sheets thick) or use cardboard.  Then top with several inches of compost and then repeat.  She thought this approach would kill the Bermuda grass.  She said to cut through the cardboard or newspaper when I go to plant in the spring.  Has anyone actually used this method successfully?  In this area there are underground termites.  Will the cardboard or newspaper attract them to my yard and house?  Is this the best way to kill the Bermuda grass under these circumstances? "
1015,How to prevent fungus on soil in self watering pots?,"Below is a picture of one of my lemon trees, where the soil is covered with some sort of fungus. When I remove it, it comes back in 2-3 days.  I am suspecting the problem is, that lemon trees can't be in self watering pots, where they can drink all the water they like from the bottom.  Often I see leca pebbles covering the surface in connection with self watering pots. Is that to prevent fungus?  Question  What is recommended in order to prevent this kind of fungus?   "
1016,What to do with the spent flower spike of foxgloves (digitalis)?,"I've had a glorious display of foxgloves in my garden this year, but now pretty much all of the flowers have wilted and fallen. I don't particularly want to collect seed from the plants, but what should I do with the remaining flower spikes / plants?  Should I cut the spike off the plant near its base? And if I do, will the plant recover to produce another spike next year?  Or should I just get rid of the plant entirely and sow seeds now for next year's display? "
1017,What Are The Fastest Vegetables to Grow,"i've found a lot of detail online about the fastest vegetables to grow in terms of time from planting to producing (radishes!) however i'm wondering what are the fastest vegetables to grow from a fully matured plant? (not sure if that's the correct term)  i.e. if i already have a a tomato plant which is fully grown, how long would it take for a tomato to grow on it?   weird question and i've probably used horrendous terminology so apologies!  thanks "
1018,Will my basil plant regrow without leaves?,"I received a potted basil plant a bit over a year ago as thanks for some computer work. Not knowing how exactly to grow it, I kind of let it overgrow, including not nipping it in the bud at first. It started getting sickly and spindly, and its roots had basically filled the pot. So I took a cutting and replanted it in the pot, planting the rest out in my front yard to see how it would do.  The outside plant withered and died (we had some weather fluctuations, but the inside one was sprouting pretty nicely) and then, recently, my wife decided to make a dish and removed all of the leaves. The remaining stem has stayed green, but there's been no sign of regrowth of leaves in the week or so after.   Is it likely to recover? Or should I just start over from scratch?  Later edit: I ended up tossing the remaining stem, but I kept most of the soil for a transplanted tomato plant from work. Much to my surprise, a circle of basil sprouts have popped up. I am guessing that, at some point, a flower fell and reseeded, and these sprouted once the main plant was no longer giving them the ""hold"" signals. "
1019,Sour orange tree,My Son planted a lemon tree in his yard about 10 years ago. Somewhere along the way of becoming a big tree it now appears to be producing lemons on the lower part of the tree and big oranges on the upper part.  Problem is the oranges are nasty.  They are big and orange with a deformed looking skin.  The inside is white and very sour. It’s such a big healthy tree we hate to do away with it but the fruit it produces is worthless. Within about 50 ft from this tree is another much smaller orange tree that produces very good oranges. Don’t know if that had any significant??  Any suggestions on fixing the big nasty orange tree??? 
1020,Are there any bad effects in using nematodes in pest control?,"I have a pest situation on my apricot tree caused by the beetle Capnodis tenebrionis (see this question). I am averse to using chemical pesticides, and I read that nematodes can be used to control C. tenebrionis:   [website][website]I'm considering using this method. My question is can the nematodes themselves become a problem? There are many plant diseases caused by nematodes. "
1021,Exceeding a Pond Filter's Flow Rate?,"I have a 990l pond, and a Rockways 3-step formed waterfall that recommends a 4,000l/hour flow rate.  I need my pump to output 4,000l/hour. Do I need a filter that specifically supports such a flow rate? The pond is small, so do I need a 'big' filter that support the high flow rate of the pump, or do can I get away with a filter designed for smaller ponds (and thus built to expect a lower flow rate)?  Many thanks in advance! "
1022,How can I best get an alert if overnight frost is predicted?  ,"What's the best way to get warned if there's going to be a frost? Is there website or online service which will email me?  My priority would be a service which emails only in the event of frost warnings but I guess a year round daily email with min/max forecasted temperatures for my postcode would be fine.  I'm in the UK. I did sign up with one UK frost alert service before last winter (sorry, can't remember which one) but never received any emails.  "
1023,How do I reliably deactivate weed seeds that I've gathered?,"There's a number of Sosnowsky's hogweed (Heracleum sosnowskyi) plants which have blossomed a while ago and now they are standing with dry seeds ready to be spread by wind. Suppose I gather the seeds (that isn't dangerous when the plant is already dry). There will be perhaps a liter or so of them.  I want the seeds deactivated such that if they fall into soil they definitely give no seedlings ever. Having them destroyed by burning (or throwing into molten steel) would do but that isn't necessary, all I want is to be sure that all the seeds I get through this deactivation procedure give no seedling if they ever fall into soil. So for example burning doesn't look good because how do I ensure that all the volume has burnt fully or at least heated to high enough temperature?  Deactivation procedures should preferably not require complex handling of seeds afterwards. So for example some dangerous chemical wouldn't be optimal because how will I then dispose the contaminated seeds?  Should I boil them? How long would be enough?  Should I soak them in boiled water? Is that enough?  Perhaps some rather safe chemicals would do?  What's an easy, safe and reliable way to have seeds deactivated? "
1024,Is this a tiny Bloodgood maple sapling? How should I care for it?,"While mowing the lawn yesterday, my husband stumbled across this tiny plant. It's barely two inches tall. Some people down the street have a beautiful large tree that looks like a Bloodgood maple, and I've always wanted one! Could this be a little sapling, or perhaps a different variety of red maple?  We gently pulled it up, planted it in a clay pot with regular dirt from the yard, set the pot on a saucer, watered it thouroughly and put it in the sun. This morning it was very dry so I watered it again.  If it's a tree, or even if it's something else, what's the proper care for it at this fragile stage?    click on pictures for full size     "
1025,Spontaneous reappearance of Horse Chestnut Leaf Miner,"Last summer, the leaves of the chestnut tree in our back yard have, quite early on in the warm season, developed these stains on them:    All of the tree's leaves dried out and fell long before autumn (around late June). I understand this might have been caused by a Horse Chestnut Leaf Miner infection, which seem very common in Europe in later years, and against which apparently no cure currently exists, once appeared.  Assuming this parasite is in fact what's causing the leaves' degradation in this case, then I am wondering how likely it is that the same parasite will infect the same tree next spring as well, or whether this just happens randomly and cannot be prevented. If it can be prevented, what substance can use? "
1026,Seeds not germinating,"I have planted a couple herbs 2 - 3 weeks ago and this is the result.  It seems the wild rocket has pretty much all come up, the others had similar number of seeds planted but not making a show.  2x basil, 1x mint, 1x sage, 1x rocket.  Its been on a windows sill, no direct sun but good light (for the UK at this time of year). Also been keeping it under a lamp when its been overly cloudy.  Are the rest a lost cause? Is this usual when growing from seeds?  How can I get the rest to either come up, or the next batch work well. The seeds are new, purchased from a seemingly reputable (20k+ good feedback) organic seller on ebay.   "
1027,Recommendations for how to equip a small home greenhouse?,"As I prepare for fall around here (USDA zone 8a, max low ~10f, average low ~45f) I long for a greenhouse to bet overwinter some of our showy pots, and perhaps get a jump on some annuals and veggies as next spring rolls around.  It's no small task to add a greenhouse to our property (plus I have to check local building codes to see if it's possible to locate it where I want it.  I'm happy though because it gives me lots of time to plan and budget.  I foresee something with a rigid frame, about 8 ft x 12 ft.  I have power and water close by.  I'm wondering what systems people would suggest I install?  Are there some basic ones I should have (say a heater, and auto ventilation)?  Maybe some add ons I should consider?  Stuff I probably should avoid? "
1028,What should I do with my Cherry trees?,"I have a pair of large (roughly 30' tall I guess) cherry trees. They're mossy. They don't produce well (at least not for the 2 seasons we've had them for). What they do produce is so high that I can't net or harvest the fruit safely. The branches are a mess.  I don't know the age (we've only owned the home for a year and a bit), and I get the impression from our neighbors and the overall state of the yard that the former owners weren't all that concerned with upkeep.   The birds get most of the fruit now, but the few cherries that are low enough to harvest are delicious.   Can I aggressively prune them? When, how, and how much? Am I hoping for too much to want to get the trees down to about 15-20 feet tall? Is the moss a problem? Should I just pull it off, or do I need to treat it with something?  "
1029,What flowers require a period of time after blooming before pruning the leaves?,"The author of this answer explains that the leaves of daffodils and tulips should not be cut down or otherwise disturbed for six weeks after the flower has gone by, as they are providing the necessary nutrients for the following year's blooms. Also, feeding the plant is important during that period. It is, however, fine to cut down the stems.   I had planned to ask if this rule applies to other bulbs, but I came across the same instructions for bearded iris, which have  rhizomes, rather than bulbs.  In light of this, are there other flowers I should treat the same way?  "
1030,Will my lime tree recover from cold shock?,"This is my first attempt to grow something and it hasn't started off well. During the last winter, my Persian lime tree wasn't protected well enough from a cold front. All the leaves fell off, and the bark became brittle. I assumed it had died and was planning to uproot it in the spring.   When spring came around, I noticed at the very base, almost even with the soil, new leaves began to sprout. Today, even though there are 5-6 new branches forming,they are only at the base, and there is no sign of life on the rest of the tree.   If I take care of it, will it eventually recover?  Will it ever bear fruit again (Someone told me no). Should I cut away all the dead parts? Would I'd be better off replacing it.   Also, the tree was young to start with, only 4ft tall or so, but did bare a few limes before winter. Thanks!  Edit for clarity: My main question and concern is, if I choose to nurse the tree back to health, is there any possibility the tree will never bear fruit again? I had a person tell me that could happen, but I can't find any evidence to back that claim. If there is a possibility, then with the plant being so young, I might be better off starting over. Heh, I guess I feel bad for killing it and would like to see it recover.  I live in the U.S in southern Louisiana. Winters don't usually get below 20F here. I'd say average winter temp is around 50F.  Pictures   "
1031,My Rubber plant lost all its leaves!!! Can it be saved?,"Please help! This plant is nearly 15 years old and 6 feet tall. It was thriving until 2 years ago when I moved it close to a window and a heating/cooling vent when it slowly started losing its leaves. From all the reading I've done I realize that little light, drafts and change in temperature are whats caused the plant to lose all its leaves. My question is...can it be saved? and if so HOW? I have already moved it to a place that will have lots of sun and away from any drafts and vents. What, if anything can I do????? Prune it right down the the base and start over??  "

1033,How should I flatten my uneven back yard in Toronto?,"I need to regrade my backyard. Currently I have a good green layer of grass and other small unwanted :-) plants  covering my backyard. The previous owner dug a patio and I suspect that they spread the soil around the house. The soil under the grass is not level and the grading of the lot was ruined. I intend to fix the above by removing the sod, leveling the soil, grading the backyard and putting the sod back. My question is: do I need to do anything special when I use a sod cutter on this unevenly leveled soil? All the above are going to be during the same day (a weekend probably). Also a related question: is the beginning of June a good time for this? Here in Toronto we had a quite cold and dry May, and it rained quite a lot 6 days ago.  Edit: I think that I have two options: a) remove the sod, grade the soil and put the sod back AND b) use a rototiller (rent it from HomeDepot) and turn the old sod over  I would like to go with b) because: -the existing sod is poor quality -there is less work involved to remove and put back -I understand that using a rototiller will also help me to aerate the soil, make it easier to be graded  To get my lawn back I can either buy sod or seed and wait for the grass to grow back. This should be easy with the wet summer that we are in for here in To.  Any pros and cons ?  Edit2: here is a picture, the two sheds are not there anymore, that spot has no sod now  "

1035,Installing a DIY drip system,"I have a practical question about a garden irrigation system I'm thinking about creating. Instead of connecting this ""drip system"" to my faucet which only has expensive water from the government, I'd like to connect it to a water barrel that collects rain water.  I have the current setup in mind (apologies for my programmer art):   A hose is running through my 4 garden beds (only two drawn). I figure the total hose length would be about 15 meters, with a diameter of I guess 1 cm (typical garden hose). I would then make holes in the hose, and connect smaller tubes. I got this idea from [website]The question I have would be: is the system of ""communicating barrels"" enough to ensure the water from the barrel reaches all the way to the end of the hose? Or would I need a pump to ensure pressure? Is there a way to calculate these things?  Thanks in advance (I haven't bought anything yet)! "
1036,Why does the water in my rain barrel evaporate quickly?,"I have some rain barrels in my yard. After a certain amount of tinkering, they collect rain water well. However, I notice that a day or two after the rain, most of the water is gone. I've checked for leaks in the barrels and their hoses without finding any. I also moved the rain barrels out of direct sunlight as much as possible. Is it normal to lose so much water this way? Is it evaporation, or something else?  The barrels are entirely covered, except for a small hole where the water gets in. They are in my back yard, so I doubt that anyone else is using them. And the cats wouldn't be able to get at them for a (several gallon) hearty drink.  Besides the rain barrels, I have some buckets to do rain catching. These do not seem to lose water at the same rate. What gives? "

1038,Disposing wood after heavy pruning,"I'm not sure if this is the correct place to ask, but -  My wife recently got some of our trees (heavily) pruned, and it has fallen to me to handle the wood.  I am in two minds - I'm contemplating purchasing a 9kw petrol Chipper/Shredder (about US$800), or I could cut the branches smaller and throw them into the creek area at the back of my house.    I seem to recall the hardware store selling apple chips (for bbq'ing or smoking, not eating) at about $10 per kg).   My wife wants to BBQ, but does not know how. I've never smoked anything.  Does anyone know if it would be practical to use a chipper to make my own bbq chips, and if so, what I need to do in terms of prep?  (Do I let the wood sit around until the leave dry up, can I shred it with the leaves on?  Does it need to be dry - which is an ask in my climate).  If I just throw the wood into the creek, how long will it take to decompose (months, years, bad idea altogether?)  "
1039,Controlling Coriander/Cilantro ,"   Possible Duplicate:   How do you discourage cilantro from bolting too quickly?       I have a Coriander plant that I think is bolting. It started flowering and got quite tall.Most of the standard coriander leaves have gone, and have been replaced by Fennel-like leaves.  I assume I can't cook with these? Is there anything I can do to make it produce the standard type leaves? "
1040,Should I repot the zinnia that's in a crowded pot with some marigolds?,"I've always had a green thumb. Not sure how but it's natural to me. I started growing French dwarf marigolds and semi dwarf zinnias from seed early May. They're just now starting to bloom.  Because I wasn't sure exactly how many plants to have per pot and how well different flowers grew together, I planted 2 marigolds and 2 zinnias in a 4 1/2 in wide by 5 1/2 in tall plastic flower pot and I let them take off on their own. One of the zinnias died. The other zinnia is almost done blooming and the marigolds are growing their buds.   During the hottest part of the day it starts wilting. I also have to water it 4 times a day. The zinnia I had to stake up because it keeps falling over.  I'm not sure how to repot flowers that are in one pot with 3 plants without damaging the stem of one of them.   Should I repot my zinnia? Or should I leave them alone since they're doing okay? I keep my eye on them during the heat and put them in shade.  "
1041,What are these shallow markings on my chili leaves?,"I had some green aphids, and killed them with an acetamiprid based insecticide. Everything after that seemed fine until recently. Some whiteflies started showing and I treated those with a mixture of rubbing alcohol, liquid soap and water. After few days they seem to be gone for the most part. But now, some plants are showing different symptoms and I have no idea what's wrong with them. I get it, those eaten by the bloody flies have some issues, but what's happening to the others?   Here are some of them:  Some Cayenne plants seem to be fine. But some got this:     Here is a Jalapeño with some other problem:    To me, it looks like it's been eaten by something, but there were plants with more white flies on them and they practically have no damage. Also, some Royal Black chilies and one Jamaican Hot lost more or less of their leaves without having no other symptoms at all. I used some granulated NPK fertilizer (15:15:15) on a few plants and most of them didn't get any. This doesn't seem to matter, because there are some sick and some healthy in both groups (fertilized and not). I don't know, maybe I did bad with this solution against white flies, but I'm not so sure.. I mean, some of the plants are totally fine and some are very sick. Any ideas?  Update: 2015/06/07  Help people! This is starting to kill all my plants. There are no more white flies, they are just wilting. Here's my biggest Jalapeño, which was just fine until today.      What's this, how do I stop it? "

1043,Cactus Identification? Are the buds real?,My friend brought me a little cactus from a plant sale. Unfortunately I don't have a clue about cacti and was wondering if someone could tell me what the little orange buds are? Are they real?

1044,'Dead' Bonsai Help,"My wife bought me a small tree two years ago from a Garden Show. I am unsure of the variety, sorry!  It had a great summer on our decking, and was thriving. It wintered well, and came back glorious .... however, when we went on holiday, the neighbour watering plants for us, forgot about it. We returned to brown dead leaves. They all fell off, and we were left with three sticks ... I was gutted.  Instead of throwing it away, my wife left it in a corner of the garden, and amazingly, this year some leaves have appeared on one of them ... Was hoping for advice on what to do to help it recover? Are the others really dead? Do we need to separate and re pot the surviving tree?   "

On top of the leaves, there are also small reddish moving dots that appear to me as insects.  Does anyone know what are these tiny reddish brown insects? Are these really insects?  They have super tiny legs and looks like they can form weblike white thing on the leaves. "
1049,Using Sunflowers as living bean poles,"About a month ago I got the idea to try growing pole beans (Kentucky Wonder) and using my sunflowers as support instead of bothering to put up a trellis. Of course it wasn't until after I bought the seeds that I paused to wonder if the sunflowers would be able to keep ahead of the beans. I have no experience with growing pole beans.  The Sunflowers: One portion of the sunflowers are a variety I grew last year. It's a branching variety, the seed pack claimed they would grow to 6 or 7 feet. In my garden they reached 8 feet easily. A second is a mixed pack with at least 3 varieties in it, I think they are branching varieties and they also claim a final height of 6 or 7 feet. A third set is actually a descendant of the first variety (apparently I missed one head when I was clearing up stalks from last years flowers).   I'm fairly sure the sunflowers can handle the weight as I needed a hatchet to cut down the stalks this spring. I'm not too concerned about the beans wanting to get any taller than the sunflowers as I can't harvest any higher than I expect the sunflowers to grow anyway.   The real question is will the sunflowers be able to stay keep ahead of the beans? At the moment the sunflowers have about a 3 week head start (they're 6 inches tall, and likely to grow quick with the 70-80 degree days forecast for most of the week. Should I give them a little more time to put on size before I complicate things?  "
1050,Hand-digging vs Tree-spade: When should you use one method over the other?,"Is there any real difference in survivability or growth of trees transplanted using one vs. the other?   For example, would moving a cedar using a 90"" tree-spade yield similar/better/worse results than hand digging and burlapping a 90"" ball?  How about smaller sizes?  What things (other than cost) should be considered when weighing one vs. the other? "
1051,What are the white patches on my succulent?,"I recently bought this plant ( about 3 weeks before ) and replanted it in my container.I used the desert mix, I live in redwood city CA and it is placed outside and gets a lot of sun ( more than 8 hrs). I have been watering it when the soil get very dry. I noticed these white patches and wasn't sure what to do?  It's tips are also getting brown, should I be watering more? But I am afraid of overwatering as I have killed succulents before my overwatering them.   "
1052,Removing blooms from these unidentified Bromeliads?,"So, I have two Bromeliads (I don't know specific names) for conversation sake, until identified I've labeled the pics Small Brom(1st 3 pics) and Larger Brom(last 2 pics) below. Please see blooms. Both of their blooms are starting to brown. I held up white paper behind each in the close ups, so it's a little easier to see color contrast.  Can you please help identify types of Bromeliads I have?  Also, at what point do I snip the blooms? And how far down do I snip? Or do I wait for them to fall off? The small Brom has 4 pups and the larger has 6, which I was told is very unusual. Is this unusual or normal? The small Brom has a bloom thats formed at the top of the leaves (doesn't have it's own stock coming from core, like the larger Brom) so I assumed where to snip the blooms would differ? I'm really unsure though.  They both have more than quadrupled in size and are not in their original pots. I didn't know until a recent post I asked about a different Brom, that I should've have reported them, and that they prefer to get root bound... So if you were curious about their pot size, that's why... My bad :(                 "
1053,Sundew leaves are becoming brown - should I move it to a larger pot?,"Three months ago, we bought this sundew in a small pot. As told by the seller, we watered it with purified water poured below the pot. Now, its leaves are becoming brown:   I thought that maybe I should move it to a larger pot. But, I was told that it needs sterile soil, and all I found in the gardening stores was the usual soil (that comes with some fertilizers).   What should I do? Is it a good idea to move the sundew to a somewhat larger pot with a standard gardening soil?  EDIT: I understand that standard gardening soil is not good for a sundew. I did not find clean soil in gardening stores. Where can I find clean soil? Can I e.g. collect sand from the seashore? "
1054,Encouraging fig or similar into canopy: what to do with site of severed limbs?,"This is a fig tree which has been pruned with a chainsaw down low and with normal secateurs up high. Down the bottom on the left you can see the nodule where a limb about 13cm (5 inches) in diameter has been severed.  The idea here is to encourage this fig into a canopy which can provide shade in summer and not be all prickly with when you venture under the tree. The shape of the tree is more important to us than abundance of fruit   What should I do to the sites of the severed limbs to discourage any resprouting from them. Are there any tricks to this or should I just leave it alone? The other thing is, given the explicit aim here, should I cut off the far left and far right limbs that are still on it to emphasise upward growth rather than bushiness?     NB: Acknowledging preexisting question about pruning a fig that doesn't cover my question here: What is the proper way to prune a Fig Tree?  Update: I don't know if this is the right way to describe it, but do I need to ""cauterise"" the large cut sites by painting something on them to protect against infections and ""seal the wound"". (I really don't know what I'm talking about, feel free to edit this!) "
1055,Advise from experienced farmers,"I don't know whether I should ask this question here or not, but I could not find any stackexchange website related to agriculture, so I found this website most near to agriculture, and I think that there are experienced plant growers of many countries here. If so, please give me proper guidance.  I live in a rural area of ​​India and my ancestors have been cultivating land for many years, and now I am also interested in it. We have done traditional farming for many years, like wheat, mustard, millet and cotton.  Is it possible to cultivate the land as to self-sustain my family and to have a living standard close to that of a doctor or engineer? What should I cultivate and how to cultivate in order to earn self-sustainability as fast as possible?  What steps do I take to reach my goal?    Editor's note: there are parts of the world where growing plants is considered to be farming, especially in rural communities where mechanization is less common. Due to the fact that in more technologized areas of the world farming is considered to be large-scale agriculture and often involves animal farming, I have replaced this term with growing plants in order to reduce ambiguity.

1056,What kind of tree is this? And how can I kill it?,"This tree is growing outside my office and blocking almost all the light coming into my window. I don't necessarily want to kill the tree and I can't just blatantly chop it down, but I would like to get more light in my office. I'm also hesitant to prune it for fear of making it look holey. If the tree met an untimely end, I would not be upset.  Two questions:   What kind of tree is this? What non-apparent things can I do to make it so that I get more light through my window?      "
1057,What steps can I use to encourage pollination?,"I have some plants that have many flowers but not very many vegetables being produced; sometimes it seems as if I'm growing the plants for the pretty flowers and not for the vegetables that may eventually appear. The flowers look healthy, though sometimes it appears that they open up in the morning, look beautiful until about 2:00, then slowly die by the end of the evening.   I suspect lack of pollination is an issue. What types of things can I do to encourage pollination to occur? Is it possible that there are simply not enough bees/other pollinators in the area?  EDIT: In this particular case I'm referring to cucumber and zucchini plants, but I'd like to see if I can get information that will be helpful when I plant other types of flowering plants, like chilies, strawberries, or tomatoes. "
1058,How can I remove stagnant water stuck under a houseplant?,I have a houseplant in a pot with drainage that I put into another pot without drainage. I should have gotten a larger outside pot because the smaller plant pot ended up being too tight a fit at the top. A while after watering I realized that the water wasn't going to evaporate and would be stagnant. Can this water be dangerous (as in anaerobic stuff going on)? I don't want to leave this outside because an animal could drink it so I have been leaving it and put chopsticks between both pots to try get some air to it but it still didn't evaporate. Any ideas on disposing of this water safely? Thanks! 
1059,What are some sustainable alternatives to peat for potting compost?,"I've just finished writing the tag wiki for organic and was thinking about wider issues of sustainability. Perhaps the best area where I could improve things personally, would be to use an alternative medium for seed trays. At the moment I use peat-based potting soils -the kinds that are sold for germinating seeds.  I currently use a mixture for larger plant types, and I could easily avoid the peat based composts and use more of the coarser wood-based composts.  But what could I use for starting new seeds with? It would have to be nutritionally rich, and also fine grained. Seeds are primarily peppers, but I do start other things from seeds.  I think I've heard of people using coir (derived from coconut husk hair), but I think I heard it was too fissile? Does anyone have any experience or have any other alternatives I could try in spring?  I don't recall seeing anything in the big box garden suppliers here in Texas - so I would probably have to go to a nursery. "

1061,How should I plant snowdrops along a long driveway?,"Our drive is getting on for 100m long, bordering a wooded stream. We would like to line it with snowdrops but I'm worried this is a colossal task as some sources claim I need 100+ bulbs per square metre. Ultimately we would like a the whole area to be drifted but appreciate this will take some years.  What is the best way to set this up so it will look OK with fewer bulbs, and spread nicely? What is the minimum bulbs we could get away with that it would not look silly, and should they be planted individually or in small clumps?  I don't have a wide shot in season but:      The woodland is on the right of the drive, falling away into a stream just past the line of trees - the close-up showed it this spring around the stream.

1062,"Glyphosate accident on lawn, how to repair?","I thought Glyphosate was safe on grass so sprayed it liberally on the weeds in the beds and clearly have splashed the grass.  What are my options to repair? What do you recommend? Would I noticed the difference with grass from another supplier?   Get some local turf and try and replace it and live with the difference in colour? Will I noticed? Get some local seed and sprinkled over the top and live with the difference in colour? Will I noticed? Drive 2.5 hours to the place that delivered the original turf and replace it?  Drive 2.5 hours to the place that delivered the original turf and buy some seed (they only sell £80 / 20KG bags of seed!) Somehow cultivate the grass I have to spread into that space?   Leave it alone and hope the grass grows into the patches? Dig out the dead patches and hope the grass grows into the patches?    I live in London, UK. PS what you cant see is plastic edging (controversial I know!) which makes redrawing the edging difficult as the edging is 1 continuous piece.    "
1063,Which types of broccoli are cut-and-come-again?,"I grew two types of broccoli this year. One was monaco I think, and the other one I'm not sure about (maybe calabrese?).  We started harvesting the monaco more than a month ago and per this question we have been getting a good crop of secondary heads ever since.  But the other one has given us nothing at all in terms of secondary heads (nothing wrong with its maincrop).   In neither case did they get anywhere close to flowering. Is the difference down to variety? Or is it something to do with how and when we harvested? "
1064,French beans (Green beans): Dwarf v. Climbing,"French beans (or ""green beans"") are widely sold in both dwarf (bush) and climbing (pole) varieties. If anything, my experience is that the climbing varieties are harder to find in seed outlets.  Apart from the obvious the difference - dwarf plants take up less space and you don't need to support them - are there are any other differences?  For example, flavour, heavy cropping, choice of varieties, length of cropping, environmental tolerances?  I'm assuming the dwarf varieties have been manufactured more recently (but I have no idea whether that's true). So is it possible that the gain in convenience has been at the expense of something else? "
1065,Why don't you want to put mint in a compost pile?,"A video by UC Berkeley on YouTube said that you don't want to put mint in compost. Why not? He also said no Bermuda grass, but I know why this is the case, essentially due to one of their other videos. "
1066,How much coffee grounds should I add to my compost (and how frequently)?,"I have been reading that spent coffee grounds can be used for fertilizer and/or composting and also came across this question on this site.  I have a compost pile in the yard that holds roughly two 33 gallon trashbags full of uncomposted leaves (i.e. freshly raked leaves from the yard).  Can I take my spent/wet coffee grounds out each morning and add it into the compost pile (I drink about 2-3 cups/day)?  How much coffee grounds should I add so that there is a balance between other stuff in the compost pile? If adding it daily is too much, should I limit my composting of the spent coffee grounds to less frequent intervals (once a week, once every two weeks, etc)? "
1067,"Pruning ""Dead"" Indeterminate Tomato Plant","I have a pair of indeterminate tomato plants in the garden, which gave me quite an impressive harvest, but now the weather turned and the vast majority of the leaves have shrivelled up and died.  I was told however, instead of just ripping it up off the ground, I should trim off most of the branches and prune it in a particular manner (trimming off branches coming from the main, but leaving a small nib), such that it'll regrow anew next season instead of me having to start over.  I tried researching it, but could find nothing about it. Is it worth giving it a try? How exactly should I be pruning it? "
1068,What are some resources for region-dependent planting schedule/calender?,"Is there a website that has planting calendars for various regions?  Is this sort of information more typically acquired through books, or just by word of mouth?  I'd like to have a list of crops, sorted by safe first sowing date, also by transplanting date, and perhaps also by last sowing date.  Obviously this is quite dependent on local climates, and even micro-climates, but perhaps there is a resource out there that could serve as a rough guide.  I'm located in Maritime Canada, but am hoping that this can be a good general question for people in a variety of regions. "
1069,Dawn Redwood Bonsai Forrest Issue,"I have a Dawn Redwood Bonsai Forrest. 3 out of 4 mini trees are doing fine (2 are doing great, one is doing fine) but the forth (the smallest one) looks sort of bad. Its leaves are look sort of dry and I don't know what I can do about it.   When I received it, maybe 2 weeks ago, I had to repot it because one of the trees were nearly out of the soil and the soil was beyond horrible. So, I repotted it and the tallest tree that seemed like it was about to die started growing and seems much better. On the other side, the smallest tree seems sort of sick?   I try to expose them as much sun as possible because I do know they like full sunlight and the soil is easily drained, yet moist. Is there something else I could possible do? (I've attached some photos just to see the condition of the trees right now).   "
1070,Will dead pine needles on top of new grass seed prevent the grass seed from germinating?,"I recently removed old roots, weeds and grass from a small area in front of our house.  I had some leftover mushroom compost, so I built up some areas to make the entire area level, but now it seems that dead pine needles from a neighbouring tree are falling onto the area I just seeded.  Will the pine needles not allow the seeds to germinate?  Is there anything I can do? "
1071,"Succulent spreading outward, Exposed roots","Please see pics below. I'm assuming (possibly shouldn't assume) that this succulent was in poor light before I brought it home because of all the spreading. What's the proper thing to do with it? I'm wanting to re-pot it because the pot can't stand on it's own, without putting something under each of the two main spreads. All clippings and pups are rooted in, and when I went to remove, to re-pot everything came out in one chunk. Is it safe to  clip the roots, or will the plant suffer? When I re-pot it, should they all be separated, or should I put it in a pot wide enough that the spreads are also touching soil, so they can root down?            UPDATE: Voila! What do you think? (PIC BELOW) I don't like answering my own questions, and received much help from @Bamboo comments. I've included a pic of what I did with it from the advice. I layered the bottom of this pot with large aquarium gravel then topped off with my own mixed: mixed bird grit, playground sand, cactus soil and regular potting soil together. I potted the ""clump"" from old pot and filled loosely with the mix. The spreads are gently resting on top of the soil mix, and I lightly sprinkled some of the mix on top of the exposed roots. I only lost 2 roots, and one leaf (clipping shown in right bottom corner), that I placed on top of the soil. This pot has two large drainage holes, and is about 2"" deep. Cross your fingers this works okay!  I also have cactus liquid fertilizer, but am unsure if I should use it yet.   "

1073,"What are these white with black caterpillars eating Petunias in Albuquerque, New Mexico?","I'm visiting grandparents in Albuquerque, New Mexico and am trying to help perk up some of their potted and hanging potted plants. It doesn't take long for plants to dwindle in this area (dry and hot and high altitude).  I keep finding tiny caterpillars (or worms?) that are no longer than the width of my pinky finger nail. They're white with one wide horizontal black stripe (not from head to tail, just across abdomen). They are not fuzzy, and have no spikes. They are chewing on the flowers only from what I can tell, Petunias specifically. They chew on them before the bloom is even open! And the ones that have opened get torn up too!  I treated for mites, and the spray consisted of garlic oil, cottonseed oil and neem. The mites disappeared, but these little white and black buggers did not.  Can you please help me to identify them for me, so I can research how to get rid of them? I'm not finding matching pics online. Or do you have any tips to get rid of these? I know the Petunias specifically won't last too too much longer, but until then I'd like to keep up with them as much as possible during my stay.  Please refrain from discouraging keeping these flowers in this climate or recommending others-locals here have already warned us. My grandmother just moved here, has little income to get more and it gives her comfort to look out the window and see her flowers, during hard times.   This is a picture of what might be the ""baby"" or ""larvae version"" of pest. It's not a good picture, and was taken at night with flash, so you can't see markings, but he's white. (I'm still trying to get a good picture, my luck- they're hiding when I try to get a picture!)    Here's a picture of the damage.  "
1074,What to do with a plant that can't support its own weight?,"I received this plant (I'm sorry, I'm not entirely sure what it is) a few years back when it was on death's door and only had a few living leaves left. I managed to bring it back to health but that left me with another issue: all the new growth increased the weight of the plant and the existing stem could no longer support its weight.  In a bid to keep the whole thing from falling over and snapping, I staked it. It kept growing and growing and now it's to the point where the top is much heavier and larger than the poor, sickly original stem can support.  Is there a way I can train this plant to eventually support itself without the stakes or am I past the point of no return? If not, is there anything I can do to help ensure that the tiny little stem does not snap, say while moving, etc.?    "
1075,No dig methodology?,"My backyard has just been cleared of convolvulus ( field bindweed ), and native bush/trees exposing what used to be a lawn a decade ago. I'm thinking I would like to try the no-dig method of layering down some newspaper, putting some compost on top, mulching on top of that, and then planting.  I just wonder if there's any benefit from using a fork to loosen the soil ( not turn it over ), before I put the newspaper down.  This would be the same as the second step when double digging.  I do understand that it is claimed that vegetables are shallow rooting so don't need this step, but others claim that they're shallow rooting because the soil has not been double dug!  So, does anyone who does no-dig gardening have any experience?  Or should I just double dig and get out as many convolvulus roots as I can? "
1076,How to paint a cut off branch on a spruce tree?,"I have a spruce tree (picea abies), which is next to a path and since one of the lower branches was obstructing the passing down the path, I cut it off. Now my question is how do I paint the place where the branch was? What kind of paint should I use, is color important, or is there some special substance just for that?  Thank you in advance. "
1077,What are these white spots on my Purslane leaves?,"I am growing Purslane as vegetables, however I noticed some white spots on the leaves.  I used agriculture pesticides for aphids, whitefly and so on but nothing changed.  Do you think these white dots are a fungal infection? If so what pesticide is recommended for it?   I am attaching photos for the infected purslane, hoping you can figure out what that is.             "
1078,"Tree Biology, identify tree by the roots","I have some roots in my pipes under my house. It will change a lot of liability if I could identify which tree the roots are coming from. I was curious if root cells, looked at under a microscope, differ from one tree species to the next? I have 2 different trees (of different species) in my yard and community common area, and was wondering if there was any way to identify which tree the roots came from?   Thanks! "
1079,"Edible, indoor, winter plants. What lights? (and other advice)","I don't have any outdoor gardening space and I'd love to grow some edible plants indoors, preferably during the winter when the sunlight is low. I understand I need non pollinated plants, since my apartment is rather low in pollinators. I also want to use grow lights.   Am I being silly trying to grow edible plants indoor in the winter? What lights should I get? What kinds of plants can I grow with a good light? I saw this post, but it's not about lights. People have suggested lettuce, herbs and green onions. Can I just put the plants on a shelf and use a timer with the lights? Do I need something more complicated, e.g. hydroponics?  "
1080,Peace lily wilted inexplicable,"I have a peace lily in my office at work that gets low indirect natural light, in addition to bright white fluorescent light.  I have had it for about 12 months now. I have not potted it up, and it has always been quite root bound.  All that said, it was always the happiest green and healthy plant. It consistently got new foliage growth and sometimes almost flowered. It never ever showed signs of nutrient deficiency, and the leave were always a healthy green with a flawless complexion.  Then last weak it wilted like it was thirsty, and after watering it, it is not reviving. It is wilting now like it is heavily dehydrated, even though the soil is still semi damp from the last watering. Even though it is wilted over, and the stems are getting a little soft to the touch, the leave still have turgor and seems almost like they are not dehydrated.  I always watered it only when it got completely bone dry. I never over water.  I have no clue what happened. The only thing I could imagine is that last time I watered it, I much too heavily swamped it, and in a single watering I drown the plant. Is that possible??  This plant shows no signs of root rot, and has never shown signs of any maladies. Just one day it wilted and it won't revive.  Is there some other possibility of what went wrong?          "
1081,"Should I remove the top of a tall, skinny eucalyptus to promote a stronger core?","I've got a tall skinny eucalyptus tree that I planted about a year and a half ago. When I bought it, its trunk was somewhat narrow, and tethered in at least three spots to a stake to keep it straight. However it seems that this has caused it to not have a strong trunk, as it hasn't had to fend for itself in the wind and weather.  Fast forward a year and a bit, and it's at least another meter taller, but no stronger. I've released the tether except for one right at the top to prevent it from bowing over and breaking.  To recover this, can/should I lop off the top in the hope that it re-sprouts further below and develops a stronger trunk on its own (without the tether)? If I do this, how far from the top should I cut?    Here are some close-ups for identification of the specific type of eucalyptus:     "
1082,"Soil nutrient replacement, bamboo question","I know little of botany and earth science subjects. This might be a stupid question, here it goes.  What I have: A hillside with a running variety of bamboo in Oregon. The bamboo shoots reach about 25ft long and mostly lean over at 12ft high or so. They get to be about 3/4"" - 1"" in diameter. I have a trail going thru the forest, down a hill and towards the ocean. It has very high rails holding the bamboo back. But, eventually the trail becomes a tunnel that only kids can get thru if not maintained. Several times a year I create about 6 piles of cut bamboo 6x6x25 feet. Again, repeat this process for a section that I try to keep below 6ft tall once a year (for ocean views).  Question: Am I killing the soil by hauling all this green mass off to another location for either burning or tossing? Again, i'm not educated on the subject and this kind of thing never really bothered me like when I haul grass clippings to another location. But, with such large amounts of mass from such a small location, it feels like I am literally degrading that part of my property or damaging it somehow. Is this true? How important is it to put the cut bamboo back where it came from as mulch? Or, am I worrying about nothing? "
1083,Does this bird cause any harm to the garden?,Couple of days back we had a visitor to our garden. I've never seen this bird before. Does anyone know what this bird is? And does it do any damage to the garden?      Sorry about the blurry picture. Its due to the mesh door. And I live in the pacific northwest area. 
1084,How to establish a chili variety,One of my chili seedlings has very narrow leaves. The picture below shows it in front of a normal seedling.  Question: If I wanted to propagate the plant because of this particular feature - what would I have to do? How would I establish my narrow leaf chili variety and get its seeds?    The plant is indeed a narrow leafed specimen and it is about to produce flowers. I am wondering what the fruit will look like.   
1085,Side effects of introducing cultivated variants of a plant into an area where the wild version grows?,"Plant breeders, farmers and gardening enthusiasts have for centuries been selectively breeding plants to develop plants with certain desired traits, be it larger roots or fruit, showy flowers or....  So if one chooses to plant that is the result of some breeding effort in an area where the original wild version is at home, could that have negative efects on the wildlife? Like cross-polinating and similar? And are there methods to avoid spreading of the cultivated type?  I distinctly remember some of the wild Bellis perennis in my parents' lawn suddenly showing a double layer of ray florets and pinker tinge after pink cultivated bellis were planted in a flowerbed nearby.  Would I risk a similar effect if I planted red-leaved variant of elder (S. niger 'Black Beauty', S. niger 'Black Lace') in my garden, in a region where Sambucus niger is growing wild? Short of cutting off all flowers before bloom, is there a way to avoid it? Or is the risk only theoretical? "
1086,Winter Watering time of day? At what temperature do I cover any of the plants with plastic tarp?,"I have a garden in san mateo, ca that is only 5x9 and we have 5 large tomato plants, herbs, broccoli and lettuce.  We have an automatic water sprinkler that goes off every other day.  I want to know if I should arrange the time of watering to late morning or noon, it's set for 3am now.  How low can the temperature go before covering and for how long do I do this?  All winter? "
1087,What is Horticultural Grit?,"I live the U.S. but I read UK gardening books.  Can someone please explain what is ""Horticultural Grit"".  What is it make of, what is the size of the particles?  Is there some standard reference that defines or specifies ""Horticultural Grit""?  If I wanted to buy it in the U.S., what would I ask for?  Thanks for the help. "
1088,Can you have too much drainage in a garden?,"I plan on using some of these drainage bricks to build a retaining wall.     The installation of the drainage bricks recommends that a drainage layer is used to route the water away from the base of the inner wall.   I am thinking to lay a very wide drainage layer, however my concern is that I ""Dry Up"" my garden.   is it possible for me to over-drain my garden, whereby any moisture absorbed into the ground is routed away too quickly?  is there any drainage guide which i can apply?

1089,Why are the leaves on my Peace Lily turning yellow and brown?,"Several leaves of my Peace Lily are turning brown directly, or after first turning yellow. I'm pretty confident I'm watering it the right amount, but the hot weather started here in Madrid about 10 days ago, and I haven't humidified the leaves in the last few days. The problem started while I was humidifying it regularly, but it has worsened quickly since the weather got warmer. Should I humidify it every day? Would more than once a day be better? Is the humidity even that important, or could another issue be causing the problem?  It doesn't look like it needs to be repotted, and it's not receiving direct sunlight. Since my room is very hot, do I need to move it to a different room? I hope not, since it's where I spend my time working!   Also, some weeks ago I put some fertilizer in water and used that to water it 3 or 4 times in a row over a period of about 16 days. It was growing nicely, but then the problem started. Was that a bad idea? Could it be related to its present state?  How can I keep Peace Lily alive and growing?    Adding pics of roots in case there's anything wrong with them or the soil...      "
1090,"Bare, old wood spots on cedar hedge","I have recently purchased a home with a lovely cedar hedge that makes the yard quite private. In some areas, the old hedge has bare spots that seem to be called ""old wood"" showing through. From my research, these areas never seem to regrown or fill in.  What should I do? Leave it? Cut the ""old wood"" out? Will the whole hedge eventually turn like this? "
1091,Mounting Air Plants and commonly used terrarium substrate safeness,"I'm wanting to put together air plant (Tillandsia) terrariums and hanging decor for gifts. I'll be making 8-9, and want each one to look different. I read on a Google search you can use silicone glue/sealant to glue them onto wood and rocks. Is there a type of wood that works best?  Any suggestions on glues? And will the silicone based kind damage or harm the plants in any way? If so, is there a safe plant based option, or DIY kind you can make?  I also see decorative and colored sands and dried moss used quite often. Will either option be safe to use? Or is it only sustainable for a short period of time (meant for temporary decor)? What's the best way to go about making them in a manner that whomever I give them to has the least amount of care possible; Not having to transplant, weeks or months later, but still appear decorative and colorful?

1092,New to houseplants - what's wrong with my chilli plant?,"I'm currently growing a few chilli plants from seed in my apartment, but the largest one is having some problems. Some of the leaves are curling, whilst others have a dusty, salty substance on the bottom and light green patches on the top. Parts of the stem have started to brown.    (Photo gallery here: [website]As I'm really new to growing plants in general, I have no idea of the cause - I've been watering them fairly frequently recently (around once a day/once every two days) as they live in a sunny windowsill (well, for the UK) and the soil appears dry. None of the plants it lives alongside (also chilli plants) are having the same issues, though it is the largest of the plants and may possibly require repotting? I've spent a long while Googling, but haven't been able to find anything that matches the exact symptoms.  Any ideas? "
1093,Can an orchid be revived with no roots?,"Unfortunately someone decided to water one of my phalenopsis while I was away. I came back to a smelly mess with all the leaves dead, two stems still present and green from when it flowered 6 months ago, and all the roots that were in the bark rotted. I don't see any viable roots.  I'm wondering if it's even possible to save it.  For the moment I've put what was the roots under continuous running water ( aquarium waterfall ) to see if I can supply it highly oxygenated water.  I'm going away again so I can not rely on anyone just watering out daily.  Anyone think this might work? Our should I try something else?    "
1094,What should I do to rescue grass from a petrol spill?,"We had some less than stellar workmen do some work a few weeks ago, and one of them spilled a substantial amount of petrol onto our front lawn. There is now an area about 100cm in diameter where the grass is completely dead.  I was not able to do anything about it until now (about 3 weeks later), so I have dug up the entire dead area, down to about 30cm. This is as far as I can reasonably dig, because we live in a clay area (Sydney Australia - almost all of the west is just clay).  The clay still stinks of petrol though, as did all of the dirt and grass I dug up.  Is there any way I can repair this? Do I just leave it dug out for a few weeks to ""dry""? (It's summer at the moment, so lots of long, hot 30&deg;C days and hotter)?  If I throw some fresh dirt from another part of the yard into the hole and plant new grass seeds, will the petrol that's in the clay just re-contaminate it? Or is that area going to be dead forever? "
1095,"What is this low-growing plant with fuzzy green and gray leaves, and when can I transplant it?","I found a number of these plants tucked behind peonies, bleeding hearts and other perennials. They're primarily up against my cement foundation, and are growing in clumps. I didn't plant them, but don't know if they're perennial or something that re-seeded. They may have been there in previous years and escaped my notice.  The furry leaves are a combination of green and gray. Each plant is only a few inches high, and the widest are about 8 inches (20 cm) at the base.   I'd appreciate an identification and a bit of information as to what I can expect from them as they grow. If they produce flowers, when will that be? Also, what will they look and smell like? Right now I don't see buds, just pairs of young leaves forming at each center.   They're very pretty and different from anything else I have, so I want to move some to where I can see them. When can I do that? I've heard that a general rule of thumb in transplanting is either well before a plant flowers, or after the flower has gone by. The foliage alone is worth looking at, but if it's saving energy for flowering, I don't want to interrupt the process.   Since they're all in the shade, is that a pre-requisite for optimal growth? I have both shady and sunny areas, so that would be helpful to know.   I live in zone 6. Our average high temperatures in the summer are between 80°F (27°C) and 90°F (32°C), although we usually get a few significantly higher spells. The location of these makes me think they're shielded from that level of heat, but I can't say for sure. I started seeing them just after our last frost, but if they've overwintered, they're hardy well below freezing.      "
1096,Narrow-leaved prunus laurocerasus wants to become wide-leaved! What to do?,"This spring I planted a narrow-leaved prunus laurocerasus (it could be Otto Lycken cultivar, but I am not positive). It started well and strong. However, the summer in my area was very hot and dry, and the plant was visibly shaken throughout summer months - a lot of leaves dropping, new leaves appearing. At some point it even bloomed, so it was strong, but still confused, and it still looks as if suffered a lot.  And about a month ago, a strange thing happened: New leaves started appearing from the base of the plant - and they are not narrow any more! They look like those from common prunus laurocerasus.  I have no clue what to do. Should I remove new leaves? Should I remove old leaves? Or should I just leave the plant as is and let the nature do the selection?  This is overall present look of the plant:  (branches used to be full of narrow leaves - now there are just some at the tops; at the center of the lant you can see new wide leaves)    Wide leaves at the base of the plant:    Narrow leaves at the top of the plant:   "
1097,What could be causing my blueberries to have a funny taste?,"I have just harvested some of the ripest berries from a row of 6 blueberries of different varieties. They all have a slightly odd taste that I have never detected in store bought blueberries. It is difficult to describe. My wife suggested it almost tastes like a hint of basil, or some similar 'grassy' note. I have read they can taste sour if you pick them too soon, but I wouldn't call this a sour taste.  Is this possibly just what these varieties taste like? Unfortunately I don't have the exact names of them.  What could cause blueberries to taste like this? Could this be a soil, watering or fertilising issue? "
1098,Can herbs steal each others flavor?,"I made oswego tea for the first time tonight and my wife thought I had given her oregano tea. It was too much of a coincidence to guess that I think. She had no idea I made tea out of bee balm and the bee balm was planted right next to the oregano (probably too close now, since both have grown a lot in the last year).   I've heard it is possible for some herbs like basil to somehow weasel their oils in to tomatoes, but is it possible to corrupt herbs in a similar way? Or does Oswego tea just more or less taste like oregano? "
1099,"What is this fern-like plant with red stems and green, red or cream colored leaves?","I am trying to solve this mystery plant. Could anyone verify if it is a fern at the very least?  The photo was taken at the UC Berkeley Botanical Garden in Berkeley, California two years ago. I have contacted the garden's horticulturist but he is on vacation and this is in sort of a time crunch.  Updated: From my memory the spread was quite big maybe a few feet, 2 or 3 feet, in width and the plant was as high as 3 feet? The width may be smaller but I do for sure remembering having to be on my tip toes to take this photo because i wanted this angle and I am 5 2"" so it had to be somewhat tall. For sure though, this photo was taken in July.    "

1101,How to maintain forest land with a variety of tree species?,"I own 5 acres of forest land in Northern Idaho. On one part there are many different species but many have died. There are a lot of dead birch trees laying around.   Am I helping or hurting by picking up all the fallen branches, sticks, etc. from the ground and raking up what appears to be years of dead leaves? I'm trying to help but now I'm having doubts.   How can I help and not hinder and still clean up? "
1102,What is this tree and will it eventually destroy my house?,"I bought my house last fall. All I knew was this is a Christmas tree. I wrapped it with Christmas lights and it looked merry last winter.  Come spring, it started sprouting new buds rapidly. Now it's summer and it's still sprouting new buds. Its needles look a lot like the 25ft Spruce tree in my front yard.        Will this tree grow so big that its roots will destroy my house's foundation?  How do I ""control"" it? It's ""hollow"" with no needles inside:  "
1103,How can I tell if a seed coating contains pesticides or fungicides?,"I purchased some Dichondra seeds online to plant in my large reptile's enclosure. There was no mention of the seeds being treated - but when I received them I noticed that the seeds were coated and listed as pre-inoculated.  I'm not generally one to be overly paranoid about pesticides &amp; fungicides but reptiles tend to be pretty sensitive to such things so I absolutely can't risk planting treated seeds. Is there any way to tell if the seeds in question are fungicide/pesticide treated? The seller didn't know, and while I'd assume there are some labeling laws for treated seeds I can't find any information on what those are. Does anyone have any idea as to what the seed coating is and whether or not it poses a risk to my lizard? "
1104,"I've found about 40 kilograms of beige powder labelled ""Green Salt"" - what is it?","I've found this in my neighbourhood, near a trash trolley:  The handwriting can be unambiguously translated from Hebrew as ""Green Salt"".   My best bet is that it is some kind of fertiliser because that would be cheap enough to throw away once you're done with and I found it outside a newly renovated garden.  Here's what it looks like inside:   And here's a closer look:   It has a definitely organic smell. I'm not sure what of, though.  Google suggests this is either Uranium tetrafluoride or Magnus' green salt.  What do you think it may be?  Why was it used for and why was it thrown away?  Would it be useful to me in any way?  Is it toxic?  Is it flammable?  Is it a fertiliser?  Is it sell-able? "
1105,Is early June too late to transplant Rhubarb in USDA Zone 5?,"Last year, I foolishly planted a rhubarb plant (zone 5) behind a Horseradish and a raised bed. It's getting shaded out.  Is it too late to dig it up and put it in a sunnier spot? I've no expectation of a crop this year, but would like the plant to survive, and possibly give me a pie or two next year.  Would it be better to wait for early fall? "
1106,My new allotment plot is covered in horsetail,"Finally got got off the waiting list and been offered an allotment plot. It's been empty for a while and is completely covered in horsetail. I've just been reading that Horsetail is the 'lodger from Hell' and the best I can hope for is a continual fight. Any suggestions how to start? Is it worth covering and mulching while I work on a small area at a time? Should I just spent a few months weeding and not worry about planting till next year? Any help would be appreciated, thanks.

1107,How to keep cucumber beetles/bacterial wilt from spreading when removing infected plant?,"I have some cucumber plants that are very infested with cucumber beetles (mostly striped, some spotted).  The plants are dying from bacterial wilt, and although it's hard to access all leaf surfaces to get an accurate count, there's probably at least one beetle per leaf.  These cucumber plants are near some zucchini and butternut squash plants.  The zucchini seem a bit damaged by the beetles but so far are doing okay.  The butternut squash look undamaged by the beetles so far, but I have seen a few on them.    I want to prevent the spread of the bacterial wilt to my zucchini and squash.  What is the best way to do this? I was thinking that removing the infected plants would be the best way, but I don't know if the beetles that are currently infecting my cucumber plants will then start wandering after the plants disappear and then congregate on my other plants in greater numbers.  If there was a way to kill the beetles as I removed the cucumber plants, I think that would be the best way to prevent the spread of beetles/bacterial wilt.  I don't know though, so please teach me.  Note: I asked a similar question, Cucumber with bacterial wilt, what to do to save other plants?.  This is where I got the suggestion to remove the plants.  Now I'm asking what to do about the soon to be homeless beetles that currently infest the cucumbers.  Another note: I have woodchips down as weed control throughout my garden, including under the cucumbers (with a few bare spots near where the stem enters the ground).  I think the beetles hide under the wood chips during the day, not sure though.  I don't see any on the plants during the day, but see a few crawling around the woodchips. "
1108,Do tomatoes really need support to grow?,I am new to gardening and I am starting out with tomatoes. I keep reading that tomatoes need support like a stake or a cage. However is there a reason why they can't just grow on the ground like pumpkins or watermelons? Do wild tomatoes grow with support as well? 
1109,What is happening to the leaves of my avocado?,"I have an avocado plant in my outdoors balcony. It's been growing nicely, but there are small brown dots/holes in the leaves for some time now. I don't see anything in the underside of the leaves, and up until now new, healthy looking leaves have continued to sprout, but I'm concerned that it will not stay healthy.  What does it have? What can I do?      UPDATE:  It's been months since I asked this question. The avocado's leaves continue to look bad, but it continues to put out new ones. I've attached a new picture of the current state as well as the trunk, in case the brown things on the trunk aren't harmless or natural (I hadn't noticed them before, because I was preoccupied with the leaves)    This is the trunk, April 2014.

1110,What is the treatment done to so-called prepared / treated hyacinth-bulbs for forcing in pots?,"To have hyacinths grow and flower indoors in pots (also known as: to force a bulb) you have to get special bulbs: they are called prepared or treated. I was not able to find out with a simple internet search what this special treatment is?  In my novice mind I would guess it has something to do with freezing or coldness?  Can someone enlighten me? Is it possible to do this ""treatment"" at home? For example to bulbs from the garden? "
1111,Can you help identify these plants in my new garden?,"I have just moved to Berkshire in the UK and this is the first house I have had with a garden. I've been trying google search to try and identify these plants, but I'm not having any luck so I hope this forum can help me.  No1 is a plant with large leaves (bigger than my hand), with serrated edges. It stands about 1m tall.     The stems are green but some of them appear to have spots on. There are also little red (buds?) where the leaf is attached to the stem. Close up of the leaves.     No. 2 is a tall plant with green leaves turning yellow/orange. It is over 6ft.    No 3 Is a climber. It has small green leaves and small white round buds/berries.    No.4 I think is a Rhododendon?    No 5 Is a tall shrub with dark green leaves and is already over 6ft - seems to have the potential for a large spread too.   This is the first time i have posted to the forum so i hope the images work ok. If they don't here is a link to the album with all the plant photos. [website]Thanks!  "
1112,What's this white bug?,"I found these white bugs on my Carolina Reaper plant last week. They seem to leave white webs/fluff behind them, as you can see in the picture. From what I've read online, they appear to me to be mealybugs, except that these little fellas jump. Are they dangerous to the plant? How should I deal with them?  I can try and get a better picture or from a different angle, if that would help.  Edit: I asked a buddy of mine who does landscape architecture, and he said it looks like some kind of spider to him, though he has no idea what kind. I looked at a list of all spiders in Indiana (where I live), and didn't find anything that even comes close to resembling it. I used a similar website to look at common bugs in Indiana, but couldn't find anything there, either. I'm in Southern Indiana, if that helps.  Update: A Carolina mantis decided that s/he now owns the pepper plant. There are no more white bugs/spiders to be seen.   "
1113,"What is the type of moss that commonly grows in dirt, trees, and bricks?","I'm trying to grow moss for my paludarium, and there's a certain type of moss that is very common (especially during fall) that you can see growing in hard-packed dirt, trees, and bricks -- (at least where I'm from, Houston, TX, US). It is very common, and looks like:    Is there a certain name for this? I don't think it's java moss or sphagnum, it looks quite different and doesn't get as big. I've tried everywhere and it appears that this is just ""moss"", but is there at least some type of scientific classification?  Edit  After doing some research, I found two possible classifications: Bryophyta oedipodium and Bryophyta bryopsida (true moss). Is it either of these? I am by no means an expert on plant life, I'm doing this for my amphibians, so if anyone is familiar with mosses, any help would be much appreciated! "
1114,Should I kill off one of the plants from a polyembryonic citrus seed to let the other grow?,I am growing some indoor citrus trees from seeds and found the seeds to mostly all sprout two plants. They are all about 1.5 inches tall right now and for each pair of plants one is clearly larger and taller than the other. I am worried that having two growing so close to each other will end up hurting both.     I was thinking of just cutting the smaller one off at ground level to let the larger one grow freely. Is this a good idea?  Is there even a problem at all or should I just leave them be? 
1115,How much time do tomatoes take to ripen?,"I planted some tomato plants in August in pots with 70% soil and 30% organic vermicompost. Plants started to fruit from mid November, but even today those tomatoes are very small and green (and hard). It has been 1 month and they are not turning into mature ones. Are the plants missing something?   Is 30% vermicompost not enough or should I use some NPK fertiliser?   What is the usual time for tomatoes to turn red and mature? "
1116,"Help me make this drainage ""ditch"" look great","I have about 100 feet of flowerbed that follows a damp drainage path. The area is 100% in the sun, no shade. I would like to plant some plants along this flowerbed that don't ""spread"" over time - can tolerate the damp soil of the drainage area, bloom, and come back every year.   Separately - at the end of this bed, where it actually goes towards the drain, I would like to plant some kind of spreading moss or something that blooms and would spread so that it eventually can cover the drain. That area is also on a bit of an incline.   The top soil is kind of low, and shale-y, so I guess I will have to dig a hole and put in some topsoil at each planting location? The climate is near the Washington DC area.   Any ideas on what could make this look great? I would also like any ideas on the right kind of edging for the outside edges of this bed.

1117,How does Guano improve plant life?,"I'm interested in the use of Guano as a plant fertilizer. Are there only specific plants to give this to?   Also, how much and often is it necessary? I mix organic compost every 2 - 3 months for my vegetable garden and give them Seagro every other week. "
1118,Does it make sense to chop up dead branches and leaves for use as fertilizer?,"In terms of pot plants, how effective would it be to put back into soil dried out or broken parts of a plant? Is it worth the effort? It would seem logical, but I don't know how much of the actual plant (sans water) are substances suitable for use as fertilizer and if it's even a significant amount.  "
1119,What can cause a Gasteria leaf to suddenly shrivel and turn greyish brown?,"I have three succulent plants that I believe are Gasteria. One leaf in one plant has suddenly shrivelled and turned pale greyish brown. Sorry, no matter how I try, the colour in the picture is not very accurate. It looks a lot unhealthier in reality than it does in the picture.      The plants are offspring from a large mother plant and have lived in ordinary indoor potting soil for one to two years (the mother plant lives in soil too). They have always been on a north-east window sill, and if they get any direct sun, it's at most one to two hours in the early morning.  I water them every one to two weeks, and the soil dries out completely between watering. The water is ordinary tap water which in our place comes from a lake. Because I see fungus gnats every now and then, I add Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis tablets to the water about every second time.  The plants have looked relatively healthy ever since I got them. The one in question has been repotted about half to one year ago, and I saw back then that it had made extensive roots. Another of the three plants is growing its own offspring above the bottom most leaf.  There has been no change in watering that I'm aware off. I watered the plants two days ago and did not notice anything unusual, thus I believe this leaf has shrivelled and turned pale greyish brown relatively suddenly.  What could be the cause?  Additional information in response to comments:  The pot is the type normally used for expanded clay pebbles. To water, I remove the inner pot so that any excess water can drain from the many holes of that inner pot. I'm pretty sure there's never standing water.  Some months ago, I tried to fight fungus gnats with nematodes which required the soil to be kept moist for a few days, and these plants did not seem to suffer from that.  Our tap water is said to be the best quality for drinking. It's all I have ever used for my plants. Details are available here (the page is in German but the PDF is available in English).  The bacillus thuringiensis israelensis are from the gardening department of the supermarket, their website is here. One tablet is to be dissolved in 1 litre of water.  My watering can is about 0.8 litre, might such an overdose of bacillus thuringiensis israelensis be harmful to the plant? "
1120,How can I preserve and propagate a color sport in my dahlias?,"I have several Hulin's Carnival dahlias in my garden, whose flowers are normally white with flecks or large patches of wine:    This year, one of them has put out a stalk that has pink flowers instead of white, keeping the wine flecks:    I would like to preserve this color variation and propagate it if possible. Since it's now fall, I don't think stem cuttings would work (but would be happy to hear differently). These particular dahlias are under an overhang from my porch, so I've been able to leave them in the ground over the winter. If I do that this winter, is a pink flowering stem likely to grow from the same place on the tuber next year? Would digging up the tuber and dividing off the pink-flowering part give me a better chance for success? "
1121,Pruning this grape vine during summer,"I've just moved a neglected grape vine plant to a place where I want to espalier it properly. It's summer at the moment (Australia) so I know I can't do any heavy pruning at the moment.  However, I want to begin tying the plant up and training it properly but am unsure of where to start.   There are three main branches/arms coming off the trunk. Each of the three have healthy full growth on them with multiple smaller branches, plenty of green leaves and heaps of sprouts. The middle one which ideally should've been trained upwards is bent over.   Ideal scenario is for this to grow one main branch upwards and have three arms coming off in each direction (6 arms in total, or three stacked T-shapes).  How would I go about approaching this over summer and then again once winter has ended? How would I select which branch to bend to train upwards?    "
1122,Can pak choi be re-grown?,"I know that pak choi can be grown as a ""cut and keep"" plant, but can I regrow it from the base of the plant, as can be done with celery?  If so, how? "
1123,Plant Identification: Allium Species,"I'd like to ask what plants these are from the left to the right (scientific name would be better)? I bought the left one 2 years ago, and the seller said that it was Welsh onion. However, when I searched in the internet, it does not look like that very much, and it is more closely related to rakkyo. I'd like to ask for confirmation? Also, what is the scientific name for the one in the middle? I""m not sure if it is A. fistolosum? It's commonly bought in our markets here in the Philippines. Thank you!       "
1124,Is this a Jacaranda or a Silk Tree or something else?,"Back in March, I bought a baby Jacaranda tree from Ebay. Well, they claimed it was a Jacaranda.  Just recently I discovered Silk Trees which look remarkably like the Jacaranda.  Everywhere I read, articles said the best way to tell them apart is by their flowers.  Well either tree won't flower until a few years old. So is there any other way I can distinguish between the two? Is what I purchased a Jacaranda or a Silk Tree...or even something else?  Here's some helpful info which may help identification:   I purchased the tree as a tiny little sapling for $10 on Ebay. It was not bare root nor was it grafted. Def grown from seed. The seller was growing them in Florida. I live in Southern Texas. This tree has thrived in my clay soil with only watering once a week. Just came out of a drought too so the tree had no real rain water. The tree grew from about 1 inch tall to over 5 feet in about 6 months! Has one main trunk, though started sprouting a secondary one at ground level   Plethora of pics:        "
1125,Which tomato cultivars feature wrinkles?,"The Pumpkin tomato, Beefsteak tomato, Raf tomato and ""Cor de bou"" (Catalan - in translation ""Ox heart"") are featuring (vertical) wrinkles - or furrows - not sure how to call them.  What other tomato cultivars feature wrinkles and what's the best name for such a tomato category? Wrinkled tomatoes? Or ""Segmented tomatoes""?  This is a Beefsteak tomato:    Beefsteak and ""Cor de bou"" might be the same thing, as the French name of the above image suggests. "
1126,How can I get clean soil for my sundew?,"When I bought my Drosera Aliciae, I was told that I have to repot it in a clean soil - without any nutrients. Unfortunately, all gardening stores in my neighborhood sell only standard garden soil, that contains nutrients.  How can I get clean soil for my sundew? Can I e.g. collect sand from the seashore? Can I take garden soil and clean it somehow? "
1127,"Was my rosemary burnt by nitrogen, or something else?","I am trying to grow rosemary from starters.  I am based in In California, San Francisco Bay Area.  I dug up an area about what people are recommending on the other rosemary answers here. 30cm x 30cm wide + 30cm down, and combined the area for 6 of them. The soil had some clay about 20cm down or so, but this didn't seem to get in the way too much when I checked the other day. I sprinkled a few quarts of Kellogg organic Amend (.3% Nitrogen, mostly insoluble; .1% potash, .1% phosphor something; 1% calcium. w/gypsum, poultry manure, and compost) and mixed it in pretty well, then planted the starters like a foot apart. It's been about a week, and the rosemary seems to be slowly burning or drying, despite lots of watering.  Did I burn them with too much nitrogen in the additive? Or maybe I didn't break up the root clusters sufficiently and water is just bouncing off them? Could the compost be too old/dried up? We used half of it a couple years ago, and though it's been out of the sun, either in the garage mostly, it does warm up. It was never really moist, but what do I know. "
1128,Will Lilac do well in soil with a high concentration of clay?,I would like to plant some Lilac but may be cursed with Missouri clay. Will Lilac generally do OK if planted in clay-rich soil? What is a good way to start a new planting? 
1129,Is there anything that can turn azalea blooms blue mid-season?,"We've used aluminum sulfate to keep azalea blooms blue in the past. This season some new guys apparently missed a fair number of azaleas in a large grouping and we have pink blooms on enough plants to bother the homeowner. Would applying aluminum sulfate now ""correct"" the color for the rest of the season? If not, is there anything else, short of injection dyes or that kind of thing, that could make them blue quickly?  Edit: The soil is very sandy with little to no clay. Soil tests in neighborhood show 2-3% organic matter content, but these plants get an addition of compost annually so it is likely higher here. "
1130,Why are my Green Chillies Turning Red,"I received some sort of green chilli pepper plant from a friend. (I don't know which kind; the flowers are small, white, and five-petalled.)  Usually, when the chillies are around a handspan in length, I harvest them. Since early frost is October 1st, I harvested the remaining few and left the plant to ""hibernate.""  Two days ago, I noticed a single, bright red chilli pepper growing on the plant.  What makes chillies turn red/yellow/orange? Is it simply a function of ripening time, after some length is achieved? "
1131,Tomato Plant Stalk Appears Diseased,"Found this in my garden today:    My tomato plants appear to be quite ill. The lower stalk is covered in bumps, and it looks like they start at the base. Most parts of the plant are fine, but I am getting blossom end rot... I'm not sure if the two are related. Lack of calcium in the soil? I've grown tomatoes in the past in this garden, but this is the first time I've had a problem.   My garden is an eight by ten patch of my lawn that I've been tilling up the past few years. This is my only tomato plant. I'm also growing cumbers, which are thriving, potatoes, corn, and a bell pepper plant.   Does this look familiar to anyone? Anything I can do for my tomatoes? I imagine I'm going to have to pull the plant and try again next year.  "
1132,Cucumbers not producing,I have 3 cucumber plants that I started indoors from seeds. They were all off to a great start but after producing 1-2 cucumbers I noticed the don't look as healthy and leaves have turned yellow. I see new growth in some places. Is this normal?  Are we at the end of cucumber season?  What should I do differently?  I am in San Francisco area.     
1133,What is this willow-like tree?,"What is this tree?. I though it was a willow of some kind? but cant find a definitive answer.  It has dark cracked bark, long drooping willow like leaves. The stems are red. There is a red vein running through the leaves.  This image taken from google earth on dick burton road, cape town. There are a good number of these lining the road.     "
1134,How can I get more foliage and flowers on my rose?,"I moved into my new house about a year ago now and this rose bush was in the yard already looking very forlorn without much foliage at all. It's card calls it a 'Mum in a Million' type.  I've since fed it with some Miracle Grow and it recovered, but this spring it seems to just continue to grow upwards without bushing at all. Is this normal? How can I tempt it into putting leaves out on the lower stems and producing more flowers? I have no gardening experience at all to fall back on, so am keen for some advice.  Currently it produces 1-3 flowers over the summer, usually one at a time, and they'll last for about 3 days before wilting, at which point I just prune the dead head off just under the bud.  This is how it's looking currently.  "
1135,Can you advise me on a still-water garden pond in tropical Central America?,"We're looking at making our first backyard pond in the edge of our garden. I have read a LOT of pages through searching on Google and they seem to make it so hard to get started. I don't think it's this hard so I need some advice.  Our pond is going to be sort of round, mostly. Then it will elongate the last part maybe 3 to 4 feet long under our walkway as a mini under the bridge type deal. The round part of the pond will only be 4 to 6 feet in circumference. So a very small pond really.     First thing is can I just use either the dirt itself as the liner or line it with lime? (Lime: From what I have read through articles I have found, helps starting a pond with pH levels, bacteria, etc.) We live in Guatemala in Central America so pond liners are not easy to find, I would have to import it and that gets expensive, no point in it. We live in the tropics, so no need for worries of freezing or anything of the sorts. The temperature is normally from 70&deg;F to 90&deg;F with no humidity, very nice all day long and all year long. Rainy season is a bit wild, but only 4 months long, just a lot of rain during those months.   What kind of fish would be good for this size of a pond and climate? I love Koi but they seem very work intensive and take a lot from what I have read. But I don't believe everything I read as the McDonalds down the road has Koi outside in a small around the building pond made of cement, so they can't be that big of a pain ha ha.  Or would Goldfish be better? That being said how many would be the max of a given fish, or better yet a good number of them?   I do ""not"" want a filter and a bunch of pumps etc. in our pond. I would like to have a still water pond. I know it will be a bit muggy, that's fine mostly as it won't be horribly deep in the elongated part under the walkway.  That being said, what are the suggestions for still water ponds to keep them clearer? Can we not buy a couple bottom sucker fish for it? We had one in our fish tank years ago that grew to 7 inches long.  Or is there another fish to keep them clean?  Are there some plants that would be suggested as water plants to help keep it clear water? Would turtles be good to have to help keep it clean? What do the fish eat? I know that for aquarium fish you get fish food, but wouldn't the mosquito larvae (a lot during rainy season as I had Tilapia tanks once) and other natural things be good food for the fish?     We really want this pond to be 100% natural and still without mechanics of any sorts. Electricity is hugely expensive in Guatemala, so we don't want pumps running year round.  Any other advice that can be given would be greatly appreciated for a first timer. "
1136,Should I prune this new olive tree?,"I planted this tree a few months back and it's been growing rapidly in the summer sun here in Cyprus. We have average daytime temperatures of around 40 degrees C (104 degrees F) at this time of year, and will for another two months or so before things start to cool down.   Should I be pruning this tree at this point in its life? I don't want it to get too gangly or take over the garden, and I eventually want a tree that has a canopy that I can walk under (to access other parts of the garden), so I'm eyeing the lower shoots as candidates at this time.   Can anybody advise me on this?    UPDATED: As some have requested them, here are some more pictures to make it more clear how the tree is growing. Apologies for the state of the garden in general (work in progress).      I was also advised to expose the top set of roots. A local cat and her kittens have done a pretty good job of it, but I've made sure they're exposed. Is this good enough?  All I've exposed so far are the thin, spindly roots. I used some water to soften the soil.  Thanks for the input on this. To answer a question, I'd love a tree that gives both shade and fruit, if possible.  "
1137,Plants that can be carried around?,"Right now I am transporting a potted avocado (just potted the seed) from one state to another, and I am finding that I really enjoy carrying around this pot with life growing in it. Are there any species of plants that would readily lend themselves to being grown entirely when one is walking around with them? I assume that such a plant would be hardy, have shallow roots, not be very picky with climate, and be able to fit in a small pot that could be held with one hand, can anyone suggest such suitable species of plants?  "
1138,Can I prevent the leaf loss from my fern?,"I’ve had this house Fern for around two months, and made every attempt to keep it healthy. It had been put in a slightly larger pot with pebbles at the bottom to help the water drain. I ensure the soil is moist at all times and water about once every two to three days. The first month it seemed fine but in the last week the leaves have started to fall, can someone tell me what I am doing wrong??  "
1139,When and how should I move deciduous ferns?,"When is the best time to move a fern? It's a deciduous species, maybe a shuttlecock fern. Also can I divide the plant while I'm doing it? "
1140,Identify this Insect or Fungus. Possible Scale,I do not know the name of the plant and I have battled brown scales on my ficus before at my office.  What is attacking this plant?  Could it be some type of white scale?  It is not mealybugs.     
1141,"Where can I find a ""bee melon""?","My wife remembers a shrub(?) that grew in the Azores that was called a bee melon or Melão de abelha.  She describes it as growing from a bush that produced small white flowers, and then a pale whitish fruit that tasted sweet and floral.  Does anyone know anything about this plant? "
1142,"Cucumber with bacterial wilt, what to do to save other plants?","On Saturday, my cucumbers looked perfectly healthy.  On Sunday, half of one of my cucumbers had very wilty leaves.  On Monday, the other half of the cucumber's leaves were all wilty.  I have seen cucumber beetles on my cucumber plants before, and still do.  I was previously unaware of the bacterial danger they posed to my plants so I didn't do too much to fight them, as the leaves weren't being eaten too much.  There was also another kind of beetle that I don't recognize and don't have pictures of, maybe twice the size of the cucumber beetles and having orange highlights.  This cucumber is growing very close to/on top of some other cucumbers.  I also have a zucchini plant and some butternut squash plants pretty close to the wilted cucumber, as well as some more cucumber plants further away in the same garden.  My garden also has pinto beans, garden beans, carrots, roma tomatoes, and russet potatoes.  Picture:    Does the bacterial wilt pose a threat to any of the other plants in my garden? Is there a possibility of bacterial wilt spreading plant to plant? Should I remove the wilted cucumber, and if so how? What should I do now to kill as many cucumber beetles as possible?  The space I garden in is assigned as an organic garden space.  "
1143,What causes holes through forsythia branches?,"I was pruning some forsythia, and I noticed that there was a hole through the center of many of the major woody parts. It looks as if (only) the pith had been bored out. I'm wondering what could cause this, or if it's common.  I saw only a few mentions of this online: one question with no answer and another that seems to suggest that this is normal in older wood.   I hope the description is adequate; I could take a picture of the trimmings if it's not clear (not my plants and I didn't think to snap a picture). The plants are otherwise reasonably healthy-looking, and flowered well this past season. Is this normal/common in healthy forsythia? Wood-boring insects? "
1144,What is a good frugal method for providing shade to fruit-bearing vines?,"What is a good and, hopefully, frugal solution for providing shade to long vines?  In my case, I'm dealing with pumpkin vines on the ground.   I imagine a combination of sheets and chicken wire might do it, but I imagine chicken wire doesn't qualify as frugal.  Any ideas?  Here's my layout   "
1145,What exactly happens to potting soil if it is stored for a long period of time?,"The story: I have bought a few sacks of ""Plagron Royal Mix"" here in Chile. This soil is supposed to be sufficient for my ""tomatoes"" for roughly six weeks. After four weeks in the soil I noticed problems, which seem to point to under-fertilization. Since it was time to repot anyway, the plants received roughly 50% fresh soil in a bigger pot, but the symptoms are worsening. Over-fertilization, while not impossible, seems unlikely. Before repotting, I rinsed the soil to remove excess fertilizer. (As recommended by the manufacturer)  Now considering the trip from Holland to Chile and that it's not really a hot product here, I cannot rule out that the soil was stored for a significant amount of time possibly even under adverse conditions. There are no dates on the sack.  If an organically pre-fertilized soil (peat, fibre, worm castings, etc.) is stored for a longer period of time, how does it change? Will it reduce the potency of the fertilizer? Can it have other harmful effects on plants? "
1146,Is it better to plant many seeds in one hole or few?,"I don't quite understand why so many tutorials, photos and videos show people planting a bunch of seeds together in one hole. Is there some benefit to this?  I have very little experience with gardening, but common sense tells me that planting just one seed per hole is the efficient thing to do. Somewhere I heard that plants grow better in distance from other plants because they get more water, sun and minerals from earth that way, which totally makes sense.  I can totally understand the desire to ensure that at least one seed grows into a healthy plant from a hole by putting multiple seeds in it, but that doesn't seem like a rational use of seeds.  Are there any other benefits to putting multiple seeds in a hole besides that? "
1147,RE: Missouri Clay - how well will day lilies (Hemerocallis fulva) grow in this mixture of soil?,"My yard contains a good amount of Missouri clay and I would like to plant some day lilies; will they survive/thrive in thick soil like this? Also, do they do well in direct sun or shade and what type of irrigation do they prefer? "
1148,Can you grow plant roots in fish tank?,"Was wondering if you could put non-water plants onto a fish tank so that their roots grow inside the fish tank. What are the chances of the plants being dangerous to the fish?  I read that the fish and plants are beneficial to each other and if it would be good for them why not?  PS: I do have real water plants in the tanks too, just figured it might be interesting to do and my rooting plants love my fish tank water :) "
1149,Natural herbicide to kill weeds in a hard landscape environment?,"I've got some weeds growing up between the flagstones in our backyard -- is there something natural and okay environmentally that I can use to kill the weeds? Obviously, I don't want anything growing at all there, so it doesn't matter if it kills everything.  An internet search has turned up varied suggestions (vinegar, salt, boiling water) but nothing that seems definitive. Anyone have more concrete advice? "
1150,Why does this sage look different than what is in stores?,"Does anyone recognize this variety? Is it normal for sage to have a woody base?  Also, could you recommend how to prune it please? It has been abandoned for years.     EDIT: Adding close ups.     EDIT 2: Adding soil analysis.    "
1151,Basement hydro or aquaponics?,"What I want to grow:     Cherry tomatoes Iceberg &amp; Romaine lettuce  Green/Yellow peppers Strawberries   Room information:   55-75% RH, can be vented to the outside once a day manually (via a dryer pipe and a computer fan) 15 to 20 degrees celsius from night to day 200-400W of T5 high output fixtures    Question  Would hydro or aquaponics be a more suitable solution and what style, In media, Raft, PCV Pipe?  Do those 4 plants play nicely together or should I do a media/PVC setup to separate some? "
1152,What are the chances to get an edible apple from a tree grown from seed?,"I am growing a few good apple trees in my roof garden, in pots. I love growing the trees, and of course love the fruit. Since I am in a warm climate, I grow appropriate apple cultivars which are professionally grafted and yield beautiful apples.   Apart from that I also have an experimental area where I grow six apple plants grown from seed. One of them finally blossomed this year (about 4 years from seed) and the fruits have set and look promising. The others have not yet blossomed.  Since this is a four year experiment (and counting) I had time to look online and try to answer a question I had all this time - what are my chances of success?  According to some sources, the chance to get an apple tree which yields any fruit is about 1 in 10, and a tree yielding edible apples at about 1 in 25. Other sources also claim statistics as 1:250 to get an apple as good as the origin, and 1:250,000 to get a better apple than the original. All the sources are contradictory, and I don't know if growing apple from seed is a sensible thing to do, or an incredibly slim chance of success.  To be clear: I have no intentions of growing the next commercial cultivar in my roof garden - I just hope to get nice, edible apples. Does anyone know the chances of getting there? "
1153,What should I do about a Tillandsia cyanea with accidentally removed roots?,"My Tillandsia cyanea was watered too much, and when I touched it, the top part with the leaves separated from the roots. I've found that some types of Tillandsia don't need roots, but is this it? Should I put it in the soil again? "
1154,What exactly is an outdoor bonsai?,"I recently got a Brussels Boxwood Bonsai, 3 years old. And I have it placed indoors near an optimally sunlit area and apartment temperature is around 70 F.There seems to be a little bit of wilting/decay on the top canopy.  Boxwood is supposed to be an outdoor bonsai.  What exactly does the term outdoor mean?    Should I just the place the bowl outside or have it replanted on ground outside?  If it must be outside anyhow, is that absolutely mandatory? Are there no alternatives to placing it outside? "
1155,What should I do with a watermelon plant that has flowered much too early?,"I have several (trellised) watermelon plants that are about a foot tall by now. One of them, oddly enough, has flowers already.  This is my first time trying to grow watermelons, but it seems like it's way too early for any of them to be flowering yet. I thought the time it took from seed to fruit 72 days (at least on the packet), and that flowers wouldn't appear until closer to when it was time to grow fruit. It's been something like 3 weeks I think.  Should I pinch off the flowers to encourage the plant to grow some more? Or should I let it be and be happy that I have an exceptionally eager watermelon plant? "
1156,How to prune an overgrown (and now flowering) Dracaena?,"My cut Dracaena (houseplant) has become very tall, and now one of the ""branches"" has flowered. What is the typical way a Dracaena is maintained as a household specimen plant as it outgrows the configuration as seen in the example below?   My Dracaena is currently about 6 feet tall total (1.6 meters). The main trunk meristems were cut between 3 and 4 feet (0.9 - 1.2 meters). So as it continues to grow, do you typically top off the secondary side shoots (producing more side shoots?) or do you cut them off completely (promoting new sideshoots) or can you cut the main trunk (below the original offshoots) to start afresh?  What about the stem that has already flowered? (see the second example picture below) Is that branch's growth terminated by the flower? What do I do there?  What are my options in keeping this plant going long term?    (example photos below, not my actual plant)    "
1157,Multi planting in one pot,"If you wish to have an instant effect with your planting, can you plant more than one plant in a pot?  In this case, I have 3 Hydrangea arborescens ‘Anabelle’ which I want to place on a large pot. They are in 2 litre pots currently. As Spring comes. I want to transfer them in a large pot.  Will this work? Or will they get over crowded? "
1158,"During a warm-spell in early winter, can dormant hardwoods survive planting? Even if frozen temps are a day away?","Zone 5 northeast USA has had an early winter in some places, getting slammed with many evenings in the 20s and a few even lower. Some snow but it's come and gone, eventually melting after a couple weeks. A warm spell has melted most snow recently and the ground is still soft, it didn't freeze deep yet.  Can a dormant hardwood tree be planted in the soil if it's not frozen? What if temperatures will drop below freezing the night or coming days after planting? I have some potted trees and spots ready to dig for them! Winter weather came early so I didn't plant them earlier in the fall.  My understanding is yes as long as the trees are totally dormant before transplanting. In terms of planting I've heard to pack the soil a little compressed and add lots of mulch on top to help prevent frost heave from throwing the tree back out from the ground! "
1159,Does it matter if my cabbage forms its heart some way off the ground?,"My cabbages have been growing strongly, but until recently mostly big loose leaves, not hearts.   Now they're beginning to heart up, but some way up the stalk and off the ground (about 12-15cm up the stalk, possibly more [photo probably shows the most extreme example]).     They look like decent hearts.  But is this a problem? In a lettuce (which I am more used to growing) this would look like a plant that had started to bolt. And also, archetypal illustrations of healthy cabbages always show tight balls close to the ground.  Edit: Further thought: Could it be connected to overcrowding and/or being shaded by nearby beans and broccoli? Are these guys reaching up for more light? "
1160,Golden Pothos Leaves Are Regularly Dying,"I have a very interesting set up and had questions about the differences across our factory floor.  We have three columns of Golden Pothos that are numbered about 96 plants (unless the irrigation failed on one and I removed the plant before it died) per column:   The irrigation is set up for a hose to connect to about my chest height.  The water travels through the plastic hose to the top of the column.  From here the water gets distributed through regulators to each plant.  There is a regulator every two rows.  It's kind of a nightmare.  Previously the pots were self-watering, but we had huge issues with proper drainage and we lost almost every plant.  This time we made sure each plant had a large amount of drainage.  This also has the effect of the higher plants draining into the lower plants.  This set up seems to work well, to ensure more even watering across the board.  However, I am regularly finding about 4 to 6 leaves that are dead per plant, about every two weeks.  Is this volume normal?  I know this question was asked before, but my set up is atypical.  We have other plants in the area that seem to be doing much better as far as die-off is concerned.  I only remove one or two leaves per two or three plants.  They are also pictured:     The other plants are watered by hand.  I also water the columns by hand every week I don't water using the irrigation (every other week)  So why what appears to be a significant difference?  What can I do to help the columned plants grow better?  Is there anything that we're doing wrong? "
1161,Repotting diseased chilli plants - possibly rust,"My chilli plants appear to have developed rust after a bad attack from aphids! See photo below    The leaves have also gone curly:    My plan is to repot the plants, washing away the old soil and replacing it with compost I bought. Would this help the plants? Or would the new compost just be infected with the disease?  Thanks for any help. "
1162,What to do with this Bromeliad?,"    What to do? I was given this Bromeliad, two links above. Please see what looks like white dust. A neighbor had quite a few plants on her porch, she gave me most of them because she didn't want to have to bring them inside this winter, as she's going south. None if the other plants have this white dust looking stuff. Is it just dust? Or should I be worried it's a fungus? The top of the leaves wipe off,as pictured but the white on the bottom of the leaves are just colored that way (do not wipe off. Can anyone help to identify this Bromeliad and tell me if simply wiping the leaves is good enough, or should I be doing more?  I also need help identifying the Brom, what kind it is. I'm not sure if it's one without a bloom or if it just hasn't bloomed yet. Also, is the pot too small?   I will be posting another question of an additional plant she gave me, with further questions about it and it's identification. Thanks! "
1163,What can i do with this Aloe Arborescens?,"i have this plant but it's terribly heavy and unbalanced. I don't know much about aloe but i don't think it should look like this, especially because without a stick the plant just falls over.  So my question is, is it possile to cut the aloe in the pointed space and replant it?     Maybe it has something to do with the small vase but i live in a small apartment and i cannot afford a huge vase spot.  Anyway, suggestions?  "
1164,How to grow a tree on steroids?,"How can a tree be made to grow bigger and faster constantly over 100 years?

1165,What to do with Autumn sown peas now they're showing?,I've made Autumn sowings of peas for the first time this year.   I planted the seeds in small pots in the (unheated) greenhouse like I'd normally do for spring sowings. It was a bit speculative as I wasn't sure anything would show up.  However every pot now has a small but strong looking pea poking out. They're 2-3cm high.  It this was spring I'd let them grow on a bit longer and then get them transplanted outside.  But what about these Autumn sown shoots? Do I leave them where they are (presumably they'll shortly stop growing as winter sets in so won't outgrow their 8cm pots till spring? Or transplant outside shortly and cover with fleece/plastic? Or something else?  Location is UK south coast and we're just getting our first frosts about now.

1168,Soybean oil as insect repellent?,"Some of the ""natural"" insect repellents I use (the kind you put on your skin) have soybean oil listed as one of the active ingredients.  I've also seen ~6% soybean oil listed as an active ingredient in some of the ""natural"" garden insecticide sprays at the garden center.  Is there anything different about this soybean oil than the jug of vegetable oil (100% soybean) in my kitchen cupboard?  If it is the same, what would I dilute it with, and what concentrations would be useful? If I can mix my own, cooking oil would be much cheaper than the ""insecticide"" from the garden center. "
1169,"Agroforest guild of apple, hazelnut, and black locust?","Is this tree guild particularly promising or not: apple, hazelnut, and black locust? Or substitute apple for other fruits like pear or currants or mulberry, and black locust for some other kind of locusts like honey locust?   I envision them going together as a cluster of 3, planted just ~5' apart from one another so they form a miniature closed canopy in the center, then leave a ~10-15' gap between each cluster of 3, spreading over time to reforest part of a farm field.  Part of my motive asking this question is also just to learn more about guilds. For folks who think they have an answer to this question of if/how well it is likely to work - how do you know!? How can I know?! If you already tried such a guild, that's obviously a good tell. I wonder how experts go about thinking of these things to decide in advance if they're worth planting out and trying.  For one I can plant some smaller test runs, but even then if it works for a couple years I'd probably expand it before the test groups reach maturity.  For two, I can be careful about site selection. All 3 of those plants like well-drained soil, and I have pretty wet clay-ey soil but will be doing things like using sheet mulching with mounds and hugelkulture to help regulate hydrologic conditions. For sunlight I have full-sun and can orient the trees so the most sun-loving are south-facing. So at least with a cursory amateur assessment, it seems like it could work.  I'm in zone 4/5 and so far haven't had great luck with apples but am starting some promising local crabapple seeds now. Hazelnuts have been doing well and I want lots of them, thus making them the focus of the guild. Locust is as locust is - if anything it'll be doing too good for comfort! But we already have plenty of comfort as humans, so the locust can do its thing. "
1170,Yellow spots appeared in my lawn suddenly although all other area is green,I live in southeast Michigan. I built my house 2 years ago and had sod laid down last year.  I was told to water twice a day at least. The grass has held in and it came green during this season with no issues. I have reduced the watering to a single time a day and everything was perfect.   Suddenly within 2 days yellow spots appeared in different areas of the lawn.  I used Grub control in May of this year. I used Scott turf builder weed and feed in June. I applied grass food in July.  What is causing these yellow spots? How do I fix them?  Update: here are some pictures from different areas.     this is close to the garage   and here is another picture in my back yard all by it self   this one is next to the side walk(and could be dog pee)  
1171,Early action needed for whiteflies and aphids?,"While pruning my tomato plants last night, I came across some early signs of whiteflies.  I saw just a few mature whiteflies crawling around; I hate them.  I have battled them off and on through the years with various crops.  While looking at the underside of some of the leaves, I only noticed a few spots where eggs were attached and also a few pink soft aphids I thought.  I cut those branches off of the plants to dispose of the eggs.  I have a raised garden bed housing just some lettuce, peppers, and tomatoes; maybe 40 square feet.  Do I need to go into full ""kill mode"" and spray for these pests or is a certain amount of infestation just expected to occur?  I don't want a full blown attack from these pests but I also don't want to jump the gun if it is not needed.  On the same topic: I raised tomato plants from seeds this year for my first time.  They are so much healthier than purchased plants and I am very pleased.  What are the odds that these pests just showed up on their own?  The pepper plants were the only plants purchased from a nursery.  The lettuce was also grown from seed. "
1172,"Identify plant, and what to do with rocks","    Can anyone identify this little tree/shrub/indoor plant? I got it from a neighbor who had it on her porch, among others, and it appears pretty healthy. It's in a 3"" plastic pot, that rests in a faux rock holder.  I'm curious about the rock decor at the base of the plant. It's all glued together in one piece at the top of the plastic planter and is difficult to water, as the water sits on top of the rocks. I'd have to break it to remove. Should I remove the glued rocks? Or is this a kind of Plant that will continue to grow fine even though the rocks are against the base, and/or can it thrive with little water?  "
1173,Should I replant a watermelon that almost died when planted in the ground?,"I started a watermelon in the ground as a small plant. It basically died in the ground, so I took it out. The roots had not really taken.   After a few weeks, however, I repotted it in a container just to see if it would come back.  So it has and know I am wondering can I replant in the ground without it taking another hit?  Thoughts?    I need to replant it as soon as possible! "
1174,Corn already has tassel but not female flowers,"I have 5 corn plants growing on my garden, one of them (the tallest) already has a tassel, and today I moved it a bit and saw pollen falling from it. But the plant has no female flowers to pollinate.  Should I try to collect and save the pollen for when the female flowers show up? Or will there still be pollen when they show up? "
1175,What is the shelf life of vegetable seeds?,I bought a packet of vegetable seeds from Costco a few years back.  I still have seeds left in individual packages.  Is there a life to these seeds after which it is not recommended for use?  What is the impact of using seeds after the shelf life of the seeds?  Is it just lower germination rate or could this impact the quality of the vegetables/plants produced from old seeds? 
1176,Red Venus Fly Trap Seedlings,"So I ordered a batch of red venus fly trap seeds (seeds to grow completely red fly traps, not green fly traps with some red inside of them) from the fly trap store and started sowing them about 4.5 weeks ago. So far I have seen 14 of the 15 seeds sprout, so that is awesome (they are currently green). From what I understand, because I have seeds and not a clone, there is a small chance they might not be red. That fact aside, hypothetically if the seeds are to turn red, does anyone have a guess as to when I can start seeing the sprouts/plants turn red? And when cloning from a leaf pulling (of a red venus fly trap) do the new leaves grow in red or do they also start green and then turn red? "
1177,Can trees starve for water as they get bigger?,We had this huge pecan tree that stood alone. The landlord said it used to put out paper shell pecans that could be cracked with one hand a decade ago. I also heard that smaller pecan trees put more nuts out and I wander why? All the nuts this large tree did put out were dry and shriveled on the inside. So one year I left water hose that leaked at the base of that tree all year and the nuts tripled and were full.  Do some trees requirement for water in the soil increase as they get larger to the point where the tree would thrive as a smaller tree but be stunted after a certain size?

1179,Why did my basil leaves turn black?,"I picked a bunch of basil last week so we could put up some pesto.  I brought the leaves inside, washed them, and set them on the counter in the kitchen while gathering other ingredients for pesto (grating cheese, etc). Many of the leaves started to turn black -- especially at the tips and in the veins. It didn't seem to affect the quality of the end product.  I'm planning to dry the next harvest batch, and I'd like to make sure it doesn't turn black during drying.   What makes basil leaves turn black? What should I do post-harvest to prevent this?  "
1180,Are this spiders killing this trumpet tree?,"I have a trumpet tree in a pot in my balcony. It has beautifully blossomed this spring and gave dozens of flowers. But since all the flowers fell down 1 month ago it has gotten worse and worse.  The leafs started loosing it's green color (see the pictures). Some of the bigger ones started dropping off.  It was then that I noticed some very small cobwebs and looking hard I started to see very tiny white spiders all over the tree. I proceeded to spray the whole tree with an insecticide I have that, according to the label, is appropriate against spider mites. It didn't get better but it also didn't get worse.  Yesterday I was watering the plant and it lost 5 or 6 leafs just for a little shake of the pot. I noticed again the spiders, this time many more than before, so I sprayed them again. This morning I found 15 more leafs on the ground.  Could this spiders be responsible for this? How can i get rid of them? It is also worth mentioning that I usually water the plan with hard tap water, is this bad as well?     "
1181,Tomato Plants indoors over the winter,"Here is a picture of my tomato plants on my south facing window in the UK. I started them far too late from seed, I guess I planted them in about July. By the time winter came they weren't anywhere close to fruiting but I couldn't bear to let them die so I brought them indoors.    My question is, if I re-pot these into bigger pots, keep them indoors until spring and then plant them outside, will they be able to flower and fruit? Or have I ruined their chances by starting late and bringing them indoors? I have fertiliser but I haven't used it since I brought them in.  I've searched the forums and lots of people are asking about bringing plants in over the winter when they have already fruited, but these never even got to the point of fruiting. I know they are leggy and straggly but I love them now so I don't want to give up on them!  Thank you in advance for any help or advice. "

1183,How to manage fruit-trees blooming for the second time in autumn?,"A friend of mine has an apple tree and a walnut tree that have bloomed for the second time this year. The trees grow in a 6b hardiness zone in the Northern hemisphere where it is already autumn. Night temperatures are 7-9°C (44-48°F). A sour cherry tree that bloomed last year in autumn has died during the following winter and the owner fears that this year the apple and the walnut tree will follow the same path.  An old man that runs a seed and pesticide shop that knows other people having had the same problem in the past few years told me that the only thing to do is to apply copper sulphate after the first hoar-frost, not sooner. Will copper sulphate not only protect from fungal infections during dormancy, but also help the tree to go dormant?  In the next 10 days the weather forecast estimates the same night temperatures, except for tomorrow night when there will be 15°C (59°F). Should my friend wait for the first hoar-frost and apply copper sulphate or is there something else to be done?  Update: The apple tree is full of flowers like it was spring, except for a branch that is in the shade.  The walnut tree doesn't have flowers yet, but the buds are on their way to open in a few weeks. Its leaves have more than 15 cm (6 inches) in length. "

There are no thorns. 
1185,"For a new lawn, are mixed soils worth it?","I'm redoing my lawn because it was extremely unlevel. I've already flattened the whole thing, scraped out all the old grass, and now I'm ready for top soil.  After calling a few local places, I've learned that some of them offer different mixes, involving soil, potting mix, and sand. Is there any reason to get such a thing for a lawn?  A related question, but perhaps too localized: There's an excavation place that had soil from job sites from around the area. They say they sift it for size, but that's it. Is there a likelihood that this soil is junk, or pretty much the same thing as other places that get their sifted soil from a local prairie?  I'm going to hydroseed, if that makes a difference. "
1186,How do I encourage morning glories to bloom?,"I know that many of you will find this unbelievable -- but my morning glories did not bloom this year.   For those of you that live where morning glories are a perenial that borders on ""weed"" this might sound amazing -- but I live in a colder environment where they are an annual.  This is my first summer in a new house and we planted morning glories along the fence line. They shot up and have covered the fence with green -- but the buds never came. The cutting in the glass on the window sill did-- but the plants in the earth never did.   Now the bottom leaves are begining to brown like it is the end of the season -- and I am wondering: What did I do wrong?   They get good early morning sun. Are protected from the mid day sun, and then get evening sun.   My mother in Law for whom morning glories were the bane of her gardening-soul in Tennessee thinks the gods shown warmly on me so that I didn't have to have them blooming their dirty flowers in my yard -- but I really wanted to see their sunny faces in the morning.  What is wrong?   Additional Information   No idea what variety. Sorry. I will have to do a better job on that next year!  I am in the heartland where we have had a heat wave with intolerable humidity. The flowers should have started and bloomed long before the heat hit. I started the seeds directly in the ground after rubbing them on a little file and soaking them overnight. They do get mid day shade, the sun they receiving is morning (until 11ish) and afternoon (after 3ish). We water regularly. During the heat we watered twice a day, in the morning before the sun got too hot, and in the evening when it started getting less hot. The location is very well drained. We added no fertilizer to the soil prior to planing. The soil was a new mix of top soil and manure. A wood chip mulch was added to the top to keep in moisture.  Pictures below:     "

1190,Controlling curly top disease in sugar beets,"Last season, curly top virus caused a significant decline in the quality of sugar beets grown in my garden as well as tomato. The steps I have taken so far include spraying with a preventative insecticide, (neem oil), removing affected plant materials, and practicing good weed control to eliminate sheltering locations for the leaf hopper vector.   The steps do not appear to work adequately as some of my plants are starting to show purple leaf vein discoloration, an early sign of infection. Yellowing is also present.   In addition to the control methods mentioned above, what other methods can I use? Can anything be done to the plants showing symptoms to preserve fruiting? "
1191,Scraggly tangled Monstera,"I purchased a Monstera from a coworker. She said it’s grown new leaves nonstop but I don’t know what conditions it lived in before. I now have it next to a large east facing window (unfortunately, my apartment doesn’t get enough light in the winter for my plants to be overly happy) and water it when the soil feels dry. The largest of the leaves split in a few places, but it’s certainly not spectacular.   I’d really like to make the plant more attractive looking. Right now, it sort of looks like a plant explosion. All the leaf stems cross cross and tangle, and masses of tiny leaves keep growing making it look bushy and scraggly.   Don’t get me wrong, I still love him, but how can I make things tidier? Is it best to trim Monsteras, or should I be tying it to stakes to make it look more upright? I took a couple trimmings to experiment with propagation, but I’d be afraid of over doing it. I just feel like something should be done to help maintain the quality and health of the plant as well as making it look less... chaotic.    "

1193,How to treat fungus on indoor avocado plant leaves,I have an indoor avocado plant which I just repotted but up until this point have really neglected.  Despite this it seems to have grown happily over the last two years and hasn't required or received much attention.  I would like to take better care of it and in repotting I noticed that there is potentially some fungus growing on some of the leaves as shown here:    I do not know if it is a fungus or not but the white speckles seen most easily at the top of the leaf cannot be easily rubbed off the leaf and feel a bit hard to touch.  These spots are on about 50% of the leaves (maybe a bit less).  The rest of the plants' leaves look very healthy in my opinion:    I would like to know if there is anything I should do in this situation?  I have read that I should both leave and cut off any leaves with fungus on.  That I can buy some anti-fungal stuff for the leaves etc.  Is there anything I should do to help the plant?  Some of the tips of the leaves are also brown.  I read that this is probably due to a high concentration level of salts in the soil and have since repotted the plant to try and fix that issue.  I am assuming the brown leaf tips and the fungus are unrelated. 
1194,What are the factors for lawn health?,"Not sure how exactly to tackle this question. Our lawn (and the neighbors on either side) have sad &amp; anemic front lawns. Both neighbors have tried numerous approaches, from sod to chemical baths - with the same muddy result every time. We share some obstacles to lawn growth, here are the ones I've been able to identify:   Clay: the area is more clay than soil, only crabgrass and moss seem to survive Trees: lots of shade North-facing: not sure how this fits in, my thumb is nowhere near green aggressive mowing: the neighborhood service rolls the riding mowers through whether the grass is dying or not, so anything we do will need to be hardy   Is there anything else I should factor in? I know I need to do a ton of research, but I hate it when I don't know what I need to know... Or is this a lost cause and I'm better off looking into alternative ground cover? "

The landscaping was planted in August, so it's almost made it a full year now.  In June, we started to see dead spots appearing in the bush, where the leaves shrivel up and fall off.  We've been cutting the dead spots out, but soon, I'm expecting to have no bush if this keeps up!  The dead spots do have green under the bark when we cut them out, so perhaps the parts are not really dead?  Any ideas on what could be the cause, and how I can identify the problem, and treat it?     "
1202,Koi Pond Needs Emptied due to safety issues,"We have a fairly large koi pond that needs converted to something more safe for 2 year old. It has a top and side fountain that run into it. We've wondered about removing the koi and placing a larger sized river rock in the water to where they can be walked on,  allowing possibly 2"" of water above rock, but still allowing the fountains to flow? Someday we'd like to use the pond for koi again. Would this work? "
1203,"I reseeded my lawn but the results are patchy. Do I apply further seed, or start again?","I had a tree taken down and the stump ground up.  I cleared a majority of the tree mulch and laid top soil, seeded, and put some hay on top.  It's been a couple of weeks and the grass is growing in really patchy.  It looks pretty bad.  It's been extremely hot lately, so I'm thinking it's probably not getting enough water.  My question is: should I rake up the hay, dig up what's currently there, and start from scratch?  Or should I seed on top of the existing patchy grass?  (I'll be sure to water more often this time around.) "
1204,Is every pea a potential seed?,"As the pea seeds from the gardening store look the same to me like the dried ones from the supermarket, I'd ask myself the question if I could use those for growing them as Microgreens? Is this possible or are they most likely some kind of special breed that can't germinate?  UPADTE:  I had a few supermarket peas soaked overnight and 'planted' them this morning. Unfortunately, I could not find my usual microgreen trays because I did renovate this summer and therefore I had to use a provisional, but it will do the job. I will post an update with pictures as soon as there is something to see. "
1205,How do I grow rhubarb in hot weather,"I live in South Carolina (37 C or 100 F everyday in July), but I love Rhubarb. I planted 4 rhubarb plants in the shade on the north side of my house. 3/4 have died and the last is struggling. They get lots of water. Is there anything else I can do to stimulate growth? Would potting them and bringing them indoors help?  Shortly after asking this question (3 wks ago), I build a Dirt wall around the rhubarb plants (2-3 inches tall, and 14 inches in diameter), which I have filled with around 3-4 gallons per plant everyday. The sandy clay takes some patients to wait for the water to soak in (before adding the rest of the water in small increments) and the soil is still moist the next day. With this extra attention the rhubarb has begun doing noticeably better--one has added 2 new leaves/stalks (it only had 3 before) and the other is still recovering. Thanks Mike Perry for the ""ideas link"" in your comment.   My sun-room doesn't get enough sunlight for rhubarb. I went to a local nursery that sells rhubarb and the plants were thriving outside in 90F heat. The only difference: they had a very porous soil vs. the clay I had tried growing mine in. I am now successfully growing rhubarb outside in 80-90 degree F heat. The soil MUST be porous. (+ daily watering) "
1206,Are my bananas safe to eat after being flooded by Harvey?,"I have banana plants in my back yard, one of which has produced a nice heart. The bananas should be ripe in a month or so. My house and yard were flooded by Harvey. The category 3 floodwater that inundated my house and yard included stuff from multiple sewage plants upstream that were overtopped and possibly from two EPA superfund sites.  Will my bananas be safe to eat? If not, will next year's bananas be safe to eat, or should I just cut them all down? "
1207,How to get rid of insects on basil while leaving the leaves safe to eat?,"With reference to this question: Insect infestation on my pepper plant, what do I do?  I have these insects in my indoor ""kitchen window sill"" basil and they do seem to be chewing it fast enough to slow new growth, which is annoying.   The first suggested solution to getting rid of the insects is to spray them off the plant outside and then submerge the plant for long enough to drown any remaining. If I did this to my basil, wouldn't it drown the basil too? As I understand it, basil doesn't like wet feet.  What is the best solution to getting rid of such insects and still being able to use the leaves in food without hassle? Maybe the water spraying and drowning as suggested in related question is still the best?  ADDITION: The insects I'm dealing with are definitely not white fly, which is why I posted a separate question from this: How do I get rid of white flies on my basil?  UPDATE (9/Aug): I tried the detergent spray twice (per GardeningDirections user) without any apparent effect by the next morning. I then tried drowning the bastards last night (per Mikey) and hopefully it has been more effective, but I still saw two which I squashed this morning. I'll whether I can just kill off the remaining ones by hand. Any other suggestions at this point before I try to figure out what to do to close the question?  UPDATE (24/Aug): I have taken the whole planter container outside and picked off the individual larvae from the underside of the leaves in bright sunlight so none would be missed. Now I am hoping the insects' natural predators will keep them down for long enough for the basil to recover and then I'll bring the plant back inside. I still haven't ruled out trying pyrethrum spray but that's a last resort.  UPDATE (15/Sep): I have used a pyrethrum-based spray to kill perhaps 90% of the bugs while the planter box was outside but it also knocked the basil plants themselves so I did not respray. Now I notice there are still one or two insects left which have laid new larvae all over the undersides of the leaves... and I've also put these creatures through an evolutionary bottleneck so no doubt they'll be tougher to kill than ever! So I officially give up. These basil plants will be transferred to the garden outside, to survive or not. I will get new plants for my indoor planter box.  UPDATE (19/Oct): Transplanted outdoors a month ago the basil is still surviving, even thriving and the insects formerly dominating them are clearly being eaten by proper predators, which hints to me that the best possible way to control the insects would perhaps be to introduce a few friendly predators into the kitchen!

1208,How to grow wax apple / jambu (Syzygium samarangense)?,"  I bought a Black Pearl Wax Apple tree to grow in the Bay Area in California. This fruit is popular in tropical areas of Asia, but it virtually impossible to find in supermarkets outside of Asia. I've scoured Google for how to grow Wax Apple, but could not find any useful information.   What kind of soil does it like? Is it self-fruitful or do I need to cross-pollinate? Does it like to be pruned? Is it deciduous and can it withstand winters of 45 degrees Fahrenheit at night? How much light does it prefer?  "
1209,Is it safe to eat fruits and vegetables planted in a pet cemetery?,"Are there any safety concerns in eating fruit and veggies from plants that have been growing where dead pets have been buried?  Not a full blown pet cemetery, but a small and intimate location in the backyard where the beloved family dog or cat has gone for a dirt nap.   Does the rotting flesh of the animal corpse affect the ground water or soil in a way that the produce from plants in the immediate area should not be ingested?  They didn't cark it from rabies or other such ailments. Just dead of other causes not diseased. They were buried 6 months ago in a rather shallow grave, about 30 centimetres (a foot) deep and the plants (carrots, baby tomatoes and a few chillis) are in a 1 metre (roughly 3 feet) radius of such. "
1210,Are these Golden Pothos roots overwatered?,"Based on my previously asked question:  Golden Pothos Leaves Are Regularly Dying  I took one plant apart to examine the root structure.  The soil seemed dry enough, and almost no moisture was felt.    The soil came out in larger chunks, but said clumps were easy to break apart.    Pictured is the root structure.  They seem solid enough, although the entire structure seems small.  What's going on here? Are they over-watered?  Are they under?  Appreciate the help! "
1211,How to trim this multistem tree,"I recently moved into a new house. A tree in the backyard does not seem to have a ""main"" trunk. It has a lot of branches coming from the ground. What should I do with it? Remove it? Trim it, if so how? Leave it?  Pictures below:     "
1212,My indoor plant has an orange mold-like substance growing on it and has tiny white bugs. How can I remove it?,"I have my very first plant in my cube and it seems to be doing just fine.  However, there is an orange mold-like substance growing on the top of the soil, and I can see a few tiny white bugs crawling around in the soil.  Did I do something wrong?  Should I be worried?  Is there anything I can do to fix my potential issue?  Here is some additional info, unfortunately I do not have answers to most of your questions as this plant was just given to my by a friend with no details provided.   I do not know the type of plant. (See pic)  It will not bloom, and sometimes grows extentions of itself which can be cut off and replanted elsewhere. (That's how I got mine.) The pot is just the cheapest plastic pot I could find at the local store.  I's essentially a glorified tupperware container with holes in the bottom. It's planted in potting soil that my roommate had sitting in the apartment. It seems like simple black dirt with those little white balls in it.   Here are some photos of the mold and the plant. The white bugs are too small to photograph with my camera.  They are only about 2mm long and .5mm wide.  They look like tiny white larva of some sort perhaps.  (Click all photos for full-size)    Photo of mold (Inlined to make post shorter)   Another photo of mold    I'd like to apologize for my ignorance.

1213,Is a full spectrum 380-840nm white phosphor LED suitable for growing plants?,"I am an avid grower and like most I have spent much time and money on various lights and techniques. Take a look at this [website]Now even if it was crap, it is cheap and makes bold statements on its performance. So why aren't growers testing it and sharing their results? Why are there no journals online? Why is nobody even attempting to test this technology even though it is a very advanced white led technology? It has everything a led grower want from a light, full spectrum with UV+ IR. Could someone please give me a full detailed opinion on this as it has been available for over a year and still not a single journal. "
1214,How to make garden flat and level,"I don't know if I'm searching correctly, but I'm amazed I have only found one answer (which is still lacking).  How can a garden be made completely flat and level? How would it be done professionally?  The first step (now obvious to me after research) is to remove existing turf, plants, roots, etc. either by hand and possibly with a rotavator.  The next step is the one that eludes me: distributing the soil so it's flat. It sounds simple. But the one answer I've found was this; use a bit of wood and kick it around. This is just not practical enough, or simply good enough, for several reasons:   It will not ensure the whole garden is level It will only work for sandy soil, not more stodgy clay type soil.  As the garden is walked on and compacted, unevenness will reappear.    What would the professional process be for achieving this for a small-ish garden with no access for heavy machinery? And let's say the garden had to be level and flat enough to play a proper game of bowls. (I'm not that old yet, but might as well do the manual labour in preparation while I still can).  Thanks "
1215,Is it a bad idea to put a pot over a bucket to mimic a water table?,"I have a black walnut establishing itself in a hanging basket pot on top of a 5 gallon bucket so it can get all of the water it wants. Is this a good, or bad idea? Why?   "
1216,How to get proper drainage in a pot with a built-in saucer?,"I bought a 16'' wide plastic pot with a built-in saucer. The saucer is removable. On the inside of the pot, there are 4 holes where the saucer connects with the pot and 4 other tiny holes that appear to be drainage holes. How should I prepare this pot for proper drainage for a tropical fruit tree?   My first concern is the proper size of drainage holes - the 4 tiny ones seem like they can clog up easily. How much should I widen each hole?  My second concern is that the drainage holes are currently not at the lowest point of the pot. The center of the pot is the lowest point, but it sits directly on the saucer, so drilling a hole there would not help. My limited understanding of physics is that water will try to flow to the lowest point of any container, so holes that are slightly elevated don't help.     "

1219,Is the end of June too late to harvest and plant seeds from a Hellebore in zone 6a?,"I live in Massachusetts, zone 6a. A month ago I found a plant in my yard, which my friend identified as a perennial shrub called Hellebore. It has pastel green and pink flowers on stems gently bent over in such a way that almost only the backs are visible. I picked one, which is shown in the picture below. A few days ago I checked, and found that the Hellebore has grown significantly, and most of the flowers now have pods filled with small white seeds.  Is it too late in the season to plant the seeds somewhere else in the yard?  If so, are they ready to be harvested now, or should I wait for something to happen to the pods, such as drying out, splitting or falling on their own? Also, since there are so many seeds, can I also store some for the winter, using the same method as my annual flower seeds?   Update: After having read @Stormy's answer, I think I'll try to cultivate a new one vegetatively. The current plant is in a mostly shady area. Is that an important consideration in choosing a location for the new one?   click on pictures for full size     "
1220,What is this fungus/mushroom on my oak tree?,"I've got an oak tree. Within the last 2-3 weeks I've observed two growths on the base of the tree that started from nothing to what you see below. They're a fungus or mushroom of some sort. They're solid structures, but if you look closely you can see fuzz on the tree itself where they meet.  My plan was to call someone on Monday, but I'm not entirely sure who. An arborist? Before I do call though, I'm trying to get as much information on this as I can, because I know it can range from being treatable to being dangerous.  Any ideas? Thanks!         "
1221,Is the calcium deposit in my kettle utilized?,"Can plants utilize the calcium that sediments in the kettle when water is boiled? Should we be ""feeding"" it to them? "
1222,How do I protect the roots and adjust watering levels in a non-draining indoor pot?,"The long, winding backstory:  We have a rubber tree which has been in the same pot for ages.  It has been moved twice, and in our new home we're still trying to find it a spot it likes.  Recently, when we went to water it, we noticed standing water on top of the soil.  It's been very droopy lately with leaves falling off.  Thinking it's getting over-watered, we move it to get a bit more indirect sun and hold off watering for a while.  Not much changes (maybe a bit more drooping).  I start worrying about mildew and root rot, and as we're discussing what to do about it we realize it's been in the same pot/soil for probably over a decade.  So I re-pot it in fresh soil and clean out it's pot.  It's been about a week; and the rubber tree is starting (very slowly) to improve.  Some wilted leaves are still falling off, but a few fresh green ones are starting to open.  Now I'm worried about how to keep it happy.  Now that I have fresh soil in a nice large pot, I have the issue of keeping the water fresh.  My past experience of plants is either in proper ground, or pots which can drain excess water.  I understand I've just shocked this poor rubbery tree quite a bit, and I don't want to add more stress.  But I feel there's a fine line between under-watering and over-watering when one leads to drought and the other to rot.  We thought maybe a watering spike would help keep things even (as the water would be released about root level), then thought maybe that was a bad idea when the entire bottle emptied in about 18 hours.  Now we figure there's a lake in the bottom of the pot, and we might be headed back where we started.  Rubber trees are very, very slow growing; and I'm not sure how quickly they take up water.  Then again, maybe they like a bit of stagnant water in their pots.  I've heard they very much like pots, at any rate.  My questions:  In a sealed pot, how can I measure the water needs of my plant, and how can I make adjustments?  Is there something I can do to protect the roots, or prevent water trapped in the bottom of the pot from causing health problems? "
1223,Do techniques to repel slugs also work on snails?,"I have seen the thread on an organic way to repel slugs. However, usually I only see snails in my area. Will the techniques in the answer there work on snails too? Also,   By the way, I've never seen a slug in my life here in Hong Kong. Are slugs/snails location specific? "
1224,What is the best way to channel an electricity cable under the lawn?,"I need to channel an electricity (and network) cable under the lawn to an outbuilding.  I understand it would be best to shield the cable to stop anyone from danger when digging in the future, but what is the best way to excavate the small channel required for the cables and shielding?  I'm guessing there's some kind of tool that makes the job easier with the least amount of damage to the grass? "
1225,Organic method of helping a Manganese deficient lemon tree,"My young lemon tree has yellow blotches on some of its leaves, even though the leaves are quite newly grown. This advice suggests that it's likely to be deficient in Manganese, rather than Magnesium, as the older leaves look ok.  Whenever possible, I use organic methods in the garden, so I would really appreciate advice consistent with organic gardening principles. How likely is it that some regular (home made) garden compost could help resolve this? Is there a mulch of some particular plant high in Manganese that I could apply?  Any other suggestions would be appreciated too   "
1226,"If money plant can grow submerged in water, why it can...","die from over-watering in soil?  Question is simple: If I can grow a money plant(Devil's Ivy) in water, why over-watering it in soil can kill it?  Can anyone explain? "
1227,Why has my bougainvillea lost almost all of its leaves?,"I got this bougainvillea plant as a gift a week or two ago. I read up on it and it said that it needed direct light for at least 5 hours a day and not a lot of watering.  But I live in central Texas and the days are 100 degrees. I would water it about every other day to two days when the soil looked like it was really drying. For now I have brought it in, re-watered it and now I'm not sure what to do with it.   I want to keep it small and shrub like but from what I understand this keeps growing longer unless you cut it back.  Do I need to cut it back and let it re-grow?  Or give it time and let it grow bigger before cutting?   Edit for pics. Click on them for closer view.    "
1228,Is it true that having only one fruit per vine makes it taste better?,"I had noticed how expensive square watermellon is and apparently the reason for that is because often times farmers will only grow one watermellon per vine as opposed to the normal four or five per vine because the logic is that by cutting off the other growing watermellons, you are saving the nutrients for the one watermellon thus making it taste much better and whatnot. Is this true? And if so, is it really that helpful to do so, because I would imagine that if a plant weren't able to handle that many fruits growing at the same time, they simply wouldn't grow at all, so simply cuting some off doesn't make all that much a difference? "
1229,Why clean plant when repotting,"So I have some Venus fly trap seeds growing in a 72-cell germ station. The cells are pretty small and I will have to repot soon. Whenever I have read about repotting, I always hear it is best to try to get all the old soil off the root system before repotting it. My question is why? Why can't I just scoop the entire soil block and plant from the cell, not clean off any of the soil, and then just put the hunk of soil with the plant into a bigger pot with more soil? I ask because I hear of people damaging/killing their plant in the process of cleaning the plant of its 'old' soil, and don't want to do this if I don't have to. Hopefully this is not an ignorant question.  From [website]""Once you have the old soil and plants free from the original pot, start breaking away the soil from the roots. Do this very gently and methodically to be sure not to tear or otherwise damage any of the roots. You can also simply dunk the entire soil ball into clean water (rain, reverse osmosis or distilled water) and swirl it around to release the soil.""  From [website]""The roots of a Venus Flytrap can break fairly easily, so be careful not to pull on them too much. Gentle taps on the soil are often all that is required to remove most of the soil.""  and   ""The Venus Flytrap can be soaked and rinsed in water in order to remove stubborn soil and to expose the rhizome so that it can be cleaned of any dead leaves and tissue. Small scissors and tweezers (forceps) are very handy for this cleaning."" "
1230,Is staking young trees helpful or harmful?,"I frequently see small trees staked with some support twine or rope, presumably to aid against strong winds.  However, I've heard or read somewhere that staking small trees can actually be harmful, preventing them from building a natural resistance to the wind (in trunk strength, root development, etc.).  There are many guides that explain ""proper"" tree staking. Here are a few examples:   How to Stake a Tree Staking Trees   It seems, from aggregating information in such guides, that staking is sometimes necessary, but that people often do it wrong.  The question then, is how do you determine when to stake a tree (if at all)? Are there lots of oddly bent or fallen trees somewhere from lack of staking? I've never seen one. "
1231,What has caused stunted growth of my Peace lily?,"The growth of my peace lily has stunted. Should I fertilize my peace lily with humic acid? Can it substitute NPK?   I brought this plant home 4 months back, when it was new to our home. Its  growth was marvelous (3-4 leaves per month),  but with the passage of time its growth slowed down by a great extent, to hardly 1 leaf in a month.  It receives copious amount of light, and the humidity is doing fine at 60%. I allow the soil to dry between watering.   After seeing slow growth I repotted it last month, in a new pot with 2 inches larger diameter then the previous pot. It didn't show any sign of transplant shock.  The root system was healthy, the soil is very well drained, and the pot has several holes at bottom.  I cant figure out the problem. The plant is not doing very well even though everything seems good. To me it looks healthy, but the growth is very slow and the tips are getting brown.    "

1233,Does wrapping fruit increase its temperature?,"I was watching a video on how to grow Wax Apples (Jambu) and the farmer said that wrapping his fruit in paper bags would increase the temperature by 2 degrees Celcius. Can someone scientifically explain this? I understand how a mammal has warm blood running through its veins and clothes keep the warmth from dissipating into the air, but I do not know what is generating heat on a fruit. And these bags are not air tight - wouldn't any cold air get into the bag after a matter of seconds?   "
1234,How can I ensure my perennial herbs survive in an above ground planter (1.5' x 5') year round?,"Never been much of a gardener, so 10 years ago I bought a house with a mostly asphalt backyard. So, different season of life now, my wife and I are starting a small garden of mostly food bearing plants.  We're located in Calgary, Canada where we have long winters with lots of Chinooks (warm wind that will randomly bring the temperature up to 10-20 C and melt everything).  Our raspberries are planted below ground and are thriving. This year we added some herbs (thyme, sage, etc...) and strawberries. However, as we're limited in space, these are planted in the above ground planter box. The guy who sold us the herbs suggested that freezing over the winter for many of the perennials would be fine, but our Chinooks could likely kill the plants if they were planted above ground. Any truth to this? How can I ensure that my plants survive our strange winter? Can I just shovel lots of snow onto it and hope the planter box never gets the chance to thaw? "
1235,Can I grow spider plants in coffee?,"Long story short, I have stale ground coffee (whoops vacation whoops) and two spider plants growing in pure water. Can I combine the two, or is that too acidic? I know that spider plants like acid, but... perhaps that's too much. Or perhaps there's not enough in the ground coffee to feed them?  For context: I am a student living in university housing, so I can't easily access potting soil.  [EDIT] To be clear, I mean to use the coffee in lieu of soil, not as a liquid growing medium. "

1237,Why would we cut off leaves of strawberry plants once the harvest is done?,"Each year since I'm following Gardener's World (a BBC show for gardeners), Monty Don cuts off the leaves of his early strawberry plants once the harvest is done (in June or July). Last year I did it for the first time on my plants. This year I had the biggest harvest in 4 years.   What is the reasoning behind the idea of cutting off the leaves?  Was this (one of) the reason(s) my harvest was outstanding this year? "

1244,"Can my weed wacker designed for .065"" (1.651 mm) trimmer line handle .08"" (2 mm) one?","I have a Ryobi P2200 hybrid weed whacker. It takes .065"" (1.651 mm) trimmer line. I have found better deals and much better shaped line. I have found a piece of (plastic) wire that was exactly .08"" (2 mm) and fed it through the hole and it fits with some room left over (did not run with wire in, very dangerous!).  I would naturally think there is a great possibility that it would work. But would there be a reason why it does not say in the manual it can handle .08"" (2 mm)? Will it mess with how it auto feeds, how it performs etc. Would it be worth trying? Not that I go spend $8 at a local store and it does not work.   "
1245,Will mulch on top of exposed tree roots cause rot?,"I've been planning on adding a mulch circle around my trees for a while now and have time to do it this weekend. I've been reading that you shouldn't butt the mulch directly against the tree, as the humidity can cause rot in the trunk. Looking at the trees however, I have several with roots that come back up out of the ground and are exposed. Does mulch present the same hazard to them? Should I avoid covering them? "
1246,Should a root-ball always be loosened when transferring a potted plant/tree into the ground?,"I've always thought that the right way to transfer a plant/tree to the ground is to dig a hole twice as big as the root-ball, free the roots that have been growing in a limited space, and set it level with the ground. This way, the roots are free to branch out and establish themselves in the surrounding soil.  However, I recently saw landscape workers just directly transferring a tree with its root-ball still looking like the shape of the container†. Wouldn't this slow down the growth of the roots and make the tree more susceptible to uprooting in strong winds?   Are there tangible advantages to freeing the roots, or have I been doing it wrong (or unnecessarily) all this while?   † It is entirely possible that the workers were lazy and didn't do it knowing fully well that they were going to get paid anyway. The question still remains though. "
1247,Is it good practice to replace water in Lucky Bamboo everyday?,"My sis replaces water in the jar everyday, the plant grew well but it started turning yellow after couple of weeks. The plant was in bright indirect light.   I thought the plant needed less water changing, maybe I am wrong. I can't say why the plant grew well for few weeks and then started turning yellow. What's the reason for that? Is changing the water everyday the culprit? "
1248,Pros and Cons of wood vs stone mulch,"We currently have stone next to our house however we have been getting quite a bit of weeds. Its probably been some time since any rocks were added. Basically I am looking for the pros and cons for stones vs mulch next to a house. (how often to add/replace, costs, etc)  Update:  Climate - Wisconsin so colds and hots. Rocks do currently have landscape fabric down but it could easily be 20+ years.  I am looking for a very basic list of pros cons. A few things to get it started   Adding stone/mulch monthly/yearly/??etc? Resistance to weeds  Cost (probably initial cost + if have to add to it yearly) Impact of water - get washed away? store moisture? redirect flow?  Aesthetic - home value?  Environmental Impact?

1249,Storing potting soil and reusing the next year,"Am I being silly for thinking that it's good idea to store the potting soil I've used in my annual pots?  As the first frosts are approaching here, we empty our terracotta pots that were filled with summer annuals.  In years past we've dumped the soil but I get so tired all the little white flecks surfacing.  This year I'm playing with the idea of storing the soil (in a dry location) over the winter and adding compost / fertilizer to it next spring and reusing.  Is this crazy?

Now that those puny trees have grown up and started to produce a substantial crop, we're wondering which varieties they are. The labels have been lost.  Supposedly there are 1200 apple varieties native to England. How can we go about identifying our apple varieties? Is it even possible?  Some photos of one of our cookers, in case anyone can identify this variety from photos alone. That would might start us off.  Click to enlarge      "

1254,"Moved tree nursery in Fall, new area has heavy deer browse, how to protect the baby trees?","I'm growing a small backyard potted-tree nursery (~20 trees from seedlings to &lt;1in. saplings at this point). I recently moved to a new house, not very far but far enough where the deer browse has increased significantly. Unsurprisingly, the tree nursery has suffered severely every night since the trees were moved to the yard in this new location.  Autumn is upon is and some of these trees' leafs were already turning colors and drying up. After just two nights in the new location, many of the trees have lost most of their leafs to deer. Thankfully the deers are not eating all the buds, mostly just leafs, though they have chomped the terminal stem of an apple tree...  What's the best thing I can do to protect these trees at this point?   I realize in this new location I will need deer control - I plan on putting up a steel post deer fence ASAP around the tree nursery and in the long run putting up a wood fence and/or living fence around the whole yard. With a fence up I also plan to upgrade the tree nursery, planting trees out of pots to grow out in beds before bare root transplanting, and setting up air pruning beds for seedlings. In the mean time what can I do...just put the steel fence up ASAP?   Another idea is to move the trees into a garage which gets some western light but very little. While living in a garage is not a long-term solution, my thinking is the trees are already losing leafs (from seasonality and more rapidly from deer browse) so being in the garage is not all bad and regulates temperature; in the mean time I can setup a fenced area for them. If I went the garage route, should I move the trees back out as soon as I have a fence up, or wait until spring to move them out (I'd think the latter - wait until spring to bring them out)?  The trees in question are:   Hazelnut Elderberry Apple Pear  Black currant Linden Lilac   Hardiness Zone is: 5 "
1255,Getting rid of moles in the lawn?,"I've seen this question which seems to be our canonical mole page but I have additional questions/details I hope you can answer here.  I'm not a native English speaker so forgive my expressions. In particular, it seems that ""moles"" are ones that make tunnels that are visible on the grass? The moles I have make tunnels 10-20cm under the grass so I can't tell where the tunnels are except when I dig out one of the earth piles. --> What's this kind of mole called? Just so I can phrase my questions properly.   Also, I'm not in the US so some of the products mentioned don't exist here (Austria) and I can't figure out whether my ""local"" Amazon.de has anything similar. --> Knowledge of European alternatives are much appreciated!  My lawn is new: rolls of pre-grown grass rolled out over a thick layer of new soil in the summer of 2013. There are a LOT of earth worms (which is a good sign) but also at least one very annoying mole that perforates my (expensive) lawn.   I have tried old spring-loaded mole traps borrowed from my neighbor, but they were triggered by soil and not by the mole itself.  He also gave me a concussion trap (powered by a round of gun powder, no projectile) that got jammed by soil and didn't blow.  Strongly-scented cotton balls seemed worth a try but also ineffective. Burying a deep container in the mole's path in the hope of trapping it (advice from a pest control person) didn't succeed either.   Here's an image of a revealed tunnel going under the boys' sandbox. I've placed a plastic stick in the path for visibility. I know that the mole passes through here and I placed a slab over this hole while I figure out what to do next.  --> What can I do to get rid of this mole? Trap/kill/move/chase away - whatever you can recommend.   "
1256,Why is triclopyr not available in California?,"I'm considering using a triclopyr based herbicide to defeat some clover in my lawn (dwarf fescue) in San Francisco, CA. For example, there is this product:  [website]But it's not available anywhere (that I can find) in California. I asked Scotts why not, and they couldnt answer.   One possibility is that it's banned, but I dont see any references to that online. Another possibility is that its ineffective against California variants.   Anyone know why it's so hard to get triclopyr in CA? (I can order it online from out of state, but I want to know why it's unavailable)  thanks "

1258,How can I stunt the growth of a Night Blooming Jasmine?,"I have been trying to grow a Night Blooming Jasmine, Cestrum nocturnum Jessamine, plant indoors. The plant is growing pretty rapidly. I read that the height of the plant goes up to 8-10 feet, which is quite a bit for my small apartment.  What are the techniques I could use to stunt the growth of the plant, but keep it healthy and make it bloom? Also, is it possible to bonsai train the plant?  I am a complete newbie and this is my first plant that has grown so well. So, please feel free to advise about any basics.   "
1259,best control method for mealy bug on dwarf white pine,"The dwarf white pine has mealy bug which hide in the bark scales as well as living on the needles.  It is only five feet tall so I can reach all the branches.  Will soap and water harm the waxy cuticle on the needles?  Will a dormant oil spray harm the needles? If not should this be done in late winter, early spring?  Any other ideas given that systemic insecticides are not available to homeowners in Ontario?  Update: The plant kept going downhill even after soap and water.  When there was substantial foliage die back after a winter I pulled it out and found very few roots.   "
1260,When will my tomatoes be ready to harvest?,"I am planning to serve homemade tomato soup for a large dinner party on Sept 24, 2011 (42 days from this posting).   This dinner is really important to me; so important, that I decided to plant my own tomato garden (those gas treated supermarket tomatoes just don't compare to the real thing, ya know?). This will be my very first gardening experience, so I'm looking for any useful information at this point.  So, to continue the story, this weekend I found a source for 4 large Big Boy tomato plants. The season is almost over and the people at the nursery looked at me like I was crazy as I walked off the lot with $130 worth of tomato plants, soil, pots, and feed.   Here are some picks of one of the plants:    The plants stand about 3 feet tall and look reasonably healthy. They're planted in 14in ceramic pots (around 4 gal).  Now here's the real question: Based on these images, will my tomatoes be ready in time for my all-important dinner party? Is there anything besides a healthy dose of sunlight, regular watering/feeding that I can do to speed things along.   Update:  Here's a pic of the tomatoes a day before the dinner party. The plants are still going strong (thanks to you all, no doubt) and I foresee many more tomatoes in the next few weeks.    "
1261,How do I deal with 'compostable' bags?,"I let my neighbors dump their vegetable trimmings in my compost pile, and it's worked well for many years.  I don't tend to actively maintain my compost pile and only turn it once a year.  (screen the stuff from the bottom when I'm turning over the garden in the spring, then throw all of the rest of it back in to sit 'til next year).  Unfortunately, last year my neighbors broke the container they had been using in their kitchen for compost, and I got them a new indoor compost container.  I bought it online and didn't realize that it used bags.  They've been using it, and my outdoor compost pile is overflowing with the bags.  I've looked at the store, and the refills all seem to say variants of 'for municipal composting'.  Is there some way of dealing with compostable bags in a personal compost pile?  Do I just have to break them open?  Heat them up sufficiently?  Or do I need to go through and attempt to remove them all?  update : I took at look at the box, and there's text on it that says :     Bags are certified to meet ASTM D6400 standards. This means they will break down in an industrial composting facility.  Please dispose of bags properly.  Bags may take more time to degrade in a home composting environment.   The bags themselves say they're made from cornstarch. "
1262,Are these two weeds both lambsquarter?,"These two western Idaho weeds look like lambsquarter to me. One of them is blunt, and the other one is pointy (and much more susceptible to leaf miners and some disease that wilts the shoots and leaves). Are they both lambsquarter? What are the variety names, if you can tell? Because of the immaturity of the weed in the second picture, you might be tempted to say it's bind weed or something (but it's not; it's not a vine; the growth habit is just like that of the blunt variety).  Blunt variety (picture 1):   Blunt variety (picture 2):   Pointed variety:  "
1263,"What is this stuff? Some kind of moss, lichen?","I found this stuff growing between and on the tiles in a moist, not too light corner of my garden. It looks funny, like a very small tropical island with palm trees :P  I transplanted some of it in my mini-bog with carnivorous plants, where it seems to settle really nicely, but now I do start to wonder what it is, and I can't find much like it.   It's very small. It's mostly green, almost looking like a succulent plant. In the picture you can see some specs or pores, but these are so small, I didn't notice them before I took the picture. On the leaves are small 'cups'.   It grows stalks of about 3 cm which look remotely like palm trees, but up close they look like a roof of 'fingers' with some fluffyness underneath.  If I pull it out, it's quite stuck to the bottom, with thin hairy roots. It looks like they are just thousands of hairs which grow straight from the whole ground facing side of the plant (?) straight into the bottom, which suggests to me that it may use this strategy to attach itself to rocks or (rotting) wood.  In the picture you can see it. On the left you see parts of the leaves of Drosera Capensis Alba and Drosera Binata, to give an impression of the size. The 'log' in the front has a diameter of about 2cm. ;) The whole area on the picture is maybe 15cm wide.  I tried to google for various properties of it, but all I found is cup lichen, but it hardly seems related to that.

1264,Is this flea beetle damage on this hollyhock?,"Here's a picture of a hollyhock. It's been covered with holes like this all year (and the ones last year were, too, all year). As a side note, I gave it potassium for the yellowing of the leaves, twice (once just before I took this picture).    So, my question is, are these holes caused by flea beetles? I've never actually seen any flea beetles on them. Hollyhocks in other areas of my western Idaho town have similar problems. Ours used to be worse than this.  How do I stop these holes from happening? "
1265,Can a topworked female pistachio tree be pollinated by grafting a male bud or scion?,"If one has female pistachio trees coming into bearing age, can they be pollinated by grafting a male bud or scion onto a topworked female?   If so, assuming it's done early in grafting season and with more than one scion to improve the rate of survival, could it pollinate by the first season? "
1266,Root system of an evergreen tree,"We have evergreen trees that are approx. 55 feet tall.  I am not sure the name of this type of evergreen, but is has short needles and the branches fall like a canopy and produce very small pinecones.  Next door to our property they are intending to build right next to our property line where the trees are and we are concerned about damage to their root system.  We have been here for 30 plus years and love our trees.  The questions are:  (a) how far does the root system extend?; (b) what can be done to protect the root system? (c) if they dig so close to the trees would it be likely that they will die?  The area the new trees would be planted face north, they get some early morning light and afternoon light.  Not sure about the soil, but there are scattered trees in this area already but not as a border, so there are quite a bit of root system in the area, but the new trees should be planted a couple of feet away from the existing trees.  The trees would be along the back of the lot and our lot is approx 63 ft wide.  Also, if we would request 2 lines of trees for privacy/noise levels, do you think that is feasible or how far do such big trees need to survive?  One other question I have is if we want to plant additional trees to line the property line, are there fast growing columnar evergreens for privacy that we can plant or what type of tree could we plant for privacy as they are building a 3 storey, 36 foot tall building right beside our property line which apparently will be 40 foot wide.

I have bird feeders there too and they seem to spend a lot of time there as well. 
1271,Elimination of Japanese Knotweed by injection,"I have a Japanese Knotweed problem in a limited area (about 15x15 feet).  It is very difficult to dig up the roots because they can be a good 2 feet underground.  Therefore I am considering death by injection: cutting off the stalks about 6 inches above the ground and pouring imazapyr into the well of the stalk. Will this be effective? Is there a better approach?  One pamphlet I read described an experiment where they did something similar but used a mixture of glyphosate, triclopyr, and imazapyr. I am not really expert in different herbicides, so I am looking for some expert advice here. "
1272,Recommendations for climbers that'll climb by a walnut tree,"I've got a large walnut tree (Juglans regia), and I am happy with it, I just want to improve further that part of my garden to be more attractive to birds and butterflies.  My idea is to plant a climber that will climb up the walnut, and hopefully cover it (at least partially).  I searched the net, but could not find a similar case.  No need to mention that the climber must be juglone-tolerant.  Is this doable, or even possible at all?  My thoughts are now:   lonicera hedera wisteria   This list of juglone-tolerant plants mentions lonicera and wisteria, but not hedera. Another list mentions lonicera only (out of these three).  I will be doing some crown lifting pruning of that walnut next spring, so that more sunlight is available daily for the area at the bottom of the tree.  This is not my walnut tree, but my tree is very similar (age, size, habit...) to the pictured one:   What do you think? "
1273,What is happening with my pothos?,"Eleven days ago, I had asked why my young plants were not growing. Well, weeks later, one of them is regressing. What can be the issue now?

1274,What should I do about landscape rocks in my garden plot?,"I have a brand new house and garden plot; it is currently sod so I have to dig it this first year and amend the soil. I have run into a section that seems like it used to be a rock path or drive way, just smallish 1""d river rock about five inches down and up to one foot deep, some are big fist sized guys.   I know that ""sometimes the problem is the solution,"" so I am wondering if I really need to pull all of these out and sift the soil? If I don't will they add to my drainage and water storage under the garden? What if they are all mixed into the soil? How deep should they be under the growing strata? "
1275,Propagating loniceras for beginners,"A neighbor of mine have a beautiful lonicera plant that just flowered - this may be the third time this year! He offered to me to take as many cuttings as I wish, and says that I just need to put them in water (like indoor flowers), and they will root - and later on such cuttings may be moved to soil, and become real plants. Is that true?  What would be the right way to use my neighbor's generous offer?  I just have to have that plant, I almost fainted when I sensed fragrance of their flowers this morning! :)  I do not have any experience at propagating plants using cuttings, and probably have brown thumb for such work.  EDIT: Meanwhile, I discovered a series of blog posts describing 43-day experiment of rooting lonicera in water.  "

1277,What is this ornamental conifer and is it dying?,"This ornamental conifer, which looks like some sort of blue spruce, has lived in this spot since at least spring of 2014, when it looked like this:    I live in SE Pennsylvania, and it has appeared healthy until a few weeks ago, when I noticed a majority of its needles had died.  We haven't had extraordinary weather recently.  Is the plant itself dying?  Is any care indicated?    (The only thing that has changed in its environment since it was originally planted is the addition of lamb's ear to the bed last year, which the picture shows is growing a few feet away.)  Per @stormy's request:  There has been no fertilization since a dusting of Preen in the Spring.  I pulled soil back from the trunk until I was scraping dense clay and took these two photos:   Here is a macro photo of a cut stem and dead needles:   Here is a close-up of heavy lichen coverage on the branches, although I think that had developed that while the tree was still healthy:  "

Its outside under a shade cloth area. I would say it's a little darker than it should be.  I pruned a few branches back.  After a few weeks, as I saw some life emerge, I fertilized with 5 3 1 and treated it with systemic as there were signs of aphids on my willows a few feet away.  Spring arrived and it pushed out leaves very quickly. However I have 30% of the leaves are curled and not flat and open. They have dark spots in the recesses of the leaves.

1283,How soon can I start training or pruning a seedling?,"Is there a minimum age, height, or trunk girth before I can start training  or pruning a seedling / young tree? I am concerned that starting too early would be detrimental to its early growth.   Specifically, I have a wax apple tree that is just 8'' tall. Its leaves are growing much faster than its branches. Some leaves seem to be pushing into the frail branches. Can I cut off these overly strong leaves?  Another specific problem I have is a Wonderful Pomegranate seedling about 1 foot tall.

1284,My anthurium's leaves are turning yellow and brown,"I recently got this anthurium from Safeway. I put it away in my room from a south facing window. And then repotted it into a bigger pot with regular potting mix. The plants leaves started to get brown tips. So I put into another room which gets less light. But the leaves are still getting brown and new leaves dying.   Should I water it throughly only when it gets dry. The soil did not feel dry till about a week. Should I wait till it gets dry or water every other day.  I did try to spray a little water on it every once in a while. I read that anthurium prefer overcrowded roots but I repotted into a bigger pot, should I repot into a smaller pot. More images on google drive:   [website]"

I'm not sure if they are farming those bugs (is that even possible?), somehow feed off the bugs, or if this is completely unrelated. But if they are not going there for the bugs, I'm not sure what else they would find there.    Does anyone know what those bugs are? How would you recommend I approach getting rid of those ants and bugs? "

1290,Why would one of my Prairiefire crabapple trees seem stunted this year?,"I planted two Prairiefire Crabapple trees on my front lawn about ten years ago. Each spring, they flower beautifully together, then fruit, then leaves.    This year one of them seemed to lag behind.  It only bloomed very sparsely, with only a few flowers, and the same with the crabapples. It looks, for lack of a better word, sick.    I had a landscaper last year that took it upon himself to prune the trees while I was out.  I was shocked to see how much he removed.  Could this have something to do with it?

1297,Why were my parsnips fat with a woody core?,"The last (and only) time I tried growing parsnips (""Harris Model"") a couple of years ago, they ended up much ""fatter"" than the parsnips I've typically seen in the store and in pictures. Instead of being just a bit bigger than carrots, these were about 3-4"" diameter at the top, and had a tough woody core. The core was inedible and removing it made cooking them a hassle. I regarded the crop as a ""loss""; nobody wanted to cook or eat it.  I followed directions seen in various places: direct seed in spring (late April) and harvest after some frosts (around Thanksgiving -- mid-November). Some research I did afterward indicated that I may have given them too long of a growing season and should have harvested them earlier. (I.e. maybe they were overmature?) The tops were at least 3' high, which is more than I've seen elsewhere. Was it too much fertility (i.e. an overdose of horse manure)?  What caused this problem and how can I prevent it when I try again next spring? "

After a few days the plant took roots. After 2-3 weeks the first leaves have been formed and now, after almost 2 months in water, there are multiple leaves (some very big) and the plant looks great.  My question: Do I have to put the plant into earth? It's recommended in every source I found, but as it's growing absolutely great at the moment,  why should I change it?  Will I kill the plant by keeping it in just water? "

What else should I consider eg Variety, Soil, Watering, Timing, etc so that I can achieve maximum nutritional results from the indoor growing process? "
1302,Harvesting beans to prolong cropping - but how thorough do I need to be?,"It is said that if you let your runner/french beans reach full maturity, the plant stops producing.   So I harvest my beans (even if only to throw/give them away) regularly to prolong cropping.  How thorough do I need to be? Is it sufficient to regularly pick most of the beans that are ready or do I have to ensure I catch every single bean pod? "

1305,How do I maintain a Raspberry plant?,"I planted a raspberry cane this spring, and it appears to be doing well, having put out a new cane that is now 5 ft tall (and curving under its own weight.)  There is also old growth at the bottom that bore fruit this year.  What do I do to this plant to promote new canes and to maximize fruit production.  I would also like to keep it somewhat under control, as I have seen raspberries take over a garden.   Should I stake it or trellis it? How should I prune it? How should it be fertilized?   "
1306,messy curry leaf plant,"Couple of questions,   1) The leaves doesn't look very healthy, any idea what might help them?  2) What bugs are these? they are making a big mess, how to get rid of them?    "
1307,What are these small black winged insects in my lawn?,"I noticed two or three small, black insects tonight while sitting in my lawn, which is presumably where they're coming from. It seems to have wings, and I think it has a sharp thing which resembles a stinger. It's a little black speck to my eyes, and this picture was maxing out the cell phone camera I had at the moment.  The grass doesn't show any obvious signs of stress; it's a nice green color, but I'm still concerned that this insect might damage my lawn. I'm in the Northwest USA. Three questions:   What is this insect? Why is it in my lawn? How can I kill them all?   The picture was taken while on my leg, not in the lawn.   "
1308,Which fruits and vegetables can feature russeting?,"Which other fruits and vegetables than apples, pears and potatoes can feature russeting?  For example this nectarine: that stain is a scab or is a russet? To me it looks like mild scab but maybe the nectarines can also feature russeting?    I'll provide here the image of a russet pear for reference:    Later edit: Here's a very interesting nectarine - scabs or russeting?   "
1309,What should I do with the flowering bulbs I didn't plant this spring?,"I live in Minnesota, I have bulbs I dug up last fall. This spring was so wet and I was so busy, I couldn't get them in the ground. I realize it is really too late to plant them now. But what should I do with them? Some of the sprouted in the bags I was storing them in. Would they be okay for next spring? Should I plant them?  I did miss a couple last fall and they sprouted beautifully several weeks ago. Should I just plant them so they can grow next spring? "
1310,What special steps should I take to prepare my garden for fall planting?,"I am starting to think and plan out my fall/winter garden. I am looking at trying to plant some crops that will be overwintered and some crops that I can harvest before spring. What special steps should I take to prepare my beds for fall and winter crops that are different than what I do for spring crops? This year I pretty much just tilled up my soil and did not worry about soil amendment or anything. Can I do this for fall and winter crops as well or do I need to take more care with these plants?  I'm not totally certain what I am going to plant yet and I know some of this will depend on that, but I know I will try onions and garlic, and probably some carrots, radishes and maybe some leafy greens (maybe spinach and lettuce).  "
1311,Do peppers change color when left on the plant?,"My mother and I purchased some pepper plants from Costco. The info card they came with (which identifies them as Capsicum annuum bell peppers†) depicts vibrant red bell peppers. However, they've started to sprout their fruit, and we're noticing they're distinctly green.  Mom hears tale that peppers turn red if you don't pick them from the plant. Is this fact, will the pepper change color when left on the plant past its full growth? Is this only for particular breeds of pepper? If it does change color, is there a specific length of time I should wait, or perhaps some way to tell when the color change is complete?  †The card doesn't clarify much past that. Just says ""pepper"" matures in ""60-100 days"", and talks about both mild peppers and hot peppers. "
1312,Do ground cherries ripen after picking?,"I read that you should let ground cherries physalis pruinosa, also known as Stawberry Tomato,  fall to the ground and then pick them.   It is going to freeze and the plant is loaded with fruit. If I pick the the fruit and let them stand, will they turn yellow and ripen as a tomato would? "
1313,Why did my jalapeños turn black?,"Last year I grew jalapeños. The fruits were tiny, but I was able to harvest a few handfuls. I noticed that many of them started to turn black on the plant. They were still edible, and they weren't rotten. The skin of the fruit developed black patches, shiny like the rest of the skin. It looked as though they were ripening to black (instead of red like other peppers would). The plants looked perfectly healthy otherwise, and continued making fruit.  Is this normal? If not, what causes it / how can I prevent it?  (Sorry, no photos available, I didn't think to take pictures at the time.) "
1314,Ideas for picking up residual water?,"I have several plants hanging in my balcony from something like this, so when I water them, the residual water naturally spills to the floor. So I was thinking of building a wood planter, similar to the image below, to pick up any residual water.  I'll be building this planter with treated wood. So two questions:  1) Should I drill some holes at the bottom of the planter so that the plants in there don't rot from too much residual water?  2) If I do drill some holes, what can I do to avoid so that the residual water from the planter doesn't spill to the floor?  3) I've read that there are materials I can put at the bottom of the planter to absorb any water. Would this be healthy?  4) Is there any special paint or treatment that I should use with this wood so that it doesn't rot from the combination of moisture, soil, water, humid &amp; hot weather, etc?  5) Any other creative ideas on how to pick up any residual water from the plants above? I particularly thought about this because I can use it to add more plants.  Any help is appreciated.  Thanks.   "
1315,"What Would Be A Good Shade Tree for Oakville, Ontario, Canada?","Shade Tree questions  I'm looking to get a new tree for our backyard to provide a bit more shade throughout the summer. I did some searches around and on this site, got some ideas, but would still look for some more specific suggestions/facts/ideas from those on here if you don't mind :)  I live in Oakville (just West of Toronto , Canada).  I have 3 primary goals I need to reach with the tree:  Main Goals   Shade for the backyard, (I guess at least 40 ft, preferably 50+)   Privacy between neighbour to the back and our raised deck.   I'm not trying to get shade on the deck, I just want a partial barrier between neighbours and myself, so we can sit on our deck and they on their patio and we're not staring at each other :) Fast/moderate growth speed. I understand it'll take a few years to get large, I just don't want it taking ""too"" long ;)    Secondary Goals (aka ""Nice to have"")  Additional things I'd ""like"" to keep in mind, or at least be aware of:   Prefer a tree with not too many diseases it is prone to . Fewer typical pests/etc. Our area seems to have things such as: Asian long horned beetles, Japanese beetles, Ash borers in the area .. that I know of :) I'd rather not deal with those if I can avoid it.  I would like to minimize attraction of squirrels, mice, rabbits, chipmunks, etc. : rodents in general .. most birds we're ok with (we have Cardinals, Orioles, Blue Jays and Woodpeckers to name a few)   Would also like to avoid caterpillars if possible .. :) (I know this one's tough - not sure which trees are more prone to them.) Lower maintenance - I'm not against raking, however, if a tree is dropping excessive sap, needles (i.e. pines), nuts, etc., whatever, which makes ongoing maintenance a nuisance ... I might shy away from it :)   Backyard Details  So some more details:  Our backyard is on south side of our house, so facing on our deck south towards the neighbours, we have more neighbours to our right(west) which are already obscured by trees/shrubbery and grants us evening shade. We have a dense thicket of Sumac to our left (east) granting morning shade and privacy from the walkway.  The fence/property line is probably about ~50 ft  from our house. Not huge backyards, but not tiny. I don't think we want too huge a tree, or it'll start impacting neighbours in the future.  We have a small 8x10 shed in the SW corner, some cedars lining the East fenceline, and various gardens which aren't all that ""set"" at the moment :)  We have encountered some minor pockets of flooding/pooling during a heavy rain which we are still building up and working on .. regardless, it doesn't seem to stay long. So during a heavy rain, pooling water, but a few hours after the rain, it'll be gone. Our soil seems to be mostly a reddish clay ... not a really good/rich soil .. just a thin surface soil, then this hard red clay.  My Research  I did some more research and found the following on some trees, I'm hoping anyone with more knowledge of these guys could provide additional information or links that might help me in my decision :)  Red Maple: 50+ ft height, fast growing, adaptable and hardy tree somewhat drought and flood tolerant. Prone to Asian long horned beetles.    I only mention the beetles, at the moment, I think this may be our top choice. I think we can handle the beetles :) (I hope).  Katsura: 100+ ft height, fast, likes moist soil, sensitive to droughts.    It's definitely moist in our backyard, mostly due to pooling water mentioned .. however, we're not really a drought prone area, so this guy might be an option, although perhaps a bit tall in the future)  American Linden (aka Basswood):  100 ft, fast, seeds attract chipmunks, mice, squirrels :( ... bark eaten by rabbits/voles :( (we have LOTS of squirrels and rabbits - I'm not eager to attract more of them .. lol ) Prone to Japanese beetles.    Nice looking tree, however, after reading up on things, it seems alot of things we don't like, seem to like the Linden .. O.o  I'll probably shy away from this one ...   Large leaved Linden: 100 ft, moderate    Not sure if it's less prone to fungus and pests the American Linden seems to have ...   Silver Linden: 100 ft, very tolerant to pollution, soil compaction, drought, etc. drops buds/pollen during spring/fall - might require ground cleanup ? O.o    It seems this one's a ""messy tree"", they don't suggest it for near sidewalks due to the cleanup required .. :)  Hickory:   ??    I didn't get much info on this one - seems too many varieties .. would any of these be a possibility for me here ?  Beech:  ??  prone to beech blight aphids ?  Oak:  ??   not immediately fond of dealing with the acorns/squirrels :)    I couldn't find immediate specs on the height and such .. and again, I'm not writing it off just due to the squirrels, yet :)    This might actually be my 2nd option behind the maple, in fact.  So I tried to get all my thoughts done and all relevant information .. hoping to get some ideas, suggestions, etc ? Are there other trees might be better suited to my purposes I haven't listed ?  Worked on a sketch .. let's try adding it :)  "
1316,Crop rotation: by season instead of by year?,"I have 3 raised beds in a small 30 m2 greenhouse, this is the first year I have it so I don't have much experience. I've been reading about crop rotation, and was wondering why you can't or shouldn't plant the same crop every year. Can't you just rotate the crop each season?  For example, in one bed, I have 16 plants of tomatoes, plus some radishes and arugula in another row that I didn't harvest so I can get some seeds. Lets say when the plants stop producing and start dying, I plant (just an example) some onions, garlic, or whatever would grow well here in the autumn/winter season (pretty dry but not too cold).  I would also add a few cubic meters of compost before spring. And btw, the raised beds are on top of the native soil. I made the retaining walls with wood and filled them with the same soil I got from leveling the terrain, plus about 1/5 of compost. There's no separation or insulation on the bottom.  Wouldn't this already help produce a healthier/more fertile soil since I already rotated the crops on winter plus amended the soil with compost?  I'm asking this because the tomatoes bed seems to be perfect for them. They are growing so big and have a lot of fruit, the other two beds receive a bit more shade so I don't want to end up with a bad tomatoes crop next year if I move them to a different location. "
1317,How to replant bamboo/water based plants,"I have had a bamboo for several years in this tiny glass pot. It has grown very much, but its time to move her to a bigger home. But how? the pot she was brought home in was large at the bottom and narrow at the top. How do I remove her without ripping her roots to shreds? I would prefer not to break the glass.  Also, what else should I be aware of when transferring a water based plant. This is unfamiliar territory. How should general care differ from soil based plants?  This picture should illustrate the trouble I am having removing the bamboo from its original pot.  "
1318,How do I bake weeds out of my landscaping?,"I've got a rock area around the back of my house that is getting overrun by weeds.  The reason the weeds are able to grow there is because the weed barrier has shifted some so there are gaps between some of the sheets, there are holes in it, and some soil has settled on top of the barrier and underneath the rocks.  I'm thinking that I'd like to replace the weed barrier to ultimately keep this under control, but I'd like to kill off any weeds that are there first before moving the rock and laying the barrier.  I've tried using Round-Up, but the weeds will usually come back within a few weeks.  I've also tried to pull them to keep them under control, but that's getting tiring.  I was thinking, since nothing is supposed to be growing there anyways, what if I just bake them out?  How would I go about doing this and what supplies should I pick up for this? "
1319,Fraser fir Christmas tree doesn't seem to be soaking up water any more,"When we got our Christmas tree, which the farm called a Fraser fir, we were told to give it warm-to-hot water, and to ensure that the water line stayed above the bottom (cut) end of the tree. Otherwise, it might sap over and prevent the tree from soaking up more water. We did that while we were here, but we were away for four days last weekend, and despite filling the basin to the brim, it was empty by the time we got home. We refilled it, and it’s been 24 hours without any change to the water line, where previously it was soaking up a substantial portion of the water every day.  The tree itself still seems fine, with only a light scattering of needles on the floor under it and the ones on the tree itself still seeming healthy and flexible, not dried out and brittle. Presumably that’s just due to all the water it had already soaked up.  Is there anything we can do about this situation? I don’t have the equipment in my apartment to saw a new cut on the bottom of the tree (nor do I much like the idea of taking all the ornaments off so that I could do that), but it seems likely there isn’t much else to be done about it. Am I missing any easier steps that might help? Ultimately, we’d like the tree to remain fresh and healthy through New Year’s at a minimum, since we’re hosting a New Year’s Eve party, but we certainly wouldn’t mind our tree lasting beyond that. "
1320,Echeveria black prince leaves getting soft,"I bought this echeveria about two and half weeks ago from a local nursery. I watered it twice last week. Normally i would water it once a week. Since the time i watered it the bottom leaves feel very soft and slightly mushy. Can you tell me what to do to make sure it doesn't die? I dont see any new growth and when i repotted it i found a few very tiny mealy bugs in the roots. What can i do to get rid of them? I thought of dipping the roots in soap water but given that it's suffering from over watering already, it didn't seem ideal to do that.  I've placed it in direct sun for 4days now hoping it would help the leaves become normal again. Also, how do i clean the leaves? They have some dirt stuck to them.  "
1321,Caring for Edelweiss (suddenly started withering),"I recently bought a pot of Edelweiss in central Switzerland, in a village at an elevation of ~600m. The plant was looking healthy enough and was one of about a dozen pots ligned up outside the shop in the heat and dust and sun. They didn't look like they were taken particularly good care of, nor like they needed it.  I brought the plant back to Zürich, where I live (on the Sonnenberg, at about 540m above sea level). The plant looked undisturbed after the drive home.   Day1: The evening I got back I watered it the tiniest bit, and put it in front of the window so it would get a lot of sun. The next day was hot (~32°C) and sunny, and I went out, and when I came back it was absolutley shriveled. Night1: I got scared and figured low turgor means too little water, and thus watered it a lot (and afterwards read online that you should not water it too much...) still, overnight the plant recovered quite a bit. Afterwards I added some chalk to the earth - having read online that Edelweiss likes chalk. Day2: The next day I decided that maybe it needed more fresh air so I put it outside in a sunny spot. It was hot (~30°C) and sunny again, and again when I came back the plant was all shriveled. Night2: I decided to see if it recoveres at night if I do not water it, which it did (albeit somewhat less than the first time over). Day3: I decided maybe too much sun isn't good for it after all (though all I read seemed to suggest the opposite) so I tried to put it in a sunny, but somewhat less exposed spot which gets shade in the evening. Fortunately (or so I thought) today was also a bit cooler (25°C) and cloudier. Aaaaand when I came back the plant was more shriveled than ever, and a few leaves started turning yellow and brittle.   I'm at a loss, the only obvious conclusions atm seem that Edelweiss is either a nocturnal plant :D or that it was befallen by some misterious malady unrelated to the way I keep it :-/  Come on, this is a plant that grows somewhere on some cliffs where it gets scorching sun during the day, really cold during the night, and the occasional torrent of rain, plus, this particular one lived on some street for a while (and God knows where before that). How could my subalpine front yard have killed it? Do you have any suggestions what I could do?  Pictures:     "

1323,Why aren't my fruit/nut trees flowering?,"I live in zone 8/9 in northern FL and I have the following fruit/nut trees:   2 Pecans 2 Meyor Lemons 2 Peach trees (uncertain of variety) 1 Black Mission fig   Most of the trees have been planted for between 2 to 4 years, and they are all about that young.  None of these trees have ever significantly flowered.  The peach trees kind of flower, but the flowers fall after about 2 days.  The trees themselves have all grown and flourished, and what's more is that all of them (except the pecans) were blooming when I bought them.  What time of year should these trees flower? I thought the pecans (which are about 4 years old) should start flowering right now so you get a winter harvest.  Are all these trees too young?  EDIT  Talking to my dad last night, he thought it notworthy that the pecan trees grew their stamens every March/April... He said that those grape cluster looking clumps should have turned into pecans throughout the summer... On my trees though, they both just fall off after a few weeks. "
1324,Is it too late for my under-sized leeks to fatten up?,"If you want that very welcome leek crop in mid-winter, you have to start thinking about them early on in the spring growing season. They're such a long time in the ground. Well, I got mine in on time but I've been neglecting them ever since. Next door's chickens paid a visit and damaged some patches of leek seedlings so I threw in some optimistic late sowings to fill in the gaps. Later some thinning was required but I left it rather late.  The result is a row of leeks which range from OK to severely undersized (some less than 0.5cm, many less than 1cm). Is it too late (mid-August) now for these feeble looking plants to swell up in time for a winter crop?   And when exactly do leeks slow down and stop swelling? At what point later on this year should I stop looking for progress and just be happy what I've got? "

1327,How do I prevent my berry leaves from getting scorched in the sun?,"Raspberries are plants that require good exposure to sun. However, my black-raspberry plant has been getting scorched of late. Typical signs of sun-scorching are when the older leaves start drying out (see photo), turning brown and papery (crumbles if you press). The new leaves are unaffected though.   I live in San Diego, and the weather here over the past two months has been between 65 and 75 F (and will remain the same until December). The plants get about 8-10 hours of sun everyday. In short, it's heaven for humans, but not for my raspberry plant.  Firstly, am I even right in diagnosing this as sun-scorching? If so, how can I prevent it? The obvious option would be to move it to a place with more shade. However, I'd rather wait till Jan-Feb when it'll be dormant, to move the plant. An alternate would be to cover it with a black netting that cuts the sunlight, yet allows it to breathe. However, I don't have much experience with these. What are my options given the constraints?    "

1335,What to do with tomatillo and chilli plants in winter?,"First time gardener here. This year I decided to grow some tomatillos and mexican chillies in my garden. Although it was some hard work I also had a good harvest (for my first time) and fun overall. Now winter is coming and my plants are dying. I already knew that this type of plants can't stand cold weather, so I knew this day would come. Last year we were around 2-5 degrees C during winter everyday (but no frost) and under 10 C until about April, I expect this year will be the same. My question now is, what do I do with my plants?  They have lost a lot of leaves, but they actually don't look that bad (to my untrained eye). Should I just cut down whatever is remaining of them and take them to composting somewhere? I feel kinda bad because they still look alive.  Next year I want to plant again, but cut down in numbers. This year I had 10 tomatillos plants, and about 20 chilli plants. I didn't think all of them would surive (first time gardening) so I planted a lot. It turns out they did all survive!. I don't have as much time anymore to take care of them and I am frequently out of town. Next year I think I only want to keep 3+6 plants maybe. Also, I'm not really wanting to get into composting. I'm ok with taking them somewhere, or have them collected, for someone else to compost.  Also, although I do have an actual garden, I used growbags for all of my plants. What do I do with the soil? If I cut down the plants, is it ok to just spread it around the garden? We are talking about 21 growbags that can fit 3 plants each, so that's a lot of soil, I think. I don't suppose it's healthy to reuse that for next year, right?  Sorry about the long post. In summary: what do I do with my plants (and soil) now that winter is coming and they are dying? Pics attached in summer and today for reference  Many thanks!     "
1336,What can be done with hazelnut shells?,I've found a lot of empty and broken hazelnut shells lying under huge hazelnut shrub. (Most of them were eaten by squirrels but some have worm holes).

1337,Multiple Cast Iron Plant rhizomes (Aspidistra Elatior) in same pot?,"I've recently just purchased some Cast Iron plants (aspidistra elatior) from an online vendor. They were shipped bare-root and I've just planted them. I intended to have two plants to go in my apartment's living room.  What I failed to realize, being somewhat new to house plants and having a brown thumb, is that while the plants shipped as two separate root balls with leaves, each root ball was actually a combination of plants. So, I think that I may have planted two or three plants (two or three root systems) in each pot. (Apparently, Cast Iron plants propagate using rhizomes; it looks as though a few of these were placed in the same package.)  I only need two plants, and I've only just completed the potting task (and I gave the plants a little water, so the soil is now wet). I wanted the plants to look full, but I don't want them to suffer. Question - will the plants survive as they are, or should I remove the plants, separate them, and repot all of them separately?  Thanks!  Edit: I've added a picture of one of the plants, here (Google Drive link): [website]"

1339,What should I do if the soil shrinks and separates from the flowerpot walls?,"Recently we relocated a cactus into a new flowerpot. When it was planted the soil would evenly occupy the flowerpot and adjoin the flowerpot side walls. The soil isn't cactus soil, but just regular soil that we bought from a local shop.  Now the soil shrank, formed a stiff cylinder and that cylinder no longer adjoins the flowerpot side walls - there's about 10 millimeters of air on one side of the soil cylinder and the other side seems to have slanted onto the pot side wall.  The cactus looks just fine.  Is that a problem? How do I address it? Do I loosen the soil or should I just leave it untouched? "
1340,Where does the carbon that makes up a plant come from?,I have had this question throughout the time that I have been gardening. Where exactly does the carbon that goes into the plant structure? Is it like the nitrogen cycle? Does it come from the air? Is it from the ground? Is it a combination? I recently saw a presentation on soil where the roots go between the soil particles. Does it get some carbon there? 
1341,How long would a typical Everstart 12v lawn and garden battery last?,"I'm using a 12v Everstart battery to power some speakers, I had wondered how often should I be expected to charge it? Same with my actual mower, my old craftsman doesn't have an alternator to recharge the battery while running, and that's a similar Everstart as well.  Also would anyone know how well these Lead-Acid batteries handle constant fairly slow drains for a few hours at a time? Should I consider a float charger or some other type of lead acid battery charger for the speaker battery to be on?  Thanks in advance. "
1342,"Returning a garden paved for 30 years with packed clay below, back to lawn","My new rear garden has had concrete slab paving for decades, resting on heavily packed and deep London Clay soil and a small amount of odd rubble. The paved area measures about 6x7m. The soil under the slabs is solid with weed roots, even where there's been no light for many years, and weeds (of all kinds) come up between the slabs continually.   I want to convert the paved area back to a nice garden and grass. The options I have heard about are:   Bulk replacement: excavate existing area some inches down, remove old rubble/soil/weeds, bring in new topsoil, compact a bit, lay new turf or seed. Concerns - Guaranteed success, straightforward, completed quickly, but probably quite costly as work on this scale probably would need mechanical hire and grabber removal. Remove paving only (much less bulk), break up packed soil some inches down, sift manually for weeds, mix in compost/whatever, compact a bit, lay turf/seed. Concerns - no idea how much work involved and time required (might drag on a long time), soil may end up poor condition than if new good soil was introduced and need regular prevention against deteriorating, and introducing new soil implies bulk removal and cost as above so will there be any net benefit compared to the 1st solution.   I haven't had to do garden landscaping on this scale before and have no idea what I would actually have to do, nor the amount or work and cost and any practicalities involved, nor what mechanical equipment might exist could offer trade-offs between time, cost, final quality, and physical effort. I am open to hiring a contractor but will probably end up doing it myself, especially if a contractor would add a lot to the bill as expected.  I don't expect sorting it out to be cheap, but I would like to feel once it's done, it mostly stays done (other than annual maintenance) and is ""low maintenance"". For example, if it will help that the soil drains well, or retains water and nutrients, I'd prefer to ensure the soil the turf grows on actually has those characteristics for at least some of its depth, instead of needing to be ""propped up"" each year. I'd also like to ensure that any depth I work to is sufficient for the soil to retain water and nutrients enough for the grass to cope with future hot summers (ie if I only sort out the top 3 inches will there be issues with drying out/nutrients washing out). I'd like to ""do it once and do it properly"" as we hope to enjoy it for a long time to come.  The house is a terrace property so the only access to the garden is through or over the house itself. Large scale material movement would involve renting a conveyor, a narrow mobile digger, or at an extreme I could hire a mobile crane and hoist bulk material over the property roof (all of which could be acceptable options). Because of the residential neighbourhood and the terrace nature of the house, I'm doubtful that large scale manure and similar material (or chickens!) would be a good idea socially :-)  I need to dig up and remove about 15-18 cu.m. of packed soil and rubble and get it to the front and taken away, to get the basic ground level nearer the back of the house as I want it, so heavy bulk moving of material is already going to happen to some extent. I haven't yet decided how this will be done so that's open to being combined with the return of the paved area to turf.  Naturally I'd like to minimise effort or cost. How much work is actually involved and how deep do I have to work? What are the options I should consider and how do they stand regarding time, money, effort and final quality?  Update  The garden is mostly exposed (a few smallish trees, no overarching shade). It's north facing but raised (the house has a cutaway as it was on a hillside) so it doesn't get much shade from being behind the house. There will be beds and planting in places, and there's a small ""island"" in the middle (maybe 8 ft across) which has some small shrubs/trees and that will stay, but I'd like to put the bulk of the paved area back to turf. Below the paving seems to be almost entirely compacted soil and stone, any concrete or rubble layer I do find anywhere, when I get going, I can deal with. The pics show some of the area where a little paving has been lifted.  The garden is about 3m of extension + 11m of paved area (almost all raised behind the small retaining wall). The overall plan is to level the first 2.5m of that paved area level to the back door of the house so that the when it's done, the garden is ""split level"" - the first 2.5m (about 1/4) of the current paved area ""behind"" the retaining wall"" is dug away and level with the back door, the current retaining wall is removed, and a new retaining wall (or gentle grass bank) replaces it, about 2.5m down the garden.  About 6m of the remaining elevated 8.5m of the paved area will be mainly grassed apart from about 2.5m at the very back which will be left as-is (shed etc). The 2.5m that is at the same level as the back door will have about 50% new paving for a small rear patio, and the other 50% grassed like the rear part. So the final garden will be about 2.5m lower level (50% grass, 50% patio) + retaining wall or grass bank + 6m elevated (grass apart from the 8ft island) + 2.5m left as-is. Plant beds and so on will largely stay where they are but might be reworked or improved later, but for now I'm hoping to sort out the turfing and landscaping, not the beds. I am reckoning I might have to lower the surface level a bit to lay more topsoil, but don't know if this is necessary or not. I'm not tied to any especial ground level so if the level rises by a few inches that's not an issue.  Photos (including 1 of the paved area with most weeds cleared-for now anyway) "
1343,Can I use a horizontal 2x4 to brace a 3 wire trellis?,"In brief - I want to use a 2x4 to resist the tension put on trellis posts ~16ft apart, rather than the other two options.  I'm building a grape trellis with upright 4x4s connected by high tensile wire. As with any wire setup, like a long wire fence, you usually need to brace the ends to avoid leaning. I'm wondering if I can run a 16ft 2x4 between the posts at the top, using brace pins to attach to the posts. This 2x4 wont really hold any load, as that will be held by the high tensile wire. The 2x4 is only there to resist the tension force that the wire puts on the main 4x4 posts, turning it into a compressive force on the 2x4.  Can that 2x4x16 even make that span given it's own load? And if so, is that compressive force (it should be straight and level) going to force it to sag?  FWIW this is really to avoid the other two options - 1) angle the posts at 60deg so the tension forces the posts into the ground, or 2) build large H braces on the ends. "
1344,Increase chances of good fruit from seed propagation,"I understand that propagation by seed does not produce trees that resemble its parent. However, I am forced to propagate by seed some rare fruit that are prohibitively expensive to ship to my home. How would I increase the likelihood that a seed would produce good fruit?   Do seeds from sweet fruit have a higher chance of also producing sweet fruit? Or is there no correlation? Are there any visual characteristics of a seed (size, color) that make predict how good the fruit will be?  "
1345,How and for how long can home-grown onions be stored?,"How should I prepare home-grown white or yellow onions for long-term storage?  This answer says the ideal conditions for storing onion sets for re-planting and storing mature onions is the same, but it doesn't mention some important details I have questions about.   Should I cut the tops off so they look like they do in the store, or leave them on? Should I remove any of the papery outside layers, for example if they are damaged or covered in dirt I can't easily remove? I live in a hot climate so there are no cool locations below room temperature except the refrigerator or freezer. Is a fridge well ventilated enough and does it have low enough humidity for long-term storage? Can I store onions in the freezer? Do they need to be somehow cured or prepared after harvesting but before storing? Is there anything better than a mesh bag? For example, I've read that some people wrap them in foil.   Given ideal storage, how long can I expect my onions to last, and is there a way to tell if they're about to go bad so I can use or dehydrate them? "
1346,How do I change the color of my hydrangea flowers?,"So, I've heard that people sometimes mix a bit of lemon juice in when they water blue hydrangeas, they say it keeps them blue if the soil is lacking in acid. I was wondering, I have a pink indoor hydrangea plant; would it be possible to alter the color by putting the lemon juice in? Would it possibly make it blue in time, or purple?  "
1347,What kind of tree is this and what should I do with it?,"A tree in my yard looks like it's dying.  A friend said that I can simply cut off the side that is dying and see if the rest of it lives.  However, some of the branches on the ""living"" side seem to be dying, but there are some portions that look like new growth.  Almost all of the bark has come off of the dead side.  The bark doesn't appear to be coming off anywhere else except where some of the branches have died on the living side.    I live in the United States, Omaha, Nebraska. The pictures below were taken 11/1/2017.  It's fall here and the leaves are falling off the trees fast.  I did my best to take a picture of the full tree, the bark and the leaves. Let me know if I can provide any other information.    What kind of tree is this and what should I do about it?  Is it time to cut it down, or is there a chance of it still living if the dead part is removed?       "
1348,Why do landscapers constantly play with the throttle on a leaf blower?,"I live in a condo complex which employs a professional landscaping service to take care of garden area around the house. They all use equipment that is powered by two-stroke engines: leaf blowers, chain saws, hedge trimmers, lawnmowers, lawn edge trimmers.  With the leaf blowers and lawn edge trimmers they constantly play with the throttle, going between maximum and idle. I don't understand this really, is it impossible to hold them at half throttle?  The sound of the two-stroke engine itself is annoying, but the change in the throttle makes the sound really hard to ignore. What is the motivation for using those devices this way? "
1349,What's the best way to utilise chicken manure?,We have a few chickens. They produce a small but steady supply of manure. As I understand it chicken manure is an excellent fertiliser. What's the optimum way to utilise it in the garden?   Is it best to add the chicken manure to our general compost or is there a particular part of the garden where its application is especially valuable in concentrated form? 
1350,Trailing vinca....sap?,"I brought some trailing vinca cuttings indoors to hang around the apartment. Very pretty — but I just discovered a sticky (ew) spot on the furniture and carpet under the hanging vines.  The leaves are covered in what looks like a misting of water, but which is very sticky and saplike in consistency.  Is this normal/healthy? (With whom do I lodge a complaint about a poorly designed plant?) The plants are otherwise very happy-looking.  PS: The only information I can find about vinca sap is that it's likely poisonous. So I guess I won't lick my plant.     "
1351,Should I account for seasons when growing inside only?,"My indoor plants are fairly disconnected from the outside: the temperature and humidity are controlled and they are under strong artificial lights 18h/day.   Should in any way care about seasons? For instance, my fertilizer says to apply twice per month during the growth season. Do I have a perpetual growth season or do plants take a break by themselves anyway? (Alternatively, do they need one?)   In case it matters, I'm growing right now: basil, chives, mint, sage, mango (1' high), avocado (1' high), a few houseplants, tomatoes (seedling), lavender (seedling), cosmos (seedling). "
1352,What are the benefits of dethatching your lawn?,I have St. Augustine grass. What exactly is the process of dethatching? This question went into a brief discussion regarding dethatching.   Are there benefits to dethatching? When is the latest time of the year to dethatch one's lawn? 
1353,Should I remove fruits afflicted with blossom end rot?,"A few of my peppers are, it seems, suffering blossom end rot - first identified a week or two ago - this is based on the descriptions on the condition elsewhere on the site, but here's a few pics to help confirm:      From what I read on here, and in other locations on the web, the afflicted fruits can't be ""cured"" of this state; any damage done is permanent. So:   Is an afflicted fruit ever salvageable (for the purposes of being eaten)? Should I be removing afflicted fruit from the plant as soon as the condition is noticed? Or should I wait for a certain level of severity before acting? Or maybe there is some obscure benefit to leaving the fruit on the plant?  "
1354,What are the ideal germination conditions for herbs and leafy greens?,"I'm new to home gardening. I just bought Sustainable Seed Company's Herb Collection (Basil, Chives, Cilantro, Dill, Lavender, Oregano, Parsley, Rosemary, Sage, Thyme) and Mountain Valley Seed Company's Leafy Green Collection (Kale, Lettuce, Arugula, Chard, Spinach). The herb planting guide that comes with the seeds recommends the paper towel method to test the germination of the seeds. It also says,      ""[Seeds] are widely variable. For example, lettuce need a temperature   between 65-80°F and a good quantity of light to germinate, while   peppers or other warm season crops need temperatures between 75-85°F   or higher to germinate, and squash, melons, and cucumbers like the   paper towel to be a little drier. Do a little research on the crop and   the ideal germination conditions before starting.""   As I understand, the germination conditions they're referring to are: moisture, temperature, lighting, and airflow. Am I missing any? Does pH or other properties of the water impact germination?  Is there a table or other resource, where I can look up all these ""ideal germination conditions""? The seed packets themselves give some - but not all - of this information. I'm a scientist by training, and I'd like to minimize the time it takes to germinate these seeds. "
1355,What is the white residue spreading across my dracaena and how do I treat it?,I have a white residue spreading across my dracaena at home. I tried wiping it with wet sponge when it was on one leaf only but its come back and spreading across now 50% of the plant. Some of the leaves are turning brown as well. The white residue doesn't move to naked eye. When I looked through jewellers loop they look like grains of rice. Soil looks clear - but they are on the stem as well as leaves. Please help! Can I save this plant? Should I cut off any browned leaves?     
1356,Why doesn't onion bulb sprout?,"Usually when my store bought onions starts to sprout, I plant them in a plastic container filled with water and get some green onion.  This time I decided not to wait until onion starts to sprout. I chose quite a large onion bulb and put it into a plastic container filled with water.  I keep water level just below the bulb, so that roots are submerged, but the bulb itself is above the water.  After quite some time (about two or three weeks) it started producing roots. Lot's of them.  After another few weeks I've noticed that the onion bulb itself has elongated a bit towards water. Obviously there's some ""growing"" happening.  So, lot's of roots, change in size, but no sprouts.  Why?  Could it be something to do with the onion bulb being very large? Or is there not enough humidity and warmth to start sprouting? Or perhaps the season is wrong (planted around October, and it's January now)? Or something else? "
1357,Cabbage leaves closed,"A cabbage plant on my pot seems to have formed a head, however I am not able to see the head completely as the cabbage leaves have converged and closed themselves towards the head and is very much tightly stuck inwards.  I am afraid to open the leaves by force to see the head. I suspect that the plant is dead?  I shall post a picture later, but can someone help me whether is this normal or the cabbage has any disease?  Thanks for any help on this issue. "
1358,Are mondevilla adequate to cover balcony?,"We have a small balcony that’s covered with a metal grid (something like this balcony). We want to cover it with a vine, and the end result  is something like this.  I was thinking of buying a mondevilla plant for that purpose. I’ve gone to many home depots, plus a few nurseries, and nobody has anything for this purpose, and I just noticed that our local supermarket brought two mondevilla plants.  What do you think? Would it work? This is the actual mondevila plant that I would buy. "
1359,"Two grafts needed for weeping mulberry - is it true, and why?","I bought two weeping mulberries this year, and I am really excited about them (see pic).  However, something confuses me. The person I bought them from says that each weeping mulberry (at least those that she sells) requires two grafts: one at the bottom, and one at the top.  Is that true?  And, if yes, why is that?  (I can't visually confirm that, all grafts are done so that they are almost not noticeable. I know though that unwanted shoots from the middle of the trunk have different leaves than those in the weeping crown.)   "
1360,How to fill low spots over existing grass in my yard?,"I read this question and it made me think of what I need to do this weekend. But I have these questions:   If I've got a few holes - maybe a place where a bush was dug out and the ground eventually settled and every time I mow over it I scalp the lawn - how do I go about spreading the fill over the lawn?   Do I need to reseed the grass, or will the grass underneath poke through eventually?   If it will just kill the grass beneath, should I work up the existing soil with a pitchfork or something?  Could I rip the sod out, tuck some dirt underneath and return the sod to it's newly elevated location?  "

1362,Why is my plant turning white/yellow,"It’s winter here in Quebec city, and I feel like my plant is slowly dying. At first I thought it lacked sun, do I putted it on the windows border, but the furnace in just below so it might have dry hot air coming towards it. At least it has the sun now.   Is it a symptom of dry air? or lack of sun? what can I do to revert the dying process here   "
1363,Why remove dead leaves from plants?,What reasons are there to remove dead leaves from plants? Does plant type or indoor vs. outdoor change the important of removing dead leaves?  People says it's the correct thing to do. Searching google only returns pages about how to do it and not why it's done.  I'm particularly interested in any research. I find too many anecdotes are used when it comes to questions like this. 
1364,How to deal with a blueberry bush putting off unusually large-leaved branches,"I have an issue with my 2nd year blueberry bush. I purchased this ""Blue Jay"" (I think) variety of blueberry bush two years ago and it has fruited satisfactorily both years. However, it's now sending up much larger-leaved ""suckers"". Am I looking at a possible grafted variety? Should I cut back the suckers? (They all appear to derive from under the soil). The suckers aren't flowering but I wouldn't expect them to anyways since they came up after the smaller leaved bush finished its fruits. I'm new to Vaccinium culture, would love some advice.     Update: it seems that you were correct. I dug up the bush and found an entangled root system of 2 clearly different species. I didn't think blueberries were grafted but these shoots did have the same aggressive nature as suckers that appear from below ground with other grafted plants. After careful separation, I now have a perfectly happy blueberry bush and what I believe to be some sort of Salix. Thanks everyone!   "
1365,Growing and planting a beautyberry tree from seed,I recently collected some beautyberry seeds from a neighbouring tree. How long does it usually take to see the seeds germinate? What is the recommended age and process for moving the new growth into the garden? 
1366,Planting magnolia tree a little 'high',"I bought a Magnolia grandiflora in a 100 Litre container. It needs to sit tightly next to a fence, with intent to block a neighbouring property. Now, here is the problem... The tree is 2m tall, but blocking the neighbour requires closer to 3m.   This is a slow growing tree, and I want my privacy sooner rather than later.   What problem would I have if I plant the tree just a tad high -- i.e. I put it into a hole in the ground, which is, say, only 1.5m deep? Does anything change if I put a 0.5m frame around it (it's next to a deck, so I don't want lots of additional dirt in the area).  ------ Additional info ------  The Magnolia is a 'Kay Paris'. To add complication, I have clay soil, which I believe isn't ideal for this tree (happy to be corrected). I still want it very close to the fence, a bit less than a foot. I am happy to water it regularly, and I suspect it may even work despite a 'rain shadow', as clay tends to hold moisture. But at such short distance from fence, the rear branches will be squashed a bit tightly, at least for a year until I cut them. So... will this work? "

1368,Can I overwinter a banana tree on an unheated sun porch?,"Can I overwinter a banana tree that is growing in a container in an unheated sun porch in zone 5?  Do I cut it back, water it just enough to keep it from drying? Should it be exposed to light? Would it help to mulch the roots in the pot in case it gets below 30 degrees?  The porch is unheated and the temperature may drop to the 30's. "
1369,Whats wrong with my Basil sapling?,"I live in Pune, India. The weather these days is like Temp: 15 to 30 deg C, Humidity: 30 to 60%. The sapling bought from a local nursery a month ago, the plant is kept in the shade. We water regularly, and There was no overuse of fertilizer or manure. The transplant was done by the gardener, so I think its safe to say that roots weren't damaged either.  What could be the issue? What do I do?   "
1370,Whats wrong with our two Jasmine Plants," We bought these two grown Jasmine plants 2 months ago when they had a few flowers and healthy green leaves. But now it looks like they are afflicted with some disease.  We live in Pune, India. The weather these days is like Temp: 15 to 30 deg C, Humidity: 30 to 60%. The plants have been watered regularly. They were kept outside in a place which gets diffused sunlight (shade of the apartment building) most of the day. The plants were potted by a professional, so I am thinking that he would have taken care of the roots while transplanting. We did not add anything to the plants other than watering during the last 2 months.  What could be the issue? What should I do?  PS: Yesterday, after 2 months, we added some fertilizer granules and manure yesterday and moved them to an area which receives ample direct sunlight for a longer duration. Will that help?  PPS: The plant seems to be of the species Nyctanthes elongata (a.k.a. Jasminum elongatum. Here is a photo from happier times.  "

1372,Feeding Tomatoes via an irrigation system,"OK, so I have set up my greenhouse with growbags and an irrigation system, and am having good results with growing several varieties of tomatoes and chilies. I'd prefer to automate the feeding of my plants though, so am considering adding a Venturi injector onto the main feed lines so that I can add feed directly via the drippers.  I'd like to know:   Is mixing Tomorite with every watering a reasonable idea or beyond stupid? If it is reasonable, how should I adjust the amount of feed? The bottle says 4.5 liters + 20ml of feed per bag, twice a week, but for continuous feeding, I'm assuming I'd need to set the feed amount to some ratio that's much more dilute. Has anyone done this and had success or problems?   ADDENDUM  I received a reply from the manufacturer:     Thank you for your email regarding Levington Tomorite.      As yet we have not tested this product with automatic irrigation systems so cannot offer any advice. Continuous feeding can lead to a build up of ""salts"" in the compost which can harm plants if not flushed through with clean water on a regular basis.   So to be on the safe side, rather than add a weak solution to the drip feeder, I'm going to opt to leave them unfed during my time away.  "
1373,How can I move large amounts of soil without a wheelbarrow?,"We source compost/soil/mulch etc. in two forms: bulk and bagged. We typically use bagged when there is limited access to the areas to which we need to apply materials. I would love an efficient alternative for two reasons. First, the bagged material is several to many times the cost of the bulk materials. Second, I hate to see all the plastic bags go to the dumpster/landfill/wherever.  Is there a device, garment, container, or contraption that would allow 1 or 2 guys to carry as much loose soil as they would be able to carry bagged - Say 2-3 cubic feet per person?   Edit: We get bulk compost in 1.25 cubic yard totes that have sling handles can be lifted with a forklift. Is there such a thing as a mini version of this? If so, please provide source. "

1375,Garden Grass/Lawn Mould Identification,"We have a standard grass lawn and in true British style got a paddling pool out a month too early. The pool got infested with mosquito larvae so we drained it (not into the garden) and got rid of the pool.   When we removed it we found that mould(?) had grown where the pool had been. It's definitely got two different areas of colour. After a couple of days these holes also appeared, I'm assuming it could be from birds. Any idea what this is and what we should do? "
1376,Artificial Lighting for Growing Seedlings,"I'm attempting to grow Curcubits and Nightshades (for eating) indoors (in the middle of winter).   I recently acquired a  (Red/Blue LED 120 watt) grow lamp - but my calculations are that it will eat a lot of electricity for the number of seedlings it will produce.  [ I'm growing everything in a 60cm x 40cm x 35cm high with my lamp situated about 10cm above the lid ]    Am I better off having this light come on  intermittently throughout the day and night to provide warmth and heating, or have it on a timer - say 4 hours per day, and rely on heating from a heat pad (actually a heating blanket under my plastic growing chamber) ?  (Unless it is not practical to avoid it, I would prefer not to leave the light on for 12 hours per day as it seems it will eat quite a lot of power)  I guess a third option would be to remove the heat pad and rely on the Light, but I think this would be inefficient for heating.   Does anyone have any ideas how best to optimise the setup of my ""growing container"" ? "
1377,New turf left to grow too long - how best to fix?,"I recently made a small (approx 7-8 sqm) lawn by laying topsoil and then turf.  It took hold nicely however I left it far too long before mowing and now have a problem!  I currently have a manual cylinder mower with is no good for the long grass (it jams and tears at the grass) and a strimmer which is also no good, I intended to cut it short enough to use the mower with this but it just flattens the grass (like crop circles) and does not cut it well.  As the grass has grown long, when short it does not look nice - yellowish and a bit sparse in places with small bare muddy areas.  What is the best way to fix this? I assume I can borrow a powered mower to get the grass short, then sprinkle seed to fix the worst of the bare patches, then just wait and it will fix itself as it is still fairly new (couple of months) good quality turf. Is that correct?  Is there more to it?  Does the type of mower matter?  I was thinking a small hover mower would be the easiest in my small awkward garden but not sure if that's best for the grass or if it matters at all.  Thank you :) "
1378,How to identify real holy basil?,"I need help identifying some plants.   Unknown Basil 1   Unknown Basil 2   Potential Holy Basil 1   Potential Holy Basil 2  I purchased these two types of basil online. They both claim to be holy basil but they are clearly two different types.  I noticed that the basil in the blue container is not hairy, which means it cannot be holy basil as that is one of the characteristics.  The basil in the red container does have the hairy characteristic, but I am not sure if the leaves are the correct colour or if it is even a basil.  I had a look at two youtube videos, but it seems basil quickly cross-pollinates and thus Ocimum tenuiflorum may change quickly and become another species, but for most of the seeds to change, I am not so sure if that is possible. I would have thought cross-pollination only result in a few seeds changing rather than most or all of them.  [website][website]So, what plants am I actually growing?

1379,My reseeding lawn is turning yellow,I reseeded my lawn in early May with Scotts sun and shade grass seeds and Scotts turf builder starter 24-25-4. I did second feeding with the same fertilizer On July 2nd. The grass was growing nice until this couple of weeks it started to yellow. I am in the pacific northwest and the weather was not that nice this summer. We only have 3 or 4 sunny days. Mostly cloudy days mixed with some sun. There is also water restriction in my area. I water the lawn on Thursday and Sunday with about half an inch each time. Am I watering too much or the grass needs more nitrogen? Should I feed the lawn with Scotts turf builder 30-0-3? Thanks for your help.           
1380,How do electric tillers compare with gas powered ones?,"I have 6 raised beds filled with topsoil and compost, and am looking for a tiller. They total about 200 sq.ft. I see a lot of electric tillers on the market and wonder how they perform compared to gas tillers? They seem to be very inexpensive which I like but will they do the job? "
1381,Will a field system being dug near my Norway Spruce have any effect on it?,"My neighbors are having a field system dug for their septic system.  The digging is just beyond the edge of the drip line of my very tall, 60+ years old, Norway spruce.  Will my tree suffer any consequences of these trenches being dug?  We have had a very wet spring but the trenches were left open over night.  I am concerned that major roots could have been damaged or destroyed and that leaving the trenches open may cause dry out of any roots remaining. Could there be ramifications later? "
1382,How to propagate japanese maple from this street (mutant?) specimen?,"There is a neatly pruned japanese maple in a public area close to my work:    We had warmer than usual weather last several weeks, and new growth appeared:    It is hard to believe, but this new branch was not there three weeks ago:    Is it possible to cut these young branches, and get a similar maple elsewhere one day?  NOTE: Looking more carefully, it occurs to me that this may be some kind of reverse mutation, no? But even the 'reversed' version looks attractive to me. "
1383,How to save roses - commercially potted gift ones with few roots?,"I was given a pot of (flowering) roses which I actually like and would want to keep and plant in my garden.  In this tiny pot there are 4 plants; each one has only a few roots  as a quick inspection showed.  What would I need to do to save these?   I would try to pot on each plant, cut off all the flowers and buds. Anything else? Is it worth the effort? Will they survive at all?    "
1384,How to block line of sight while vines grow?,"Our garden backs onto a playing field for a school, with a ~15 foot chainlink fence separating the two. We have some vines growing up the fence, but they will likely take a few years to grow sufficiently to block someone seeing from the field into the garden and vice versa.  While we wait for the vines to grow, is there something nice-looking we can use to block line of sight from the field to our garden? The previous owner of the house used something like bamboo fencing to do it, but when we moved in it was a) ratty and horrible looking and b) had big holes in it anyway, so we took it down.  Is there something less offensive we can put up while we wait for the vines to cover the fence? We'd need something 20-30 feet long.  Thanks for your help. "
1385,What to do about grubs in vegetable garden and potted tree?,"This Spring there seem to be grubs all over my garden, in just about any handful of dirt you flip over. There are lots of articles about how to handle grubs in your lawn, but I don't have a lawn, just a vegetable garden.   (Left image is public domain from Wikipedia. Right is from my garden.)  I have a couple of raised beds, currently empty, where I'm planning on planting tomatoes and artichokes. Are grubs damaging to those plants? If so, what can I do about them?  I also have a half-barrel with a Valencia orange tree in it. The soil seems to be full of grubs. If I turn over a handful with a small trowel I find a grub about 1 in 3 tries. I don't want to dig down and risk harming the roots, so I can only see the grubs near the top. They never come above the soil, and I haven't seen any beetles on or near the tree. The tree seems to be doing fine, but I'm concerned. Will the grubs be a problem? What can I do about them without harming the tree? "
1386,Worried about personal health after dealing with houseplant potentially infected by fungus,"I've just pruned the leaves that have died off of my Dracaena Massangeana houseplant. I covered its ailments in two previous questions:    Dracaena leaves yellowing: too much water? Dracaena Massangeana: Leaf spots on new growth   The dead leaves came off very easily, and I reached the core of the stem where I saw what looked like white ""mold"" in small patches (roughly 3 mm in diameter) around the dead part of the stem.  At this point I put on gloves and moved my plant somewhere away from the other houseplants in my room in order to avoid contaminating them.  I am worried that being around and breathing the air potentially contaminated with whatever was growing and affected my plant may have adverse health effects on me.  Specifically, from researching the spots on my plant's leaves, one of the likely results was Fusarium Leaf Spot Disease. From another cursory search, it appears that fungus of the Fusarium genus may produce mycotoxin that is harmful or even lethal to humans.  I imagine it's hard to identify exactly what the growth on my houseplant was, but I want to be sure I am not harming my health as a result of having dealt with it in the same confined space where I spend much of my day and sleep.  I'm wondering:   Is there a risk of infection or general health risks for me after having dealt with this plant with bare hands and without any protection for my respiratory tract? Should I take action to prevent potential further complications, such as leaving my room or airing it thoroughly?  "
1387,Should I prune other veggies the same way I prune tomatoes?,"I just finished pruning the foliage on my tomato plants and am wondering if other plants in the garden would benefit from a similar trim?  In particular, my eggplant and peppers have very dense leaves and honestly, cutting the leaves back would help me keep track of how ripe the veggies are.  I don't want to hurt or stunt the plants though.  And what about other veggies?   "
1388,Please help me identify this houseplant,"I’ve had this plant for about two years and it grows so well in our sunny office window. I don’t know what it is and it’s getting tall that it droops. Should I be tying it up? Should I be trimming it? I’m sure it needs to be repotted but should I be waiting for spring?   Thank you in advance. I really try but I’m lost on this little plant. For reference, I live in Minnesota in zone 4b. "
1389,When to cut tip layered raspberry & blackberry,"I have some Raspberry and Blackberry plants I'm propagating by tip layering into new containers so I can give them to friends. The tips have been potted for at least 2 months, and now that a few baby leaves have poked their way up through the soil, I'm wondering if that means they have enough of a root system to stand strong on their own or if they still need to be attached to the mother plant for a little while longer? I don't want them sapping away energy from the mother plant if they can survive on their own...  When I do cut them, should I leave a decent length of the cane attached, or cut it at the soil line? Will it grow back out from the cut point as if it were a new cane of the daughter plant?    "
1390,Potted tulips are drying up,"This is the first time I bought tulip bulbs and I kept them inside, beside the window. Recently I got flowers. But, the flowers are there for only 2-3 days before they started drying up. Is this normal ? Or, am I doing something wrong ? "
1391,When should I transfer a pothos rooted in water to soil?,"I recently learned how to take clippings from a pothos plant and root it in water. I am quite new to this sort of gardening and have no idea when I should transfer it to soil. I can see tiny roots growing but I'm not sure how big they should be before I transfer it to soil. When should I plant them? How long should the roots be?  I didn't include a picture originally to try to keep the question general, but as requested here is a picture:  "
1392,Plants growth rate,"I'm making a  ""device"" to plant some vegetables, and I would find more than useful to know what growth/time equation plants follow. It is linear?, or do some plants growth exponentially?.  Not sure where to ask this question, any links will be appreciated.  Thanks! "
1393,How does the T budding grafting method provide contact between the cambium layers?,"In a T budding technique of grafting fruit trees, how does the cambium layer of the bud come into contact with the cambium layer of the rootstock?  How does this great method have such a high success rate if there is no direct contact between the cambium layers?  The upside down T method is usually more recommended.  Here is a great video that demonstrates this method.    This is the photo that I made that shows where I think there is contact between the cambium layers, let me know if I am correct or not:   "

1395,How well do dwarf tomatoes do with dry farming?,"I'm interested in trying to dry farming tomatoes in Western Washington, zone 8. We have got dry summers here.  I will probably try some dwarf varieties anyway, but am curious if anyone has thoughts. Are the root systems stunted, and thus have a harder time reaching deeper groundwater? Or will the lack of foliage help them minimize water requirements, and let them do better?  And, any recommendations for an indeterminate dwarf variety that would work well with dry farming? "
1396,What's the correct name for this raised tree bed?,"What's the correct name for this raised tree bed? This one was designed only for the tree. And it's not inside a garden, not even in a park, but at the corner of the street. Searching on Google I can find mostly raised garden beds that contain a tree and the flowers planted around them.  And what's the name of the raised beds used in the parks or on the street? Most of my search results are gardening raised beds.      Here are similar structures in Madrid.One of them:   "
1397,What's the best place to plant this grape vine?,"I purchased a grape vine plant from a nursery today, its called a vitis vinifera, or Flame Seedless. It seems fairly healthy and I would like to plant it now.  It is midsummer here in So. Cal and averages 80°F in the day. This plant was stored outdoors at the nursery (under shade-screen roof). Do I need to ""harden"" it before planting it in full sun, by bringing it in and out of the shade?  I am considering planting it up against that stone wall to the right of the raised bed planter, (see pics, full sun 8 hrs./day in summer, faces S.W.) and training it to trail along the fence; perhaps maybe a high trellis built out from the top of fence horizontally a couple feet. Does this seem to be a decent plan?  Rocky clay soil, I will mix in compost and a bit of sand when I plant.     "
1398,Discouraging voles from entering my compost bin,"I believe there are voles getting into my compost bin.  I am not putting kitchen waste in the bin but no cooked food or meat.  I can't prevent voles from getting into the compost bin, so my questions are: How can I discourage voles from getting attracted?  What type of food should I not put in the bin?  Are voles detrimental to the compost or will the compost still be usable in my organic vegetable garden?  Should I put tea leaves, banana peels, watermelon rind, etc in the compost bin or will that attract voles?  For the most part, this is a cold compost bin because I don't think I am able to heat it up naturally (that is a different issue). "
1399,How often do mower blades need to be sharpened?,"An important practice in toxin-free (and other) turf care is to only mow with sharp blades. So how often do I have to sharpen the blades?  I'm sure that it will depend on conditions, but is there some general guideline? Is it based on area mowed? Hours mowed? After so many months?  And are there industry standards that professionals follow? "
1400,"Mango seed growing, but not producing leaves","I planted a mango seed in a pot, after it germinated in a damp paper towel. It produced a stem, but has not done anything since for at least a month. Is it a faulty seed? Do I need to replant? Or is there something that can be done to rescue this seed? I live in Saskatchewan, so I realize that planting it outside is not an option, and it will likely never produce fruit.  Since this picture was taken in mid-March, the sprout has not grown at all. It still appears to be alive, but has not done anything. I believe it is getting sufficient sunlight. It sits in my window each day, and gets sunlight during the entire morning.

1401,Does a sprinkler or spray nozzle increase the PSI exerted on a garden hose?,"I am looking to buy some garden hoses and I want to be sure they will be strong enough to use with a sprinkler, spray nozzle, or drip irrigation system if I buy one in the future.  My water pressure at the faucet is 50 PSI. I've read that your hose burst pressure should be 4 times the expected working pressure. So that would mean a burst pressure of 200 PSI. I also read that if you're going to use a garden hose with a nozzle or a sprinkler, you want a burst pressure of at least 350 PSI. But I can't find anywhere else on the Internet that talks about this, so I'm wondering if this second article is just making a overgeneralization since some places might have a high faucet pressure and so they just picked a high PSI number just to be safe rather than trying to explain to people the aforementioned 4:1 ratio.  So my question is - do you really need such a high hose burst pressure for a sprinkler or nozzle? For example, might a sprinkler actually increase the PSI exerted on the hose - thereby making the working pressure on the hose higher than 50 PSI even if the water pressure coming into the system was only 50 PSI? Like might there be some designs that exert some sort of backpressure that increases PSI on the system to increase the distance water sprays?  Thanks for any insight you can provide. "

1404,Cut marks on pothos leaves,I have a golden pothos house plant and I have noticed certain cut marks on the leaves. What's the underlying cause? Is it due to a pest or some bacterial infection?   
1405,Which Fertilizer should I use for Coriander?,Which fertilizer should I use to grow larger leaves on coriander plants?  I have read this question - What could cause my coriander plant to start browning? Which talks about over water logged soil causing rotten roots that cause brown leaves. But it did not answer my question.  Thank you for any advice you may give. 
1406,What causes papaya leaves to curl up into weird shapes?,"One of my papaya trees has contracted this strange condition where the leaves are curling up into weird shapes.       I have many papaya trees, and this is the only one that is like this. I have watered this (and the other trees) with plenty of water. I have used compost soil and cow dung to fertilize them. It gets a fair amount of sunshine.  What is wrong with this tree? Is there anything I can do? "
1407,Relocated lime tree not doing well,"A friend of mine gave me well-established lime and lemon trees. They're about four years old, two or three feet tall. She's moving and can't take them with her. The lemon tree is doing relatively well: it's lost two leaves in the last ten days.  But the lime tree isn't doing well at all. It's dropped more than half its leaves. They seem fine, nicely green and healthy, but then just drop off. It has the same light conditions (we both have windows facing the same direction), and I'm watering it on the same schedule as she was.  Could the stress from the move (about ten blocks, walking) be causing this? How can I help it recover? I'd really like to see it healthy again. "
1408,How do I change the soil on already planted plants (not in pots),So my plants arent growing too well in my garden (as compared to my friends with the same plants I gave them) and was wondering how do I give my plants better soil? I've already mulched the surrounding areas. Can I just dump new soil at the base of the plant? I assume no since that doesnt reach the roots. Fertilizer perhaps? New to gardening and never used that either. 
1409,Any concerns on putting a garden bed over concrete?,"I would like to start a vegetable garden. The problem is I've planted so many fruit trees in the ground that there's no more room for vegetables. The only way I can start my vegetable garden is to place it over the concrete in my back yard. The natural choice for gardening on hard land would be elevated planters:    But these elevated planters are just so darn small and darn expensive (~ $200). On the other hand, normal garden beds are usually much bigger and cheaper. I'm considering getting this behemoth:    The problem with garden beds is that they don't have a bottom. What precautions, if any, should I take with the bottom if I were to put this garden bed over my concrete? Will drainage be poor? Will I need to cover the bottom with something? Do vegetable roots not like hitting into the concrete? "
1410,Is there any way to recover drooped/folded leaves?,"My snake plant is drooping because of the lack of sunlight. I'm going to revive it by moving the pot, but do I have to cut very folded/drooped leaves? They are bent from the middle of the leaf. Any way to recover those leaves without cutting them? I currently use a wood stand for keeping them upward. "
1411,Treating tree disease that manifests as warts/galls/bumps on leaves,"I am trying to identify cause of the problem we have with our tree and the best way to treat it. Here is the image showing the growth on the tree's leaves:    Is this cause for concern? We really want to preserve the tree as it's old and majestic and could spend money on professionals if this is treatable.  Also, is there anything we can do on our own? Fertilize tree? Spray at root? Basically any suggestion that will help long-term care of tree is welcome. "
1412,Nutritional value of home-compostable plastic?,"There are types of compostable plastic that you can compost yourself at home (as opposed to compostable plastic that can only be composted in industrial composting facilities). I was wondering if there would be any benefit in doing this, other than getting rid of the plastic?   If I understood correctly, during composting microorganisms consume the carbon in the plastic and produce mainly CO2 and water. I don't think there is any NPK in the plastic, so I suspect there is no benefit for plants. Is this true? Or do the microorganisms produce something else that is useful? "
1413,How can I fix these light spots in my lawn?,"In the picture below, you can hopefully see some lighter spots on my lawn, marked by yellow lines. Does anyone know why I have these? Do I need to fertilize more often? Is this a fungal infection? How can I restore my lawn to its green color?  Update: This is sod that was laid just this past August - J.B. Sod Oregon Premium. I fertilized 6 weeks after it was laid (Scott's terfbuilder without weed control) and again last weekend; second time with a fall fertilizer. I watered religiously.    "
1414,Can I plant heather under wisteria?,I have a young wisteria plant in a large wooden sided container in my sunken courtyard. It should get pretty good sun on the wall it's climbing.   Most wisteria info seems to say you can't grow ANYTHING underneath them as it will strangle them. How about heather?  If not any recommendations for ground cover that will grow under wisteria in a container?  Thanks.

1416,Planting and landscaping around a grave,"This is a graveyard in South Asia. My goal is to grow some plants covering the rather bare area. What kind of plants would thrive here? From trees, flowering plants to ground covers. Plus, something to cover the wall in the back. Perhaps a climber? I also plan on setting up a pergola over the graves. I'll need something suitable for that as well.   I'm also allowed to plant outside the barriers of the actual graves, so no restrictions whatsoever.  The climate here is semi-arid. It's quite dry as per the little rainfall we get but since there's a tube-well a few feet away from the site and im making the trip daily, watering isn't an issue.  From experience, flowering plants do really well here. Even some tropical plants. As long as your consistant with the watering.  Soil is too heavy to work with at the moment, but that won't be an issue either as I'm already in the process of amending it all around down to 2 feet. It'll be ready before spring time.     "

1419,help! I broke my mango seedling's root,"Ok, so my cousins had come over.sweet kids of 8 and 9. I was just showing them around my garden.And earlier in the day, we had some mangoes, and I had showed them how to take the seed out of the tough outer shell. Both of them had a seed each ,I put mine in the wet-paper towel-in ziplock bag experiment.  We were searching for a spot in the garden, and started digging some soil and placing the seed there.Finished off by pouring some water.  Then I just wanted to show them how the seed grows.So I had dug out some mud from my pot where I had placed a seed 20 days ago.And we got to the seed.My cousins peeped in and said they wanted to see the whole thing. I was sceptical, and honestly thought the seed is dead or something- since the plant had not come up yet and I had lost hope in it. So I dug it some more , and the seed seemed stuck or too tight to come out.I used my fingers to just move the mud aside, and holy cow I saw a strong root going down ! I was so happy!   But then it had been just 20 days , so I thought the root might not be lengthy. I was trying to chisel the seed out with my hand ,my cousins helped me push the mud out of the way.By then there were three hands in the pot, and I tried to be careful but my hand slightly shifted and, Oh dear god, the root BROKE!just like that!  I took the seed out and the broken root. It was 2 inches approx long!. But the seed still has an inch and a half  of strong root attached to it.The cut end had some kind of rootlings coming out of it,tiny &lt;1mm kind of light greenish white tubes( I don't know how else to describe it!) radially popping out.  I have planted the seed back into the mud and took away the broken root as a souvenir. Is there any chance that the seed will grow a new root?  Can I do anything with the broken root? right now its inside a pot, But will it grow?I know that's silly , but still, does the broken root do any good?   EDIT 1: just made my sentence construction better. "
1420,What is wrong with my Mother-in-Law's Tongue/ Snake Plant?,"It's been more than one month since I planted this Mother-in-Law's Tongue/Snake Plant. It was fine in the first few weeks. I had put it near my Wi-fi where less light reached it. It was doing fine until I noticed that a stem (leaf?) died, and I plucked it with ease, so I moved it to my north-facing window, as I thought low light was the cause of the dead leaf.  Now there is a hole big enough to see if the soil is dry or not. I water it once a month, and it's been around 20 days since I watered it. Lately, another leaf is getting yellow and brown:    Another thing I observed is the plant is kind like wilting. They were all straight and tightly packed, like all snake plants are, but now they have gone wilting:       Today, I tried to lift the drowsy stem, and I found that it had gone kaput. At least that's what I think happened. I pulled it with little to no effort, and it came out. Another leaf of the same stem came out easily, like someone just put it there:       Then, there is this young stem that came out completely:       In case it is needed, here is the soil:    What's wrong with this plant? Why so many weird things are happening? "
1421,Growing tomato's and other plants inside,"I've always started the garden season late and I want to change that! I figured I could start seedlings now  growing them as indoor plants until April even though it's a little early to start inside.  I don't have nearly enough window space with natural sunlight for the plants that are growing to receive enough sunlight on top of there not being a full day's worth of sunlight. I don't have money for a green house and I'm not sure where to start with indoor lighting? Could I make a mini green house with plastic totes?  I'm growing tomatoes, some sunflowers, and broccoli. They look like they need more sunlight.L Also this is not where they are normally placed. I have cats that can get to them when they are not by the window.  "
1422,What are these brown stains on my Bougainvillea's leaves?,"I recently got this Bougainvillea from a vivarium but I've noticed there are some brown stains in its leaves, just on the bottom of the plant. Do you know what these are, and how I should treat it?   For reference, it's in the garden, under a roof, with enough sunlight but not direct. For now, I have it isolated from the other plants, just in case.  Also, the bracts that cover the flowers are somewhat wrinkled, is that okay? (pictures attached).     "
1423,Why is my lawn changing colors?,"I'm wondering what is causing my lawn to apparently change colors... this a small segment of approximately a 3' x 6' area.

1426,What is this plant with narrow stems and purple flowers found in Germany?,"I found this plant in the pre-Alps in Bavaria/Germany:    It was located between 900 and 1200m above sea level on a forest meadow in the beginning of July. It was a hot day (>25°C) but not sunny at that time on the meadow. Despite some efforts I can't seem to identify it. My best guess is that is is some sort of Centaurium, maybe Centaurium erythraea? Can you help? "
1427,Is this spotting on my schefflera houseplant caused by alternaria?,"I've had a medium-sized schefflera or 'umbrella' houseplant for about five years now, and it might have been as old when I first got it. Lately, I have noticed black spotting on some of its lower leaves - the leaves higher up don't seem to be affected. The affected leaves are slightly sticky.     My question is twofold. First, is this caused by alternaria? Second, what is the best means for dealing with it? I'm reluctant to use any sort of fungicide or bactericide as I have two cats that are fond of this and other plants. Can it be controlled with removal of the affected foliage, limiting the moisture of the soil, and ensuring that the remaining foliage is kept dry?  As a bonus, I also encountered some small yellowish growths of what appeared to be a fungus on the surface of the soil a few months ago. Whenever I saw it, I would scrape it off and dispose of it, but it kept creeping back. I can't provide a picture, as it now seems to have departed, at least for the time being. Could this be related to the spotting of the leaves, or share a cause (overwatering)? "

As you can see my cloche doesn't have any sides and is really just a roof.  In terms of the heat, light etc, and the scientific properties of a cloche how adequate is my home made version?   I'm sure ""better than nothing but not as good as a sealed in cloche"" would be a rough answer.  But can anyone answer more fully about the importance (or otherwise) of sealing in your seedlings properly? "

I started pulling out by hand the tall seed pod stalks before mowing my yard, hoping to somewhat limit its ability to spread.  Here's an image of what I'm pulling up:    (Note: I originally identified this as crab grass, but upon adding this photo, I realized that I'm mostly dealing with dallisgrass, not crab grass.  I do have a small section of lawn that has some crab grass in it, but that plant is spread closer to the ground and has a Y-shaped seed stalk).  I understand its seeds primarily germinate in the spring time during cooler temperatures, so I wonder if I am just wasting my time by pulling out the seed pods?  Am I just being overly cautious, and doing this is no more effective than applying a pre-emergent treatment next spring?  Thank you! "

1435,Is Aloysia with brown spots drinkable?,"The leaves of the my Aloysia plant developed brown spots. Initially I thought they were tiny insects, so I washed the leaves and indeed some of the spots were removed, but other spots could not be removed. The brown spots look and feel like dry leaves in the autumn.  I cut all the branches with the leaves with brown spots, and a day or two later, I noticed tiny sprouts of fresh clean leaves starting to grow. Now my questions are:   Are these brown spots only a sign of old age, so that the new leaves will be OK? Or, are they a sign of some illness that might infect the new leaves? What can I do with all the branches that I cut, with the brown-spotted leaves? After washing them well, can I use them for tea?  "
1436,I think my lime tree is dead,"I have slowly been watching my lime tree die. I thought it just didn't get enough water last winter when we had no rain in the Los Angeles area and had heat problems. I noticed the bark seemed damaged so I painted the side that got the hot west sun. We have clay soil and I planted it too close to the garage expecting it to be a dwarf and much smaller. It had really small limes this year, but almost no new growth or leaves. The branches seem dead. I wonder if this tree looks like it can be saved? We are in the area for these Asian citrus psyllid, but I never saw them on the tree or damage in fruit. I have an orange and lemon tree both doing fine. Should I just take it out, or wait and see if there are new leaves?  "
1437,Are citrus trees better grown using containers or in the ground?,"I would really like to get a couple citrus trees (lemon and/or lime). The problem is I live in an apartment. I hope to move at some point such that I will have some land that I can put these in.  My question is, should I get the trees now and leave them in the pot on my apartment balcony which gets half sun? Or should I just wait until I have the land to put it in and get the trees then?  I know not to expect a significant yield, if any, on year one regardless. But I would expect a bunch of fruit in a few years in good conditions.  Suppose two situations, (1) a tree in the ground, (2) a tree in a pot at my apartment.  What are they going to be like at the 3 year mark? Would a tree in a pot for three years have it's growth significantly stunted such that I should just buy the tree in three years when I have the land? "
1438,Designing cherry laurel grove,"I plan to build a seating area close to my neighbor's yard.  The little problem is privacy, and I would like to solve it by making a cherry laurel grove. Since I am a kind of plant-collectory person, I would like to have various cherry laurels.  Can you help me design that area?    The size of planned cherry laurel area is appr. 6m x 2m (18ft x 6ft). It is a very sunny area. Existing magnolia, cherry and maple are dwarf or stunted specimens, and do not represent significant light or other barrier.  My yard landscaping style is naturalistic (so no formal features) ).    This is not my yard (though I wish it was), but a visual explanation what I want to achieve:      The cherry laurel cultivars available in my area are following:   ’Any’ - H 0.8-1m, W 1.5-2m - young leaves dark red; ’Caucasica’ ’Etna’ - H 2-3m, W 2-2.5m - young leaves copper-orange; ’Kleopatra’ - H 1-1.5m, W 1-2m - young leaves light copper-orange; 'Mano' - smaller than usual (6x3cm) leaves ’Marbled White’ ’Otto Luyken’ ’Reynvaanii’ ’Rotundifolia’   I would like to combine as many as possible cultivars.  I don't mind light pruning in the future.  Is this a good idea at all?  Can you suggest some placement of cultivars? (I will be looking at the grove usually from ""future seating area"", so that view is more important; ""desired view"" mentioned in the diagram is a larger view to the rest of my yard that I want to remain unobstructed) "
1439,Succulent clean up and growth,"I've learnt from a YouTube video that succulent ""leaves"" can be cleaned with milk and that would remove water stains as well. I wanna know if this can cause any harm to the leaves. My succulent has gotten very dusty and I would like to clean it up.  Another thing I wanna know about is why it isn't growing. It has been the same since i bought it (which was around 3 months ago. There has been no growth at all. Is this normal? Are they slow growing plants?  "
1440,Why didn't my amaryllis send up a flower stalk? Will it ever?,"I acquired 3 amaryllis bulbs and planted them cozily in pots kept near my south-facing window (where there is also a radiator). I didn't give them fertilizer, and not one of them sent up a flower stalk. They only have the leaves. Was it because I didn't fertilize? How can I get them to flower in the future? "
1441,When is the best/acceptable time to perform a fall core aeration and seeding on a lawn?,"I live in Southern NJ, USA (Mid Atlantic/Northeast region).  I recently contracted with a (well known, national) lawn care company to perform some maintenance on my lawn (aeration, fertilizers, pesticides, etc).  They came two weeks ago to apply some fertilizer, pest control, and some broad leaf weed treatment (the nutsedge is almost all gone!).  They just came back today (August 31, 2011) to perform the core aeration.  I sent them back for a few reasons:   My lawn is saturated from recent rains, don't want heavy equipment to damage it.  I feel like I read somewhere that the best time for a fall season aeration was mid-late September.  They were supposed to be giving me a seeding with this service and I feel like it's still a bit early to do a fall seeding.   Is my thinking here correct?  Should this core aeration and seeding be postponed for a few more weeks (into mid/late September)?  When are the ""best"" and ""acceptable"" times for these fall services? "
1442,Can I plant this rose shoot?,"A rose I bought at a florist is sending off a shoot, and it seems to be doing quite well. Should I plant the entire rose stem or only this shoot? How can I ensure it will survive?  Sorry for the blurry picture.   "
1443,Do I need to correct the pH of my newly re-potted citrus tree?,"I tried my hand at making my own soil for my citrus tree re potting. See below for the long story reasoning. I mixed EKO store bought (I live in an apartment) organic compost with coco coir and perlite. Its about equal parts of each, maybe a little less perlite. I tested the coir and it had a very neutral pH almost exactly 7 before mixing. After mixing and potting I watered and tested again, the pH was 6.5. Then the next morning I re-tested it again and this time the meter was around 5.4-5.8. It kept bouncing around allot. I am thinking that something in the soil parts must have taken time to dissolve into the water, hence why the measurement changed over night. Do I need to adjust the pH up a bit? Is this going to continue to change over the first few days? Assuming I am going to get something to be prepared to change the pH, if needed, what should I get? By the way its a 1 year old miniature naval orange tree and I live in Colorado if that matters.  Reasons for re-potting:  After 2 bad batches of store bought potting soil. First one did not drain well, second one (miracle grow) drained well at first and then I guess it broke down and did not drain so well. Literally I would water and 1 week later, in full sun, it would still be mucky an inch below the soil surface. Yes the pot has holes and I removed the drip pan because its located outside so who cares if the water runs off. This mg soil must have also had fungus gnat larva in it because it almost immediately got a bad infestation of them, with the little worms just under the surface. Hence I re-potted it in a pot that is full of many large holes, the kind with holes in the edge. Like what plants come in when you buy at the nursery. I then put that pot into a slightly larger pot. "
1444,Can I drill drainage holes on the side of the container?,This is a cross-section of a container. Most containers have a drainage hole on the bottom. I've marked that hole with an asterisk.  |         | |         | |         |  \___*___/   The problem with this position is that you have to elevate the pot with a stand and put a saucer under it or else water flow will be blocked by the pot's bottom forming a seal with the floor.   Can I drill the holes on the sides near the bottom so that I don't need a stand and saucer?   |         | |         | |         | *\_______/*   Is there a reason why nobody does this? 
1445,Is it safe to consume fruits from plants grown in metal cans?,"We drink a lot of coffee in our house so we have tons of these aluminum (?) cans (about 10cm in diameter):    I would like to re-purpose these cans as growing containers for some hot peppers (Capsicum X). I can imagine any acids in the soil can dissolve the metal of the can, despite it probably having some inner coating. Is it safe to eat fruits harvested from a plant that grew in a metal container? "
1446,How should I grow mexican sunflowers (Tithonia) from seed?,"I want to put Mexican (Tithonia) sunflower seeds directly in the ground.  If they were regular sunflower seeds, I would sow ithem directly in the garden, and I would put twice as many seeds close together, because not all would actually develop into plants. Then I'd transplant some somewhere else, if some areas were too crowded.  However, a Mexican sunflower:   is a much wider plant than a regular sunflower really dislikes transplanting   I have 30 seeds. What I am supposed to do? Any sunflower guru over there? "
1447,Please can you help me identify a rose with sentimental value?,"My late mother had a rose that was grown as a cutting from her grandmothers rose garden. I am very new to gardening, but I have managed to grow several cuttings (luck > judgement).   It would be wonderful to know more about the rose. Especially if its a climber or not.  I think it might be a hybrid tea(?):     More pictures, of these roses, are at Google Photos.  It's the pink one in the pictures (the fully grown one is my mothers, the ones in pots are my cuttings). I'm less interested in the peach coloured rose...but for a bonus point? "
1448,Wounded rhipsalis hanging cacti,"I need advice caring for my hanging cacti. I think it's rhipsalis lepismium bolivianum? It's started to develop black patches along its limbs. Also some weird spots. And some white muck gathering, which I guess is mealy bugs – I've just ordered some SB Plant Invigorator and Bug Killer for that. Can anybody give me more advice? Anybody with experience of this? I haven't been watering much during the winter, as with other cacti; it's in a fairly well-lit spot, a couple of metres away from a south facing window – and was doing well until winter set in proper.

1449,How can I help a sunburned jade tree recover?,"I put my jade tree out to get some sun yesterday, and apparently the sun was a little too blazingly direct. Instead of the healthy red edges I was expecting to see, several of the leaves are now collapsed-looking and have a greyish-brown color.  These photos make the brown spots look more red than they are. (Phone camera pics, sorry for the quality.)  The most dead-looking leaf:    A cluster of really sunken-looking leaves:   Is there anything I should do? This is quite a healthy plant otherwise, and it's an eighth or less of its leaves that are affected.  Should I keep the plant inside for a few days to recuperate? The sun outside today (and probably tomorrow) is just as strong as yesterday, and I don't have any good windows that get much sun at all. Should I cut off all the affected leaves? Leave them and see if they drop off themselves? Smear some aloe vera on there and make it a nice cool glass of lemonade? What about the leaves that are only partly bad-looking (one big, juicy leaf just has a collapsed edge, for example)? "
1450,How to seal board gaps in raised bed garden?,I just put together a 10x4 raised bed garden using cedar boards stacked 2 high.  I am a little concerned that the small gap between the stacked boards will let water seep out.  Could you provide any recommendations for sealing this gap? It would have to be soil/food safe.  My initial thought was to use 100% silicone caulk along the inside of the gap. Do you think this is a good choice or are there better options? 
1451,Brown spots around the veins on a hot pepper plant's leaves,I noticed this on some on my Carolina Reaper plants. A lot of the leaves have this kind of spots surrounding the midrib and the veins.  The plants grow indoors in 5l pots but I kept them in the garden for a period of about half a year when the temperatures were higher.    Some of the spots can be seen on the underside of the leaf as well.  Here's a picture showing the distribution of the spots on a leaf's upper surface.  What am I dealing with here? Some kind of pest? A disease? Or maybe the plants are lacking something?    Bacterial leaf spot comes to mind but I;ve never actually seen it and the pictures I can find online look somewhat different. 
1452,Ficus benjamina variegata: drops leaves but grows new branches,"I have got a ficus, presumably Ficus benjamina variegata. It is not in the best shape, presumably because it was a bit overwatered.   What confuses me is that it drops leaves (a bad sign) and at the same time it grows new branches (presumably a good sign). Should I just let it happen? Or should I chop off the new branches to encourage it to grow leaves on the existing branches?    I am (now) aware of the general ficus caring advice: no draughts, no changes in room temperature, no moving around, and daylight but no direct sunlight, water when the surface of the potting medium feels just about dry to the touch, then watered well, but not left sitting in water in any outer tray or pot after 30 minutes - thanks to How can I revive these house plants.  "
1453,Will an unevenly coloured (green) pumpkin ripen to a nice even orange?,My experience of cucurbits is mostly courgettes and cucumbers which a) don't matter too much about an even colour and b) don't sit so heavily on the ground.  But with a pumpkin it's all about how it looks. So I'm looking at my best and biggest pumpkin and worrying that it's not an even colour. The underside (which is nestled in grass) is very pale green and the part which gets the air and sun is a strong dark green.   Will it turn a nice even orange all over?  Should I lift or attempt to turn the growing pumpkin fruit so it gets a nice even suntan? I'm not sure this would even be possible without damage. I did try this with an earlier fruit but in spite of my careful handling it came away from the plant. 
1454,How can I tell if my chilli plant is perennial?,"Last year, I got a chilli plant sapling from a family friend. It planted and grew quite well, yielding around three batches during the summer; the chillies are long, green, and turn a bright red if left long enough on the plant.  The family friend suggested ""save some seeds,"" but it was too late in the season and I didn't save any.  Research online suggests that many (most?) of these plants are annual. How can I be sure if mine is annual or perennial?  I left the plant in the soil throughout winter (-20 to -30C). Now that it's thawed out (mostly), I can see the stalks look okay. I pruned the tallest ones down to a few inches, and removed all the hanging dead leaves.  I would like to grow the same thing, so I need to figure out as quickly as possible if I should wait/watch (and is it worth the extra effort?) the current one, or yank it out and replace it with a new one. "
1455,"Urgent treatment for Echeverias, in mid-winter","My E. Purpusorum has begun to shrivel its bottom leaves and just by touching the plant it came-off. The roots seem to have died, but I still have a chance to root the stem. This species seems difficult to grow in my area, as I lost anoter E. Purpusorum last summer.  My challenges - Local climate and locally-used potting soil. First, I have a link to show you the climate in my city. Values are average. Local nurseries potting soil is not sufficiently draining, but global warming has been on my side for a while. I potted-up few Echeverias into a better draining mix. Most have grown a bit and then flowered. I had to take advantage of the relatively warmer winter, because my pots sit in the open and are not protected from excess rain. My mix with much added Perlite seems to solve the problem.  The sick plant - It is now February, and temperatures are only now reminding me of true winter. I expect temperatuers to rise in March. My E. Purpusorum can be trimmed to take-off the dead roots and any parts of a rotten stem, if there is. my question: It is too cold and wet to make new roots?, Should I let the cuts callus and wait till mid-to-end of march to re-root it?  "
1456,What's the best way to grow tomato and pepper plants from seedlings late in the season?,"I am wondering, is there any best practice for starting tomato/pepper plants this late in the season?  To be clear, I am talking about started plants that I am hoping to get heavily discounted from stores given that it is August 1st. We recently moved and were not able to start plants from seeds.  It feels like I should be able to do:   Buy a bunch of pre-started plants (for cheap) Transplant to garden Profit   I am in zone 5 and our first frost is normally early October, meaning tomatoes/peppers planted today would have nearly 60 days to produce. I expect that really is more like 45 days as the end of the season will be pretty cool.  Is there a good way to approach this?  "
1457,Pine tree falling,"We have a pine tree in our backyard leaning at 35 degrees of an angle. On one side of the tree the roots seem to be separating from the ground(there is a hollow gap of 6 inches forming underground between roots and ground, because the dirt is lifting up in between the roots the hollow space is not visible.) The tree is tilting everyday another 1/16 of an inch more measured at 12 feet up. Our landlord doesn’t believe me that the tree was s falling nor will come over to inspect it. A small storm will tip it 1/4 inch, a very heavy storm will tip the tree 2 inch. Any suggestion of how to convince our landlord that the tree(30-40 feet tall) will fall? Or are pine tree’s roots to strong to make it fall? Will it fall suddenly? I think when it reaches 37 degrees it might snap. Is there a common sense angle at which one should cut a tree? Thanks, Jan "
1458,What tool is most suitable for this task?,"I have planted this lilly pilly in my background and it has grown rather tall. It is about 1.5~2m tall now. It is not obviously in the picture but it is located at a corner.    I want to trim it down and preferably just a bit taller than the fence. However this hedge trimmer I have (Bosch AHS 48 Li) is not really up to the job. It couldn't reach the sides facing the fence and the top, even though I have used a ladder.    My questions are:  1) What kind of power tool is best suitable to trim hedge of this size? Hopefully it is battery powered.  2) The lilly pilly is currently flowering. Is it a good time to trim it?  3) How regularly I should trim it? I have not been diligent during the winter time and I feel that it have grown rather unkempt. "
1459,Thyme (Black up curled tipped leaves),"I have a thyme cutting that has rooted, probably about two months and the tips of some of the leaves are turning black and curling up.  Any idea what that is? Light, nutrient deficiency or some disease?   Additional info, may be of help, it's in a bottle of water with some nutrient feed inside a window that receives over 10 hours of sun daily in the southern hemisphere, so it's summer with average temperatures upwards of 26 Celsius.  (will update with a pic later in the day)  "
1460,Co2 enrichment with exhale bags,"I’m intending to try co2 enrichment with Exhale bags.  And from reading on the co2 enrichment I understood that photosynthesis does not play a role during night time and the plant actually emits co2.    I wonder if the bag should be sealed during “lights off” period? So the plant won’t be flooded with co2 I also read that the co2 level should be around 1200-1500 ppm, but the light intensity is also an important parameter and it should be measured as well. So I will need to buy a co2 meter and a light/lux meter.  The prices for those two are ranging from relative budget pricing to very expensive:   light meter Co2 meter    Are those measuring tools should be sufficient for my purpose ?    What is the lux level for effective photosynthesis to occur when co2 enrichment is involved?   Growing setup:   Plant: let’s keep it private - one plant in 90x90x160 tent. Light: x4 COB CREE CXB3590 - 200W in total. Growing medium - Coco perlite mixture.   If any other information is missing please write it and I’ll add.  "
1461,Can I eradicate blackspot on roses with a winter pruning?,"In mid-winter, I pruned my standard roses back harshly.  Black-spot can be a problem on these roses.  The pruning is such that they have hardly any leaves.  The remaining leaves do not have any black-spot.  Should I spray now to remove any remaining fungus on the plants?  Will this keep black-spot from the new foilage that will grow as spring starts?  Or will the fungus spread through the air to the new foilage in any case? "

1463,Is there any reason not to add commercially produced flowers to compost?,Is there any reason to avoid putting flowers purchased from the florist in compost?  The flowers were gifts but are now wilting.  Would florists or growers use anything on the flowers to preserve them that might be bad for compost? 
1464,What is my Sago Palm releasing into the air and is it seasonal?,"I just bought a small Sago Palm and it's been sitting in my room for the last week. It doesn't have a flower spike, so I assume it's not releasing spores. But it gives off a slight musky smell, and my allergies have been going haywire. If it's not spores, what could it be releasing? And is it likely to be seasonal, or permanent?   "
1465,How can I pump water from a rain barrel to my balcony?,"I live in an apartment with a porch that is one story off of the ground.  I plan on container gardening on the porch, but I don't have a spigot outside to connect a hose.  There is, however, a gutter drain near the porch at ground level that I could attach to a rain barrel to collect rain water.  The challenge with this will be pumping the water up one story to the porch to use in a timer based irrigation system.  Has anyone done this before? If so, what were the challenges with this setup, how did you go about doing it and do you have any recommendations for a pump method? "
1466,Regrowing a ficus from suckers,"I've got a ficus which dried out this summer. The roots seem to be alive and well - multiple suckers are growing without issues.    This photo was taken a week ago and the suckers continue to grow.  I read that is possible to regrow the tree from one of them as long as it's not grafted. (I don't think it is, the leaves on suckers look the same as the trees next to it)  My main questions are:   Should I cut the old tree immediately, or wait longer? Should I select one sucker and cut the rest, or is it better to cut the small ones off over time?   Anything else I should pay attention to while trying to revive this tree? "
1467,Is it okay to top a redwood tree?,Our redwood is about 30 years old and about 4 stories high. I would like to shape and top it to keep under control. Would it be fine to top off about 10 or 15 feet and also shape it? A tree trimmer told me it would be a good idea but years ago another trimmer told me not to top because the top would split in two and continue growing that way. Sounds awful. Any advice?

1471,Do I remove the garlic flower?,"I've never grown elephant garlic before which I believe is closer to a leek than garlic. Anyway, it looks like it wants to flower so should I snip it off? Or should I let it flower, collect the seeds and try growing from seeds?   "
1472,Keeping healthy grass in play area,"My kids play in my backyard a lot (4 kids aged 2-11).  We've been in the house for about 6 months and when we moved in there was grass in the back yard.  When we moved in the grass wasn't in amazing shape.  This isn't really a surprise - our back yard is very shady (it's a ""typical"" sized backyard but has a dozen mature trees, so most of it is always shaded).  Other than grass, there were always plenty of weeds.  We have two rope swings set up that the children play on often.  We have actual swings for them, but more often they take the swings down and just hang on the end and swing back and forth in all sorts of ways.  This inevitably ends with feet dragging on the ground.  As a result, the grass has gotten much more ragged since we moved in, and in large circular patches around the rope swings, it is completely bare dirt.  Now the kids get filthy when they play outside, and it's a bit of a pain.  My wife would love to have the grass back.  I'm not sure if it is possible given the conditions.  The shade obviously isn't going away and I don't want to take down the rope swings.  Convincing little children to be nice on the ground is probably impossible.  So my question(s):   Is it possible to get healthy grass under these conditions? If not, what are some cost effective alternatives?  Main concerns would be not looking tacky and helping to keep the children from turning into pig-pen everytime they go outside.   Here's a picture of the play area under the main swing - in front of a clump of trees which I tied up with some old ropes.  You can (hopefully) see the big patch of dirt in front, and scraggly grass elsewhere.  It gets some sun in the morning but later in the afternoon (and during the summer) it's almost completely shaded.    Here is a patch of grass at the side of my house where the kids haven't trampled.  It gives you an idea of what the lawn used to look like (although it was never great under the tress).  It's winter, so it looks worse, but it's still not in great shape, nor was it when we moved in.   "
1473,Durability of stone over concrete?,"My concrete sidewalks are an inch or so below grade (presumably sunken since installation by previous owners?) and are beginning to crack. I'd like to install flagstone pathways in their place. It looks like, in general, laying stone over existing concrete is acceptable. It also looks like I can use 1/2"" of sand and 1"" thick stone to get the walkaway about 1/2"" above grade which seems suitable.  In addition to aesthetics, I'm interested in replacing the walkway with stone for long term durability. Will the pathway be as durable laid over existing concrete as it would be if I demolished the concrete and installed it more conventionally?  "
1474,Need help determining houseplant's problem,"I've had a houseplant (not sure of the species, unfortunately) for a few (~6) months now. Until recently, the plant has been healthy.    Now, there are a few things going on with the plant that are concerning to me. I'm rather new to gardening, so I'm not sure what the problem is (I'm familiar with some deficiencies, but nothing more), and I don't really have anyone to ask. I was wondering if anyone could possibly help me determine the diagnosis and and treatment to my plant's ailment.   Symptoms:   Browning and yellowing of leaves at the base (phosphorous/iron deficiency?)  Small white circles on the undersides of leaves. Upon closer inspection they don't look like aphids, perhaps aphid eggs? (See topmost leaf) Weird structures on the stem. Are these part of the plant? Am I just that dull?  Very small, almost invisible black dots on underside of leaf  Aphids, I think.   Is this just a simple aphid infestation rearing its ugly head?

1475,Are cherries from the market irradiated?,"I bought some sweet cherries in season last summer and decided to see if I could germinate some for planting.  I ""de-nutted"" maybe 20+ of them and placed them in damp paper towels in the refrigerator for several months. They were all healthy looking seed kernels (out of the stone). I decided to plant some in the house in early January for an early start. Several of them were putting out roots.  I planted the four largest ones first - one died, three grew up, but one of those was ""albino"" - so I pulled it out. A couple of weeks later I planted six more that had roots, and these came up much more slowly. Four of them are slow growing and green. One more of these was ""albino"" (also??), and the other is still there, but not poking out of the soil yet - maybe dead. All of the remaining seeds were not sprouting roots at all, so I threw them away.  So, I got roughly a sorry 50% germination rate and only 25% survival rate. I then wondered if they might have been irradiated causing genetic defects, and if the surviving plants might also have other genetic changes that are not yet evident.  I can't find any info. online about cherry irradiation in the US. Does anyone know if cherries are routinely (commonly) irradiated for market? "
1476,Oak tree - arborist says needs to be removed?,"I have a very nice oak tree in my backyard that is about 100-150 years old. The tree is in a good visual shape and we trim it about every two years.  However, there is a wound on tree's stem, about 25 feet up from the ground. We hired an arborist who performed ""resistograph"" testing and says there is over 35% decay at this place and it needs to be removed.  Resistograph results are attached in the picture. Does it really need to be removed? Or should we get a second opinion?  (click on the image to get the fullres version for readability)   "
1477,Haworthias in polystyrene pellets potting-soil when pumice not available,"I have read this article about using styrofoam (Polystyrene) instead of Perlite. Is it good to plant Haworthias in 100% styrofoam grains?  The poly's water retention is inferior to that of Perlite, and is closer to that of pumice. The polystyrene balls are easily obtained when you rub a piece of the stuff against a rough surface and all the ""grains"" break loose.  Setting aside all other issues while processing this stuff, how good will be a 100% styrofoam-based substrate to plant Haworthias? Will the water retention be sufficient for Haworthias? "

1480,Why did my new pear tree snap hours after planting?,"I bought a new pear tree, Williams Bon Chretien,  from a local garden centre yesterday and put it in the ground following the instructions. Watered roots while in its pot before planting, dug the hole suitable size and filled with the recommended soil and got it in with a stake and rubber tree tie facing into the most common prevailing wind. However the wind sometimes feels like it can come from any direction and it's not unknown to knock over some plant pots around the garden.  Spot too windy for a tree? Stake and tie not being suitable? Was the tree not good quality from the garden centre? Stake badly positioned? Weak tree type and a different type would work?  The tree and the stake are solid in the ground still and the tree has snapped a bit under where the stake is tied as can be seen in the photos. I may have put the stake in too high/low?  The garden is surrounded by other gardens so I am confident to rule out animals causing this.  I feel like this tree cannot be saved. If it can be could you point me in the right direction? I would still love to have a tree in this spot and neighbours have trees, any tips are appreciated.    "
1481,Why do the leaves of my new Chinese Evergreen turn yellow even if I wait 5 weeks between watering?,"Is there any way to tell when a Chinese evergreen really  needs watering?  After maintaining a  Chinese evergreen for 24 years, it died of old age. This plant taught me to wait till it drooped before watering it. That usually took about 2 weeks.  I now have a new one.

1485,Two-dimensional plant spacing,"I'm new to vegetable gardening and am just beginning to plant a few seeds into raised beds. On every seed packet, and in almost every other guide or reference I've found, on- and off-line, instructions are given on the correct spacing in two perpendicular dimensions, yet none offers any explanation whatsoever of the reasoning or implementation details of this mysterious practice.   So for example I'm told that for carrots I should aim for final spacing of 4 inches on the x-axis and 12 inches on the y-axis. In keeping with tradition I hope to produce a carrot which is approximately circular about the horizontal plane, so I'm at a loss to see why its space requirements should be any greater in one dimension than the other.   The larger given distance isn't typically wide enough to offer walk-in access, so what on earth could the reasoning be? And how am I supposed to be orienting these axes with respect to their natural environment anyway? Should one or other axis be aligned to the midday sun? The magnetic pole? Ley lines? I wouldn't want to think I'd planted my whole garden at right angles to its proper orientation...  "

1495,When is the winter period for plants kept in a country with no winter (or a constant room temperature)?,"Reading up on how to care for a Mammillaria Elongata Cactus I see it mentions such things as   suspending watering in winter for best care (and to encourage better flowering)  the preferred time to re-pot is in the warm season fertilizer can be used in the growing season, but suspend feeding in the winter.   When are such periods in a country where there is no winter, and very little or no change in temperature, such as tropical countries (or indoors where the temperature may be constant)?  Is one supposed to follow what would be the seasons in the country where the plant is from, construct ones own winter, by choosing a time to just water less each year and sticking to it, or can you safely treat the plant the same throughout the year?

1504,Areca Palm - Expert Assesment Please,"Earlier this afternoon I took delivery of a 170cm Areca Palm, via an online purchase from a reputable horitcultural company. It was relieved to be taken out of the box and plastic wrapper and positioned in the warm sunlit lounge. Naturally it was quite expensive so I've given it a good inspection to make sure there is nothing wrong with it. Unfortunately it does seem that there is something not quite right that concerns me enough to write here for some expert advice.  Photo 1 below shows you the complete plant. Overall I would say it looks very healthy:    The first things that struck me as odd was the black marks all over the stems. I've been able to gently wipe quite a lot of them off by using one of those green scrims dipped in water, plus running my finger nail up and down also proved to be effective. After quite a work out it now looks much better but many of the black spots won't come off. I've since read on this forum that there is nothing to worry about, so I guess I'm OK with this, but thought I'd mention it nevertheless. Photo 2 and 3 below shows this:      Another slight concern is regarding the shield-like leaves that wrap around the thicker, presumably older stems. Are these meant to be yellow and crispy with dark patches on them? I'm hoping the answer is yes. Photo 4 below shows this:    OK so now my main concern. At the foot of the plant are what look like some new little stems with leaves on them. On a couple of them all of the leaves are crinkled in the middle of their length. Photo 5 shows this. This is nothing though, compared to the mutant stem that I found toward the centre of the base of the plant - covered in dry completely frazzled leaves. Photo 6! What an earth has happened here? Is this a magnesium deficiency? Clearly there is something very wrong with this little chap. What should I do?     Should I keep the plant or send it back?  Edit > I wrote to the supplier who replied with the following:  The crinkled leaves etc is not something to worry about. We see this often on new growth and the leaves straighten out as they develop. It can also occur where the palm is getting ready to split and divide.   Likewise on larger mature Areca the stems are usually speckled with black. Again it is not a cause for concern, it is natural. I am rather more concerned that you may have stressed the plant if you scrubbed at its stems. I would advise that you leave the plant to acclimatise in its new home before re-potting it. Also, please do not feed or over-water the palm. Feed should only be applied during the warmer, growing months.  We do carefully check our plants before shipping them and would not have sent it out if we had any concerns.  We also only work with top rated growers and suppliers from across the various continents, we do not offer sub-standard plants for sale. Please therefore be assured that you palm is healthy and will flourish with the proper care.  Thanks for reading,  Giles "

1506,Which Fertilizers to use?,"I have a Gardenia, anthrium and peace lily indoors.  For my other plants, I use NPK (7+3+6) for the green plants, NPK (3.5 + 6 + 6 ) for blossom plants and another NPK(4+1.5+4) for all purpose.  My questions are:   Which would be best for Gardenia? I heard it needs acidic soil and apparently Nitrogen helps to make it acidic. So, NPK (7+3+6) (which I use for green plants) a good fertilizer to use on Gardenia?  Since Anthrium likes more phosphorus, is NPK (3.5 + 6 + 6 ) good for that ? Peace lily requires NPK(1+1+1), so is there any from these above mentioned fertilizer which we can use for peace lily? Is there any among the above mentioned which is good for Chilli plants ?   Many Thanks! "
1507,Distance and spacing of LED growlights for propagation,"I am planning to make an indoor propagation setup which consists of  h:30cm x w:40 x L:50cm recycled polystyrene boxes and full spectrum LED panels. Clearly, the biggest limitation is height in this case. I might join two boxes to double the height, if necessary.  The LED panels I have seen keep a temperature of 25C while in operation, but I will clearly drill some holes for ventilation.   The setup is intended to start seeds and grow them vegetatively until they can be hardened off and planted out (this will include vegetable plants).  Edit: I am planning on leaving the polystyrene lid on and attaching the LED panel to it, with the wiring at the top or side; but I am open to other solutions if strictly necessary. The boxes would be placed in a cold part of the house, where the temperature range is 13-18C.  My questions are:  1) What should be the distance for, say, 25W, 45W, 75W panels like these?  2) Would spacing be a problem in the case of a panel? Should I buy strips instead and evenly space them out?  3) How many hours of light per day are suggested in the case of seedlings?    "

1511,Encouraging wisteria to grow quickly,"I've planted some wisteria and am trying to encourage it to grow up a wooden column. I put some nails into the column and have slowly wound the wisteria around the column on the nails and attached with twine. My plan is to wait until the wisteria has reached the top (where there is more to wrap around) and then remove the nails.  I've read a lot about wisteria but most of the articles about pruning it describe pruning to encourage flowering. I don't care at all about it flowering until it's very well established; instead I'd like it to grow as quickly as possible and as focused in growing up the column.  What should I do to encourage growth of the plant? Should I be pruning away the secondary vines and only leaving leafs on the main? Should I regularly fertilize? Extra watering or less water?  Thanks!  edited: I've added 5 photos. I don't know the variety of wisteria unfortunately.  1 The mature vine I have now.

Yesterday my husband was given  some young Rose of Sharon plants from a friend at work, grown from seed by someone else. I've always wanted some, and would like to know how best to  ensure successful growth.  There are six seedlings, ranging in height from 7"" to 12"", in a 9"" by 9"" plastic pot filled with dense wet soil, which looks to me like garden dirt.   Can I transplant them now? I've been told this is the worst time of year to do that. Our temperatures are between eighty and ninety degrees F during the day, sometimes hotter, down to the sixties at night, and it's quite humid.  How should I care for them while they're in the pot? As you can see, the stems are bending. Is staking a good idea, or would that disturb the roots? Should the pot be in the sun or shade, and what's the proper amount of water? If it's too soon for planting in the ground, do they need separate containers, or are they okay together?  Finally, how much distance will they need between them, or other plants, in their permanent spot? I have a section of day lilies, some of which I'm planning to remove to make a home for the Rose of Sharon.   Edit to provide requested information: The variety is Hibiscus syriacus.

1518,Using buckets as placeholders for future trees?,"I am currently landscaping my yard. I plan on completing everything with the exception of planting a few small, narrow trees around the perimeter. I will be doing that next year.  While everything is a mess now, I am considering digging the holes for the future trees, putting ~5 gal buckets in the holes and then backfilling. My thought is that this will make it easier to come back next year, pull out the buckets, make any necessary small adjustments to the size of the hole and plant the trees without having to make a big mess.  Is this an OK idea? Are there any problems with it? The only problem I can think of is that the subsoil is heavy clay which could really stick to the bucket, so getting the bucket out come next year could prove to be a challenge. "

1521,"Red bugs, tiny webs and white powder on Tulsi plant","This is in south India. I purchased a Tulsi plant around 3 months ago from a local seller who told me he also had medicines for plants if I ever needed them. I asked what medicine, and he didn't know. Approximately two weeks after bringing the plant home, there were some dark brown bugs crawling all over it and the leaves appeared to have powdery mildew. I sprayed a milk+water solution under bright sunlight for three days and the plant actually recovered. I also pruned off many leaves that had no chance of recovery. In a few days it sprouted fresh leaves all over.    However, a week or two later, I noticed very tiny red bugs (size around a quarter of a millimeter) crawling all over the leaves of the plant. This time, there also seemed to be some kind of tiny webs all over the stalks of the leaves. Leaves began turning brown, had some kind of white powdery substance on it and although the plant was constantly sprouting fresh leaves, the bugs and the 'disease' always caught up and devoured the leaves. The plant has and still is able to sprout fresh leaves though. The bugs seemed more abundant and visibly there during the rainy days. Now that the rain is gone, I don't see bugs, but the tiny brown blobs on the leaves shown in the first picture just might be them. I heard Tulsi needs direct sunlight, so it has been kept on a terrace where it gets morning and afternoon sunlight in plenty.      Some pics (click on it to see larger):      I don't want to go to the seller because I believe they may be running a scam where they sell plants which are already sick/disease-prone so that they can sell 'medicine' when gullible customers come back.    Questions: 1. Could anyone help identify what is wrong with the plant and how to fix it? 2. The plant has dropped seeds all around it. Would it be more advisable to kill the plant and grow saplings from the seeds? Or would they be prone to the same disease? 3. Does anyone know of any supposed chemical that such suspected scamsters could use to make plants seem healthy only as long as the chemical is used? "

I live in a dry area (a steppe climate, or a Bsk climate with very hot summers), where the daytime highs are usually 89° F. or above in summer (up to about 116° F. at the most; temperatures that high are infrequent, but it's not uncommon for it to be over 100° F. for extended periods), and occasionally (such as now), the highs are a little cooler than 89° F. We're starting to get tomatoes on more plants, now. The night-time lows are usually 30+° F. cooler than the daytime highs.  Many new tomato varieties I'm using this year don't seem to set fruit during certain parts of the year, although I had thought the ones I formerly used from local stores were typical of tomatoes (apparently, most of them have some heat tolerance, it seems).  So, I was wondering: Which tomatoes tend to be the most heat-tolerant?  Also, I'm having the same problem with eggplant, although I'm only growing two varieties (I'm growing about 30 varieties of tomatoes). Feel free to comment there, too.  It should be noted that I'm only asking this question to answer it, because I just made a long list of reportedly heat-tolerant tomatoes, and I wanted to share it with the community. Nevertheless, if you have an answer, please feel free to give it. :) Please excuse the fact that I refer to myself as if I were someone else in my answer. I know there are other lists online, but most of them only list a few heat-tolerant varieties (and often the same ones as many of the other sites). "
1525,What is this incredibly efficient ground cover?,"I moved some soil from one part of my garden to another recently. This seems to have caused fairly aggresive appearing of this ground cover (weed?): (leaves are smallish, 1cm long)    In next two pictures you can see it 'in action':      Here you can see it growing 'through' another plant:    What is this plant?  Could it be CHICKWEED Stellaria media? "

1527,What is the best time period of the year to graft a tree/plant and what is the best time of the day to graft a tree?,"I live in Sri Lanka. It's dry and warm in the day time here and, temperature in day time here is around 30 degrees in Celcius. I want to know what is the best time period of the year for grafting a tree. Is it ok if I do it these days by shading the tree and regularly watering the tree. Or do I have to wait till the rainy season?  Also I want to know what is the best part of the day to graft a tree, morning or afternoon.? if there's a best time of the day for grafting a tree what is the reason for that? I am planning to graft a Mango tree.  "
1528,A good way to take care of Pelargonium,How often should they be watered?  How much? Any parts that need cutting off? I have one potted plant which is pretty grown. And has pink flowers.  Thanks! 
1529,How can I save this plant sprout?,"In my other question What is this plant on the pictures? I was asking about the identity of certain plant. The reason I was asking was that this plant has gone for the worse recently. The whole plant somehow faded and the liitle sprout seen on first picture has sagged and lost most of its leaves. Well, it went from bad to worse. The liitle sprout just toppled over with no roots left. My guess is that the roots have rotted away. My question is: Can I save that sprout and how. Would putting it in a water with a bit of liquid fertiliser help? Or is it gone. My worry is that the big plant might follow soon.     "
1530,Tall-flower support,"These nice yellow flowers were holding themselves quite well, then at one particularly heavy rainfall most of them fell down.    I pulled them up with a cord. Am I doing this right?    They are rather tall (> 6ft) for the slender stem they have. Could something in this environment be making them grow this tall against their nature? "
1531,How do I rejuvenate my Date Palm Tree?,"I've had this date palm tree for a little over a year now and the leaves have started to turn yellow with some of the bottom leaves dying out, is there any way to rejuvenate the plant, should I cut away the dead leaves at the bottom? Also, am I ok keeping it in a patio plant pot, as I'd rather not plant in the ground as I don't really have space in the garden?      "
1532,What is causing damage to my summer squash and zucchini plants?,"I have a variety of problems with my summer squash and zucchini plants:   The summer squash (and to a smaller degree the zucchini) has clear spots in the leaves:      This morning one of the zucchini plants was dead and looked as follows with a white maggot inside:     My questions:   Are these problems related? What is happening to my plants? What can I do?   EDIT: I live just outside Washington, DC on the MD side. I have a sprinkler like automatic irrigation system. The ugliest leaves are the ones that receive the highest amount of sprinkler water that goes on for 3 minutes at 9am and 9pm. Could this be the culprit? Am I over watering? Am I watering the leaves when I shouldn't? Do I have the wrong watering schedule, that is making the plant prone to this disease?  There is nothing alive in the dirt. The summer squash lives in a raised bed. There are one eggplant, one tomato, one green pepper and one basil in the same raised bed. All other plants are thriving.  The zucchini lives in a rectangular container. It is pretty big and there are other zucchinis in there. The zucchini plant, has a orange pulpish where the damage occurred (not sure it is visible in the second picture).  "
1533,How Far Back To Prune Frost-Damaged Gardenias?,"I have 4 formerly great-looking gardenia bushes in my yard, but this past winter has been brutal on them (I live in the DC area, where it was still snowing as of yesterday). The plants are still alive, but in terrible shape.   I understand (from internet research) that I should prune them back to the healthy parts so that they can grow back. But, how can I tell where that is? There seem to be leaf buds even on the bad parts, though I don't know if those buds are dead.   Is there something in particular that could help me gauge how far to prune them?  A photo of one of the plants is below. Thanks in advance for any advice.    "
1534,Why does this Jade plant have small leaves when compared to other Jade plants?,"    And more importantly, how do I take care of this plant? This is a succulent plant, so it needs less water, right or wrong? On one site it says that I need to water it every time the top soil gets dry. I am confused as to how to take care of this plant. How do I take care of it and why the leaves are short. "
1535,Digging French Drains - Rent Mini-X or Tractor Loader Backhoe?,"I'll be digging a few french drains in my backyard.  I'll need to dig the trenches, smooth them out with right slope; put in a few inches of drainage stone; lay the pipe; more drainage stone; top off with topsoil.    I have to run about 160' all total over 3 branches.  My yard is about 12-18"" dirt, then 18"" of very moist clay, about 3' down I'll hit water.  The Mini-X seems well suited to the task but i'll need to go back and forth to gather and place the stone.  My backyard isn't terribly big - it's about 3K square feet total.  Which would you rent from Home Depot - the Mini-X or the Backhoe?  --Updated information -- My problem is that my lawn is nearly always soaking wet.  In addition to the heavy clay and high water table,  I have a wonderful neighbor that installed a drain pipe of his own - and exits it 6 inches away from the property fence - and right into my lawn.  The result is half of my lawn is pretty much just shy of mud all the time.   In the back of my yard i have one of the county's stormwater drains - i'll exit into that.  Originally I had thought just connect PVC to both my house's gutters and run one over to the fence line - but then I stumbled across this video.  [website]My idea was to put in a drainage that primarily gets rid of the water being forced into my yard and to assist in draining out the high water table water also.  When i look up drain tile - it seems like it is a french drain?  [website]Neighbor property on the left, mine on the right.  Here is what i'm thinking as far as drainage. "
1536,What do healthy red maple saplings look like?,"Last year I had to cut down a red maple tree. I was able to save three of its offspring.  One is ~2' tall and I moved it from where it volunteered behind a bush to the middle of the yard.  Another is ~8"" tall and spent most of last year in a pot. Buried the pot in the ground in early fall.  The last one is a pure untouched volunteer, ~6"" tall growing right up against the stump of the old tree.  How can I tell if these saplings survived the winter?   I see very small buds on all of them. Should these buds be hard or soft?  What other signs indicate a healthy, young red maple sapling? "
1537,Cupressocyparis with double leader,"I have two cupresocyparises (aka leylandiis) that each developed two leaders. They are both around 8m (25ft) high now, the leaders start at appr. 2m above ground, so I guess it is too late just to remove one of the leaders in its entirety. The distance between leaders is small - 10 cm, and each leader 'has' its own half of the tree (above the starting point of leaders of course), but those two halves are knitted closely, impossible to move separately.  This is not my photo, but in the center right of following photo there is a tree with double leader somewhat similar to mine (but in an early stage of development)    This is one of mine double-leader Leylandiis:    From aesthetics point of view, they look fine to me.  What is the significance of double leaders regarding other aspects of health and development?  What if I just leave them?  Can I just shorten one by lets say 40cm, hoping that the remaining will become the only leader over time? "
1538,Do strawberry runners start from age zero?,"They say that strawberry plants don't produce good fruit as they become a few years old. Let's say a 5 year old strawberry plant starts a new plant via a runner. Does this runner have its biological clock reset back to zero or is it considered the same age as its parent? That is, will the runner produce good fruit or will it produce bad fruit like its senile parent? What I'm trying to see is if I can infinitely extend my years of harvesting strawberries by constantly rejuvenating my strawberry patch by propagating via runners every year.  These spindly horizontal vines are runners. I have Quinalt strawberries, if that matters.   "
1539,Sago Palm - Won't put out more than a few fronds at a time,"How do I get more growth from my Sago Palm? It never puts out more than one circle of fronds at a time until this winter.

1542,"What is causing this yellow fungus in my plants' soil, and should I be concerned?","In this post I mentioned that the soil in my schefflera plant's pot had been host to some yellowish fungus, but I somehow managed to misidentify some discolored perlite as the fungus in question.  However, I rediscovered the fungus yesterday; here a small growth can be seen about an inch in front of the base of the schefflera:  And here is a closeup of the same:   Then, when I was watering my philodendron, I discovered what appears to me to be a very similar, fuzzy yellow fungus on the surface of its soil as well:  And:   It doesn't really look quite like the dog vomit slime mold discussed here.  I removed the schefflera soil's strange cylindrical growth with a toothpick easily enough; but is this fungus something about which I should be concerned, or will simply scraping it off whenever it appears keep the problem at bay? Should I repot the schefflera and philodendron in new soil? Water less often? Or is it beneficial, and OK to leave as is? "
1543,"First Time Hydroponics, Cloudy Water with White stuff on top? Is this bad? High Res pics","It's my first time doing hydroponics, I am using the GH Flora series.

1544,When should I repot my avocados?,"I stuck a bunch of avocado seeds into some mud, and surprise, they sprouted and seem to be doing quite well!  I think I need to move them to separate pots, however. Is there a general rule for doing this? Number of leaves? Plant height? There are some that are struggling (the two near the bottom of the pic), so I'll probably leave them alone for the time being.   "
1545,How do I predict a plant species' water intake?,"I'm an amateur gardener planning a future garden in an extremely dry area. The soil is fertile, but I understand you need to water artificially in order to grow anything significant.   I want to experiment with species and varieties that aren't traditionally used in the area. When selecting  species to try out, their estimated ""thirstiness"" is going to be a major factor, as water isn't going to be cheap.  Do any canonical resources on plant species' water consumption exist?   If not - what general characteristics should I look out for in order to determine how thirsty they are going to be?  "
1546,Is there anything wrong with letting cucumbers get large?,  The top and light green cucumber is the one in question. I thought it was fitting to use a cherry tomato for scale.  Is there anything wrong with letting a cucumber grow that large? Is there a well understood difference in flavor or texture? Any impact to the plant itself (aside from weight)? 
1547,Ants and white fluff on my citrus tree leaves,"I've noticed this weird thing on the underside of some of my citrus tree's leaves. It looks like a number of ants stuck in a bunch of white fluff.    This is only on some of the leaves, and it's mostly at the bottom. The tree itself looks to be perfectly fine otherwise and is growing.  The tree itself is around 3 years old (and has been here for less than a year), and the climate is dry Mediterranean (hardiness zone 11?) although it has been wetter than usual these last few days.  So, what am I looking at exactly? And should I remove the effected leaves or do something else?   Update:  Using a damp cloth I wiped clean some of the leaves to see what's underneath the fluff. In certain cases I've observed small white winged insects, in others small hemispherical brown things, but the leaves look otherwise unaffected. "
1548,subdividing and repotting drosera/sundew,I have a very nice drosera/sundew - but it's overgrown it's little container and needs to be repotted.    What should I use as the potting soil?   I plan on separating it into two or three new containers. Why should I use as containers? Right now it's in the really cheap plastic container it came in.    Should I use a glass or ceramic pot?

1549,Is it possible to revive this hedge?,"We've lived in our house a little over a year, and over time it seems like the hedge out front has gone from a healthy green to a grey / brown. I have to admit that I'm a bit of a novice when it comes to hedge care.   I'm not sure the exact kind of plants these are, however looking at images online leads me to think they are Hinoki dwarf cypresses. From the pictures (linked below) does that seem correct?  There seems to be some new / green growth here and there but the vast majority of the plants are brown. Perhaps I have not cared for them properly.  Any tips on diagnosing and/or reviving these?

She said it originally had leaves similar to my crappy drawing on the first picture. She had not watered it for ages and presumed it was dead.  I took it in an effort to resurrect it and after 6 months it has a small new sprout (look closely at the second picture)!  Questions:   What is this plant? I was told not to transplant it for fear of killing it but it has obviously outgrown its container, can I transfer it to a larger pot without killing it? Obviously it prefers partial shade, but what else should I know about caring for it?      "
1552,Abies koreana molli - diseased?,"I bought Abies koreana molli tree (25 cm high) 3 month ago. Im keeping it in my flat at the balcony door (so it shoudl have enough light). Temperature in my flat is constantly at 18-20 degress of Celsius.   1 month ago, I discovered that lower branches were attacked by Tetranychus mite - I sprayed it with spcialized pesticied that was intended to kill these. It killed mites succesfully, but needles from lower branches started to fall of (because they were damaged too much by the mites).  I though that the tree will regenerate and everything will be fine, but problem is, that currently, almost all the needles are slowly falling of (they either slowly turn brown or fall of even while green after I gently touch them).  I examined the tree again and found out, that some of the needles on few branches have green-brownish areas (first photo) on them and also little brown ""protrusions"" at the middle axis of the needle (Second photo and third).    Is this some kind of disease? Can it be cured? I searched other forums and tried to compared images with some other diseases, but found nothing. "
1553,"What are good plants for salty, sandy roadside conditions in Maine?","I live in Maine (USDA hardiness zone 5).  My lawn has a 5-10' deep mostly-dead area along most of the curb.  It stretches maybe 50 or 60 feet.  Last year I attempted to get grass to grow there without much success.  I'm interested in alternative ideas.  The area gets a lot of salt and sand during the winter as the plows pile snow upon it, and after the snow melts I need to rake the sand back down onto the road (the town eventually sweeps the streets).  It's on the south side and is in full sun.  Any suggestions for plants that can take a beating like that and come back happily year after year?  I have some hostas around that seem pretty durable.

Neighbours are worried that its roots might eventually damage supply/drainage pipes in front of the house, which are possibly about 6 6 -8 metres away.  Do I have to worry?  Can I keep the tree pruned to a height of about 4 metres in order to slow or stop root growth?  Many thanks. "
1559,Should I lift my onion crop?,Looks like my onion crop is done (end of August). The green part has died right back and I've got just the bulb sat a little way into the soil.  I don't have a good rodent-proof cool dry dark outdoor storage place to put the onions. If I lift them they'll have to live like any old shop-bought onions in storage in my kitchen. I can keep them dark and dryish but not especially cool.  I'm new to full size onions.

1561,"Mushroom growing, when to harvest champignons?","I am having a small experimental box with brown champignons in my basement. It already had two great waves of mushrooms, but it seems I waited too long because they all were opened up already.  When I watched the day before, I harvested a few big ones and left the smaller ones to grow a little more - next day all of them were opened and didn't have the typical champignon shape anymore.  I have also noticed, that my mushroom stems seem to be quite long in relation to the mushroom head (e.g. 10cm/4inches) in average.  Champignons are grown on straw substrate covered with clay-based soil (all ready and prepped by the shipper) The room is pretty dry but the box is covered with a perforated plastic sheet to contain more moisture. Room temperature is 10-14 degrees, it's pretty dark most of the day (just enough light to walk around when eyes are conditioned)  So here my questions:   How do I know when to harvest a champignon?  When I harvest, should I cut the stem or just rip/screw it out? Do I have to harvest all at once, no matter what size?  Anything I can do to grow them bigger heads smaller stems?

1563,Dealing with mealy bug infestation on jades,"I have a couple of jade and dwarf jades on my windowsill, and I think they've been infested with mealy bugs - I had an infestation about a year ago, on a different plant, and I think it spread to the jades.  The mealy bugs have spread to a couple of plants, but on most of them I spray with water and dish soap and it seems to have killed all of them. But on the jades on the window sill, it looks like ants are tending the mealy bugs, and because the jade's leaves are so close together, I can't really get at them with the dish-soap-and-water spray like I could on the other plants. What do you do in such cases?  Also, I have to say, I'm worried that what I have might not even be mealy bugs- I've included a few pictures, so tell me if it's something else that just happens to be white and similar-looking. I'll try to add better pictures as soon as I succeed in getting them in focus.  This picture is of the jade, with what I think are the mealy bugs hiding in between the leaves (it got worse when they flowered):    This picture is of a different plant (I don't know what it's called) in which the same pest appears only sporadically and can be more-or-less controlled by a soap-and-water spray. You can see one in the very center:    Here's another shot of a jade with them on it. You can see the ones that are exposed, on the leaves, but there are more beneath those which are the ones I've been having trouble with.   "

1565,How to save my Crepe Myrtle bonzai from expected death during next winter?,"I had the hardest time making a seedling Crepe Myrtles this spring. One died because I touched it like a noob then it bended an died -_-. The other one had not enough sun so it dried out and died, another one died because I tried inside and I think it was too cold...   Then I finally manage to save one from death by putting it outside under the morning sun and inside a small greenhouse to keep humidity. It had now like 4 pair of leaves and it's still pretty small. I don't know what to do with it during winter since I don't have a lot of sun in my apartment and it's pretty cold (20-21 Celsius)   I live in Quebec City, Canada where winter are long and very cold. So, I don't think I could let it outside, but at the same time, I can't really bring it inside since it won't be in a dormant state...   Would it be safe if I buy an hydroponic lamp with a timer during winter? I read that it's not an Indoor Plant... Do you have any other suggestion ?     "
1566,What potted outdoor plant most resembles astroturf in terms of required care,"I am looking for the potted plant that has the highest survival rate when planted outside on a balcony, in a small trough pot in direct sunlight, supplied only with rainwater, without any regular human care.  Ideally it should also have    any color different from dried-up brown for a significant part of the spring/summer season and  either survive snow and temperatures slightly below zero during winter or automatically reseed itself in the spring. be strong enough to not be pushed aside or supplanted by other weeds   In other words, what I am looking for is an organic plant that closely resembles astroturf or a plastic flower.  Which plant would work the best in this setting?   The climate would be European continental with temperatures between about -3°c and 23°c. The pots/troughs would be long but narrow: 15cm * 15cm * 1m or 6in * 6in * 40in (they are permanently mounted to the outer wall of the balcony)  My current survival-of-the-fittest experiment show clover to be a strong contender. However I do not know what sort of clover it is, just that it comes back each year and stays green for quite a long time.  Are there any other contenders? Is there a particular sort of clover that is specifically suited for this? Perhaps some form of cactus that can survive a few snow days? Some sort of sunlight-resistant moss? A nice-looking lichen? "
1567,Juniperus virginiana and producing berries,"As you may have noticed from other questions of mine, I am in a process of transforming my yard into a bird garden. (This is a long-term multi-year enterprise).  One of the most attractive plants for birds ever is Juniperus virginiana (Eastern Red Cedar), I found that from numerous internet sources. For example a web site says:     Eastern Red Cedar is great for birds. The berry-like cones provide   food from late summer through much of the winter for many bird   species.  The social Cedar Waxwings, for whom fruit is a larger part   of their diet than it is for most birds, were named for their love of   these cones.  Eastern Red Cedar’s dense foliage provides good coverage   for small to medium sized birds who are looking for a place to perch   safely out of view and reach from larger predators.   The base species is a large tree (30 m), but its cultivars (that are much smaller) are usually sold by nurseries, and then planted in gardens. In my area, cultivars 'Spartan' and 'Heitzii' are available.  My questions regarding Juniperus virginiana are following:  1) Are both female and male plants needed for producing berries?  2) If yes, do male and female plants need to be of the same cultivar?  3) Do some of you have berry-producing Juniperus virginiana? What is your experience regarding male/female relations? "

1571,Why are my corn plant's leaves turning yellow?,"Backstory:   I picked up my Corn Plant about a month ago (January 21st) from a local nursery. The plant had just been watered and the lady told me that I will likely have to water it once a week. After a week passed the surface of the soil was still damp to the touch so I let it go a few more days before I gave it a thorough watering.   Please note that this is my first house plant so I am learning as I go. When checking for moisture content in the soil I was mostly looking at the surface or slightly below (half and inch or so). I have since read that waiting until the soil is drier a little deeper would be better. The other thing I did (that I have since read wasn't a great idea) was to use tap water instead of purified water. The water in my area comes mostly from the ground and has a high mineral content. Worried this might have had an affect on the plant.   A few days ago I noticed some of the leaves turning yellow on the small stalk. They have since started to turn brown at the base. The centre of the sprout is also brown where new leaves should be coming out. The other sprout on the same stalk seems to be doing just fine.  I have yet to water the plant again as the soil is still damp below the surface. All of the rest of the sprouts are looking really healthy and green.   Questions  Any ideas why the leaves are turning yellow and brown at the base?   Is this a result of overwatering, mineral content in the water or something else?   Should I be trimming this sprout before it affects the rest of the plant?   Any advice will be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!      "
1572,black dieffenbachia leaves,"I just got a nice sized dieffenbachia. After transferring it to a nice pot it has been suffering. I gave it plenty of water, more soil, and a pot not too big for the plant. It did get subjected to cold for about 20 mins. Now almost half of the leaves are black and most of those black leaves are now crisp. Should I trim off the black leaves and leave the healthy ones? Or should I trim it all the way back to the stems?  "
1573,Please help me to select the best form composition for this backyard design,"Below you have the existing areas designated as marked.  Just below the access path to the left side I intend to install an outdoor sofa, parallel to the fence (it can now be seen in the 3Ds). The left side threes belong to my neighbor. The green rectangle to left bottom side is a vegetable garden  Update as requested: -NNW is at the top of the page, vertical axe of the schematic diagrams -no drainage issues -vegetable garden positioned there because it is the least visible and close to the shed where the tools are. Shed is there ..because that is the best area for it :-) -exterior brick veneer -no pets -USDA zone: 6a (Toronto) -prefer perenials and evergreen (but not for trees) -the trees in my design: Japanese Maple (Emperor wolf), Hybrid Dogwood, and again a green leaf Japanese maple. -fence segment parallel with the garden will be a perennial flowering vine (Trumpets Vine or climbing rose) -privacy was addressed by the below showed placement of the trees Basicall I need privacy in the patio area. -I do not insist to have a lot of lawn -watering will be done with an irrigation system -no previous landscaping experience (if you check the homereno diy section of stackexchange you will see my work on the patio and some pictures) - I do not intend to post more pictures -no other areas other that what is suggested.  -the BBQ is next to the wall parallel with the patio table (so that is the kitchen for now)    I basically need help with a theme not with the detailed design, something like what is encircled in green belowk: [website]-NNW is at the top of the page, vertical axe of the below diagram      And here is the best idea I could come up with. A rectangular theme where 1,2,3,4 have the same size.

What do you consider that I should change?     -NNW is at the top of the page, vertical axe of the below diagram       And here is a 3D     Here I added the sofa. That in the 3D is not exactly the style that I want.

(dwarf japanese maple of dwarf pine or strong color shrub)     View from the kitchen with a view that I am trying to block. Basically my neighbor and myself see each other from the kitchen or deck. There was a tree there but the former owner cut it for unknown reasons.     I have also added the windows in the 3D so you can have an idea what the viewer sees from the house    Update: How about this idea:   "
1574,Can a half broken tomato stem heal with assistance?,"I have round cherry tomato plants in grow bags. Recently while shifting the position to a better one, one of the plants got snapped to 90 degrees with half of the circumference of the stem broken. I quickly taped it with some plastic cello tape and small sticks supported by a larger stick as shown in picture. It has been 2-3 days now and the plant continues to grow Asif nothing happened. Will it affect my plants later on? Is there hope of regeneration? Will there be less nutrient input into my plants?  The tape is not put tightly around the plant  Thank You   Also wanted to say that the plant is now starting flowering.  "
1575,How quickly do I need to plant bare-root silver birch trees in winter?,"I've bought half a dozen bare-root silver-birches, each is perhaps just under a metre tall with a scraggle of roots. They came by post and arrived after 3 days looking pretty dry - in the past I've received things with some compost or damp cloth - so I hope they're OK and the fact they're dormant means it matters less.  I put them to soak in water yesterday but I've no idea if they need to be planted right now or can sit around dormant for some time now winter is here? What is the best thing to do?

1576,Can a Mexican sage survive losing all its stems?,"We planted several Mexian sages (Salvia leucantha) 3-4 weeks ago. They had taken very well to our hot, dry weather (Sacramento, California - Zone 9) and being watered on a drip system. Here's a picture of one of them to show their former size/condition:  .  Unfortunately, this morning my 3 year-old son decided to stomp the ever-living daylights out of several of these, breaking off all or nearly all of the stems. Here are two pictures of stomped plants, with breakage locations and surviving shoots circled:     Some of the stomped plants have no surviving shoots; all that remains above ground is about two inches of woody growth.  Should I give up on these and replace them with new plants, or is there a chance they'll survive and recover? If they could recover, how long should I wait and what signs should I look for? "
1577,How many years does it take to grow a tree big enough for firewood?,"There is some land we have doing nothing, and the idea of being semi-sustainable long-term in firewood is attractive. I believe in the northern UK, silver birch is a good choice for fast growing firewood, but realistically how many years does it take to have a trunk thick enough to use for firewood? I guess we'd say the trunk needs to be 4-6"".  Is it feasible that if I planted a copse of trees now, I could be harvesting in 10 years? How many such trees would likely be needed to burn over a winter e.g. kgs of wood per tree per year.  Is this realistically something I can do or are we talking multiple decades? "
1578,"Looking for advice on constructing a living fence, using trees or vine","I have a simple, old, rusted chainlink fence at the back of my yard.  In the future, we want to replace it.  Therefore, we have been looking for ideas.  We recently spotted a very interesting fence-like setup in our neighborhood, which uses trees trained along cables (see pictures).  It will be a couple years before we do this project, but I would like to do some more research on this idea now.  My first inclination is that trees would be a bad choice, ultimately, because they will get too big.  Therefore, what would be an ideal plant choice?  Maybe a vine?  For your information, there is plenty of space on both sides of the fence we want to replace, unlike in the pictures below.    If possible, I would like:  Good foliage all year long (evergreen - zone 6b, Boston), to provide privacy. Relatively fast growing Relatively long lived Friendly to birds (optional) Flowering (optional)  Any ideas or suggestions would be appreciated.    UPDATE:  After the helpful answer below, I've been able to find many examples of what I'm considering.  For those who may be interested, I've found using the general term espalier to helpful when searching. The Belgian fence style is particularly relevant.  As to the subject of selecting an ideal plant, I think I can narrow down some of the option.    Most important to me:  Good thick foliage for a good portion of the year Winter hardiness  Moderate to low water requirements  What I do not want:  No edible fruit bearing plants  No thorny plants  Off the top of my head, I wonder if a holly might be a good choice. I welcome any suggestions for me to explore.   "

1581,Why do some tomatoes have a whitish band under the skin?,"I've pinpointed the whitish band I'm talking about with two lines on the leftmost picture below:    In my opinion, the whitish band appears due to overuse of fertilizers (nitrates?) in growing tomatoes. But am I right? Do you happen to have a picture of a sliced tomato grown without any fertilizers? "
1582,Looking for basic info/resources for drip irrigation,"I had my irrigation system installed about 8 years ago.  The guy who did it was a landscaper but did it as a friend on the side, and as such I have no idea what corners he may have cut to save me some money.  He's kind of a bandaid-and-baling wire kinda guy, though I didn't quite realize that until after the fact.  He doesn't respond to email anymore, so now that I'm having some trouble with the system I'm on my own to figure it out.  The system has three zones - sprinklers, drip hose for shrubs, and drip line for planters and hanging baskets.  It's all controlled by a Rainbird timer in the garage.  As far as I know the sprinklers are fine.  We covered over the grass with bark mulch about 4 years ago so I haven't used them since, but they were working then.  The first area to develop a problem was the drip line.  Some of the lines just stopped dripping.  Water would run from the drip head (if that's the right word for it) if I pulled off the line, but when I replaced it with new line, still no water.  That was as far as I went with trying to fix that;  I haven't had baskets for a few years anyway.  The more pressing issue is the drip hose for the shrubs. Our puppy bit a couple of holes in it, or so I suspect, and I need to repair a couple of places.  I have tried that, first with the kind of fittings that you slip inside the hose, and then with compression fittings.  Leaks, leaks everywhere.  I found out from the person I bought the supplies from that what I have is .710 hose made by Fiskars, which is no longer available.  From her I bought some .700 hose and some .710 compression fittings, and attempted to make a repair, but the ends of the fittings with the smaller hose in it always leak.  Not even wrapping the hose with gaffer's tape to make the connection tighter is solving the problem.  She thinks the problem is too much water pressure;  I sent her some pictures of my system and she doesn't see a pressure regulator.  She wants me to cut off the fitting that the hose comes out of to install a pressure regulator.  I may have to do that, but first I want to know more about the system before I start hacking into it.  So, my questions:   what are the right resources to read to learn more about drip irrigation in general?  There's so much info out there but no way of knowing if any of it is correct. it seems unlikely to me that the system has no pressure regulators already in it - wouldn't the city water pressure have blown out the drip lines long before now?  I sent her this picture, which to me seems to show the three zones - sprinklers with no regulator, two drip zones with regulators - but she didn't seem to think I have any.  Can anyone else give an opinion?  What are those black things if not pressure regulators?   [website]one option is to just replace all of the drip hose with the new smaller stuff, but I'm not sure how to hook it into the system.  There's a 1"" pipe coming up out of the ground in the shrub bed with an elbow on it, and the other end of the elbow has hose leading to a T. The elbow has a nut-looking attachment which is glued on.  There doesn't seem to be any way to switch from .710 sizing to .700 without running into the same leaking issue I already have. Picture of this:   [website]This is the fitting she wants me to cut off and add in a pressure regulator, but it's very close to the ground and I don't want to do any cutting (losing more height) until I'm really sure of what I'm doing.  Any advice/insight will be appreciated!  Edit:  one argument against just replacing the hose is that the Fiskars stuff seems to be much studier than the new.  I have a post elsewhere on here about the attempted repair and people were amazed that my hose is still intact at all after 8 years in the PNW - now I understand why.  Every time I tried to pull the new hose out of the compression fitting it tore - the old hose is much thicker and seems much less like it's made from barely-held-together bits of something. "

1587,Placement of a front yard raised vegetable garden,"I'm getting approval from my wife to build a raised vegetable garden in our front yard which gets full sun from mid morning throughout the evening.  She'd prefer it to be near the sidewalk (spot #1) but we're both concerned with the number of dogs in our neighborhood and of them relieving themselves on our veggies!  Question 1:  How detrimental is doggie pee-pee to our tomatoes and to us?  Or what can I do to prevent that?  Question 2:  Does anyone else with a sidewalk veggie garden have problems with passerby helping themselves?  We're also considering spot #2.  And spot #3 I'm already planting veggies in, but it's in the shade most of the day due to the fence.      edit:  We live in the pacific nw, winters are pretty mild, our street doesn't get treated/plowed at all.  That's our drive way on the left.  A little worried about theft, and dog pee.  ** update **  I ended up building the raised garden right next to the side walk.  Has been working out great, if anything, a bit too much sun, and some of the plants on the west side get a little burnt.  A few people have stopped by and asked if they could pick from it :D  Built from 1""x5""x6' ceder fencing boards, it's holding up well, only going into it's second season.   "
1588,How to Get Indoor Avocado Tree to Branch Out,"I have three indoor avocado trees that I have grown from seed (pictured). I have cut two off after they got fairly high and both have started a new branch (the one on the right has barely started its branch and the one on the left and in front has awhile ago). The one in the back I haven't cut off the stem, but I have pruned it extensively after the leaves got really big. It is now starting with some new growth at the top. I have also been picking off the leaves of the one in the front left.   I don't want them to get very tall and I want them to branch out, but so far they don't like to grow leaves or branches unless it is more near the top. How can I do this? Is there any way to get the little bumps (that are present every so often up the stem) to turn into branches? How should I be pruning these trees - branches and leaves?

Each one has worked pretty well for 2-3 years but eventually leaked internally and ruined the electronics. I take pretty good care of them- drain and store them during freezing weather, install them properly, etc.  First question- am I doing something wrong or do these products not last very long?  Second question- is there some sort of mechanical version that I don't have to worry about burning out the electronics? I know there are the kind that you twist to start that automatically turn off, but I would like it to automatically turn on on a schedule also. "
1593,How much should I water my cherry tree sapling?,"My good friend's dad helped me plant a cherry tree sapling (about a handspan high) the other day (I don't know what kind). He brought over the rooted pot, dug the requisite 18-24cm depth, and transferred it (soil and all) into the hole. We then made a torus/donut barrier with topsoil, and mulched it lightly. (If I missed anything important that I should have done, let me know.)  My question now is how much do I water this thing? Initially, we flooded it (literally, caused a pool of water in the barrier) as per instructions. I know that cherry trees don't like ""wet feet"" (or too much water, hence the topsoil barricade), but how much do I need to water it?  I generally spray it with the hose (non-hard setting) for about a minute per day before the sun comes up. Sometimes I spray the topsoil/mulch barrier too. "

I have cabbages and leeks near maturity which will be the main events, but I've also put in some August sown purple sprouting broccoli. Not sure if it'll work, but I'm hoping for a crop early next year.  At this stage (September) the seedlings are still quite small.  At this time of year, high winds can be a problem. Do broccoli (and similar) plants, which are hardy enough to survive winter, need protection from winds? If so, what's the best approach?   I'm figuring it's too early to put them under glass or polythene, there can still be a lot of heat in the sun during the day. "
1609,Does heat affect spathiphyllum blossoming?,"I have two Spathiphyllums I keep in my flat, more or less similar (about the same age, pot size is similar, general plant size also similar), except for the conditions I keep them: one is in my bedroom, next to a north-facing window that never receives direct sunlight, resting directly on top of an active radiator. The other is in my living room, next to a south-facing very big window: plenty of light, although actual direct sunlight is limited, far from radiators and in a generally good-tempered environment.  The second plant grows fantastically, but didn't produce any flowers yet. The first plant has a slower growth (due to the low light condition, I guess), but ever since I put it on top of the radiator it's blossoming like I've never see before (see pic below). The ""ever since I put it there"" is kind of key too: the plant used to be next to the window, but not on the radiator, and it never bloomed before.  I've read nurseries use a special hormone to stimulate spath blossoming, but does temperature also play a part? I read spathiphyllum blooms mostly in spring, but the blooming of the one in my room started in December, with very low daylight, could it be I ""tricked"" the plant into thinking it's spring by the warmth alone?

1610,"Lucky Bamboo stem sags but seems healthy, how do I fix this?","I've had this Lucky Bamboo plant for almost 4 years. It has got two shoots coming out of the main stem, the longer of which is now unable to support itself.  We had a very dry winter and I had a hard time with a lot of my plants; it got really bad when I had to go away for a week. I came back and my bamboo was yellowing and the branch bent over and sagging. This bamboo seems to be healthy now, but that large shoot continues to sag.   Its been this way for a couple months now. I have to keep it next to something to support the shoot. I can tell that if I support the base of the shoot (about an inch above the main stem) with my fingers, the whole shoot stands up fine - so I guess it's the base of the shoot that is the problem.  Is there a way to get the shoot to support its own weight? Or is there some thing I should put in the shoot to help it do so? "
1611,What are some small deciduous shrubs that can grow in USDA zone 4?,"A particular site in our garden (USDA zone 4) has dry, sandy soil over heavy clay and gets full sun.

This backfill goes back 1 ft (30cm), but only goes to a height of 9 inches (23cm) from the top of the topmost retaining wall block.    Goal  We would like to plant trees at 6 ft (1.8m) apart (centered between fence posts) for some privacy from our neighbors. We live in a 3 story town-home so the trees have to be reasonably tall (10-12 ft [3m]?) to be effective.   We would like to plant 3 Japanese Maples (Blood Good) along the wall around 6 ft apart (and a Golden Raindrops in the larger corner). We want to buy the trees when they are already at a height of around 10 feet with a rootball of around 2 feet.  Question  As you can see, the roots can grow outwards, backwards (under the fence), downwards, but will be blocked from growing forwards. My question is what can we do to maximize the success here.. or is it a lost cause?    Edit 1, 2016-08-21   We live in Seattle, USA. There is a french drain behind the wall with crushed stone and geo-material for drainage. In the picture you can see the drain protruding out of the wall. We can certainly protect the fence from the soil using water proofing material, thanks for the suggestions on this! Our thoughts were the tree roots would grow under the fence (backwards) as far as they wanted, out to the sides and downwards. Naturally there would be no roots growing forward and this was our primary concern. It's not clear from the photo but the neighbors yard is dirt behind the fence. I did not realize the concrete they've spread would make the pH of the dirt unsuitable. Thanks for this info - is it a hopeless pH issue?     Edit 2, 2017-06-26  We went ahead and did it anyway and it's working out well so far. I've built an irrigation system into the wall, and under the lawn. This picture is from a month ago, but now that it's summer they grass, plants and trees are thriving. Let's see how it goes in the long term...   "
1613,Is it safe to change the entire soil surrounding the roots?,"Usually when you buy plants from the store, the soil type might not be suitable to them. Is it safe to change the soil completely? I mean to remove all the soil around most of the roots, then put it into a pot with new soil. I can think of 2 disadvantages:    The roots cannot hold on to new soil The roots wouldn't have adapted to new environment.   Would it help if I only changed the soil away from the roots? Are there certain plants more tolerant to such changes and others that aren't? "
1614,Can you plant seeds from Calla lily?,The flower on my Calla lily has gone and now there are these seeds where the flower was. I was wondering if the seeds were able to be planted. How long would they take to start growing? Is there anything special they can be used for? Anything on them would be nice. 
1615,Can I wash my dog on my lawn without damaging the grass?,Is it bad to give my dog a bath on our lawn?  Will the soap residue end up killing our grass? I never had a second thought about this but I've recently come across some natural weed killer suggestions that use soap as an herbicide. 
1616,My composter has developed a sour smell and a lot of bugs. What am I doing wrong?,"I set up a 7 cu ft rolling composter in my garden about 3 weeks ago and filled it about halfway with 1/3 food scraps and 2/3 cardboard/leaves/finished compost.  My kids added more food scraps, so it's probably 50-50 now. I've kept it wet and turned it, but upon opening it yesterday, it had a sour stench and a lot of bugs squirming in it.  I added more finished compost, hoping it just had too much food scraps, but I'm not sure if that's the right thing to do. Is it just 'not done' yet?  Any advice? "
1617,What triggers echeverias to grow large leaves on their flower stalks?,"I have seen this youtube video on growing Echeverias from leaf cuttings. The grower takes leaves, but he prefers to use the ones on the flowering stalk, so that he won't be left-out with a smaller rosette.  At around the middle of the video, he says that E. Agavoides normally sends-out a flower stalk with small leaves. At some other times, however, the leaves come-out bigger and more suitable as leaf-cuttings.  What would affect this behavior? Can I let all Echeverias, Graptopetalums, sedums and their hybrids do the same? "
1618,Organic matter in organic fertilizer,Is organic matter (OM) in organic fertilizer important?  Is higher OM better than lower OM? For example: NPK 3:2:2 OM 71% better than NPK 3:2:2 OM 60%? 
1619,Is there such a thing as a specifically indoor only orange/citrus tree?,"I obtained an orange tree a few months ago and it always seems to have a lot of problems. Curling leaves, yellow leaves and dying leaves. I am not looking for suggestions as to why I have problems here, but when talking to a person at a hardware store I was told that the tree was probably an indoor tree only and the heat was probably causing it stress. Other people have told me there is no such thing...  It said indoor/miniature Washington navel orange on the tag but also said that it could be outdoors. The sales person said that it's not really indoors but just miniature and that it needed lots of sun. Several other nurseries have also said there is no such thing as an indoor citrus tree that would not do well outside. So question is does such an a/c needing orange tree even exist? Could my tree be one of those? "
1620,Can my lawn be saved or is it time to dig it up and re-sod?,"The majority of the grass in my backyard has turned brown and/or died after what we believe was a chinch bug onslaught that went untreated for way too long.  It is St. Augustine grass in South Florida.  I finally treated the whole backyard with Spectracide, so hopefully that takes care of the bugs.  Now the problem is repairing the damage.  If at all possible, I'd like to avoid re-sodding due to the labor and costs involved, but if there's no alternative, then I'd at least like to make sure I do things properly to ensure the newly planted lawn thrives.  I have maybe 100-150 300-350 sq ft of surviving grass back there... is there any chance that the surviving grass will spread to fill the backyard (relatively quickly?) or that the brown/dead grass will regrow?  Is there anything I can do to accelerate the process?  If not, is it time to just dig everything up and lay down new sod?  What would be the proper way to do so in order to ensure I'll have a thriving, attractive looking lawn for my efforts?  Images below of what happened / what's left in case it helps (click to enlarge):    "
1621,Can kitchen waste be used as manure?,"Can kitchen wastes (like potato peels, onion skins, orange rinds, egg shells, tea inside tea bags etc) be used as manure? If so, how to use them?   Right now, I'm just dumping them in soil, which I feel is a wrong way to do this. Apart from looking like garbage, it takes a long time to degrade. I wonder whether they degrade at all, or just get buried in mud while watering.   Will it cause any damage to the plants? Is dumping them on soil considered okay? Or should they be treated in some way before dumping them on soil?  "
1622,"which plants is it? small in size, long thin leaves","which plants is it? My mumma says it's a tree. Please help me identify.  I've this plant from over one year now. This plant came randomly, I think because of birds might have bought the seed of this. In one entire year this plant has only grown this much.  But the base steam is very strong, in a very windy condition only leaves wave with breeze, plant is stiff at its position.  If this plant is a tree, can I bonsai?   "
1623,Is there a simple rule of thumb for caring for potted plants in an office?,"I've recently been made responsible for watering and taking care of many small potted plants around our office, and I have little to no gardening experience. There are many different types of plants, and I don't have the time to research the details of each one.  Is there a simple rule of thumb for how much/often to water plants like these, in general (and how to tell whether they're being over or under watered)? What about other maintenance (e.g. cutting or removing dead leaves)? "
1624,Should I put wood mulch around my wooden fence?,"I have a wooden fence that is 20 feet away from my house. Right next to this fence, I have planted various types of berries. I would like to mulch these berries with wood chip mulch because it is organic and it is cheaper than stone pebbles.   I have read that one should avoid putting wood mulch directly next to a wooden fence because it could attract termites.    Is this true?  Isn't the fence already wooden?  So how would introducing wooden mulch cause termites to appear?  "
1625,What is the difference between light and dark moonflower seeds?,"I have seen light tan, medium tan, and darkish brown moonflower (Ipomoea Alba) seeds. Is there any difference? Does one plant only make one color of seed? My packet this year only came with light tan ones, so I do not have a picture of the different colors. In the past, my packets have come with a mix of seed colors. "
1626,How to create an indoor gardening?,"I'm looking to build an indoor garden to grow lettuce, basil, maybe tomatoes etc..   I have numerous questions :   Are smart gardens a viable options ? (In terms of electricity cost and harvest quantity) If not, how to I build my setup ? Which lamp is the best in terms of quality of growth/low consumption and many more..   I've seen this video ([website]Do you know a website or YT video that teaches from scratch how to build one, which are the best lamps, how many light a day each plant need. I've seen much videos but they do not answer my questions above.. The main goal would be quality vegetables with low consumption lights. Is there any material that teaches from A to Z indoor gardening ? Thanks ! "
1627,I thought I was growing cauliflowers,I planted these about 6 months ago thinking they were cauliflowers. Most of them seemed to go to seed(?) but one looks rather good and I am proposing to eat it. What are they and why did most of them go to seed?    
1628,How do I go about planning the layout of a sprinkler network for my lawn?,"There are several great questions and helpful guides on lawns and lawn-repair on this site. Since it's the lawn laying season now, I've started thinking about laying a sprinkler network prior to sodding because it's easier to do so now than after the lawn's established.  Here's a generic drawing of a front yard and the green dotted area is where I want the lawn to be. How do I go about planning a sprinkler network for my lawn and what factors should I keep in mind? I'd like to be such that no water (or as little as possible) falls on the kerb/curb or the driveway or into the neighbour's property.    In order to keep it general, I haven't listed any dimensions. Do not worry about calculating the exact locations or worry about the curves in the pathway. Also, do not worry about having to cut through the pathway to get the pipes to the other side. I'm looking for qualitative answers that explain how to approach the problem.   The answer I'm expecting is something that addresses these questions (see figure below) or any others I haven't thought of.   Do I need to use different kinds of sprinklers in the corners so that they're constrained to not cross into the kerb or the neighbour's yard? If so, can such sprinklers be adjusted to move between different angles as desired? Should I choose a sprinkler with the biggest radius for the center? Can the radius be adjusted or is it fixed for a sprinkler? If there are small patches that aren't covered by the sweep of any sprinkler, should I spend the money on getting another one to cover it or should I just water it manually? (see the small radius sprinklers in the left and the right parts) How deep should I lay my pipes? Would it be helpful to have additional outlets at certain distances along the layout? The most cost efficient way would be to lay the pipes along the shortest distance from a central point to each sprinkler (see right). However, if I want to have a flowerbed along the edges in the future which might need a drip system, should I plan for a layout like in the left? Are there sprinklers that will let you tap out water optionally?    "
1629,What is the best time and method for planting cauliflowers / broccoli in a southern US climate with frosts?,"Inspired by the various brassicas questions, I was thinking of trying to grow some. Choosing something that I would eat, I'm thinking of either broccoli and/or cauliflower.  From what I have been able to read about growing them in a N.Texas climate, I can grow them as a fall crop (plant a few weeks ago and race against the first frost) or as a spring crop (plant after the last frost and race against the summer heat).  However, this recent question about wind tolerance implies that broccoli has some frost tolerance? Is this true? Could I plant seed in February (say) or even November and over-winter them outside, giving them a head-start when spring comes? Or would I be better off starting seed indoors in seed trays (in February?) and planting them out in mid-March after the last frost?  Is it possible to buy broccoli/cauliflower ""starts"" that could be planted in March? Pepper plants purchased in March always have a head start over seedlings during the spring / early summer months, so it seems like this might be a good idea for brassicas as well? "
1630,What is this plant with purple daisy-like flowers and what hardiness zones will it grow in?,What kind of plant is this and how hardy is it? Can it be planted outside and if so in what zones?  Plant is as seen in attached photo. Do not have any further information. Would also like to be advised about watering? Light and location? Plant indoors or out?   
1631,Is waking up a plant or a tree in winter harmful for it?,"As it is winter, even by keeping my bonsai Zelkova indoors, it losts most of its leafs. For a week or so, I let it outside during the day for it to take the sun.  Now, it's already producing new leafs.  Is it harmful for the tree to not let it ""sleep"" in winter and to have it produce leafs all year long? Can it be exhausting for the tree? "
1632,Will Hydrangeas Next to a Freshwater Seawall Suffer from Occasional Flooding?,"I am considering planting some hydrangeas next to the seawall at a freshwater lake. Normally the water level is about 14"" below the top of the soil but about twice a month the water level will rise to about 4"" below the top of the soil. It will stay for half a day then return to 14"". The soil is a sandy loam and the hydrangeas will receive about 6 to 7 hours of sun. I am located in the middle part of Alabama so it is hot and humid.  It is my understanding that the root system for a hydrangea is shallow but I am still concerned about root rot.  Would hydrangeas do well in these conditions? Are there other shrubs that I could consider as well? "
1633,What's wrong with my tomato plant?,"This is a Great White plant, planted about 30 days ago. It has yellowing leaves with black spots, all tge leaves are drooping, and there are very few flower buds. I'm afraid I might need to dispose of the whole plant. I planted this about a month ago in tilled soil with compost and bagged manure mixed in, along with a spadeful of organic poultry poop fertilizer, and added another half-spadeful a couple weeks ago. It was doing ok until about a week ago. The leaves are droopy and starting to yellow and get some black spots. Yesterday I found a 3"" long tomato hornworm on it which I plucked off. I mulched around the tomato plants with newspaper and straw to deal with a carpet of weeds that had been popping up. Now the soil around the plant seems pretty wet. So, what's going on with this plant? Did the hornworm do all this damage? Did the mulching trap in too much water and make the soil soggy? Is the problem reversible? I have 2 other tomato plants that are doing ok, but without many fruits. I checked all the tomato and pepper plants and plucked off a few more hornworms. Oh yeah, also I put that stake in about a week ago. Could that have pierced and damaged the roots?   UPDATE: Ok as someone requested I'm adding more pictures. I have mulched with straw, and it's pulled away from the base of this plant because I was worried it was keeping the soil too soggy. Also I added a scoop of fertilizer, but that was after this yellowing happened. The plant is about 20-30 inches away from each of the other 2 tomato plants (different varieties). Also, the other two seem to have decent vegetative growth and very few fruits.  It looks like the plant is pretty far gone now.  Should I call it quits before that fungus spreads to the other 2?         "
1634,Will a punctured stem harm my pepper plant?,"The stem of one of my potted plants was slightly chewed on by a cat. Nothing that would seriously damage the structural integrity of the plant, but it did puncture the surface with a few small tooth marks. Will the plant heal on its own? Should I be worried that damage to the surface of the stem would provide entry vectors for disease or parasites? And if so, is there anything I can do to ameliorate this risk?  EDIT: the cat is safe and healthy. The plant is a small chili pepper plant, which are indeed slightly toxic to cats, but I kept a close watch on the cat and he was (and continues to be) in excellent health. Don't think he got enough of it in his mouth to harm him. The plant is also fine, as far as I can tell, though I hesitate to close this question because a more general answer about what degree of surface puncturing is dangerous to potted plants might be helpful to some future person. "
1635,What might be eating my seedlings (no sign of slugs or millipedes)?,"I've got a little greenhouse to get seedlings started and to protect potted vegetables until a bigger, albeit temporary hoop greenhouse can be built (happening now...).    Last night I lost a dozen seedlings...the green, seed leaves were eaten.  I spent hours looking at the bottom of the flats, pots...nothing. Only the seedlings on top of my potting bench were accosted so far...weird.    I am in a hostile place for gardens...have been here for only 6 months but see that a greenhouse is the ONLY way to grow anything. I am in the same zone as most of Alaska!    My first thought was slugs...baby ones, yet no sign.  No slime trails...cleaned up debris under and around my seedling flats and put in bucket with water to see if anything crawls out.  So looked up the millipedes, no sign, and now I think maybe tiny 'army worms'?  I live in Central Oregon.  Freezing every night getting up to 70 degrees or more in the daytime. Also, finding lots of tiny chunks of recently eaten seedling leaves in the debris.  Confusing. I am very high in the gardening professional arena...but this is new, this place is new and I want to find the culprit before I decide how to deal with this.  Bought expensive, non-gmo seed and get attached to my 'babies'. Any ideas? "
1636,What can I use a bag of sterilised loam for?,"At the back of my greenhouse I have a bag of pale brown crumbly earth labelled ""Sterilised Loam"". I'm not really sure what sterilised loam is. I never bought the stuff and I can't remember where it came from. It must have been there for years.   What use can it be put to, within the greenhouse? Is it any use for seedlings, pots etc? Does it matter that it's been hanging around so long? "
1637,Is this some variety of peace lily?,I bought this plant yesterday. The shopkeeper said it's a smaller variety of peace lily and will flower more usual than a bigger variety. Is this true? And according to him the reason why the leaves are not so green is because he put the plant in full sun all day long. How can i restore the dark green color that these leaves originally have? Will the flower/spathe be smaller in this variety? The leaves are much smaller and thinner than the images i see on google. Is there any way i can make the plant grow bigger leaves?   
1638,Will my tree survive after have a section of root cut off?,I have a large ornamental tree in my garden. (I have just bought the bungalow). While I was out a large root (about a foot diameter) which was causing a wall to fall over was cut off. The leaves started to curl at the top of the tree and now further down. It was well watered that day-about a week ago. What else can I do? Will it survive? 
1639,What should I do with a secondary shoot on my lemon plant?,"I’m growing a lemon plant indoors. After I planted the seed, two shoots came out of the seed. At first I thought the larger one would overwhelm the smaller and the smaller one would die. Growing it in England I didn’t want to run the risk of killing both plants by trying to untangle the roots.  Now I wish I had, as I think it’s way too late. I now think the smaller one is stifling the growth of the larger. Is it safe just to pull the smaller shoot out? Or might that potentially harm the larger one? Any advice people have would be much appreciated.   "
1640,Is there a small variety of weeping willow?,My brief online search tells me weeping willows can grow to 50ft talk and 50ft wide. Is there a smaller variety that would only be 20-30 feet wide? Or a similarly inviting shade tree that is smaller than a weeping willow? 
1641,Can the top of a tree be trained to form an espalier-line?,"I have planted 2 apple trees and 2 pear trees into espaliers (horizontal lines, simple shape). I picked the perfect branches for the first bottom lines.  However, two of the trees have long flexible tops and I was wondering: can I bend the top of the tree onto the top espalier line?   I don´t want to cut it if I can use it. I have always seen and read that people cut off the tops, but is this absolutely necessary? "
1642,Is September a good time to sow chili pepper seeds in Hong Kong?,"I want to grow some habanero chili and jalapeño chili, but it is already September in Hong Kong. Although people said that chilis can't stand winter, I suspect the recent winter of Hong Kong is relatively warm (due to global warming) that the chili can withstand it. Should I sow it now or even in early October?  Here's the weather information for Hong Kong in 2010.  Because chili tends to love warm temperature for germination, I can use a raptile warm pad to heat it up. But can a young seedling or adult plant withstand the temperature in winter?   "
1643,How do I get rid of moles and mice humanely?,"   Possible Duplicates:   How can I get rid of gophers in a non-lethal way?    How can I get rid of rabbits in my yard   Is there any way to prevent vole lawn destruction during snow cover?     I have a problem with moles, and possibly mice, burrowing tunnels in my yard and garden and creating piles of dirt. I would like to get rid of them, but I don't like the idea of killing them or using poisonous chemicals. Is there a natural, humane method for getting rid of these rodents from my yard? "
1644,What are these blemishes on the skin of my bell peppers?,"I've noticed the following on two of my oldest bell-peppers, also called capsicum (the third pepper of that ""batch"" had almost finished going red and ripening instead):     It's not ""on"" the surface - I can't scrape it off - but it can be felt on the surface. The worst bits (on the first image above) look like maybe the skin is starting to split?  What's happening to these peppers? Do I need to take any action? Are they going to be OK to eat? "
1645,How do I encourage my tree to grow a full set of leaves again?,"Since before we moved in to our house a year ago, the tree in the front yard has had lots of dead branches. In addition bark is missing at the bottom of the tree.   We cleared 100+ dafodil bulbs that were growing around the base of the tree (along with other weeds) and removed dirt and a thick layer of old mulch piled 6-12 inches above the root spread.    We would like to keep the tree from dying.  Would it be helpful to cut back the dead branches?  Are there any soil amendments or anything else we can do to help the tree survive?  What should we put around the base of the tree (e.g. mulch)?     "
1646,How can you analyze if a land has good soil?,"I have a feeling that my question is not a good question, but don't know how else to formulate it.  I'm an engineer by profession, but I did spend a full season working in an organic farm.  I'm thinking of buying a small piece of land (less than 2 acres) in vancouver island.  I have no intention of growing food at an industrial scale, however, I'd like to grow greens, carrots, potatoes, onions...for my own use.  I realize that there are a lot of variables involved in choosing a good plot, ranging from slope, south-facing or not, access to water, etc.  But I was wondering are there techniques for measuring the effectiveness of the soil?  For example:   does it have the right PH? does it have the required minerals? is it the right type of soil?   Are there aspects of the soil that I should consider as deal breakers...for example are there characteristics that I cannot improve.  For example, if the PH is off, I maybe able to improve it. "
1647,Why are my carrots white in the center?,"We harvested all of the remaining carrots in our garden, and to our surprise a large number of them are white or bright yellow in the center, rather than being orange all the way through. The white carrots taste fine (very sweet and crunchy), but they don't look like any other carrots that I've seen before... more like a carrot that swallowed a parsnip. What causes this? Is it a problem? "
1648,Replacing a strimmer's nylon fibre line?,"I bought a Bosch strimmer a couple of years ago - it is a Bosch 3600H78G71 ""EasyTrim"".  There is now no nylon fibre line (which is the bit used for cutting grass) protruding from the spinning part at the bottom.  I presume this is because it has all been worn off (please correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that these lines are designed to wear off after a while and be replaced by more of the nylon fibre line inside).  The thing is, I can't seem to find much on the web about replacing this nylon fibre line.  Do I really have to buy a whole new strimmer because of this?  Apart from this, the thing works fine.  What I want is just to install a new nylon fibre line for cutting.  I have tried taking the mechanism apart, and the housing for the fibre line has this notch in it:   Does this look broken?  I have tried feeding the wire through as the instruction booklet says:   But every time I try to use the strimmer, the thread seems to break inside the spool; there is no thread coming out of the hole, so it looks like it is being cut at that notch in the white housing (weird, because it's not sharp; I tried pulling the thread against it hard and it didn't break).  The insturction manual obviously shows this as a horizontal slit so the vertical slit that is there, could that be something that has developed over time with use?  And could that be what is causing the thread to snap internally each time I use the strimmer (it happens almost immediately when I try to cut some grass)?  UPDATE: I tried again and the thread didn't break at the spool this time, but interestingly, the thread seems to be breaking very easily.  Although I can't break it just by pulling it with my hands, almost every time I cut some grass or something with it, I hear the pitch of the motor change up, indicating that the thread has snapped and sure enough, it is significantly shorter than it was when it had been cut by the blade; about half the length, usually.  I'm wondering whether the thread material has become ""brittle"" or weak in some way that makes it unable to withstand cutting things without snapping. "
1649,How and when should I trim this bush?,"I would like the bushes in our front yard to grow leaves on all sides.  To do this, I think they need to be trimmed to let light in.  What is the best time of year to trim them?  Should we cut them back to the main stalk or trim selectively?  Front view of bushes after some selective trimming of branches:   Back view of bushes where leaves do not grow:    "
1650,Why does this succulent/echeveria have brown leaves?,"I believe this is an echeveria. I got it maybe 6 months ago and transplanted it to this pot. It has regular potting soil and one thing to note about the container is that it doesn't have a drainage hole at the bottom.    In the past month I've noticed some of the leaves in the interior are turning a brown or dark rust color.  Why is that happening? What should I do to make this plant happy? (bigger container, different soil, more water?) "
1651,Should I be pruning my chilli plants during a Sydney winter?,"It's been an unseasonably cold winter this year in Sydney.  My chilli plants live outdoors. At the moment they are still alive, but most have lost most of their leaves.  Should I prune off the dead branches?  Should I do any other pruning before Summer kicks in? "
1652,When should I remove the spent stalks on my daylilies?,"This is related to my previous question about deadheading daylilies. I did a good job of pruning some, although I neglected others.  All of the flowers have gone by and I'd like to know when to remove the stalks. They die from the top down, so the tops can be gray and brittle even when there are green, pliable areas closer to the base of the plant. Are those green areas still providing nutrition, even when the rest is so far gone that further flowering isn't possible?   Do the dead stalks affect the health of the neighboring live ones? If so, should I remove each one as it dies? I think each is connected to an individual tuber or root system, so it wouldn't matter, but I don't know if that's correct.  Obviously the plants are prettier without dead stalks, but other than the aesthetics of it, is there a general rule of thumb?  The stalks in this picture are mostly dead, although if you look closely, you can see a bit of green at the base of one or two. Unfortunately I don't have a picture that shows the process at an earlier stage, where the stalks are alive farther up.   "
1653,Biological degeneration due to inbreeding among plants?,"Is there such a thing as biological degeneration due to inbreeding (incest) among garden plants?  For instance, if the quality in a bed of calendulas diminishes somewhat year-after-year, could this be due to too such genetic causes, or is soil depletion the likely only cause? If genetic degeneration is a relevant issue, are there specific signs when it occurs or recommendations how to avoid it?  "
1654,Harvesting tomato seeds and planting the same year,"I just saw this question: Harvesting sunflower seeds and planting the same year  Now I wonder whether the same is valid for tomatoes, too? About a month ago, I started harvesting the first tomatoes of a fast-ripening variety (42 Days) here[1]. Would it be possible to start a few new plants this year?   The current plants are already dying, so I hope to get at least some more before winter... (Don't know why, that would likely be the topic of another question.)  [1]Middle of Germany, equivalent to hardiness zone 8b. "
1655,Does my garden brickwork need mortar?,We recently redesigned the walkway through our garden to our back door. This involved lots of scaping of the land -- especially to change the waterflow away from the house. The new walkway ends with a small brick landing. The contractor just laid them down and glued them in place.   I asked when they would finish it with mortar or sand or something. they said they they were set tight enough and didn't need it.   Except when I step on it they move. And I live in Minnesota -- wont snow and ice get in there?  Am I missing or something or will this landscaping element not hold up?   
1656,What's hatched on my rose?,"While watering my rose plant this morning, I noticed it was covered in tiny brown bugs:    They're on most of the leaves of the plant. What are they? Is there anything I can do? The plant is currently kept inside - should I move the plant outside to avoid an infestation?  "
1657,What do the numbers in the names of indoor liquid fertilizers mean?,"I went to pick up some liquid fertilizer for the plant I keep at work and I saw several varieties :   Liquid Growth Indoor Plant 4-12-9 Food; All Purpose Liquid Concentrate Plant Food 12-4-8 with micronutrients; All Purpose Liquid Houseplant Food 8-7-6.   Do the numbers have any significance? If so, what do they mean? "
1658,How deep should the soil be above a new retaining wall to allow shrubs to grow?,"We have recently needed to build a retaining wall to prevent the garden sloping off into our neighbor's garden at the rear. We had to back-fill the gap created in building the wall with rubble and stone that was unearthed whilst digging the footings. The stone and rubble has been flattened and compacted for drainage and we plan to plant bushes or high shrubs to add privacy around the perimeter of the wall but obviously we need to replace soil to the area on top of the stone.   To what kind of depth would we need to replenish in order to plant the shrubs? At this moment, the types of shrubs and bushes are undetermined, but to create a bed suitable, I am unsure how much soil would there need to be to grow successfully? "
1659,Is my aloe dead?,"Top dressed my aloe a month ago and it seemed to be doing great. Watered it a few days ago and came home to it today looking deflated. Examined the leaves and they all fell off in my hand. One or two looked damaged and rotten but the majority had no sign of rot at the base. This plant now has no leaves and questionable roots. What are the roots supposed to be like?  Is there anyway to salvage this plant? Or root the healthier looking leaves that came off with rooting hormone?     I've had this aloe for about 6 or 7 years. It was a pup from my friend's plant. Moved it to the pot it was currently in about 3 years ago. The pot might be a little too big for the plant as the plant has been a super slow grower since moving it to the pot. It is an in-door only plant by a window without direct sunlight. Gave it the fish/seaweed fertilizer 1 or 2x a quarter. Top dressed it about a month ago with organic potting soil that had been mixed with sand to improve drainage. The leaf quality improved greatly since then with stronger and greener leaves. Last week it looked a little weak, gave it water (tap water) and it recovered to a normal state. Went out of town this past weekend and upon return on Tues the plant looked weak again and I noticed that one leaf looked kind of rotted at the base and when I pulled on it all the juice from that leaf poured out of it. I again gave it a small amount of tap water and when I got home today the leaves all looked deflated/saggy (nothing was strong or erect). Started examining the plant and didn't apply any pressure and the leaves started lifting out of the soil one by one. 80% of the leaves had white bases where they had been attached. The soil was a little packed feeling when I was trying to dig up the roots. The roots, I'm not sure what they are supposed to look like, but these were fibrous, dry, and something flakey was falling off revealing the fibrous inner material. I don't see an option to upload pictures here.  "
1660,How should mustard seeds be collected?,"This is probably a simple question but I just want to know any common advice for collecting seeds from mustard greens.  4-5 self-seeded mustards (Brassica juncea) popped up in the autumn and I just let them go to be green manure, but I've neglected to hoe them back into the soil so far. Now the seed pods are getting quite large and so I may as well collect those before turning the plants into green manure. Any advice on how I can collect as much mustard seed as possible from them?   Do I remove the stalks (that contain the pods) from the plant now (they're not yet brown)? I assume I'm then supposed to hang up the stalks some place safe where they won't be disturbed until completely dried. Do I need to put bags or containers under the stalks in case the seeds start dropping out by themselves?  "
1661,Managing weeds around fruit trees,"I have an elevated garden bed with some citrus trees. The problem is that the whole area is full of weeds (mostly a mix of crabgrass and dandelions) that are nearly as high as the fruit trees. Because it's elevated it's hard to mow. I've tried pulling them out, but they just grow back. I don't want to use herbicide near my fruit trees.   How should I get rid of these weeds? How should I stop them coming back?   I've thought about laying carpet over them but apparently that can contaminate the soil. I'm interested in planting something to prevent regrowth, but I don't want to have to mow it. "
1662,Should I remove the tree roots coming from the neighbouring garden?,"When I was digging out* a patch to grow veggies earlier in the spring I found big roots in the soil unconnected to anything in our garden. It looks like they're coming from some kind of palm trees planted right at the edge of our neighbour's yard. They were so thick I couldn't break them with the spade so they're just lying there underneath the patch for now.  Now this spot where the neighbouring roots are is the spot that's best suited (with regard to sunlight and airflow) to growing veggies and herbs. Can I just claim the soil for our plants and chop away the neighbouring roots or would that be bad form? What would you do and why?  Now, if the neighbour's tree was something nice like a lemon tree I wouldn't even think of doing this, which suggests that the answer is not straightforward at all.  Note: We have not met this particular neighbour because their yard backs on to ours rather than being beside ours. Obviously part of the answer might be to talk to that neighbour, but I am looking for a gardening-informed answer rather than the political one!  (*) Our soil is very poor in every way, so this is a process I go through, square metre by square metre, adding compost, mulch and a little organic fertiliser - in order to grow anything at all.  UPDATE: Adding pictures (click to enlarge) so you can see how precariously close not just the vege patch but a nectarine tree I planted at the end of winter and a few years old citrus are to the neighbouring palms (which by the way are towering at approx 5m+ high).  Palm is close to nectarine tree and vege patch:    Close-up of unearthed roots:    Palm is also close to citrus tree in foreground:   "
1663,How should I choose the correct N-P-K fertilizer values for my plant?,"I have a red coleus plant at work that's still growing despite my best efforts. I'm trying to choose the right fertilizer for it, but I'm not sure what I'm looking at when it comes to that sort of thing.  I keep the plant inside and it gets more fluorescent light than natural. I water it pretty regularly.   I'm interested not just in choosing the right fertilizer for my specific situation but also in learning about picking the right kind in general. So, how should I go about it? When looking at different fertilizers, how do I determine which one is the best for me?    Source: Michigan State University "
1664,How can I bonsai a pin oak?,I have a small pin oak in a small pot thriving since spring in Brooklyn. I would like to keep it and I am thinking about bonsai. I think I need to keep it outside for two years? Should I give it a bigger pot now? It's in a lame pot from a medium size tomato plant from Home Depot. I have no experience with bonsai other than a noted attraction to the art.  
1665,Save dehydrated transplanted shrub,"I recently transplanted a shrub that was growing too close to another shrub under a tree. Now, over a week in the Australian summer sun, the leaves slowly became leathery, then started to curl and are now brittle. This is despite regular watering; the ground around the remaining roots is always moist.  There was a lot of root damage getting it out. I didn't prune the top because I wanted to let it focus on new roots rather than new growth on top.  Should I prune back the branches so that the water doesn't have to spread so far? How can I save it otherwise? "
1666,Are bananas male/female and which ones will contain seed?,"My mum told me that there are female and male bananas (the fruit, not the tree), and only female bananas contain seed. Is it true?  She said the little black things commonly seen inside banana are not seeds, and the seeds are very hard to chew and few bananas will contain them.   Do you know something about this? Have you ever opened up a banana and found obvious seeds inside?  Can the black dots or any obvious seeds be grown? "
1667,"What are some tall, narrow perennials suited for dry soils, sun & shade?","I have an herb garden that stays quite dry. Although this garden is in the notoriously wet Pacific Northwest (USDA zone 8a), it is against a two story south-facing brick wall, under a large overhang, and in a sandy soil. Combining that with our rainless summers and a hard-nosed gardener who refuses to provide supplemental water after a plant's second year, it is surprising anything survives. And yet, all the standard dry soil herbs, thyme, chives, fennel, tarragon, sage, and rosemary, are all doing well in this little piece of Provence in Washington State.  I am looking for a plant (perennial) for a spot behind a rugosa rose against the wall. It must be narrow so it does not crowd the rose, but tall, 4 to 6 feet, so it stands up above the rose.  Here is the trouble: the typical tall, narrow dry-soil perennials — mulleins (Verbascum), yucca, or fox-tail lilies (Eremurus) — may have flowers that will go up above the rose, but that important part of the plant, the foliage, will be shaded by the rose. As the rose gets bigger, the problem will get worse.  A lily might be a acceptable plant choice, but lilies and dry soils do not get along well. My research tells me the madonna lily (Lilium candidum) is from the dry eastern Mediterranean, but I am skeptical.   Have you grown madonna lilies (or other lilies) on a dry soil and succeeded? Can you think you any better choices?  "
1668,How do I use linseed oil to maintain my tools?,"So, it's nearly cleanup time in Wisconsin and I finally got around to refinishing my tools. I bought a can of boiled linseed oil and coated the tools with it (helps prevent rust).    Now, everything is covered in boiled linseed oil.  What on earth am I supposed to do with these tools now that they're all goopey? Do I just have to leave them hanging till I want to use them again?  Would I need to recoat them if I go and use them?  And do some tools need multiple coats of oil?  "
1669,Yellow leaves in hardy kiwi,"I have multiple hardy kiwis on my balcony and one of them started to have strange colour on the leaves, dried out.      What could that be from?  My guesses:   There was a really heavy sun for the recent 4-5 days and I was out for this period so I didn't watered the plant. I started to water them back right after coming back but still, after a week, the problem remains. Maybe my balcony is simply a wrong place for those plants? I'm not sure because, interestingly, this does not happens to 3 other hardy kiwis I have on my balcony, so maybe this particular one is particularly vulnerable.  I have used running water that may contain too much chlorine or calcium. I've read that for hardy kiwi sometimes leaves begin to yellow because of excess of calcium or iron deficiency. I started to water with iron chelate and the water I use remains in a bottle for two days before using for watering. I've been doing this for a week but I'm not sure if this is a step in the right direction.  "
1670,Can my worms eat wood?,"It has been months since I put the worms in my pot. A bug ecosystem has been established and I bet those worms are reproducing fast. The bugs mostly come for the food I give them. Only a few like a red queen ant(which shouldn't be a fire ant but still, why red and not black?) would bother the worms and even then, I am sure the worms eat those as they are eating soil.  Every time a batch is close to fully decomposed(so about every 2 weeks, longer for leaves), I take a sniff of the soil to make sure there isn't too much nitrogen. If it doesn't smell earthy(In my case I don't get an ammonia smell, thank god), I add more carbon along with the nitrogen or if it is too strong, stop the nitrogen. These past few times I fed them, I gave them carbon and only carbon in the form of leaves(both dry from last year and fresh from fallen branches) because the nitrogenous smell was too strong. Thankfully it is getting back to an earthy smell so I should be able to put fruit and vegetable scraps in there soon.  Anyway, I have been keeping the large branches that fall off near my pot but haven't actually put any in there. I was wondering if I could safely add those branches if I break them into reasonable size sticks. I mean the wood could add some good nutrients and high carbon at the same time. Plus, there has to be a way to decompose them(not all of them of course, I will be keeping some of the bigger ones for making fires).  I don't have a wood chipper so that is out. Is it safe for me to add sticks of reasonable size whole and allow the bugs and worms to decompose them or is it too risky(mostly dead wood I am collecting if you need to know that with a tiny bit of young green wood)?  I have looked it up and can't find anything on the safety or risks of giving sticks to worms. "
1671,What kind of fungus is this? (I assume it is fungus!),  weird fungus found in landscaped beds around office buildings in Redwood Shores near Marine Parkway. What is it? Heavy and roughly size of a softball. I have pictures from other angles but can't figure out how to post more than one... 
1672,Pruning and caring for heuchera / coral bells that have gotten too much sun?,"It's getting into the driest, hottest part of summer here in MI and my heuchera / coral bells are starting to show some dissatisfaction with it. The outer leaves are browning and turning crispy.  My question is: should I prune off the browning/drying outer leaves or leave them on to provide a little sun protection to the inner foliage? Short of transplanting them to shade (I have nowhere to move them to!) what can I do to make sure they are happiest during this time of year?   "

1676,Bonsai basil? Tips on herbal bonsai,"I have a 5 year old basil plant growning in my window. Since I don't know much about gardning it has been a small hobby of mine to prune it and keep it alive.   My idea was to create some kind of bonsai basil. Since the 5 year old plant seams to be a bit out of controle, because of bad trimming and pruning, I have made some clones where I tried to be a bit harder when pruning.  One of these clones are now about 2 years old.   Here is a few pictures:     My question is, can I bonsai this plant? And does anyone have any tips or experience doing this? As you can see I have already tried to shape it like a small tree, but my fear is that over some years I won't be able to keep it like this, since the plant is constantly growing. So eventually it might end up looking like my 5 year old basil, which has grown too tall with way too many long and empty stems.   Thanks for any tips or suggestions :) "
1677,Is automatic drip irrigation possible without a timer?,"I'd like to put in my first drip irrigation system because I'm too inconsistent when it comes to watering. My garden patch is only 100 sq ft of ground. It's continuous and adjacent to a tap.  Some kits include a timer, and others do not. At ~$40, it seems like the timer is the most expensive part, so it'd be nice if I didn't need it.   Can I simply attach a drip or soaker hose, open the tap very little, and keep the system on constantly? Or is that going to be unhealthy for my plants?  *Note: Answers to this question cannot include manually, habitually turning the irrigation on and off. That defeats the purpose of the system for me and fails when, e.g., I go on vacation. "
1678,What is the Most Effective Ground Cover For a Large Area?,"What is the cheapest and most effective ground cover and weed blocker for a large area?  I am using black weed blocking sheets but they aren't terribly effective.  I'm not sure how to proceed.  I'm thinking tiles, stone or possibly mulch over the weed blocker, but I know it won't be cheap. Any ideas? "
1679,Advice for late tomato/pepper starts,I had planned to start some plants indoors for the vegetable garden this year to try more disease resistant varieties but between being busy and the weather being cold for so long I completely forgot.  I'm going to buy transplants but still want to want to do some plants from seeds. Namely some tomatoes and hot peppers.  A few days ago I planted some seeds in peat pellets and yesterday I noticed the tomato seedlings have already come up and are  now sitting by a south facing window with some artificial light to help them get a better head start.  Can anyone give me advice for late starts?  Things like:  Only doing a few. Should I not bother and just buy plants?  Can I start to harden them off early since the weather will be warmer or should I stick to the normal schedule?  Should I just direct sow? I have already sown some other seeds in a covered raised bed where I plan on putting some of the tomato and pepper starts.  Basically what would you do if you were in my shoes and you normally plant transplants out in the next week or two.  I'm in Zone 6. 
1680,Designing a west facing London garden from scratch. Help!,"I moved into a house last year and have finally got around to thinking about the garden.  What I have:  I have a west facing garden in London that is currently completely paved.  I have full width glass patio doors that open from the kitchen (back of the house) onto a small patio outside (just built this with the same large grey tiles as the kitchen). The doors also face west.  I plan on removing the old paving and putting down turf instead (unless you have any better ideas?)  I am looking for some ideas on what to plant, where to plant it and more general ideas of what to do to make this an amazing garden. I also have a greenhouse on the roof (long story) so I am happy to grows stuff from seed to have costs etc.  Here is a plan of the garden (to scale, 1 square is 1m2):  Patio is w 6.6m x l 2.4m  Rest of garden is w 6.6m x l1m (so 13.5m including the patio)  I have a shed in the back right corner (needs a door) I have an inedible cherry tree in the back left corner. (looks great in spring but puts the centre of the garden in shade at about 4pm or 5pm)    Here is a picture of the garden from the kitchen:  From the patio:   My giant inedible cheery tree:    Facing towards the kitchen:    Inside the kitchen from the door:   Here is a plan that you can change yourself if you like: [website]Sun  The sun hits the back of the garden about 10am and slowly covers the whole garden by about 12pm. At the sun arcs over the left fence by 3 ish the left bed has a bit of shade from the left fence (depending on the time of year.) By 4pm the centre of the garden is in shade because of my cheery tree (I may have to give it a very big haircut or we have talked about removing it completely. Seems a shame but sun is very important in the UK ;) )   What I want:  I would like somewhere to:   eat dinner  relax and entertain that is a bit more comfy.  sunbathe (could be the same area as above)  have a bbq (but would be happy to wheel it out when i need it)  have a bit of room for kids to play (dont have any yet but will do one day) that is lit at night and looks great from the kitchen instead of a black wall of glass (which is what we get now from the patio doors at night)   My ideas so far: (dont let them influence you too much)  Beds on the sides with a seating area on the right, table, charis and bench on the patio: (you can see why I need help ;) )    I was thinking about a small table and chairs on the right of the new patio for eating, and then putting some comfy seating in the middle of the garden on the right (like a rattan sofa) so we don’t put all the seating on our new patio which will block the view from the kitchen and will mean we don’t fully use half of the garden.  I also know nothing about plants (but I am willing to learn J ). I would like that garden to look great all year round and be lit as it is the view of the kitchen.  Specific non broad question Where would you put the seating?  Thank you so much for you time in advance! "
1681,How do I know vermi-compost is done?,"So a friend of mine gifted me with a bucket of worms mixed with dirt and food. It was a living colony and I maintained it so, even growing properly. I've followed quite a few proper rules, also taking into account prior post on how-to-make-compost.    I made several levels with 20 liters paint buckets with some holes in it (in the sides and below). From top bottom:   Covered with cloth and some slight weight 3rd level has the major colony where I throw food. 2nd level has a base of grass, dirt and is where they go down to reproduce. 1st level is empty with no holes to receive water from above layers.    I already know how long this takes in average, and that it should have a balance between carbon and nitrogen. Now to the question. Once this is all done:   How do I know, visually, if the vermi-compost is properly ripe? "
1682,What are proper methods to remove ripe humus from pile,"So assuming I have a ripen pile of humus, I'd now like to remove the humus but don't know if I should keep in mind any type of cautions and techniques.   Some people have a proper door in the bin that allows to remove from the lower part of the bin, or some other people even have a filter that allows the humus to fall directly into a drawer. But I have a small amount of material in a couple of paint cans. Hence the question  Is it ok to just remove humus with a regular filter?  Is this advisable? Or does this have some undesired results?

Every year I regularly mow, scarify, feed and I feel look after it well, but it seems to be getting worse year by year.  The lawn is UK based, not covered and reasonably large, some of the gaps are from where I scarified but nothing grew back. I laid seed but nothing came.   Attached are photos of it but Im not sure if I should scarify, compost, or just continue to be defeated? Also, when I do something, when should I do it? Help!         "
1685,What is the best time to water the garden?,"What is the best time for gardening? How many times should we water the garden?   I have grass and some plants (I don't know their names). I am just interested in nourishing the grass which is growing very slowly and not getting very green. I have supplied the grass and plants with vermicompost and NPK 17-17-17 complex fertilizers. I do not know these fertilizers well, I just did what the gardener requested. The garden is in India and I am not sure how to describe the weather for you now.  "
1686,"chemistry of ripening (tomatoes, and others)","From reading and inference over the years, I've come to this basic model for 'ripening': (Confidence level is not high.)   Photosynthesis in the leaves produces sugars.  These are available to nearby fruits.  This is good. There's a process in the fruits that converts sugars to starches.  This is not good for flavor.  Heat and sunlight promote this process.  Ergo, tomatoes should be shielded from the sun.   Is this true/sorta true/bogus?    If (sorta) true, does it apply broadly - say to squash, cantaloupes, peppers, ...? "
1687,Is aloe supposed to grow like this?,I just propped it up but it is really top heavy and some of the leaves are pretty droopy.

1689,"dying leaves on Japanese maple: water damage, drought, or disease?","we had this Japanese maple placed last year by our landscaper, and it did well.  this year it seemed to be doing well, but we just noticed these scattered branches with a bunch of curled leaves, and what looks to be dead branches.  the branches affected may be the new growth, but i'm not positive.  we live in Chicago. tree faces south with partial shade. we've been using drip irrigation set to a timer.  we turned the water off during our wet and cool june, but restarted it every 3 days for 90min in july, and then bumped it to every 2 days right before we left for vacation after forecast of a dry warm week.  truthfully, we didn't notice the problem until we got back.  we sent this pic to our landscaper, who later looked at it through the gate and thought it looked like ""drought damage"".   recommended to just keep watering it.  i'm not much of a gardener, but it didn't make much sense to me.  we have a silhouette sweetgum tree a few yards away that's doing well, and none of the surrounding plants look like they're wilting or damaged.    i was originally worried that maybe we were overwatering, but i now understand 90min of drip irrigation should be okay (true?).  so, i guess i'm looking for a diagnosis and advice.   could it be drought damaged? should we worry about irrigation problem? could it be sun damage? could we be overwatering it? is it diseased?  if so, should we prune these branches before is spreads?   i'm hoping someone might be able to figure this out on sight.  and since a picture is worth a thousand words...    (note the faded dry leaves and branches at the top of the tree, as well as the branch with red curled leaves to the left.)  thanks in advance, everyone!     "
1690,How should I care for freeze damaged tomato plants?,"I've read the other answers but this question is a bit different.  We've had 2 freezes each month this summer.  90 to 100 degrees (F) daytime and plummeting to 35 or lower at night.  We have covered with newspaper and row cloth and that really helped but then July and August we started feeling too safe and lazy.  Gorgeous tomato plants (30) laden with fruit.    There are a few tomato plants (6) that weren't damaged at all. I am unable to figure out what is common about them; their placement, their variety? All of the tomato plants are laden with beautiful green tomatoes.  The weird thing is that the basil, cucumbers, squash, beans were not damaged.  The sweet potatoes are complete goners.   Is there a chance by leaving the tomato plants alone (we built the new greenhouse right over the garden and just got the skin installed, no heat as yet)... that the green fruits will ripen?  Is there enough photosynthetic property within the green stems to allow this?   "
1691,"Potted small bushes put in the ground without removing the pot, just for this coming winter",I have an azalea bush and a Japanese barberry bush that are still in their original pots.

Any recommendations?  
1692,Getting rid of maggots in a compost vessel,"Related: Compost has larva or maggots?  We have a compost vessel (around 300L) which we use as a supplement to our garbage can. We don't usually throw meat in it and we don't intend to ever do it again. However, somewhere around two weeks ago somebody asked if he could throw half a kilogram of spoiled minced meat in it. I didn't know any better, so I gave him the go ahead.  The resulting stench has been growing for the past couple of days and maggots have infested the vessel.  I'm looking for:   A quick, one-time fix which if at all possible will not destroy the rest of the eco-system (or what's left of it) in the vessel.   I have very limited gardening experience and the compost has no specific goal (I haven't needed to clean it in years, it's self-regulating).  How do I get rid of the maggots the easy way?  Note: I do not think this question is a duplicate. I'm looking for a one-time fix while the answers in the other question are more of a long-term thing. "
1693,Is this fig tree disease or just malnourished?,"My folks in Berkeley, CA (San Francisco Bay Area) showed me their young fig tree the other day to see if I could figure out what was wrong with it, but I wasn't certain. I searched here (during title search) and found a nice document from the Aussies at kevinsky's answer here. It appears to be Anthracnose. However, I searched images and other fungi that attack plants and there were several other species that looked similar or more like the specimen below. I did not notice any fruit damaged obviously by this.   There were some other leaves, but not that many, that started to yellow that also had some small spots, but as you can see, there aren't distinct yellow areas around the dark spots, and on the yellow leaves I did not notice a powder as the document indicates is indicative of rust. However, on this specimen you can see there is some white stuff:     The question is, does it matter what type of fungus this is, if it indeed is fungus? Should I just buy a ""copper-based fungicide"" anyway? Also, is it safe to eat the fruit thereafter and how toxic is this stuff to kids should they get their hands on some leaves? "
1694,Can a lemon tree become an orange tree?,"I feel stupid to ask this, as there are many posts on Google about this, and I can't tell, if people are writing these stories for fun or it is real.

Are either really needed, and which connector would be more beneficial?   Many Thanks "
1696,Is it time to thin these cilantro seedlings?,"I planted 2 cilantro seeds in the same bed a few weeks ago... now I've got 3 distinct seedlings coming up in close proximity. I want to grow the cilantro for culinary use and planted multiple seeds assuming I'd eventually have to thin them.  Is now the time to choose two of these to thin out? One of them (all the way in the back) is starting to develop it's first cilantro-looking leaf.... so maybe keep that one and get rid of the other two?  And to thin, I just get a scissor and cut the seedling a little above the soil?    "
1697,What are these small flying insects? Are they bad for my lawn or trees?,"It's the dog days of summer in Central Texas, and for the last few weeks I've noticed a lot of these tiny, winged creatures in my back yard (disregard the cicada shell at top right):      They seem to be everywhere, seeking shelter in shady areas such as the bottom side of leaves, blades of grass, and under awnings or overhangs.  What are they? Are they doing damage to my lawn or trees? If so, how do I control them?  Incidentally, some of the leaves on my trees are already yellowing and falling even though we're still in the middle of summer. I can't be sure, but I suspect that these insects are at least partially responsible, as they appear to be more concentrated on yellowing leaves that haven't yet fallen. Here's an example of a yellow, damaged leaf that I picked up off the ground (from a common Cedar Elm):     I'll post a separate question about the leaves if it seems unrelated. "
1698,How can I stop Wild Grape and Mile-a-minute vines from taking over my property?,"I have river front property in Upstate New York, and I have finally given up the fight with fending off Wild Grape!  I read that some insect can be released that will only eat and kill the Wild Grape but now I can't find it. I went to the Cornell University website but can't locate it. Does anyone out there know where I can find this info? Pulling it out only seems to make it stronger the next year.  It's too far gone at this point.  That and the Mile-a-minute, (Persicaria perfoliata) that's even worse since it's so hard to pull out! "
1699,What should I do about bare patches in my lawn after killing off Creeping Charlie?,"I live in midwest Iowa and my lawn has started to get taken over by Creeping Charlie. After much reading, I went out and bought the Ortho Weed Be Gone to try and kill it off. A week ago I tested by spraying just a few patches in my front yard. After just a few days, it started turning brown and yellow so it appears to be killing it off, just how I wanted.  So yesterday, I went ahead and walked around my ENTIRE yard (1/2 acre) and sprayed every spot/patch that I could find. Now I'm in a wait-and-see step to see how it does.  What's the next step here? I wanted to put down the Scot's Weed and Feed because it says it will ""push out"" all the weeds because my good grass will grow and take over. But it says that it should only be done in late spring. Should I go ahead and fertilize with this? I don't want the spots that [hopefully] get killed off to be just completely dead, I want my good grass to come in.  Any help is appreciated! "
1700,Sun exposure of potted saplings,"I have 3 potted citrus trees (or maybe more precisely saplings: two are 16 inches high, the youngest is maybe 6 inches high), that are growing on my window ledge.  I am a little concerned, however, by the fact that they are growing very lopsided, due to the one-sided exposure to the sun: all their leaves are turning the same way.  What is the ""correct"" way to deal with this? Should I rotate them a little bit each day? Should I move them from window to window to ensure they have a ""full day"" exposure to the sun?    (I am trying the latter right now, and have put them outside for the afternoon. However, as a side question, I am a bit concerned about the wind, especially for the youngest of the three, which has very big leaves for its size. The wind is not very strong at all, but is there a chance that it may cause harm to the sapling?) "
1701,Information on killing yellow jackets at the end of summer,"I've got yellow jackets at my house in the Pacific Northwest. Normally I wouldn't mind terribly much, they can be aggressive but if you don't go near their hives they're fine. And if you need to get somewhere they have a hive, it's generally easy to hit it with a fair amount of poison, and that's the end of it.  However, we've got a lot of eves with peeling siding on the house we just bought, and I think they've gotten behind the siding in some places to build nests. What's the best solution for getting these guys to move on?  I've bought a few traps and they seem to be catching some, but there's still a bunch exploring around the outside of the house. Should I just use a few more traps with attractant? Is there a longer-lasting poison I could spray around the eves of the house that would get them as they come/go? Or should I bite the bullet and hire an exterminator to give the house a good spraying?  Or, since it's later in the summer should I just avoid them until they die off in the winter, then try to capture/kill the queens when they emerge next spring?  Also, can yellow jackets and paper wasps actually do lasting damage to a (wood) house? "
1702,Help growing a pine seedling,"Earlier on in the year (February I believe) I found a pine cone on the path. On the off chance that it might have a viable seed in it I took it home. I recovered just one seed and planted it in a small 4"" pot.  It germinated and started to grow. This picture was taken on the 1st June.   Now (28th August) it is still the same size. It doesn't seem to be doing anything, although it appears to be alive.  Is this normal for pines to only grow such a small amount in the first year? Or is there something I can do to encourage more growth?  It's placed in an area where it gets afternoon direct light and indirect shaded light in the morning. I'm in the south of England. "
1703,Alpinia hainanensis K. Schum. cuttings,I live in subtropical Hong Kong. I know a place in the mountains where some Alpinia hainanensis K. Schum.  grow and want to take some cuttings to grow in my garden.  Where exactly do I cut and how should I care for this particular species until it has roots?  I do not want to kill the mother plant in order to get it's cuttings.     
1704,Why are my apples rotting on the tree?,I recently bought a home that has an apple tree in the backyard. I don't know much about apples (or gardening in general for that matter) and I need help with a couple of things.   I'd like some help identifying the type of apple if possible (see pictures below; click to enlarge).  About half of the apples are rotting out while still on the branches. Is this some type of infestation? There are plenty of other apples that show no brown spots - will those be OK for consumption?   I live in south-east Wyoming at 7200 feet in altitude - it's a rather cool and dry climate here. We have already had several nights this month that have gotten down to the high 30s.  Here are some photos of both intact and dissected apples. One taken from tree and two taken from ground. I'm not seeing any evidence that suggests the presence of any pests (at least to my untrained eye).      
1705,Why did my lime tree stop growing?,"I have a lime tree inside behind the window in a pot. It's got a couple of fruits on it and it seemed to happily grow new foliage up until about 1 month (or so) ago. I also stopped watering it a few days ago as I thought it wasn't as thirsty anymore i.e. the soil would stay moist and not dry out. What could be the problem here? When I shake it, it doesn't drop any leaves. but also it doesn't have a whole lot of foliage on it...   The leaves on the bottom are rather new and on the branch on the left side, you can see a fruit, the largest on the tree (there's three smaller ones), too.    I tried to take another picture to give you some better context but it's difficult as it's nice and sunny out.    EDIT1 When watering it, I've been using a fertilizer that contains:   Nitrogen Available Phosphoric Acid Soluble Potash Iron Manganese Zinc EDTA   Is that okay, should I keep using it or use just water or a different fertilizer? "
1706,Are cherry leaves naturally droopy?,"I have 4 cherry varieties grafted onto one rootstock. They are Royal Ann, Bing, Black Tartarian, and Lapins. It was planted in a dormant state in January 2014 in zone 9. It gets at least 8 hours of sunlight every day. I give it 2 gallons of water every weekend. I have not fertilized it.   It now is flourishing with leaves, but all of them are droopy. Is this the natural tendency of cherry leaves? If not, how do I fix it? The majority of leaves are blemish free. There's only 2 leaves that have been chewed through by an unknown insect.    "
1707,Spots & holes appearing on rocket leaves,"Does anyone know what these spots &amp; holes are that appeared all over my otherwise happy rocket crop recently?   I'm not sure if it's related, but there has been a lot of rainfall in my area recently, and my outdoor tomatoes (several metres away from the rocket) have started showing the first signs of blight.  Many thanks in advance.    They've also been appearing on the adjacent lettuces.    Update. I just caught these little sods in action on the leaves. Some sort of weevil perhaps?   "
1708,How early can I plant tree seedlings outdoors?,"This winter, I'd like to purchase bare-root tree seedlings, which are shipped by mail in April.  I'd like to plant them outside in large pots, but I'm concerned about the roots freezing, or other cold-related damage.  Should I keep these seedlings indoors until the nighttime low temperature passes some threshold?  For example, should I keep the seedlings in a refrigerator until the nights tend to be above freezing?  I'm in zone 5, so the April nights tend to be in the 20F range, and the days in the 40-50F range. "
1709,What is the right way to pick peppers so the plant keeps producing?,"Does it matter where on the stalk you cut or remove the fruit off the plant so that you don't suck away its future earning potential?  Let's take the photo here, of a Cayenne pepper (Capsicum annuum), where the chilli is now ripe and ready to burn up the dinner plate.    Usually from the store, this type of chilli comes with some of the stem at the end of the red.  In order to make sure the plant keeps on keeping on, can you just pluck out the red part and leave the nub? Or do you have to cut it off the plant somewhere along the lines where the sun doth shine? "
1710,Can red ants harm bell pepper plants?,"My potted bell pepper plants were looking healthy until recently: wide green leaves, thick stems. But now they have this ""droopy"" look. I've noticed red ants are always on the plant stems and leaves. Are they causing this? They also seem to be stunting the bell pepper's growth. What is the most eco-friendly way of getting rid of the ants?   "
1711,Advice on saving rubber plant,"So here is our rubber plant, it is quite large and we have recently determined that  it is suffering from overwatering. It has been losing leaves daily and now only has 2 on the main trunk and 2 (probably only 1 healthy one) on very small branches. Our current plan is to cut off the healthy branch and attempt to root it. Then we will try to replace the wet dirt with new, dry dirt and try to trim the roots as best as we can. Does anyone else have advice? Do you guys think it will make it?      "
1712,How to keep elm shoots away from raised bed garden,I'm about to plant a keyhole garden. The ideal site is just a foot or two away from a bunch of Siberian elm tree shoots. The elm is pretty dead except for a number of shoots which I've cut down and covered with black plastic.  I'd like to know what I can do to keep elm shoots from appearing in the garden. Old carpeting has been recommended but I'm concerned about the chemicals in carpeting and having to deal with shredded up carpeting in the future. Would black plastic at the bottom of the bed help with elms? I suspect not.  What can I do other than to keep chopping up/digging up any shoots I encounter? 
1713,Where can I find a fruits and vegetables planting schedule for Southern Oregon?,"I'm just getting started on my first vegetable garden so forgive the noobie questions. I live in Southern Oregon and having a hard time finding a list of fruits and vegetables, and the correct time to begin planting. Is there a schedule out there?   Also, a lot of sites I'm finding are showing the harvest times, for example, August to November. Does this mean plant in August and harvest in November, or does it mean, plant at some point and they'll be ready for harvest sometime from August to November? "
1714,How can I water the plants on my balcony without dripping water on my downstairs neighbor?,I live in an apartment with a balcony and I'm having issues figuring out the best way to handle my drainage. I have a neighbor below me and don't want any water dripping down on her patio.   Are there any suggestions that you can make to efficiently water my plants? I have some saucers but I feel like they don't always allow for adequate drainage. Would an earth box or a DIY version of that be a better system? Perhaps raising my plants on something to get them off the ground?   Curious if anyone else has any suggestions. 
1715,What fungus is this?,"I've got several patches of this fungus growing in my mulch. It grows in roughly a circular patch, and produces these growths above the surface.    The effected area binds together into a disk, and when broken and flipped it reveals a white mossy underside to the patch.     What is this stuff? Is it dangerous?  How do I remove it without spreading it?   I've noticed a much larger growth in the neighbor's mulch. :(  Edit: A better picture was requested - Here is a zoom and crop of some of the mature fruiting bodies:   "
1716,How to care for my potted avocado plant,"I’ve been caring for 2 avocado plants grown from a seed for the past 2 years. They’ve survived transplanting and my flatmates not caring for them when I went on holiday. The biggest one has a lot of new growth this month and the smaller one is producing new leaves too.   This past week Britain had a nice bit of sun so I placed them outside as they were in the summer. After a week I have now checked on them and the smaller one has very bronzed leaves. I don’t think this is to do with the water as that’s just the tips, correct? Was the shock of window sun to full sun too much for the little guy?   It’s going to be cloudy and rainy this whole week so I figured I could leave them outside still. What do you advise? I wanna make sure they’re properly cared for! :)  "
1717,Harvested cane with new growth?,"I purchased a house 2 years ago that had a young (1-2 years?) raspberry patch. Last year it had a lot of growth but only produced fruit on a few bushes.  I have been waiting until spring to  determine which canes are dead and should be pruned but all canes, even those that produced fruit have new growth. Does that mean they will produce fruit again this year?  My bushes also have a lot of canes, approx 30 per plant, should I reduce this number to maximize the amount of fruit?  What is a good amount of canes per plant? "
1718,Sea buckthorn: Propagating from cuttings,"We are currently on holiday in a region where wild sea buckthorn is very common. We'd like to take some home to plant in our garden, kind of a living souvenir.  The typical method for propagating would be to dig out new shots that have emerged from the existing roots. But apart from it being forbidden or at least morally questionable I want to be sure I get a female plant and males and females grow quite intertwined here. So I'd like to take a few cuttings from select plants.  Various sources in the web suggest different methods, from rooting them in (the local) sandy soil to drawing roots in a jar of water, also some say to take wooden stems, other fresh green ones. Hm...  Now add to this my very limited equipment: No rooting hormones (some sources say it's useless for sea buckthorn anyway), simply a knife, a few food containers that could stand in as planters and some small plastic bags (the sandwich-baggie-type) if really needed for a makeshift greenhouse. Plus I'm about 1000 km from home and whatever I do must withstand a 10 hours car trip, possibly more if we do a detour.  How would you proceed?    To clarify:  Yes, I know that sea buckthorn loves to spread, I already have a male for pollination and a suitable place to plant it and no, I don't want to go to a nursery, where's the fun in simply buying a pot? "
1719,Indoor plant leaves blackening- help! It may take over second plant,"  One leaf is almost completely curled and black and the others have started progressing with the same thing. It’s been sitting with direct sunlight by the window during our winter in Maryland. Is it the cold? Watering, direct sunlight? Not sure if this is even a white birds of paradise, it was gifted to us. Help please!  "
1720,What is this decorative flower (or membrane) (or seed) (or leaf) (or fruit)?,"Do you know the latin name of this plant:            Update: There appear to be two more questions about the same species on this site:  Does anyone know what this wildflower is?  What are these small brown curved seeds?  A picture from the first question above: (one can notice oval membranes (in the top right potion of the photo) that are green at that stage, and contain seeds in the middle that just started developing - just incredible)   "
1721,Can I fix clayey soil with hugel beds?,"I heard about hugel kultur beds, study a bit about it and I think it might help me fix my backyard. It is about 13x11 m that I want to be fertile (so far only weed grows in it). It is heavily packed and a pain to dig around.  If I make a long hugel bed (across the whole yard) let it do its thing and spread the resulting soil afterwards to the rest of the yard will it work?  Also, how long does it take to break down pine wood (I have lots of left over pine boards from the construction)? "
1722,Miniature Rose Wintering,"I have a miniature rose plant growing in a large (about 2 foot cubed) container outside, where it has been doing very well. The bush is about 3 feet tall now, and I've had it since February (started it indoors, then moved it outside once the weather warmed up). I live in an area with fairly intense winters (northern Massachusetts), and I have two questions:    Should my rose bush be producing rosehips (it hasn't so far)? Or do only ""standard""/non-miniature roses produce hips? I've read that this helps the plant prepare for winter. We've already had several nights at or below 40°F here. Should I winter the plant outdoors, or take it inside? I've heard that this kind of rose can stand up to Massachusetts winters outside, but since it's in an above-ground container I'm guessing it's not as protected as a planted rose bush would be. Either way, is there any special treatment I should give it throughout the winter? So far all I do is water it regularly, since this Spring I repotted it using a long-feeding potting soil.  "
1723,Can a Japanese Maple Tree be Tapped for Sap to be Used in Syrup?,"I have a large Japanese Maple tree (about twenty feet tall) in my yard and am wondering if it can be tapped for sap to be made into syrup.  Is this possible or would it just be a waste or taste bad?  If it is possible, can you please provide any pointers that could help me get a good yield and not permanently damage the tree? "
1724,Why is my hosta shrinking?,"I have a blue giant hosta. It is in fertile soil and gets plenty of water. I had been dividing it every few years but lately it has started to shrink. I don't want to lose it. How can I get it back?  Update: The plant is smaller than it's ever been before. See pic. The hosta used to cover the entire tank, except for the cap.  It is now about 30 years old. Does that have anything to do with it?   "
1725,Advice on growing clematis armandii,"I've just recently endeavoured into the world of gardening, and one of my first adventures is to successfully get my newly purchased clematis armandii to wrap around my Pergola.  Now i'm planting the clematis into the ground but looking to wrap it around my structure of the pergola, so in an ideal world it'll grow up the wooden structure legs, but I'm wondering is the structure too thick for the clematis to wrap onto it?  And shall i buy some string to wrap the bamboo support in the clematis to the structure or just plant it next to it and leave it to wrap itself?  Also can anyone recommend any good plant feeder for them?  Thank you in advance. "
1726,Are these cobwebs harmful?,"I have a new succulent that I'm taking care of, but over the past couple of weeks it has been picking up some fluff that looks a bit like mould but that I believe is cobwebs of tiny spiders. I've read about spider mites, and so I'm wondering:   What are these cobweb things, and do they appear dangerous to the health of the plant? How can I get rid of them without harming the plant (it's about 2 inches across)?    "
1727,What should I do after a pepper plant has partly broken under its own weight?,"So, I'm sitting here on my computer and get the life scared out of me by a horrible cracking, rustling, thudding sound. I turn to find one of my peppers plants has broken - apparently one of the upper sections has just ripped off under it's own weight and dropped on to the toy box.  The plant was quite top-heavy anyway (all the fruit was high up) and the section that's broken off was supporting three peppers. As far as I can tell the plant is healthy, at least there's nothing obviously wrong, so I assume it has just suffered under the weight of its own fruit?  The break isn't very clean, as it has torn down the stem of the plant, as you can see in the images (apologies for the uneven quality):     Ignoring the fact the plant's effectively been pruned of a chunk of foliage, what should I do about this? Is there potentially something wrong with the plant? Anything else to bear in mind? "
1728,Indoor small tea plant and Vinca care,"Sorry to make a double question but I'm totally new. I live in an apartment, and I really want to have a tea plant, but unfortunately I have no space for huge plants. In here I read I can have certain tea plants indoors, but which is the smallest I can get?  And, apart from this subject, I bought a Vinca pot, and I really want it to be ok indoors. I don't over-irrigate it and I water-spray the leaves, do I have to do anything special to keep it okay? and, is it okay if the flowers fall in few days? "
1729,How do I get tender green beans?,"We have successfully grown a nice crop of green beans this year, but in contrast to store-bought beans the skin is quite tough.  Is there a trick to cultivating more tender beans? Or is it a matter of which breed we use? "
1730,Leafs turning yellow and fall off rubber fig,"What is happening to my rubber fig? Rather many leafs are now turning yellow and  falling off? I got this large plant last autumn and it now the end of the Winter season (here in Central Europe). One branch seems mainly affected, but it is not the only one. I'm watering it approx. every other week, and it's situated in a living room with normal room temperatures.  Can somebody perhaps please diagnose the situation and indicate how such a plant (rubber fig a bit more than 2 meters in height) should be cared for in general.    "
1731,"Is there a type of garden shredder that can handle leaves, branches and wet materials?","Is there any type of all-purpose and durable shredder that can shred leaves and a few small branches, and some wetter materials like vegetable waste? I'm not looking for a brand name, just to find out if one shredder can take care of all my needs.   Would a lawn mower be the best choice? "
1732,Is it safe to compost junk mail?,"   Possible Duplicate:   How should I use corrugated cardboard for mulch?   Cereal boxes for mulch?   Which inks which can safely be added to vermicompost bins?     I've been shredding and composting my junk mail, to get rid of the damn stuff and also get carbon into the compost.  But recently it occurred to me that the inks could have toxic stuff in them and that this could get into food in the garden.  Does anyone know anything about this? "
1733,"Can anybody identify these small, red insects?",What kind of bugs are these? Are they good or bad for plants? Do they bite?   
1734,What are the pros and cons of rubber vs wood mulches?,"This question is just concerning the realm of landscaping for flowers around a house.  We need to add mulch again this year, as the previous mulch has broken down enough that there are some thin spots and some spots not covered at all.  We noticed that every place now carries rubber mulch.  Would this also be good to use in our various flower boxes around the house?  What would be the benefits and drawbacks?  If rubber mulch lasts indefinitely, how long does it keep its color? "
1735,Taking care of a peach? tree,"I moved into a home a couple of months ago, and there's what seems to be a peach tree in a container, right next to a Queen palm.   Is this a peach tree? I can't tell as the fruit is really small and we haven't tried to eat it yet :) The tree seems to have branches in all directions, but the last 12-18""+ of the branches have no leaves on them at all, just some fruit. Is this normal? Should I prune the tree - either now or wait till Nov/Dec? I would feel better if this was in the ground - should I plant it now or wait till winter/early spring? I would have hopes of getting some edible fruit next summer, anything apart from organic fertilizer and a regular watering schedule I should take care of? Is it okay if I plant it in the same spot - it's 3ft from the trunk of a Queen Palm but since the palm tree's 30ft tall, there's ample sun throughout the day. I'm just not sure how ""wide"" this can go.   This is in southern California.   Thanks!     "
1736,Can I reduce the amount of dirt that collects in corn salad / mâche?,"It’s that time of the year again when I enjoy home-grown corn salad (aka mâche, lamb’s lettuce, rapunzel...).   While I love the taste, cleaning is a nightmare. Traditionally, the little plant rosettes are served whole and dirt tends to collect in the leaf axles, which means as a cook I have to do multiple soaking/rinsing rounds or the salad has some rather unpleasant “crunch”.   Is there a way to prevent or reduce the amount of dirt that collects in the plants already in the garden? I suspect splashing rain is a factor, so should I cover the soil? (Which may be difficult, considering that the individual plants are just a few cm in diameter and so far we just throw out the seeds over the prepared garden bed.) Does the type of soil matter?   Any idea? "
1737,"What are some quick growing, flowering, climbing/vine plants that  can be grown from a container garden (USDA zone 6)? What is a good time to start?","My main gardening space is a paved area in front of my house surrounded by a white picket fence. I planted a few vegetable and herb seeds in containers there this summer, and from seeing the failing-yet-still-pretty pumpkin vines creeping along the fence, I think next year I'd like to try planting some climbing flowers.   My front garden area is in a sunny location, facing southwest, in a zone 6 region. I was thinking about trying to grow some clematis in a container but I don't know if it would be cool enough at the roots, since there's a lot of heat from the pavement in the summer. I'm also not sure when I'd want to start planting it.  Also I think my goals may be unreasonable- ideally I'd like to have some nice flowers by the end of next season, as I may be moving in a year and a half. Is this realistic?   Basically I would love some info on   What I could plant in this situation When to start on it (can I start now?) Would it be possible to get some flowers within a year? Any advice on doing this or alternatives if my goals are unrealistic!  "
1738,Ideas for small no low-maintenance plantation,"I am from eastern Europe and looking for ideas on how to domesticate some small acreage (about 0.75 hectare). I don't want to sell this area and maybe there are some ways (which won't require lot of work, let's say no more than some maintenance, few times per year) to create some revenue out of it in the future. Maybe there are some species of conifer which meet these requirements? Are there are any interesting books / websites that provide an overview of the possibilities (with regard to possible income) for beginners?  "
1739,Dwarf Alberta Spruce Winter Burn,"I have a Dwarf Alberta Spruce which is showing signs of worse-than-normal winter burn. Not only have the needles on the south side of the tree browned, but the new buds on that side also appear to have died. I've heard that this was caused by our severe winter - when the trees should have started taking up water, the frost line was still 5 feet deep, and the plants dried out.  Is there anything I can do to help the tree along other than just wait? Pruning will not help, correct? Usually I have some winter burn, but the new buds remain green and by early summer the tree is as beautiful as ever.  "
1740,"Can cherries be coppiced or cut at 1.20m, and stay alive?","I have an unknown-age cherry that has a significant damage at 1.40m originating from wind and snow breaking a large branch (or several ones). The wound is large, about half of cambium is missing, and the wound is longish (35cm). It also looks really ugly, and there is, it seems, no chance that it will look nicer in future.    Otherwise, the tree seems fine, and perfectly healthy, the tree is fighting with the wound successfully. The tree is a smallish cherry, less than 4m high, and doesn't grow anymore, it is probably one of ornamental ones. It is an upright tree, not weeping.  What are chances that the tree will regrow if I cut the trunk at 1.25m? And what about cutting the whole tree?  If such treatment makes sense, what would be a good time for cutting?  Another option is to plant an evergreen bush just beside the tree just to bring the wound out of sight. "
1741,"What is considered a ""cool climate"" for cool climate plants? Can these plants better survive temporary frost?","Is a ""cool climate"" one that doesn't freeze? Is it one that doesn't freeze until such-and-such a month? Or is it one where the temperature almost always stays above freezing?  Related to this, would ""cool climate"" plants have a resistance to occasional night-time frosts?  I ask because I'm wondering what chance cool climate vegetables would have in my backyard garden, where it can be consistently frosty starting anywhere from the end of November until mid-January.  "
1742,Does limiting plant size decrease life-span?,"So, I'm looking into growing plants indoors(specifically, trees such as Meyer Lemons and possibly apples). It's my understanding that a plant's size can be limited by keeping it in a small pot, and trimming it's roots if it becomes root-locked. Assuming this is all correct, would this decrease the plant's life-span? If so, would it mature faster as well? "
1743,Revitalizing two old plums,"This is a silhouette of my two plums:    They are very old, around 10m high, for some longish time left alone, and exude a lot of sap. They have nice fruit. Birds like to rest and observe the area in their high crowns.  Is there anything I can do to revitalize them? Or just leave them as is? "
1744,What color should a greenhouse be?,"I'm shopping for a greenhouse to protect my tropical fruit trees from winter frosts. While browsing, I noticed that greenhouses are predominantly green or clear. What are the advantages of each color? I don't quite see the advantage of a green greenhouse. Wouldn't any color in the windows block parts of the light spectrum?    "
1745,Why the stores sell trees that look like bushes,I just bought a Eureka lemon tree. It is in a one gallon container but it looks more like a bush than a tree. It is about three feet from the bottom of the pot to the top of the branches. Does this mean it will be a small tree like a bush and is it better to be a bush or a tree? Is the bush going to produce smaller lemons than a tree? If it is a tree at what length does it need to be cut at the trunk in order to produce more branches? 
1746,What flowering bulbs grow well in an air conditioned office environment?,"I want to grow some bulbs in my office. I have windows facing east, west, and north-east. The office is air conditioned, but not humid. What flowering bulbs can I plant, that will grow well under these conditions?  I'm specifically interested in rain lilies and hyacinths. Will these grow well indoors? "
1747,Can I make a sapling out of this part of the plant?,"I have this bromeliad and on the low parts, close to the ground it is growing something unusual. It looks like it might be an offshoot, but I am not sure.   This is the plant:   and this is (possibly?) the offshoot:    So can I use it to make another plant? And if so, how do I get it off the plant without hurting it? "
1748,French Drain Below or Above Retaining Wall?,"I have water running into my crawl space and part of the reason I believe is from hill run-off above my house. I have 3.5ft high retaining wall all around the uphill side and water comes up underneath and thru it like little fountains and / or over the top of it during rain storms. My soil is very much clay, mixed with odd layers of sand. Various spots have sandstone, which is what my house is built on.  Here is a picture looking down from the uphill side on the problematic area where I've started digging my proposed trench.    Here is a picture looking up at the problem area from down the hill. The hill continues to drop another 12ft of elevation behind me in these tiered railroad tie walls. My proposed trench is on the left and the RR Tie Wall is left of that. Concrete retaining wall sticks out 12ft to the right. The ground here is full of sink holes due to run off / rivers coming over the tiers as well as up and underneath the other side of the concrete wall.    I have a 5 day break from rain. The question is basically as stated - is it ok to put the french drain there at/near the base of the wall where you see I started digging it or am I risking eroding the underneath / base of the wall? And, how deep should my trench be? I was thinking of just encasing perforated pipe in pea gravel a few inches below the surface and finishing off the top with 1-2 inch stone. I guess I'm going to have to dig underneath the tiered walls going down the hill or rip them out in order to get my drain going further down the hill. "
1749,Drying a pot of fresh soil vs drying a pot of soil with bugs,"I was trying to dry a fresh pot of soil that I bought from a local store and a pot soil that had been exposed with bugs in it (ants/ flies/creepy crawlies). After about 3 weeks, the pot of fresh soil had completely harden while the other pot with bugs are still moist. Trying to get some opinions here if a garden with such biodiversity (ants/flies/creepy crawlies/visited by lizards) are better for plants or one that is kind of sterile? Are they considered pest or good for plants? "
1750,What should I do to improve a lawn growing on a new construction lot?,"A builder built a new home for us last year (2013) and put sod in the front, and a seed blanket in the back.  The seed blanket came up somewhat patchy, so we bought a few bags of seed and a spreader, to put down some additional seed to help the lawn grow.  Also, we don't have a sprinkler system, but I did move a single hose/sprinkler around the yard to help it grow.  Fast forward to Spring 2014: the snow has melted, and the grass is starting to green.  The back yard still has lots of patches, and weeds are growing everywhere.  What am I doing wrong?  What would be the best way to help thicken the back yard as I would imagine this is the key to a weed free yard.   Should I pull weeds manually or use an herbicide? Should I fertilize?  Should I aerate early in the year?  Should I put down more seed?  Edit:  I wanted to include this wonderful article I found online as well: [website]"
1751,"Should I remove tomato ""side shoots"" growing from cotyledons?","I'm growing tomatoes and in accordance with all the advice I am pinching out side shoots, which I take to be the shoots which sprout out roughly bisecting the angle between the main stem and a 'branch'. By this definition I have side shoots growing out between the the main stem and the cotyledons. Are these side shoots to be pinched out, or rather the beginnings of branches which will later develop side shoots of their own?  Update:   Exhibit 1: One tomato plant with cotyledons; shoots in the vicinity thereof.    The question is simply, are these side shoots, or branches? "
1752,"Is it OK that the polyethylene sheeting for our greenhouse is opaque, not clear?",We purchased 4mil polyethylene that was supposed to be 'clear' but it is opaque white.  We can not see through it at all. Is this normal? Will this work for one year?  
1753,Why has the stem of my chili plant split?,"I have a couple of newish chili plants growing in pots on my windowsill, they're about 15cm or so tall and seemed to be doing well enough so far. However, this morning I've noticed that the stem at the base of one of these plants has split open from just above the soil to about 2cm up the plant.  Here are shot of the whole plant with the split highlighted:   And a close up image of the split (click for full size image):   Why has this happened? Can the plant survive and be healthy? If so, there anything I need to do to 'help' the plant? "
1754,Should I redo this pruning cut?,It looks to me that this pruning cut left too much of the branch that was cut:      Should I cut again closer to the trunk?  Should I perhaps fill the hole in the center with something?  Is there a sign of any serious illness?  UPDATE: New photos:         
1755,Plants to stop water erosion on a hill,"I have an area on the hill I want to protect against water eroding the soil. I will be putting large rocks there, but I also wanted to put some plants to reinforce soil with plant roots. I have a lot of cedars on my property and was thinking about transplanting some to areas I need to reinforce.   Will this work? What is the largest size tree I should be transplanting? How big hole and a ball I need to make? Any other tips? "
1756,Identify a plant and recommend how to save it,Can please somebody identify this plant? Are there any suggestions to save it? Its leaves are weak and getting yellowish. 
1757,Harvesting sunflower seeds and planting the same year,"I live in NY State and planted ~30 sunflower plants this year.  I started them very early indoors so had early blooms - I've had seeds on the faded flower heads for ~ 4 weeks now.  Is it possible to harvest the seeds, immediately plant them and have new plants sprout this year?  Are the seeds viable or do they need to be dried further (or aged)?  I have searched but haven't been able to find the answer to this particular question. "
1758,How do I fix an area of grass that was ruined using a vinegar/salt treatment of dandelions?,"Following some advice from the web, I boiled vinegar and salt and applied it to some dandelions in our lawn. I probably should have used less of it though - I poured 2-3 tablespoons on the dandelions. Now the grass has yellowed around each dandelion - about a 3-inch radius.  Will the grass come back in the future? Have I permanently ruined these spots? What's the best way to fix them up? "
1759,How do you manage dying leaves on young plants?,"If a leaf on a plant is shriveling or yellowing, should you cut it off or leave it there? If you do the former, should you only snip off the damaged parts or should you cut off the entire leaf? My question is pertinent to young plants that may have only around 15 leaves, so each leaf is relatively important.  "
1760,Is there a way to kill the mold on soil surface in pots?,"I’ve had mold growing on the surface of my pots for a long while. I kept removing the soil from the surface but that didn’t help. So I went and bought expensive fancy soil!! I took out the plants from the old soil and tried to clear them ip as much as I could and replanted them in brand new pots with the new soil. But bingo! There’s mold growing again.   These are citrus plants that I’ve grown from seeds and I use citrus feed when I water them. I live in a reasonably cold and very damp climate and I don’t water them too often (once a month or so?) they’re indoors behind south facing windows. Is there something I could spray onto the soil to kill the mold?  I searched thoroughly before posting this and did read the relevant posts which mostly suggest preventing mold. However I’m wondering if there’s any anti fungal spray I could use on soil, ideally home made.   Oh, by the way, could it be due to the plastic planters? I notice the other plants taken out from the same old planters and planted in clay pots don’t have any fungus. Maybe the plastic isn’t breathable? But for now I’d like to kill the mold if it’s an option as I don’t have the time to buy other pots and replant again.     "
1761,Are these growths on my houseplant roots?,"I'm not sure of the name of this plant. It doesn't grow too quickly, maybe one or two inches each year.   Is the growth in the bottom picture a root? Can I clone this plant from that?   (Click on the pictures to see closer views.)     "
1762,Seedling selection and germination time,"I planted some of my veggies in starter pods, and let them sit for a while without adequate sunlight.  The first ones to germinate first shot up way too fast and their stems are getting long and skinny.  If I select only the shortest, or the last to germinate in the group, will I be introducing plants with less desirable traits into my garden?  Or is there something to be said about late bloomers, or germinaters in this case? "
1763,Is there a way to help a stunted Euonymus europaeus grow more?,"I have an Euonymus europaeus.  However, it appears its growth is stunted - it consists of only one weak looking main branch (I really can't call it a trunk) with several smaller branches.  There is no visible damage, or illness. It is just so small.  How can I help this bush achieve its full potential?  This is a picture from wikimedia of a full grown euonymus:    [website]Just imagine 1/30th of the bush in the picture - that is my bush.  I should say that it is situated in part shade area.  Note: I know there is a similar question: Best help for a tree with stunted growth? I hope I can get more advice specific to this bush.  Should I perhaps cut it to the ground? Or only add some natural fertilizer? "
1764,How do I determine what vegetables I can grow on a hot arid island in June?,"I will be spending four months on Lanzarote this year, an arid island off the African coast, and want to grow vegetables for home consumption there.   The summer is sunny, hot, and dry; local agriculture (mostly potatoes, squash, carrots) is suspended until the winter months. Extreme temperatures during the summer have been known to reach 38-40°C (about 100-105°F).   There will be access to water, but it's expensive so water economy is an issue. I'm looking into things like wicking beds to minimize water use.  This year, I will be there between June and late September before moving there permanently next year. This June, I would like to start to get my bearings, build the soil, and try out some vegetables to see whether they are viable in summer.  Because the climate is so different here, the usual seasonal growth charts you get for veggies don't seem to really apply.  How would I determine what vegetables even have a faintest fighting chance in this climate, with June as a planting date? (or is that date completely unsuitable?)  Here are the average temperatures on the island:   "
1765,Making boggy ground less boggy and planting trees,Does planting a tree in a boggy ground make that ground less boggy?  This is a kind of follow up to another question: How can I improve drainage in a rainy area lawn with little manual labour? 
1766,White fuzzy balls on jade plant roots,  My jade plant has these white fuzzy balls forming on its roots. Not sure if this is some type of mould or insect eggs?  I don't currently use any pesticides on my succulent... can anyone recommend how is best to get rid of these white balls?  This happened a few months ago and I cut away all the roots which seemed to have this stuff on them (was left with barely any roots) but they seem to have come back so it must not have gotten rid of whatever it was.  UPDATE: I have removed all the soil from the roots and sprayed them with isopropanol alcohol. Fingers crossed they stay clean]1 
1767,How much depth is needed for grass mats?,"Simple question, how much (if any) soil is needed between the grass mat and the fleece barrier?  I'm building an enclosure for my tortoise and I want to place grass on trays for it to roam. The trays are 8 cm depth (3 in), I will have a bed of expanded clay with a fleece barrier on top for drainage that takes about 3 cm (1 in) leaving 5 cm (2 in) for the soil + grass. Is it enough?  How thick are grass mats? How much soil is needed? I plan on using Zoysia Emerald grass (it is short and readly available here). "
1768,Why are there plants specifically designed for greenhouses?,"I have read that tomatoes for greenhouse culture need to be varieties designed to be grown in greenhouse environments. What are the varieties, and where can I get them...just by mail? And what other plants should I look for that would grow better in a greenhouse than out in the garden? What about normal tomatoes planted in a greenhouse, not out-of-doors in the vegetable garden?  Will they produce well, or under-produce?  How about planting them near the south wall that I open for ventilation, where they'll get direct sun until they are over 3' in height?   "
1769,Is this poison oak?,"Here is a picture of a plant from a forest in Northern California. Is this poison oak? I’m guessing it’s not, though it does have leaves of three and a slightly longer middle stem. Can an expert identify this or tell me how you know what it is?  A follow-up is that there is a second plant in the background, which might be the same. This plant is common near where I live. What is that plant?   "
1770,What is causing yellow discoloration on the leaves of my Camellia?,"Some of the leaves on my flowering Camellia have yellow patches on them. The discoloration is only on new growth on the south-facing side of the shrub. Some of the leaves show physical damage, but others don't. The Camellia was here when I bought the house, so I don't know what variety it is, but it has pink double flowers.  What is causing this? If it's something that I need to treat, how do I do that?  Click any image for full size       "
1771,Grow oyster mushrooms in vacuum cleaner bags?,"I'm giving oyster mushrooms a go, growing in coffee grinds in a plastic bag. Having an air filter in a bag, like the ones in purpose made mushroom bags, is a recommended technique. What if I used a vacuum cleaner bag ? These allow air passage and also filter out small particles. Workable idea ? I bought some that have a synthetic inner layer that I don't think the mushrooms would consume. What about maintaining a good moisture level by just spraying the absorbent bag ? I'm a noob so let me know if these are bad ideas. Thanks. "
1772,I would like to know if it is possible to plant trees in a difficult spot,"My question is;  what trees can I possibly plant in the area between walls? I was unable to load a picture of the (walls)so I hope I can describe this.  I have 2 walls in my backyard (the issues), a 4ft block retaining wall and a 6ft block privacy wall.  The retaining wall is 10ft in front of the privacy wall. The privacy wall is on a hill about 12ft from the ground with a (?) grade which the retaining wall is holding. We live in a high desert area, so shade is needed.  The length of both walls is 60ft. They run parallel to each other East/West.  "
1773,LED light or Indirect Sunlight for Hawaiin Tree Fern?,"How should I best grow a Hawaiin tree fern in my New York City apartment? I have LED lights that are currently helping my Thai and Genoa Basil plants grow. Should I also put the Hawaiin tree fern under the LED lights? Would the fern be fine on the window sill, which mainly gets indirect sunlight (maybe at most 5 hours of direct sunlight during the summer)?  My apartment does not get a lot of direct sunlight (hence the LED lights for my basil plants).   Also worth mentioning I just repotted my fern after a suspected case of root rot. It appears we were either overwatering the Hawaiin tree fern or the pot was not draining adequately.  "
1774,Can I use sweet potato leaves as a dynamic accumulator?,"I have been thinking about growing Comfrey in my garden but I came across several articles mentioning that once it is in your garden, it is there forever because if you cut the roots, it grows like a earthworm, doubling itself.  I have Sweet Potato growing throughout my garden and I think it has a similar property with the roots. When I dig it up, it just comes back again, and grows throughout most of the year.  I found a list of dynamic accumulators that can be turned into compost.  [website]Is there any reason why legumes such as a sweet potato aren't listed? Where they listed on some websites, they are only considered Nitrogen sources. I'm not sure whether the root length is considered when categorising plants as dyanmic accumulators. Clovers don't appear to have a deep root system but are also dynamic accumulators. Could it be that ""Dynamic Accumulators"" are only weeds by definition?  Here is a nutritional factsheet for Sweet Potato leaves. [website]Apparently it is high in Calcium, Iron, Magnesium, Phosphorus, Potassium, and Manganese. This is similar to the Comfrey's nutritional content. So, would it be advisable to use this rather than planting Comfrey which I don't believe I would use other than for creating an organic fertiliser?  Some other weeds in my garden are Grass, Lemon Balm, Dandelions and Clover, but only the Dandelions would decompose to a rich compost high in trace elements and there aren't many of those growing in my garden.   I also have Biden pilosa growing in my garden because of my neighbour, but I noticed that if I use it in my compost, it just grows faster, so I just place it in the bin. "
1775,Potatoes left in the soil for winter,"I did not have time to dig out the purple potatoes I've planted during the spring, now it's early winter, not much frost is expected in this area. Will they survive if I leave them in the soil and will they grow in the spring again? Shall I dig them out now? Shall I harvest them during next summer? "
1776,How to attract white stork (Ciconia ciconia) to a garden?,"Is there any way to attract white stork (Ciconia ciconia) to a garden?  I found this on the internet, but without much further info: A wikimedia photo of a man-made structure for stork's nest: (is it necessary to construct this to attract storks? is it effective?)   "
1777,Tomato pruning vs fruit products,"My question is simple. If I cut off the non-flowering branches, will it force the plant to put more resources into the already growing fruits?   More specifically, my tomato plant is growing beyond where I can contain it. A cage thing isn't an option. So I was wondering, can I cut off the shoots that are growing out of bounds, and would that force more resources into producing the fruits?  "
1778,What's the purpose of mixing native soil with store bought soil?,"On most store-bought soil, it gives instructions to mix the soil with equal parts of your native soil. Why should I create a mixture instead of using the store-bought soil purely?   I usually buy Kellogg garden soil. The texture is quite coarse - like that of ground up wood chips. I have been mixing this garden soil with store-bought soil conditioner/amendments, but never with my native soil. My native soil is tough clay, so I was hesitant of mixing it in. Could this be the reason why I'm having such bad luck in my first year of gardening? My blackberry and strawberries shriveled after one week of planting. However, others such as raspberry and goji berry are thriving.  "
1779,Can these plants survive spring floods?,"A maintenance company planted several plants just besides the river bank, actually in the area that is under the water for a week or several weeks in the spring (sometimes this repeats several times in a year, extending into summer and autumn).  These are photos of the area in question, and unfortunately I can't provide at this moment any better photo:            Just based on these pictures, do you think that these trees and shrubs can survive high spring waters? What are these plants anyway? "
1780,When and how to repot this cactus?,"I found this cactus in a store, it was labeled as ""cactus"" but I think it is one of the giant cacti (see my previous question). It is about 12 cm in height (without spines).  I was wondering when is the best time to repot it into a slightly larger pot? I bought the plant yesterday (9th of March). Is the pot of the store still big enough, is the soil still good, and when is the best season to repot it? I think Springtime, right?  Second question, how to do this? Do I use gloves (what kind?) or a cloth for this? Any advice on repotting these spiny big plants?  Thanks in advance!   "

1782,Getting maple syrup from V shaped maple,"I have a V shaped Acer pseudoplatanus (2 leaders, starting right from the ground). Do I need two holes to use all juice producing capacity of the tree? Or one is enough? From what part of the tree the juice comes? How does it flow, in which direction?  (The tree is 14 years old, and I don't plan to get any juice for half a dozen years, but I am asking in advance) "
1783,Will galvanized hog paneling hold up vegetable and fruit vines?,"I noticed that hog panel fencing is a lot cheaper than pipe fencing, and was wondering will the hog panel fencing hold up the weight of different vegetables ranging from kiwiberry to cucumbers (maybe a small watermelon)?  How should I determine how many t-posts I need? "
1784,"Palm tree droppings, sap and seeds","Our condo complex has three very large Mexican Fan Palms that are dripping sap and shedding seeds that are very sticky. Our parking lot is coated in these seeds, they get tracked in and stick to everything. The sap has ruined my car cover (better than my paint, right?) We've lived here for a long time and this has never happened before, at least to anything near this extent. Anyway, what is causing this mess and how to we prevent it from continuing? "
1785,Is laying sod higher than existing lawn best practice?,"The background for this is here. The short of it is that the sod guy laid this down last year, and I have a feeling he skimped on the job. Didn't prep the soil, just came and laid the crap down and left.      I talked with him immediately after I saw it. He informed me it needed time to settle. My lawn is clay with little to no nutrients, I doubt it's going to 'settle', but I don't do this for a living. These pictures were taken yesterday, the sod was put down just before winter, Oct. 2013.   I have a couple of questions:   Is it best practice (or even common) to lay sod higher than the height of the existing lawn? How can I (if possible) fix this? I'm thinking there's no way to tamp down this sod, so I may have to lay more sod at the same height?  "
1786,What is the safest weed killer to use around a toddler?,"I have a grass lawn, a vegetable garden, and a strawberry patch. The garden is in a raised bed, but no fabric under the soil or mulch on top. The strawberries were in a nice bed to themselves, but have become choked with weeds and it's our fault because we have slacked. (Remember, I have a toddler to chase ;) ) The grass has not been treated with a weed &amp; feed since we bought the house almost 3 years ago and is looking like it needs some saving as it is also getting choked by weeds.  What's the safest weed killer for each of these to use around my toddler? What ingredients are OK and what should I avoid? "

1788,Drying Oregano and Mint,"I went for a vacation of 4 days and when I came back I found my Oregano drooping.  Before going I watered it very, but, still it didn't work.  Same happened with my mint as well.  Both the plants are not dying.  How can I save them?  Some of the oregano branches looks like they are broken. Should I trim them? I already watered both the plants. Looks like they are doing well till now.   Should I cover them in plastic and put in shade ?   Anyone any help ?   Here is the photo  "
1789,Venus flytrap/Dionaea muscipula doesn't grow traps anymore,"I've had this Venus Flytrap since about 6 months. It was in bloom when I got it (for some reason shops like to sell flowering plants). I read that flowers take a lot of energy from the plant, and since my Flytrap started deteriorating soon, I did cut out the flower, and the flowers that came after it.  Soon the Flytrap died back even more, it grew a few new traps, but then it was mostly gone.   I also read that they can do that in winter, so I didn't worry too much yet, and kept watering it (not too much) and waited.  After a while, it started to grow new leaves, but without traps. If you look very closely, you can see just a hint of a very tiny withered trap at the end of each leaf.  I cannot find any reference to this behavior. Is it normal? Is there something I can do to make it grow real, working traps again?  In comparison, my sundew, which should have a sunny spot as well, was bought at the same time, and seems to be flourishing. It has nice sticky droplets and it catches many fruitflies and other small flies.   The flytrap, withering.   The sundew, doing fine, so it seems.  Thanks in advance for any insights.  Update  Following the advice TeresaMcgH gave in her answer, I've investigated the lighting conditions, and although it is a very bright spot, the plants get hardly any direct sunlight.   I did some reading and apparently the Drosera thrives in lots of direct sunlight as well, and its leaves should be reddish. A Drosera that is mostly green is also a sign of too little light. Since mine was pretty green, I took that as an extra confirmation that Theresa was right.  I've moved both plants to the other side of the house, where they will have direct sunlight for about 5 hours until about 2PM and still a lot of daylight after that.   Let's see what happens...   Update 2: Two weeks later  Well, it seemed that during spring (more light), the stub-traps were already slightly larger, but the first new leaf that unrolled since I moved the plant has grown an actual trap. It's not very big yet, but at least it's a complete trap that actually opened. I've got good hopes for the future! :-)    Update 3: Seven weeks after moving  I think I can consider my plant saved! The difference the new spot made is far greater than I could ever imagine, but look at this; A bunch of new traps, a couple of which caught some insects when I put the plant outside during a sunny day. Lots of new traps in the making. Instead of just pale green, the traps have hints of red on the inside and outside.     I notice the same effect on the sundew. It's as full as it was before, but it completely changed colour. Now, the weather has been extremely sunny here in the past two months, but still I wouldn't have expected this to have this effect so soon.     I hope the updates don't bug you (this might have been the last one), but I think this case should convince anyone who would have any doubts about the effects of (more) sunlight.  Update 4: Summer's end  I've moved the plants outside a couple of months ago. At first I kept them in the same pots, which worked well and they flourished. But after a while I moved them together to bigger 'pot' of peat. I thought this would make it easier to keep them moist. By that time, both the fly trap and the drosera (Alice Sundew, I'm guessing now) were grown big enough to be divided. In the bottom-right of the picture you can see half of the fly trap. The other half is hiding at center top. The one on the left is a different plant I added later. The drosera is divided and individual rosettes are spread around the bin. I've added some other species as well (drosera binata, drosera albino (?), two types of sarracenia and a nepenthes.     So far they are doing well, and I hope they'll make it through winter. I'm not sure every one of these species can handle frost, so I think I'll move the whole thing indoors before that time. Anyway, it seems like the plants are doing even better outdoors. I'm saving up for a greenhouse, and I guess that will certainly unlock some new possibilities. :) "
1790,Removing Bushes and ground cover weeds. Do I completely change the soil?,"I am removing bushes and ground cover weeds from the front of my house.  The soil is full of roots and weeds.  There is a Hydrangeas plant that I will moving to another part of the front yard, after I take out those bushes and weeds as well.  Should I completely remove all of the soil before starting to add new plants? Or should I just get a landscaper? "
1791,Just transplated Zucchini and bean outside and noticing some white spots on leaves and brown stems,So a few days ago I transplanted my pole beans and Zucchini plants into containers. I'm noticing a few things on the plants.   We had a heavy rain and some wind a few days after I transplanted them and one of the pole beans leafs had fallen off. I'm now noticing browning on the stems.       My zucchini leaves have big white spots on the leaves. I transplanted these 2-3 days ago.  My other Zucchini plant has little tiny white specs forming on its leaves    Not sure if its just over watering. Pests? Not enough food? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! thanks so much!

1793,Pet Burial Plant Suggestions,"Two nights ago I lost my beloved dog, Heidi. I buried her in my backyard, and plan to get a plaque to mark the location, and plant some flowers. It was suggested to me today that I plant a small plant that might not grow very big, and will be easy to transplant in the future. That way if I ever sell my house, I can take the plant with me, and it will be like I'm taking the plant that she gave life to.  I think it's a really good idea, so I would like to try it. Can anyone give me suggestions on a plant? I don't know the first thing about gardening. I'd like something small that preferably is very pretty.  I live on Long Island in NY, so whatever is planted would need to be able to survive winters with snow.  Is there such a thing as a red fern? I read the book ""Where the Red Fern Grows"" as a child and I would love the idea of planting such a plant for her, if one exists. I searched Amazon and didn't find anything though.  Thank you in advance for any suggestions "
1794,Can wild columbine and myrtle (Vinca minor) be planted together?,I have both columbine and myrtle (Vinca minor) which I bought for the side of my property along the drip line (lead-contaminated soil so no edibles there). Can I plant them together or will the myrtle choke out the columbine (or vice versa)? Any guidelines for planting? (a few small bushes are already growing there and plenty of day lilies available for transplanting). 
1795,"Areca Palm just dry, or something more sinister?","I have a palm which I've had for 18 months or so and it's the best growing palm I've ever had. Big, frequent fronds, and quickly grew about 2 foot.  Occasional browning at tips, or dry-green leaves(not browning) and more watering solved it.  I had overwatered it early and lost some branches that went yellow. (so this doesn't seem like overwatering)  In the past 2 weeks, it's suddenly going very brown from the tips. Very quickly a large branch went brown (not yellow) and lots of other leaves are going that way.   All winter leaves basically stayed green. Flat temp dropped to sub-10 degrees sometimes. Watered less in winter, but still at least say, 500ml a week. It sits by a large south facing window. Weather here has been cold, then 2 weeks of very sunny warmth (palm getting lots of light behind a window), now back to mostly-cold &amp; cloudy Get some spidermites, which I try and get rid of, but not an epidemic. Well draining pot (I water it until it flows out) Roots had hit the sides, but still room to grow downwards. A few new fronds are still appearing, but they're not as tall as the biggest ones I've had. I try and keep humidity up with water on radiator &amp; vapour. I thought at first, they were burnt from being by the window during the sun, but then whole leaves went down.   I was concerned I had overwatered it in winter, so took it from it's pot to check it wasn't soaked, and the soil is very dry about 10 inches down. (Top 2 inches are still wet, but I only just watered it) No sign of any bugs in the soil, but some white specs (perhaps mould but very tiny amounts) near some roots...  Have I just under-watered it during our very sunny period? Is it craving a weekly heavy water?        I think this is similar; My Areca Palm is dying  I also noticed this new frond has gone all wonky... in case that's vaguely related :)  "
1796,What are the bright green patches in my Fescue grass?,"I've started to notice more bright green patches in my lawn as we move towards spring.   How do I eliminate the patches?  Also, the border of my lawn continues to die. Could this be caused by an irrigation issue or from the edge trimmer?   "
1797,vacation care for indoor plants,"I recently bought self-watering pots.  Currently, I am using it for Rosemary. But, is it even a good idea to use self-watering pots for indoor herbs?  Which plants or herbs are good for self-watering pots?  Also, herbs tend to affect most when I am away for 1 or 2 weeks. How, can I not kill them if not using self-watering pots.  "
1798,Should I remove or leave the plastic around the trunk of my new tree?,"This tree arrived today to me via mail: (Click on the pictures for larger view.)     It is wrapped in several layers of plastic.  I plan to plant it in couple of days.  I will remove the plastic packaging around the root ball of course, but should I perhaps leave the packaging plastic around tree's trunk, just until spring? Is plastic an appropriate material that will help the tree overwinter?  The species is Pinus pinea, also known as the stone pine, umbrella pine and parasol pine. It's actually a Mediterranean plant, and I am concerned about the possible negative impact of a harsh first winter to this beautiful plant.  I live in European zone 8, where the lower range is approximately −12.2 °C (10 °F).  The weather forecast for the whole winter this year is mild, but you never know. "
1799,How do I link a specific garden plant to its native plant community?,"If I have a garden plant, say for example, Herniaria glabra, and I want to identify its native plant community, i.e. the dominant species, associated species, soil, climate etc., how do I go about researching this information? What references/resources are available to accomplish that?  The best I have been able to do on-line for the example cited is find a region of China and an altitude range. "
1800,New topsoil has puddles on it,"Problem My new front garden seems to have pools of water on it for a good few hours after rain.  Background I've just had the front garden redesigned, leaving us with a brand new area for planting and a new driveway. The area where the garden now is is our old driveway. The old tarmac drive was broken up, but left. Underneath the tarmac is solid chalk. Retaining walls have been built around this to effectively create a raised front garden to a height averaging 0.8 - 1.5m deep.  The infill is made up of a lot of rubble from the building works, like tarmac, bricks etc. Then there is some average quality soil, and finally a good 400mm of fresh graded topsoil.  The whole garden is to be used as a bed for planting topiary, shrubs etc - no lawn. We have planted lots of buxus already. 24 hours after watering, the soil still feels very sticky. Is this due to poor drainage? With all that rubble at the bottom, some ungraded soil (200mm perhaps?) and then 300-400mm of topsoil, I thought I would have good drainage.   Photos      Question  Can anyone explain why I would be seeing puddling of water after rain? Is this something I should worry about, or is this just usual for topsoil as it starts to compact down after delivery.   Any help and advise appreciated as I really don't want all this money to go to waste due to a mistake I've made so early on. So would rather try and rectify now if there is anything that needs doing. "
1801,The Tree of Knowledge according to Enoch,"In the Biblical tradition the Forbidden Fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil in Eden is commonly thought to be apple, grape, pomegranate, fig, carob, etrog or citron, pear, or mushrooms.   According to the pseudepigraphic Book of Enoch,      ""It was like a species of the Tamarind tree, bearing fruit which resembled grapes extremely fine; and its fragrance extended to a considerable distance. I exclaimed, How beautiful is this tree, and how delightful is its appearance!"" (1 Enoch 31:4).   What tree best suits this description? The Carob tree (Ceratonia siliqua, known as St John's bread, locust bean, locust-tree, carob bush) seems an OK candidate except that it's male flowers (rather then it's fruit) resemble grapes exceedingly fine, not it's big chunky seedpods.  Any candidates? "
1802,Growing Goji Berry from dried seeds,"I am wanting to grow some Goji Berry bushes.  A few months ago I soaked some (regular dried store bought) Goji fruit, then cut them open, used the baggie method to germinate the individual seeds and transplanted them.     The plants started growing, but all of them (and there were more then a dozen) died after transplanting them - I suspect I transplanted them way to early, and also the environment was wrong.    I want to try again now that Spring is on its way - but want to avoid the mistakes I made.  [ At the moment New Zealand is going into Spring its still quite cold - most days are 10-15 degrees C outside, but a lot of sun, and nights between 3 and 15 c.    I can keep them indoors in an artificial environment, but I suspect my growing light is not great for them.  I also have a polytunnel - this seems to be nice and warm during the day, but cut out a lot of light and probably only marginally warmer then outside at night ]  Questions:   Should I remove the Goji seeds from the Goji Berry when trying to germinate them or am I better just planting the whole Goji Berry fruit in the ground ? Does the temperature of the ground need to be consistently over 22 degrees for germination to occur ?   Once germination has occurred how do I get the seedlings to a point where I can plant them in the ground outside without them dying ?  "
1803,Do eaten leaves on a guava tree mean the tree needs help?,"I planted a guava sapling in my yard and in a few months, have noticed a few leaves being 'eaten'.    Is this just some insect feeding of a few leaves and should be of no concern ?   Or is this an indicator that the tree needs assistance ? If so, what can I do to help the sapling ? The sapling gets plenty of sunshine and water. Its in a tropical city in Australia, if that matters.  "
1804,Cutting height of Cedar Hedges,"Last September we planted a hedge about 200 feet long. We used white cedar and the trees were 9 - 10 feet tall. In mid-July my neighbour decided that they didn't care for it, so they chopped anywhere from 4 - 6 feet off of 50 of these cedars. Two of these trees have already died. Some trees look like they have been broken off at the top and not cut. And when the branches go through the fence, and these bits they are allowed to trim, she cuts the whole branch off right back to the trunk of the tree. The company that planted these trees said that they would fill out but never would catch up to the rest of the trees and to keep it uniform, we would need to replace the cut trees. The police officer spoke to a Christmas tree farmer in order to get a second opinion and the farmer said that, yes, they will eventually grow in height although it may take a year. My question is: Will these cedars really grow in height? The neighbour got off with a simple warning to not touch the trees again but that doesn't mean that they won't do it: she figures that cutting branches right off is her right. What do I do? Leave them or replant them? "
1805,Would turning the compost actually slow down compost decomposition?,I watched this timelapse of litter decomposition. This makes me wonder if turning the compost actually slow down composting by discouraging detritivores and burrowers to live in the compost. I would imagine turning the compost frequently makes it a less ideal place for most of these organisms (so the frequency is important) which seem to be efficient at reducing the particle size of litter (fallen leaves are usually the bulk ingredient of the compost) as in the video.   Does turning over a compost pile slow down its decomposition? 
1806,Excess Zinc in garden soil,"I had the soil in one of my garden beds tested for a wide spectrum of minerals. This bed was originally filled with bought topsoil and mushroom compost, then it was cultivated with parsnips and spinach, finally I have added some homemade compost. The results show an excess of Zinc, with potential toxicity.   (1) What could this be due to?  (2) How do I avoid problems for future crops? I am still eating the parsnips from that bed, and have seen no problems whatsoever so far. I am planning to plant tomatoes and courgettes in May.      "
1807,"How can I convert a mulched bed to dirt, and should I?","We have several flower beds that are mulched. The problem with mulch is that if you buy it every year, it's quite expensive ([tex]500/year for us). And if you don't buy it every year, you get a lot of weeds and the weeds are quite hard to remove - they form sort of a surface-level web of roots that cannot be simply picked out without disrupting the bed (usually with a small digging tool).  It occurred to me it would be easier and/or cheaper to have dirt and just run a hoe over it once a week to remove young weeds. But I think to do that I'd have to remove all the mulch and also cut out the landscaping paper. Does anyone have experience doing this? Will I regret doing this and be going back to mulch or stone in a couple years? "
1808,Will foliar sprays affect bioavailability of nutrients in soil and vice versa?,"Calcium nitrate is a nitrogen fertilizer that can also be used to give plants calcium.  I've read that you shouldn't combine calcium nitrate with sulfates and certain kinds of phosphorus (I believe this is because the combination may make certain of the nutrients so they don't absorb how they should or something).  My question is, if I have such as potassium sulfate and/or magnesium sulfate in my soil, could I get around the problem by spraying calcium nitrate on the leaves instead of adding it to the soil where the sulfates are? Would the plant absorb them all just fine, in this case?  This question is for plants in containers. If the kind of plant matters, this is for peppers, tomatoes and such. "
1809,New backyard grass,"I removed my pool and my backyard is also full of (small) weed. I was thinking or renting a rototiller, till the whole backyard. Level the whole yard (to fill up the pool hole). After I would buy nice sod and put it on top.  Would that be enough? Will the weed grow through the sod or will it just rot? "
1810,Killing off Emerald ash borer (EAB),"I want to kill the EAB in my wood before they get to my trees. And if they do get to my trees what is a safe effective way of killing them? I would use pesticides if I want to but I would prefer to do something more natural. Anything on how to take them out would be great. And if possible provide the name of the thing or how to make something. Thank you all! Edit: I did read the other question but really tells me nothing about how I could Kill them. It helped with the preventing part. If I needed to kill them, what would be the naturally way to go. A small addition to my question is what bugs attack and kill the EAB? Is it worth trying a insect that would kill them?  "
1811,Why is my apricot seedling turning brown?,"My first apricot seedling has leaves, but they are turning somewhat brown. I can't find any information about this, so maybe someone knows?    Could it be too humid? It lives in a little plastic greenhouse box. Could it be too hot? It's in direct sunlight for about 5 hours in the mornings.   They seem to be sprouting very easily, so it seems the conditions are at least somewhat okay.   Here is a picture:     Today I put it in indirect light, and took the plastic cover off so there is good ventilation, but I have literally zero idea what's happening. It may be too late for this little guy (or maybe not?), but there are a bunch more who just got their roots and I want those to live!  Edit: another picture. This seedling is quite small, so I can't get a more zoomed in picture. The browning is pretty obvious though.   "
1812,Why would cuttings from the same hibiscus exhibit different growing behaviors?,"Last fall, we planted six cuttings from a friend's hibiscus syriacus. They were leafy, and sized from about 7"" to 12"". They're pictured in this question. Though they lost all foliage, the stems held up nicely through the winter. I'm in Massachusetts, USA, and we usually get down to -5°F or -10°F in the winter. This year was unusually warm, and stayed mostly above 0°F, if that matters.   Over these last few months (June, July, August) we've been experienced severe drought conditions, but we've been babying our little saplings, and they're growing nicely.   Five are leafing out, especially at the base, and not budding. They're each about 16"" high and 12"" at the widest point. However, one is much taller, about 40"", but is pretty much a single stalk, and has 8 buds. (I couldn't get a good picture, but in some I can see the purple flowers beginning to unfold.) The taller plant is gently tied to a stake in a number of areas. It has a protective screen like the others, but I removed it to get a better picture.   The plants are spread out around the yard, and each gets about 8 hours of sun a day, from about 9 am to 5 pm. (The taller has begun getting an hour or so less sun as we're heading into the fall.) We water them equally. We don't amend our soil or treat it with anything. We put fallen leaves around all the stems last fall, but haven't used any real mulch.   The bushier are in dirt that has only ever grown grasses, clover, dandelions. The tall one is in a section that up until last year was completely covered in a juniper ground cover, including everything you see, all the way to the big rock. We had to dig at least 8"" down to get all the roots, and then we aerated that soil. So even though we didn't add anything when we planted the hibiscus, the consistency was definitely looser. It makes sense that the soil in that spot might be more conducive to growth. In fact, I would think that a looser dirt and wider area might create a bigger, rounder, plant, but that isn't what's happening.   Is it that five are busy growing leaves, while the other is using its energy to produce flowers? If that is the case, though, is there are a reason it would be that specific one?   I've posted a picture of the skinny one and an example of the others. Click on them to get a closer look.     "
1813,What's this? Vine with heart-shaped foliage and green-to-black fruit (Identified: Creeping Cucumber),"New member, probably my first of many ""what's this"" type posts. I've just recently gotten into gardening and there are a lot of wild plants around my house which are just lovely, hoping to incorporate them. But first, identification!  I live in Memphis, TN -- zone 7.  Today, I opened my bedroom window for the first time in months and found a very pretty vine growing over it. Looking closer, it produces berries. I want to seed it along a fence in the back yard but I'm not sure if it will choke out the other plants.  The berries, which look and feel like tiny oval grapes, start green and turn black. Many were covered with a specific bug:       Nearby on the ground was a clump of trumpet flowers, which I've also spotted vining over the trees a few dozen yards away. Maybe the same plant?    I just love the heart-shaped foliage.  So, what is this??  Edit: Sitting inside at the computer, just saw a beautiful baby cardinal fly onto the vine and pick a cucumber. Guess that means my chickens can eat it, too. Definitely going to spread this. "
1814,Should I make a mini-greenhouse for my temperature-sensitive bonsai?,"I have a 5 years old Fukien Tea, which just arrived in home. I live in the south of Spain, and my city has strong temperature changes. The temperature goes aprox. like this:   Spring: 20 - 25 º Celsius / Fahrenheit 68 - 77 º  Summer: 35 - 40 º C /       F 95 - 104 º  Autumn: 15 - 25 º C /       F 59 - 77 º  Winter: 1 - 12 º C /        F 32 - 54 º   I keep the bonsai in my desktop, which is in front of a big window with sunlight, but I read Fukien Tea should also go out. Apparently the perfect temperature for it is 20 º C/ F 68 º. I'm worried about summer and winter for this little guy, I thought to get a mini-greenhouse for keep it humid and temperature-shock free in winter.   Do you think is it a good idea or the bonsai could be harm? What could I do in summer?  RPI/Arduino homemade devices are possible options, do you guys tried anything?  Thank you in advance. "
1815,Getting lemon trees to branch,"I have two lemon trees which have been hesitant to branch anywhere but at the tips where I trimmed them because they were growing too tall. They're about 1 year and 8 months old now. I grew them from seeds from a lemon bought from local grocery store.  Would you have expected the lemon trees to have branched out more by now? How do you recommend I encourage them to branch out more?  The taller tree actually did sprout three branches at the very top where I had trimmed it; I pinches all those branches off because I did not want it to become top-heavy.  My apologies for the rotated pictures - that's not fixable to my knowledge within Stack Exchange, and rotating them on my desktop prior to uploading didn't help.   "
1816,Best way of pruning Cardinal Creeper,"I've got this 2/3 year old Cardinal Creeper in a 16"" container that's become really bare at the base, making the stem look like coils of rope. The new growth seems to happen at the tips, leaving the base still bare. I did have to cut back this plant down to 1.5'/2' length from root last year due an uncontrollable aphid infestation(it was growing up somewhere I wasn't able to reach with the sprays), but it grew back nicely. Now I'd like to do some hard pruning (so as to remove the lengths of bare stems at the bottom), but am wondering if the plant would grow back up every time after a hard prune? Does the plant's ability for regrowth decrease as it ages? Also, it just shed leaves last month and is showing new growth now... though it's still winter here, and spring is still a month away. Am worried about cutting off the new growth and affecting the plant. Some of the new growth has the same curled/abnormal leaves that I'd seen during the last aphid attack, though I don't see any (yet?). What's the best way ahead?  17th Feb, '18: The plant might not have survived another hard prune, so that was some useful advice I got here. Here's the plant after new growth - the ropes are hidden :) Ignore the Bougainvillea, will you? It seems to want in on any pictures of it's neighbour clicked :D "
1817,Why are my tomatoes cracking and what can I do?,"(Memphis, TN. Zone 7)  First garden. I'm growing tomatoes in two parts of the yard. One gets more sun than the other: the partially-shaded area is producing well, but in the the sun-baked area they're cracking before they can fully ripen. Cucumbers, okra and peppers grow fantastically in these same beds, but I suspect the tomatoes are just not getting enough water. I've tried watering the hell out of them, but still, no dice.  Some have tiny spots, as well as cracks.  There are also hundreds of little flying bugs, tiniest things I've ever seen. (Searching this site, they look like whiteflies.) I don't use anything artificial, pesticides, etc. It's possible birds are getting in there, too.  Several tomatoes have actually rotted on the vine and fallen off as mush. :(         The (single) plant is also enormous. Could I simply need to trim/prune it back? I've done zero maintenance and just let it grow wild. Maybe it's just trying to grow too much fruit at once?     The tomatoes in the back yard, partially-shaded, have none of these problems. The plants are also smaller. Those are romas and grape tomatoes, though; I don't remember what kind the problem tomatoes are.  The soil in both areas is a mixture of dirt and compost (chicken &amp; rabbit manure mixed with dried leaves and pine shavings) that had ""cooked down"" over last fall and winter (with my chickens scratching at it.) It was black gold by the time it went into the beds, so I don't think it's a nutritional deficiency, but maybe?  What can I do? Should I partially shade them? Is it just a bad spot? They're beautiful tomatoes until they crack, I'm so disappointed! "
1818,Can I grow a mini-sized date plant from a fresh seed?,"Is it possible to create a plant from a fresh date seed in a mini pot? When I say ""mini"" I mean a pot with diameter of maybe 6cm, like this one? (see image below)   I already tried this 3 times with 3 seeds that had roots coming out of each, but they all died. So, I'm wondering if the issue is with me, possibly inappropriate soil or a too small pot, or it's just not possible to make it grow as a mini plant.   The soil I'm using is a mix of:   1/3 vermiculite  zeolite organic soil    "
1819,How close should a maple tree sapling be to marked utilities?,Last summer I planted a maple sapling in my yard. I foolishly did this without calling 811. This month I have other work to do and had my utilities marked.  When the marking was done I discovered that my phone and cable lines were ~6 feet apart and my maple sapling was planted right in the middle of those two lines.   How far should my sapling be from these lines?   If it is too close should I transplant it or just kill it and start over with a new sapling in a better location? 
1820,"Diseased roses: salvagable, or a danger to my other plants?","This poor potted rose bush (don't know the type) has just been getting worse and worse:         Clearly a disease, but what? Can it be saved? I've already pruned 2 branches that had basically died, but it's still spreading. I'm worried it will spread to my other plants -- can this infect my nearby wisteria, hydrangeas or peppers/tomatoes/etc? How far can it ""hop""? "
1821,Euphorbia milii (crown of thorns),"I am pretty new to keeping plants, and I have a Euphorbia Milii as a houseplant now sitting in a terracotta pot. I planted it in cactus soil, and I generally water it well, waiting for the soil to dry out. I test this by poking my finger into the soil a couple of inches. There is about an inch of volcanic gravel at the bottom, and only one drainage hole. The plant is about 10 inches tall, and hasn't grown in the year I've had it.   Basically, since I got it, it's been steadily losing leaves. It also doesn't seem to be growing any new ones, and so the result is a sparse - looking plant. The weird thing is that it's continuously blossoming, and I see more flowers on the way.  This is nice and all, but I really would like the plant to grow, and look a little fuller.   Does anyone know what might cause such a plant to grow not leaves, but flowers only, and not increase in size? The pot seems a little large for the plant, but I figure it doesn't really matter as long as the soil drains well. After doing some reading on the matter, I think I should ditch the gravel and put in some more soil, and possibly drill some more holes in the pot. Do these sound like a good idea?  Thanks! "
1822,"What is this prickly, burr-covered plant with different colored flowers on the same plant?","I'm trying to identify a prickly, burr-type plant growing wild in my yard in Massachusetts, USA.  I found about five of them in an area of full sun. Temperatures over the last few months have varied between 70°F and 100°F. The ground is regular garden soil, and these plants are sharing space with pokeweed; lamb's ears; goldenrod; and some other wild things, the names of which I don't know.   Description:   They're about three feet tall, and are covered with round orb-shaped things which I'll call burrs until I know if that's the correct term. The entire plant is covered with thorns, including the leaves and the stalk. The stalk also has white fur.  The burrs are at the junctions of leaves and stalk, similar to perennial plants, as opposed to some wildflowers which are single stalks with flowers at the top. The burrs grow to a certain size, which is different with each one, from a radius of anywhere from one to three inches, at which time another section pushes through the top, which I'll call the second stage. The second stage appears to be a flower, but only opens a small amount and doesn't have petals, just spikes. They vary in size, shape and color, even on the same plant. For example, my pictures show a plant that has both dark and bright purple second stages. At some point, the burr attached to the stalk becomes brown and opens to reveal narrow long things which I assume are seeds. These are soft and furry, and easy to separate and remove. The plant has a continuing life-cycle, with young burrs still appearing after others have died off.     My questions:   What is the name of this plant?  What is the second stage, and why does it vary so widely even on the same plant?  Since only the original burr goes to seed, while still attached to the stalk, where does the second stage go? It would make sense that it would fall off, but I can't find any on the ground.    The first picture has a good view of three different stages on the same plant. Below that are close-ups of each section from that plant. I've also included a picture of a different plant which shows the original burr with the second stage just pushing through; and a third which shows new growth and a large old brown seed pod.   Click on the pictures for closer view.        "
1823,What's the difference between each fertilizer grade?,"I've heard of at least a few different grades of fertilizer:   Horticultural Grade Greenhouse Grade Solution Grade Agricultural Grade Farm Grade Fertilizer Grade   Are these standards? Where are they defined? What's the difference between each (and any other grades I missed)?  Edit: I assume most of these have something to do with the levels of purity and contaminants, and I've read the horticultural grade does, but I haven't heard anything on that for the others. As you see in the link above, one person also says that horticultural grade and agricultural grade have to do with size of granules and the number of micronutrients. Other than that, I'm not sure what to think of the rest of these. "
1824,How do I save my quinces from insects?,"My quince trees have just started flowering. For the past 7 years I've not been able to eat a single one because of insects stinging the fruit. The fruit is always full of worms.   Obviously I need to wait for pollination to have occurred before doing anything.   What is the best thing to do?  Do I spray an insecticide? When do I spray? What non-insecticide alternatives are there?  I am aware of the plight of they honey bee, so I would prefer something that deters the insects from coming to the tree, rather than something that kills them. And the insects are only a problem when there is fruit on the tree. Of course, they are needed for pollination.  I'm not able to provide photos of the actual problem right now. I'm trying to prevent it from being a problem this season.  I have three trees, they're about 3m tall, about 1.5m in diameter. They're quite bushy, almost hedgy, but that's because they've not been pruned properly. They bare fruit about the size of apples, so it's not the ornamental variety. "
1825,How can I remove the orange stains left by grass weed and feed?,"Last weekend I covered our garden in grass weed and feed, specifically EverGreen 360sqm Complete 4-in-1 Lawn Care, Lawn Food, Weed and Moss Killer Bag available here.  It has rained every day since but today is a very hot day. I woke up this morning and noticed that the paving slabs (stepping stones) that run across our garden have now been stained orange and even our tarmac driveway has patches of orange stains - both look horrible.  I've tried washing both down with a pressure washer but that didn't do much. What are these orange stains and how can I remove them?  I'll upload a picture of it helps. "
1826,How to make concrete blocks secure in raised bed garden,"I bought some concrete blocks and laid them out like this. The aim is to build a keyhole garden.  Now I'm concerned that some could fall over. I've got a very curious German Shepherd who could hurt herself if she knocked one of these blocks over. How can I reinforce the blocks? Would filling the holes with sand or gravel be good enough? What about rebar and sand/gravel? I'd rather not use something permanent like cement.  Yes, I will need to build a fence to keep the dog out but I want to reinforce the structure anyway.  I suppose I could remove the top layer of blocks. Would the structure then be stable enough?  I did see this question but it doesn't quite address my situation.  Cement Blocks for Raised Bed? "
1827,Why are some leaves on my Schefflera turning yellow and falling off?,"I have this young schefflera:    It is growing well but I noticed that some leaves are turning yellow and some of them are falling. For example:     What do you think is causing this? Maybe overwatering, or excess of fertilizer?  Further information that could be useful:  Unfortunately I had to leave it without water for the first three weeks of August (holidays...). When I came back I was happy to see that it survived. I usually water it once a week but the week after my come back I watered it twice, as it was thirsty. I also gave it some fertilizer. Maybe this was a mistake. Also, it was pretty hot last week (almost 30°C in my apartment). My apartment faces south, so it receives enough light (but not too much direct sunlight).    I have a second question regarding this plant. As you can see there is only one stem. Will it keep on growing only vertically or will it eventually split? If not, how can I make it grow new stems and when should I do it?    As a beginner, I'd appreciate any advice. "
1828,Do different varieties of a given crop require different types of soil?,"For example, corn has a lot of varieties, namely varieties A-Z. Is it possible that corn variety A requires a different soil type to grow in than corn variety B? Or is it that this sort of thing is trivial and that all varieties can be grown in the same type of soil?  If possible, I'd like to request references, just for verification. "
1829,Safe to use ABS for plant enclosure?,"I'm planning on 3d printing an aeroponics enclosure out of ABS. Obviously there will be a high amount of water circulation involved.  Is ABS a safe plastic to use? Will chemicals leach into the soil? Have any studies been done here? I'm planning on growing and eating vegetables, so I don't want to be ingesting horrible chemicals.  Thanks! "
1830,Why is my pear tree blooming in September?,"We have a pear tree that is producing ripe fruit now (it is early-September).  The tree is doing what I've never seen before: There are blossoms on some of the branches!  Is my tree dying?  It looks so healthy, and the pears are delicious.  Why is it doing this? "
1831,Filling gaps between alliums,"At this time of year Thompson Morgan has a sale of 100 alliums for just under £6. I took the offer last year and have ordered 2 packs this year, so I have 200 allium bulbs to plant in the border.  The allium flowers look great, but, as I am very new to gardening, I am not sure how to cover the gaps between them in the border. What type of plants should I be looking for? Is ground cover (phlox) the correct type or will this impede the ability of the bulb to flower?  Caeruleum        0.5-1.0 m  10 bulbs Neopolitanum     0.25 m     25 bulbs Roseum           0.5m       20 bulbs Sphaerocephalon  0.5-1.0 m  39 bulbs Purple Sensation 0.5-1.0 m  3 bulbs Mount Everest    0.9m       3 bulbs   It is this product 100 alliums.  I have also just found last years collection it was:  Caeruleum                      10 bulbs Neopolitanum                   20 bulbs Sphaerocephalon     30cm       44 bulbs ostrowskanium                  20 bulbs Purple sensation    90cm        3 bulbs Christophii                     3 bulbs   Warning  Based on Bamboos input to this topic *neapolitanum * is actually a wild garlic and invasive likely should be avoided in a garden.  Just to be clear that this was NOT included in the pack by Thompson and Morgan, it was a typo on my part and they actually included neopolitanum. With a neo and not nea.     Some pictures From last years planting: Unfotunately not found any picture from when they were all at there best, but the current set of late bloomers still have colour.    I believe the grey fronds are from an allium but now big show bulb has appeared. Or it is a weed. The big daisy type plant is a perennial that I did plant.   And an overall view of the garden (for Stormy) Alliums planted on the right along the side of the fence, roughly the middle third of the fence :  "
1832,Harm a tree by trimming top/exposed only part of root in lawn?,"I don't see this question out here specifically asking about trimming only the top part of a tree root that is protruding higher than the lawn surface.  35 year old silver maple, with one or two lawn roots coming up in lawn.  Can I trim the roots flush with the lawn surface using a reciprocating saw with a nice clean cut?  I would not do this in the heat of summer.  Will it heal?  If not, how is this any different than nicking it with the mower blade? "
1833,Hibiscus problems,"I have a hibiscus exhibiting multiple problems. Around 6 months back, the leaves had turned skeletal, with sooty black growth (fungus?) more pronounced near the base and leaf undersides. After some alcohol rubdown to treat the fungus, I'd just kept it quarantined. Now, it's flowering from past 2 months, though the skeletal/fungal appearance remained. Some of the mature/young leaves curl at the edges and turn yellow, with each leaf stalk/base covered by same sooty stuff. Recently, am observing the flower petals turn transparent before they drop off. The other hibiscus plant leaves/flowers are fine, though there's been no difference in their soil/watering etc. What could be the problem? I'd like to move it back with the other plants, but first need to ensure this isn't going to spread to them too.  17th Feb, '18: Here's the plant after repotting. The plant wasn't healthy to start with, and I had to operate on the roots a bit to un-entangle them/fit nicely into the new container. So I was a bit apprehensive on the outcome. I'd forgotten the real green of the leaves..it'd been unwell for so long. But looks like the worst is over now :). This thread should help people struggling with similar problems...it was all in the soil!  "
1834,"What trees, shrubs or vines are most suited for pleaching?",The exact application would be to arch over a long dining table in a courtyard in eastern-most New York. The two rows of trees would need to span approximately 25' at a height of less than 15' or less.  Our candidates are:   Carpinus caroliniana (Hornbeam) Crab apple Cherry Wisteria Hawthorne Pear   But these are not based on feasibility at all.  Are there others we should consider? Or exclude from our list? 
1835,How to prepare lawn for overseeding,"I've recently been renovating a small section of my lawn, which is going relatively well.  I now would like to overseed the remainder of my lawn, which has many bare spots and is quite bumpy.   My question is: how should I prepare my existing lawn?   I'm listing some of the options I'm considering: 1) dethatch by hand, broadcast seed  2) dethatch with a power-rake with spring tines, broadcast seed  3) use an overseeder (the rental rents a turfco LS20) What would be your preferred method?   I'm in the Boston metro area, zone 6b.  Apart from watering after seeding I didn't really water the lawn.  It's cool season grass.  I don't know which kind.  The neglected lawn was already here when we bought the house 3 years ago.  I've spent the last 3 years renovating the inside and now have some time to start addressing the outside.  I haven't fertilized either, but will begin doing so.  UPDATE: As requested in the comments, I'm uploading some pictures of the lawn.  This forces me to ""explain"" a little bit.  I have 2 rectangles of lawn that I seeded this summer.  Because of this, I had to water to enable germination.  This brought back some of the lawn from dormancy.  The remainder of the lawn stayed dormant all summer, and has shown little sign of coming back to life.  If you are observant, you'll see a semi-circle of green grass at the top of the picture.  This is a patch of bermuda grass that I'm experimenting with, to see if it survives the winter (see one of my previous posts).         "
1836,How can I further prevent my Fiddle Leaf Fig plant from growing slanted?,"As my plant grows, it slants forward. It is getting taller and I'm assuming that this is why, but is their a way to prevent this? Or a way to get it straight by using some type of item?     "
1837,How do I grow grass in a North Texas climate under trees?,"I have giant bare spots underneath two trees in my front yard.  The climate is that of North Texas near Dallas. The soil content seems to be a lot of clay and dirt that dries out easily. My house faces to the South if that helps.  The previous owners of the home had to have some of the house's foundation pillars replaced/worked on. I think this resulted in a lot of the lawn being upturned near the front of the home.  Even though it can get dry, most of the rest of the yard is overall healthy, even in dry stretches. I try to water the grass in those times to keep it going.  To try and solve this problem, I used a cultivator to loosed the soil. I purchased some Scott's grass seed that helps to retain water. I threw that down and proceeded to water everyday as instructed.  In addition, I've tried to help the soil by putting down weed and feed, hoping it would help to improve the soil quality. I saw very minimal results. Most of it never grew. I'm not sure if this is a result of the shade under the trees, the trees themselves, or bad soil. When I pick up the soil it's pretty loose, with a little stickiness to it.  My question is, how do I grow grass in these bare spots?  Or is there another way to handle this?  "
1838,Is Xanthomonas a host-specific disease?,"I grew some volunteer cantaloupes in pots this summer, but they got hit hard by what I believe is Xanthomonas, a bacteria which causes angular leaf spot.  I tossed the diseased plants, but I'd like to use the old soil to pot up some pepper plants so I can bring them inside for the winter.  Is this a risky move?  Can whichever species of Xanthomonas that hits cantaloupes (a curcubit) infest my peppers (a nightshade)?  Or, is this disease specific enough to its host that it won't harm plants in other genuses? "
1839,Help me kill this grass,"Just wondering what this broad-leaf grass is called and how I can safety remove it from my ""Blue Couch"" (Digitaria didactyla) lawn. I've seen it take over many people's yards but have never known what it is and why it's there. Please help me sort this invader out.  Another question while I'm at it: Why does my lawn tend to die along the brick wall of my house or be easily invaded by this mystery grass? Is it the dryness of the soil from the heat of the bricks? It seems to get plenty of sun. I live in South East Queensland.        "
1840,Are kaki more stable than apple when planting seeds of market's fruits?,"From what I read here and there, I understand that apple seeds do not easily give of fine edible apples.  How is it now for what I could get from kaki seeds. Does anyone know if it is similar to apple trees when it comes to genetic instability?  I have these seeds from a kaki ""Fuyu"". Will I be able to grow a tree with tasty fruits?  "
1841,Is this Chinese Evergreen healthy? what should I do with the specifics?,"i got this Chinese Evergreen yesterday from a local nursery. I selected the best one from them(sadly they had only two small ones). Since it's better to buy small plants then big one, I chose this Evergreen. But I found some things that I am not quite sure what to do about.  What caused this:    What caused this tiny little hole?          The two white roots tell me the plant is quite healthy, right? But if it is healthy, what caused those two above mentioned problems? Should I re-pot it now? I got a small pot(bigger than its current pot). "
1842,Which plant is this,Can anyone tell me which plant is this? We were given a small plastic cup with mud and seeds and asked to spray water on them. I transplanted the cup to a pot and this came out. But I don't know if this is some plant or just grass. Any idea? 
1843,Why does my new ZZ plant have yellow and broken leaves?,"I got this ZZ plant (Zamioculcas) from the nursery (and tried choosing the best one) yesterday. I noticed some yellow leaves and broken leaves. When I asked the gardener (or whatever we call her) she said it was caused by sunlight. I don't know the real cause of it. Upon Googling, I learned that it was due to overwatering. Is this the case?  Also, does it need repotting?        "
1844,Folded leaves on a seemingly healthy lemon sapling,"My 3-month-or-so lemon tree sapling seemed to be doing great, and has been growing quite huge leaves at a fast rate. However, this morning when I looked at it, one of the newest (and biggest) ones was almost entirely folded:    Is it something I should worry about, or is it no big deal? And if the former, why did it happen, and what should I do?  (I try to water my plants often, but not too frequently, roughly every 2-4 days. Could it be a lack of water?) "
1845,Newly seeded lawn growing unevenly,"I seeded the lawn with Tall fescue 12 days ago. We tilled the existing soil, added more soil and compost, seeded and lightly raked the seeds after spreading. I could see grass on the 6th day and it has grown almost 1.5 inches tall. The problem I am having is that the grass is all dense in few spots and then few spots are almost barren. What did I do wrong? I did spread the seed evenly using the rotary spreader. What can I do now?  "
1846,Does soil need to be acidic for carnivorous plaints (droserae),"I'm still trying to grow carnivorous plants, and with reasonable success.  Recommended: Peat / sphagnum moss  Now generally, these plants grow in ""wet, boggy, acidic soils"" as every source will tell you. The soil needs to be low on nutrients, since the roots of those plants can't handle those nutrients and fertilizing may even burn the roots.  Peat is the general recommended medium to grow CPs on. However, live or dried sphagnum moss is hard to come by and quite expensive. And you can buy peat which is cheaper, but it isn't environmentally friendly, because it's dug up from wetlands in Belarus and such. The peat bogs here (in the Netherlands) have been destroyed years ago when peat was still used much as fuel.  Alternative, beech leaf mold?  Anyway, since I'm going to plant my plants outside in the garden, I'm going to need quite a large amount, and I'd like to try a different medium: leaf mold.  The reason I want to use leaf mold, is that it has similar properties. It retains moisture quite well and it is low on nutrients.   Now, I've bought some leaf mold from an organic grower. This is compost from beech leaves which are gathered from the area around the grower. It is a great material, but it isn't by far as acidic as the peat I have. The peat is somewhere around pH 5 to 5.5, and the leaf compost is around pH 7 neutral.  Question: Is the acidity necessary?  So the main question: is the acidity a necessity or do they just 'happen' to grow in acidic environments?  If it is necessary: - Why? What is the scientific explanation behind it? - Is there a way to make the soil more acidic without resorting to chemicals and without adding nutrients or other stuff that kills my plant? - Is there another medium that might (also) work? I read that sugar maple leaf mold may have an acidity of around 4.8, but that will probably not be available here in the Netherlands. Are there other kinds of leaves, or maybe another material altogether?  Experiment:  I'm actually trying this our right now by moving some young plants to the leaf compost environment. I must note I'm testing now with drosera binata and drosera capensis, both of which are very easy to grow. They've been in the leaf mold for a couple of days now and so far they seem to do well, although it's probably too early to really tell. Still, awaiting the experiment, I'd like to know the science behind it and be aware of alternatives.  "
1847,Aloe vera plant outgrowing its pot,"I have an aloe vera plant in a ceramic pot. It is growing too big for it and I'm not sure what to do. What is the procedure for transplanting aloe vera into a larger pot?  Also since it's so big, is there a way I can take part of it and start a new pot (like reproduce it)?    "
1848,What is the best way to grow vegetables without using chemical insecticide?,I am looking for tips and recommendations because I do not want to use any pesticides.   I am in Jamaica where insects are a big problem. I am using a combination of dish soap and hot pepper.   Any suggestions as what to mix with the soap? I have a backpack sprayer and want to spray safely and effectively.  I hand pick insects daily.   Does anyone have any favorite methods? 
1849,Mineral-oil spray on my cacti,"As I came back home today, I have found patches of oil along the alley, over the entry door, and many of my plants, mostly succulent plants. I'm not much worried about the fruit trees, because their response is fast enough, and they can re-grow new leaves instead of the ones damaged by the oil.  After a short inquiry, I have found-out that some construction work was going on. A truck was unloading some building materials next to my entry. During the unloading process, the hydraulic system operating the lever has bursted, spilled oil and sprayed the rest over a long radius.  Is it ok to leave the spray? I would not use detergents to take it off, as this may cause more damage. The oil does not evaporate, but will the sun's radiation do the work and break-up the material? What is the safest way to remove it without damaging the plants? "
1850,How to save tree harmed by urine?,"Is it possible to save trees that are harmed by dog urine?  I have some young trees which died some time ago, and at first I didn’t understand why that happened. But it happened very suddenly. The trunk began to get black and the leaves became dry very fast.  Now I have a few trees again affected by these symptoms.  Is it possible to stop the dying of the young trees? Is there a counter elixir that will eliminate the saline solution, acids and highly concentrated urea (chloride)?  I have also heard that urine is a fertilizer, but apparently not for young trees and not if the urine is overdosed.  Will it help to water the affected trees extensively? "
1851,"How can I effectively grow plants from peach, nectarine or plum pits?","I have a few plum, nectarine, and peach pits from locally grown fruit and I'd like to try growing them, mostly indoors in pots. I'd also like to try one or two outside. What's the best way to go about doing this?   I looked around online and found some conflicting advice- some instructions said just put the stone in the ground outside, some insisted that stratification (in the refrigerator) was essential, some said it was optional but would just improve chances of germination. Some sources suggested that I break open the stone and plant the seed only, some said to plant the whole thing. What methods will bring me the most success for both indoor and outdoor locations? I'm not doing this to get delicious fruit- I know that's unlikely- this is more for fun and experimentation. "
1852,"What exactly is garden soil, and why shouldn't it be used for potted plants?","Okay, I searched internet but didn't help much, so here is my question, I hope for a detailed answer.  What is garden soil? I mean, why it is not recommended for potted plants? Is it because it's heavy and doesn't drain well and less to no aeration? Or some other factors also make it a bad choice?  How can one treat or make the clay or garden soil good for potted plants without using Vermiculite, Perlite, Organic matter. Is there any other method?  Personal Experience:      I potted a plant in garden soil and watered the plant with around 3 litres of water. The soil didn't drain any water at all. Yes the pot has enough drainage holes. My Mother and Father said that I watered too much, but I don't think so.      I tried to explain to my Mom that the soil is bad and not good for potted plants, but she still insisted that that was caused by too much water. Then I demonstrated it again, but this time choosing a bigger pot with different soil. I watered the bigger pot with 1 litre of water and the soil really drained much of the water I watered. That's a good soil there.    In a nutshell:      Pot A: average size pot with garden soil; watered with 3 litres of water; didn't drain any water. didn't drain any water. Pot B: Bigger than Pot A but with different soil (not garden soil). Gave 1 litre of water and it drained much of it.   Yet my Mother and Father said the culprit is too much water. Whereas I think the culprit is the garden soil. They said to give a little water (100ML or so) around it.  Which brings to me to the next question: Should I give less water if I am using clay/garden soil (and nothing else) or watering too little is a bad thing to do? What's the case? Can anyone enlighten me here? "
1853,Basil: Main stem keeps growing back after first pruning,"I did the first pruning of my basil plants some weeks ago, and all of them have branched out healthily.  But in reference to the main stem (the original, straight stem that I pinced earlier), I saw two different results.  Some have grown the main stem back and some others don't.  Which one would I prefer?  And what makes the otherwise happen?  Should I pinch it back or leave it as it is? "
1854,How do you use potassium bicarbonate to control powdery mildew?,"This post describes using potassium bicarbonate to control powdery mildew, but doesn't give any more info.  So I'm looking for the following:  Efficacy? Mixing rate? Application rate? Application frequency?  And finally, are there different types of potassium bicarbonate and, if so, can they all be used for this purpose? "
1855,Adjusting recommended sunlight hours depending on region and radiation level?,"I have land in India (the tropics), in the hills, on a slope from 6800 feet - 5200 ft altitude (roughly). At that lowest point there's a stream of about 10-15m across. Generally my entire land is a very sunny area, high UV radiation, though not hot like the tropical plains-- it's more Mediterranean perhaps, or maybe like some of the Andean highlands, plus a relatively less intense monsoon than the surrounding region (it rarely crosses 28C even in summer, usually hangs around 20-25C during the day. In Winter, it drops to a minimum of 7C, and hangs around 13-19C during the day. I don't know how many hours those min-max numbers are sustained over).  My question is: if I were to try to grow Lavender, Tomatoes or other european herbs and plants (our weather/soil in a general sense seems suited to many of these)..  plants that are defined as needing ""full sun"", do I need to reduce the hours usually suggested because of the tropical sunlight and high UV? If yes, is there a way to calculate that or perhaps some sort of thumbrule?   EDIT: When I say tomatoes, I mean San Marzano, Roma etc.  "
1856,How should I take care of my bromeliad?,I have the following indoor plant but it looks it is not happy. Some of the leaves turned brown and the flower is dry. Is this a perennial plant? Do you think I can revive it? I water it once a week.  
1857,How and when to replant/move plants?,"So, as a first-time gardener, I of course made tons of mistakes planning my flower beds. Terrible locations, didn't think things through right, etc. The worst is probably a hibiscus near the front of the bed (among low-growers) that has gotten around 6 feet tall. It dominates the entire bed and needs to be moved to an edge of the yard, say along a fence, where it can be part of the backdrop instead of a visual obstruction.  But I don't want to kill it. It's doing really, really well where it is.  I'm worried that: (1) it's roots are probably enormous, and trying to move it may kill the plant outright; (2) if moved now, it may not have enough time to re-settle its roots before winter hits, and might just die out before spring.  (I'm in TN, Zone 7, and we typically get a little snow. Got down to 0 degrees F last winter, averaged around 20-30.)  So when's the best time to uproot and move plants? Is there anything in particular I should know before going in? Should I intentionally trim it down to give it less plant to try and ""feed"" in the new spot, or would that make things worse?  Total newbie here. "
1858,What exactly term 'companion plants' means?,I would like to find out what exactly means that two or more plants (more specifically vegetables) are good companions and could/should be planted together?   Does that mean plants just tolerate each other or there are other beneficial factors involved?   How someone determines which plants are good companionons? 
1859,"Cherry sapling has wilted leaves, dried trunk; is it dying?","I've posted earlier about my diseased cherry seedling.  Since then, all the leaves have wilted and curled to some amount and the trunk of the seedling itself looks like a dried stick.      Is this tree living its final days out? And if it is, is there anything I can do about it?  My location is Ontario in Canada. "
1860,What is this wildflower with clusters of very small pink buds which open to white flowers?,"We have a lot of these wildflowers in our yard, which grow to be about three feet tall. The stems bush out a little along the main stalk. At the end of the stems are clusters, about 4 inches long, of very small pink buds hanging over. I started seeing them in early summer.   After about eight weeks the clusters began turning white and opening into very small white flowers with yellow centers. The flowers were only open for about a week, and are now seedpods, which have not fallen off. If I open one, I find hard seeds. They have no discernible scent at any stage.  When budding, the leaves are dark green, with an area of darker green not far from the stem, and as the flowers go by they become yellow.  I'd like to know what they are for a few reasons:   Are they allergenic? My husband is allergic to goldenrod, (solidago) and some other wildflowers, and he's uncomfortable now that it's pollen season. If these contribute to that, I'll remove them. If not, I'll leave them alone to finish their life-cycle.  Are they important to the eco-system, specifically bees and ants? Only a few small bees are hanging around, which makes sense because there's very little pollen, and also because we have a lot of things nearby with bigger flowers and easier access. I know some wild things help ants and are useful for preserving the eco-system, so I don't want to pull them unless they're harmful to anything.  They're pretty, and I'd like to know what to call them!   We're in Massachusetts, USDA zone 6 (meaning our lowest winter temperatures are about −5 °F, −20.6 °C.)  Edit: Even though it's now been identified as a Polygonum, I changed some pictures to show more detail. If that helps narrow down the variety, that's great, but if not, I certainly don't need it. They all look pretty much the same to me, and I appreciate the help I've received.       "
1861,What are those black spots on my apples?,I've got two apple trees in the garden and all of their apples are covered in black spots    What is this? They are quite different from those What causes black spots on my apples?  Any idea how to treat this ?  
1862,What's going on with my bay leaf? Burnt looking leaves?,I purchased a bay leaf plant and noticed that some of the leaves are appearing burnt. I haven't repotted the plant yet. It's sitting in a nice sunny spot and I've been watering it.    I also noticed the top of the soil has solidified? Not sure if this is related or how this happened. I chipped it off... it definitely wasn't like that when I got it.  What should I do? Thanks!   
1863,What is the traditional approach to planting bulbs?,"I wandered onto this page about how to plant bulbs indoors. It mentioned that we need to place the bulb in the soil and put it in a cool, dark place for the root system to develop, which takes about 6 weeks. This is different from what we do here. I don't know what temperature range they're referring to when they say ""cool"".   Here in Hong Kong the weather is quite warm even in Winter (15+ degree Celsius , so what we do is place the bulb without soil in the fridge for 6 weeks. After that, we put them in the soil and let them grow. Are both ways correct? How do you define ""cool""? "
1864,What to call this latex material used to tie trees?,I got some special hollow (rope/wire/string/tube - I don't know how to call it) - it is green and made of latex about 4 or 5 mm in diameter and used to tie young trees to prevent wind damage.  Can anyone tell me what this is called and maybe where I can buy some more of it?  Or alternatively what other good materials can be used for this purpose? 
1865,What is this discolouration of the skin of my pepper?,"One of my peppers is showing some strange discolouration of its skin. You cannot feel that it's there, so presumably this is underneath the outermost membrane of the fruit. As far as I can tell there is only one fruit effected so far.  Here are two images of the affected fruit from different angles, so you can see what I mean.     What's wrong with this fruit? Do I need to ""fix"" it, and how can I? Do I need to worry about the other fruit on this plant? Will this be safe to eat or should I cut it off and dispose of it? "
1866,What's the best way to handle dirt in my Sansevieria (snake plant)?,"My Father rescued some Snake plants yesterday and I potted them in  bad soil till I get a better one. Now after inspecting it, I found dirt settled in the plant. Here is an image to show what I mean:     I cleaned some of the dirt with a toothpick and some water, but it's not helping much. Also, the new shoots are drowned in dirt and I might harm the plant if I proceed on with the toothpick and water method. How should I clean them?  I thought of the following methods:  Method 1: Leave them as it is. In time, the new shoots will push the dirt up, up, and away. But if I leave them with dirt, wouldn't the dirt deteriorate the health of the plant?  Method 2: Pull the plants out, safely, and fire a water jet stream towards the dirt to wash it away. But wouldn't the water damage the roots? Or can I even wash the roots with water before re-potting in a better soil?  Method 3: Proceed with the water and toothpick method. Throw some water on the dirt and then clear the dirt with thin and slender object.   What method is appropriate? Also, any other method?   Another thing, am I making a mountain out of a molehill? "
1867,"I got green mold in my oyster mushroom bag, what to do?","I'm growing oyster mushrooms in a plastic bag on sterilized cardboard and coffee grinds. I was quite stringent with cleanliness at set up, and it's been OK for a couple of weeks, but now there are green patches on the surface of the substrate. I scraped them off with a spoon and chucked them, but I might have pushed a bit deeper into the substrate by accident. How bad is this stuff, and does salt really work to get rid of it ? Will the oyster mycelium fight the green, do they coexist, or will the green harm the oyster mycelium ? Thanks.    "
1868,What are these red spots on the leaves of my boysenberry plant?,"Previously, I had issues with the sun scorching the leaves of my berry plants. Now that the heat has cooled down, those leaves are back to normal. However, a lot of the leaves on my boysenberry plant have reddish spots on them, and I'm beginning to worry about them. The plants look perfectly healthy in all other aspects.  This is something I observed even when the sun was harsh (and a little prior to that). At first, I brushed it away, because if you observe closely, the red spots are around the edges or in between two leaf veins (the leaf membrane slightly curves up there) and it didn't seem unreasonable that the sun damage would strike there first (just like how sun damage in a plastic container first appears at the sharp corners and edges).   It was interesting to note that these leaves (the ones that have red spots) didn't quite dry up and shrivel like those in my other question linked above. Could these be due to a disease rather than sun scorching? Should I be concerned and is there something I can/should do about it?                           "
1869,Why is this tree refusing to shed its dead leaves?,"There's this tree I've been noticing (not sure what it's called) and throughout the whole winter it has held onto its leaves that went dry in fall even under windy/rainy conditions. Since leaves dont rejuvenate themselves, how will it produce new leaves for the next season? Will they eventually fall somewhere around spring or is one supposed to remove them by hand to make room for the newer set of leaves to follow?   "
1870,"Cold weather protection - fleece, mesh, polythene?",This MyTinyPlot.co.uk blog post photo showing some enviably healthy looking autumn lettuces under protection got me down the garden centre today looking at protection options for my autumn/winter veg.    You can see they're using some kind of super fine fleece.  But what is the difference between plain old clear polythene (AKA polyethylene) / mesh / fleece? For cold weather protection. When do you opt for one or the other?  
1871,Should I use tap water for my Aloe and Lucky Bamboo?,"I've had my Aloe for about 5 months now; it's doing a bit better than it was at the store (they had it in direct sunlight and it was getting damaged). I just got two stalks of Lucky Bamboo also and I was reading about the type of water to put with the rocks. Now I'm afraid I'm damaging my Aloe, here's why:  On the site that talked about Lucky Bamboo it said tap water is okay as long as it's not softened, but other plants might be sensitive to tap water. I looked up about Aloes and there was a post by a lady who's growing crazy healthy Aloes where she talks about how tap water will kill an Aloe over time. Her suggestion is rain water or snow water.  I can leave a bucket out to collect rain, but it hasn't been raining much recently. And my cats will keep getting in to the water. What do I do? Is it okay to use water straight from the tap? Or should I boil it and let it sit over night? HELP! I'm already late on watering my Aloe by a week or so and I'm paranoid to give it bad water :( "
1872,Can I tilt a plant when transplanting it from a pot to the ground?,"I have an Apache Blackberry that has outgrown its pot. I am getting ready to transplant it into the ground. My concern is that the main cane has been growing diagonally in the pot. When I transplant it to the ground, may I tilt the plant so that the main stalk points upward? Or will doing so cause other problems?    This is the same blackberry plant from my previous question which I asked about brown spots. It did not grow for several months since bringing it home from the nursery. In this past month, it had a growth spurt (maybe due to cottonseed meal fertilizer or the eggshells).  "
1873,Will my avocado tree produce fruits in my non-tropical climate region?,"I have successfully germinated an avocado seed and am now willing to bring it outside and plant it in the soil.  I live on the coast in Northern Portugal, so we never get negative temperatures. Minimum would be 4&#176;C (40&#176;F), on an extremely cold night. Also, abundant rain.  Q. Can I expect it to give fruits in a non-tropical, moderate climate such as the one found in Northern Portugal? (It should, as apparently we gave the avocado to the world :P )  Q. And if so, is there any special care I should have for the tree to thrive? "
1874,How to kmow if a young rose is a climber,"I bought this young rose and it already has blooms,  smaller than the regular rose flowers but I noticed that it's kinda growing horizontally and long stems so I put a stick beside it to support its growth.  Just wondering,  could this rose be a climber? How to know if a young rose is a climber?  "
1875,What is this extremely fast growing plant?,"I noticed this plant last week. It started off with as a little stub, and grew straight up without branching and then at about 3 feet, created this branched structure. In about 2 weeks time, it grew from nothing to 6 feet now.   Can someone tell me what plant this is please? Should I kill it or let it be?    Edit: Country/Region - UK/London "
1876,What are my options for plant choices near a pressure treated retaining wall at base of backyard fence?,"My backyard has a fence built on a retaining wall of pressure treated wood which was built some 15 yrs ago to address height/level difference between my yard and backyard neighbor's yard. When I couldn't get a Bower vine to succeed there I dug in and explored. I found the cut off tops of the fence post had been buried there, rotted and left tunnels that water would escape through. (I filled them in.) It also left behind more chemicals. I've also had sweet peas, and morning glories fail there.   We had tons of rain this past winter, but it doesn't wash chemicals away. Existing shrubs (crepe myrtles &amp; raphiolepis) which were there before the fence and retaining wall were replaced are doing fine, but could I expect new plantings to succeed there now? How far from the fence would be safe and not be affected by the chemicals? "
1877,Should I earth up my radishes to prevent them from being eaten or should I pull them out?,"My back yard lacks a bit of sunshine so things don't grow as fast, but they do grow.  I've recently planted radishes for the first time and they have already started pushing out of the ground, however they are not very large, maybe half the diameter of shop bought radishes.  The leaves are still growing healthily, but the tops of the radishes are getting nibbled at by something so I need to make a decision.  Should I:   Pull them up and eat them at the size they are? Cover them with a bit more dirt and give them some time to grow larger? Cover them with mulch to stop them being eaten?   I'm an impatient gardener and worry that they will get spoiled by being eaten by whatever has been taste testing them if I leave them the way they are, or they will rot if I leave them in the ground too long.  "
1878,Growing multiple stems on Dracaena,"First I must say, I am not quite sure the plant is really a Dracaena…  Well, I see lot of similar plants growing a ""multiple"" head with several stems but mine is only growing straight up.  I have been researching a little bit about growing but my native tongue isn't -English and the translator doesn't help me that much when searching for the terms.  So far, I see I have to cut the top of the plant and seal it so it has to start growing from the laterals. Is this the only way?   Can I just cut some leaves and insert them to the main stem and they will grow from there?   "
1879,Why are lots of bubbles coming out of a freshly cut lotus stem?,"I cut some old lotus leafs, and there was one stem from which many bubbles got out. I started to worry when I realized that it had been minutes and minutes (I would say at least 10) since the bubbles were getting out of it at a pretty high outflow.    I was worried because I wondered from where does all this air came from, could it be from the roots (I heard that they are filled with air)? If this is the case, is it dangerous for the plant to have water on its roots? "
1880,What conditions cause trunk sprouts on oak trees?,"I asked a similar question here, but something annoying is catching my attention. Almost all of the pin oak trees in my area are sprouting up and down the trunks like crazy this spring, many of them for the first time. Note: These are not root suckers. What conditions might be causing this? Does it have anything to do with the severe winter?              "
1881,How can I get a map of my plot of land for planning purposes?,"I'm studying permaculture and I would like to design before I start doing anything. Is there any software that could give me a map of my plot of land, like from Google maps or from sigpac in Spain? Any suggestions? "
1882,"Why does my pepper plant have yellowing, drying and curling leaves?","One of my pepper plants has so far suffered from pests, blossom end rot and odd skin blemishes and unfortunately the plant is now taking a turn for the worse and looking rather unhealthy.  The leaves are drying out and curling along some edges, and they aren't very green (yellowing?).  The unhealthy plant:  You can see the largest dry patch in the first image - the front of a leaf, while the second is the back of a leaf to demonstrate the loss of colour - compare it to the shots below.    Another healthier plant (for comparison):  This plant sat next to the unhealthy one, about a foot away on the same window sill, so conditions should be very similar. Images are again front then back of two leaves.    A few other points that may be relevant   This is an indoor potted plant, it hasn't been moved in months. Fruit has been produced and harvested (although the first few with blossom end rot, as mentioned). It's watered with the same regularity as its peers. Water isn't being absorbed as much as with its peers - more ends up in the tray underneath, forcing me to give it less water to avoid overflowing. This is unrelated to the issue raised in another question of mine - that was a different plant.   What could be wrong with the unhealthy plant? What can I do to help it? "
1883,How to get pests off of Rosemary?,"How do you keep pests off from Rosemary? I bought a small Rosmarinus officinalis at a local nursery last summer, and it was healthy and bug-free, but after a few months of sitting on my porch, it acquired aphids, spider mites, and some sort of small winged pest I can't identify. So I sprayed it with an organic insecticidal soap advertised as being able to kill exactly those types of bugs. I've used it on almost all my other outdoor plants, and it's worked very well. However, it seems to only partially work on Rosemary due to its leaves, which curl down and inwards, greatly lessening the effectiveness of spray. Even when I try to spray ""up"" into the underside of the leaves, I found it very difficult to get the spray into these sheltered areas, allowing the bugs to flourish there while dying everywhere else.  My Rosemary's still alive, but almost all the leaves are now partially dead and pock-marked from the punctures of insects. What can I do to help it? "
1884,Carolina Reaper problem,"I have a problem on a Carolina Reaper. It's +- 2 months old. I grow them indoors(living room, +- 20 degrees celcius) under a 45 Watt LED grow panel (50 cm above the plants). I use universal potting soil. The PH is 7. After a month I started adding Chili Focus according to the manual (once a week, not too much). I try to water when the soil is getting dry, again, not too much, but enough. I have other Chilli plants under the same conditions and they are doing fine (Carolina Reapers, Jalapenos and Birds Eye). I started looking on the internet and I think it's Bacterial Spot. Am I right?    update:   1 day later I washed away the soil (in the baththub, very carefully not to damage the roots) and replaced it with new soil(1/2 seedling soil, 1/4 potting soil (ph 6), 1/4 perlite and a few cm of hydro granules at the bottom). I also raised the led panel 20 cm higher. 10 days later I took some extra photo's:        another 5 days later I took two new photos. If you look close, you see the same condition is still there, but it's hard to say if it's new or it was already there. They remain small, but it does seem to go better. There are new small leaves forming in the top middle and they look better than the ones I removed. I don't know yet what I'll do with them, but for now I am still going to give them a chance. Small question; should I remove the yellow leaves?      "
1885,Should I water before or after a tomato feed?,"I'm just back from a few days away and my tomatoes need to be watered (they were watered almost daily by friends while I was away, but it hasn't rained in awhile so they need watering).  I also want to give them a tomato feed as they are still producing new fruit.   Does it matter if I water before or after I put the tomato feed? Will watering after feeding dilute the feed?  "
1886,When to collect acorns for planting?,"I would like to try growing some oak trees from acorns. When should I collect acorns for this?  Should I pick them as soon as they appear on the tree? Or leave them a while to 'ripen', or change colour? Or wait for them to fall off the trees?  Specifically in the UK, so Sessile oak (Quercus petraea) or Pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). Or maybe more exotic oaks if I can find any. "
1887,Moisture sensors in connection with drip irrigation,"Living in dry California, we are about to redo our front yard with native plants only, each of which is getting a drip, for about a dozen plants per irrigation channel.  I'm trying to to figure out a good way to determine whether the plants will get enough water, while attempting to not water any more than necessary (this being California in a drought)  Naively, I'd say ""let's give every plant a moisture sensor, bury the wires with the drip irrigation tubing, and have the controller figure out how long to run each channel based on the needs of the driest plant"".  Has anybody ever done such a thing, without breaking the bank? If not, how would you go about doing it?  Thanks!  Update: The gardeners are redoing our front yard as I type this, but I haven't found a good approach for measuring moisture. For now, I'll have them bury sprinkler wire along each of the drip tubes; if and how it will be connected I don't know yet.  If I find the time, I'll create some moisture sensors similar to this and hook them up with some version of the 1-wire protocol, which requires very little cabling, so my sprinkler wire should be sufficient. A Raspberry Pi or such would collect the data in my garage, and publish it via WiFi. This would join my Rasberry Pi-based pool timer which has been in production use for >2.5 years now.  If you read this, even a long time from now, and are working on something similar, please get in touch. I'd love to collaborate! "
1888,Can grass live upside down?,Having seen a video on how to pick up owls I was wondering if it were possible to have real grass live on the rotating cylindrical device (instead of fake grass). Is this possible or will it die or fall apart quickly due to gravitation? What if the device slowly rotates forever? 
1889,How to plant the right tree in the right place for shade?,"Since the sun is at it's brightest around noon, does that mean that a tree should be planted towards the south side of the house? If so then what if your front lawn also sits towards the south. Would i need to shift all my vegetables and flowering plants towards the east? What kind of tree would do best and what kind of shadow would you get from the tree around noon? "
1890,Pull Crabgrass before overseeding?,I'm planning ahead for over seeding this fall. There's a section of my yard that is virtually all Crabgrass.   Does it make sense to pull it all up by hand or use a herbacide before putting down the new seed? I want to ensure the seed makes good contact with the soil. I plan on renting aerator (and possibly a power rake). Wondering if either of those tools would be able to power through the thick Crabgrass and give me enough soil contact.  Thoughts? 
1891,School plant identification and care,"At my school, every project team has their own plant and needs to take care of it. I was wondering if you guys could help me out taking care of my plant.  A picture of my plant can be seen below.  So, by that, I have a couple of questions:   What's the name of this plant?  What is the best way to take care of this plant?    "
1892,How to collect your own grass plugs?,"I have a quick question. While I know a good bit about bushes, shrubs and potted plants, I'll admit I don't know much about grass. We live in the south east with a lot of clay soil. Some of the best grass in our yard is just random grass that either blew across the driveway while we were planting at one time or else a bird dropped some there at one point. We have a small field we mow to keep it looking good.  I never water or fertilize it, but it is almost always great looking grass. I don't know the kind, but it's one of the ones that goes by runner. However, they're so dense it's almost like walking on carpet. It doesn't really brown in a drought, though it does go brown and dormant in the winter. I can forget to cut it and it doesn't grow fast or tall. I can cut it lower if I want and it doesn't seem to hurt it.  I'd love to start moving it around my yard and get it started in other places if possible. I have bad luck with grass, though. I know you can get the runner type grass in plugs and plant them slightly apart and they fill in. I'd like to try that, but I don't know how you collect the plugs. As it stands right now, I would try to take a piece of steel pipe and pop it down a few inches into the ground to get plant and root, then I'd take it up and use the ""plug"" to propagate it and put some good soil in the hole I made to let the grass grow back over it. I'd just take a doze or so of these to start with.  I figured I could then till up the spot I want to start them in and add some miracle grow dirt or compost and plant and water them. If they take I can repeat the process until I have as much as I want. I even have a spot I could make into a sacrifice spot and only use it for the purpose of propagating this grass. Does this sound like a viable way to spread this grass? Thanks for the help. I think it looks like Zoysia grass, maybe? Who knows. I'll get a pick on here if I can. "
1893,What to do with surplus thuja leaves after pruning?,"We all know that there are tons of thuja leaves after pruning thuja hedges.  Can thuja leaves be used as mulch (perhaps for acid-loving plants, let's say young pines, or vaccinum)? What if they are put in a compost pile?  I've read something about thujaplicin, thujone, and acetic acids as being present in thuja leaves? Are they harmful or helpful? "
1894,What's killing my evergreens?,"I recently noticed the internal needles on my cedar (pretty sure they're cedar) trees are turning brown and falling off. There's some sort of insect all over them too that looks like they're making nests out of spit. Are the bugs the cause of my trees' poor health? If so, what are they and how do I get rid of them?    "
1895,"What causes sandy, flecked, or speckled leaves like this?","There are several different species of plants in my yard that have developed some kind of condition where the leaves get pale, tiny specks all over them (such that they look kind of sandy). Many of them have webs that seem indicative of spider mites. Are the webs from spider mites? However, I'm not sure if the speckling is caused by spider mites or something else, like maybe manganese deficiency caused by too much calcium in the soil (I did add probably too much basalt rockdust for all of these except the apple tree at the end, which has had the problem for 1-3 years now). What could be causing this (the speckling)?  It began with the apple trees and rose bushes about a year or two ago, but it seems to be on lots of stuff in the yard, now. It seems to be leaving alone the tomatoes, peppers, and muskmelons, however. It was all over the watermelons, except the Citron watermelon (which was only lightly afflicted, but it wasn't with the other watermelons). On the other watermelons, it started on the shaded parts of the plants, and slowly progressed to the parts in full sun. Eventually, it totally enveloped them, and pretty much killed them (although the pictures I uploaded only show the early stages of the condition). Thankfully, the fruits ripened at about the same time they were completely overcome. Strangely, however, Aunt Molly's ground cherry showed symptoms in stronger sun first, and then on the shaded plants. These plants also gave their fruit and eventually died.  The issue was virtually absent until about mid-summer (although it affected apple trees, rose bushes, and maybe grape vines on at least one previous year).  The pictures that follow show the issue on several different kinds of plants in several different locations. It should be noted that it also affects the fruit, however, but that's not pictured here (it speckled the outer rind of a Ledmon watermelon quite heavily).  Around the time I first asked this question, I gave some of the plants some manganese sulfate and monopotassium phosphate. The pepino melons improved quite a bit (and seem fully recovered from the problem), whether or not manganese deficiency is the visible problem. Many of the other plants improved after the weather cooled down, and perhaps with a little rain, too.  The soil here is clay loam. We have a couple large pine trees that possibly could be eating up the manganese in the yard. I understand they prefer acidic soil (and because of that they are probably used to a lot more manganese than is available to them in our yard). The soil possibly also has a higher PH, which could also cause manganese deficiency symptoms in plants.  I should note that our nieghbors fruther away from the aforementioned tree also have speckles like this on their apple tree.  The black stringy things you see on some of the plants are not related to the problem. They're just ashes from the fires that have been going on in southwestern Idaho. The speckles, however, are definitely not ashes, even where they may look kind of like them.

1896,Why has my kiwi office plant developed red leaves?,"I have grown a kiwi plant which is growing nicely in my office. Recently, some of it's leaves have developed a red hue.   What is happening here? Do I have to worry?   "
1897,"Spring, Trimming a Redbud - Wrong time?","Is it too late or too early to trim/prune a redbud tree?  The upper branches of our redbud tree have encroached on the house.  We would like to prune the branches back so they don't touch the house and provide a path for crawling insects.  We just purchased a pole pruner so we can reach the high branches.    We're in the US, Zone 6.  The temperatures are at or below 0C (32F) at night and possibly 5-10C (40-50F) during the day.    We plan to cut the branches back by a couple feet.  Is it safe to cut back the branches touching the house at this time, or should we wait for different weather conditions?  If so, what conditions would be best? "
1898,Have I butchered this apple tree or It was just the right thing to do?,I have seen some video Tutorials on apple tree pruning and I pruned this tree from what I have learned. But everyone in my family says You have butchered It. Is this the right thing to do or I went too far?   and this is another tree. I cut one of It's main branches. Was it a right cut?  
1899,What should I do to make my strawberry a perennial?,"[website]  Strawberries grow as perennials in U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 3 through 9, depending on the cultivar and in zones 9 and 10 as cool-season annuals   Is it the heat that kills the strawberries (tristar) and prevents it from being a perennial? What should I do save my strawberry? Should I bring it inside the house in the summer or winter (it's in a pot) "
1900,Does mold on a seed always mean the death of that seed?,"I recently germinated some coffee beans (soaked in water until a root appeared), and planted them in sterilized soil.  I only lightly covered them in soil (based on this answer), so the tops of the beans were visible.  A mere three days later, a coating of white fluffy mold appeared most of the beans!  The soil remains clear, presumably since it was sterilized.  My question is: Once mold has grown on a seed, does the seed have any chance of surviving?  Or are these doomed? "
1901,Invasive herb w/ tiny white flowers,"I have a medium pot where I've been trying to raise a guava tree until it can be definitely placed. Then I've been out for 2 weeks and when I came back, there was an invasive plant spreading all around, coming from its pot and, since I already grow some basil and mint to use as seasoning, I've got interested about:  What plant is this? Is it edible?  Does somebody knows how does it taste like?  Could I use it as I use my basil, since both look equally harmless?  It may be useful to know I live on the very south of Brazil on a wet and rainy region and that it seems very happy on a very dry mix of organic compound and soil from an eucalyptus forest.     "
1902,How to obtain the inoculant for Lespedeza thunbergii?,"I am considering Lespedeza thunbergii for my shrub border, and I found a document on internet that says:     Lespedeza thunbergii is a legume, so you must obtain the appropriate fresh, viable inoculant.   How to obtain the inoculant for Lespedeza thunbergii? Why do I need an inoculant at all? And, by the way, what is an inoculant? "
1903,Best practices for watering plants with geothermal water,"My new home uses a geothermal water system, so the sulfur levels are high (based on the lovely rotten-egg smell). I've read that sulfur can be really good for plants, but I'm wary about the amounts I'll be using, or if there are certain types of plants I should avoid using this water on.   If I need to be careful about sulfur levels, how can I measure it? (Cold water from my tap is just city water, so the warmer I make it, the higher levels of sulfur will be in the water.) Additionally, It's now spring where I'm at (Pacific Northwest), and I'm getting ready to fertilize - should I take my type of water into consideration when purchasing and using a fertilizer?   Here are some of the plants I have: Swedish Ivy, Monstera, Chinese Fan Palm, Angel-wing begonia, Spider plant, and Jade (and a large variety of other succulents).  "
1904,How much to water Raspberries on a drip line?,I just put in a drip line today. I only used 1 GPH emitters on the raspberries. Any idea how long I should water them when it dries up this summer? I know it should be 1 to 2 inches a weeks but how do you convert that the GPH on a drip system?   Thanks! 
1905,"Rusty metal vase, can I use it for vegetables?","I am creating a small vegetable garden. I have a metal vase, that I particulary like, and want to use it. It's completely rusty inside.  Can the rust somehow, ruin the vegetables? If not, can that be somehow bad for the health by eating those vegetables? "
1906,What to do with the plant/tree growing right from the wall of my and neighbour's balcony?,"There is this plant growing right out from the wall of my and my neighbor's balcony (1st floor).    Is this plant bad for the building/wall/balcony?  Should I let it grow?  Should I cut it? But if I cut it, new shoots will grow (happened before). What should I do to completely remove this plant?       "
1907,When does Ivy become dangerous or harmful up a tree,"I am a part of a volunteer group in local ancient woodland and we have very many trees there which I completely covered in Ivy, we can also from time to time expect high winds of up to 40 Mph gusts. This is in England so we have a variety of different kinds of trees and a reasonably diverse natural habitat which is left to mostly grow wild apart from really the work that we do.  I am aware of the fact that other woodland nearby does have any Ivy on its trees because the park keepers are there and paid to remove it since if it grows on the tree too much it becomes quite heavy and if said gusts come the tree can be more likely to be knocked over by it.  Generally I understand that it doesn't damage the tree much more than that though because the branches just push further outwards to get to the sunlight and the Ivy is actually quite good nesting material for the birds. So it certainly does serve its purpose.  But as many of the trees are quite tall there and old, they may have the falling over problem. So I going to write a letter to the management of the group to suggest surveying the woodland and then removing any Ivy which is becoming a danger.  But I wanted to be well informed first about what actually constitutes as actually 'dangerous' before contacting them so we know what to actually survey.  I could find anything on government websites about this or woodland sites. So I was wondering if there are any guidelines and an established definition of how much Ivy is too much? What the specific dangers there are if there is just too much of it covering the entire tree? And judging by the size of the tree and maybe type, how much Ivy is too much?  I searched around a bit but I really couldn't find a comprehensive guide on this. "

1909,How to get rid of grass between ground cover?,"We just bought a new house, with a somewhat overgrown front garden. Mostly I need to do some pruning and shaping.  They planted some ground cover, including ivy. Strangely, while the ground cover seems well established, there's still a lot of tall grass.

1910,How to overwinter a potted oriental lily in an apartment?,"I wanted to have a scented flower indoors, so I bought a potted lily, it seemed to be the suitable for my conditions.   I'm aware it's only going to bloom for a few weeks, then die back, then - if I understood what I read correctly - regrow the next year from the bulbs.   However, most instructions mention the bulbs are to be replanted in a garden, which I don't have.   What I have is:   The windowsill in my bedroom. It's north-facing, so it gets good sun before noon, through a triple-glazed window. I use curtains on the inside of the room, not blinds, so the plant will get that light every day.    A small corner balcony on the other side of the apartment. There's a wall to the east side and it faces an inner courtyard, so it's only getting a little light during the afternoon. This is the inner city, winters tend to be more soggy than cold. I'm guessing that near the walls there shouldn't be any significant frost.     I was hoping that I'd just need to wait until the leaves die, trim the stalks to 10ish centimeters, and move the pot outside into the corner until it comes back to life in the spring, then move it closer to the balcony railing until I see flower buds. Would that be enough, or do I need to do something more involved? (Discard/replant extra bulbs or change out the soil.) I'd also be happy with any extra advice, this is my first nonsucculent plant I'm attempting.   I'd also be thankful for any tips on how to have preferrably scented flowers in my room for a longer time. Are there other plants that will handle my conditions that bloom at other times of the year? I've also read about forcing bulbs in a refrigerator to make them bloom earlier, but I've no idea how to store them and schedule that to cover a length of time.  "
1911,Heavy sap weeping at base of stone fruit tree,"Location: Phoenix, AZ  I have a 3-in-1 pluot that was grafted onto Citation Hybrid root stock. (i.e. the image shows the root stock.) Around 2 months ago (~ 1st July) it started weeping sap at the base of the trunk and this is becoming worse.  What could be causing this? Is there a way to fix/stop this?   "
1912,Are these mushrooms dangerous to my scallions?,I am growing scallions (and eating them). This morning I noticed two mushrooms (which I think grew last night) among them. The following questions arise:   Is this bad for my scallions? Is it dangerous for me to continue eating the scallions? What kind of mushrooms are they?    
1913,"Drainage question; tall, cylindrical pot vs stouter one","I recently repotted a Euphorbia Milii that hasn't been doing too well. I posted a question on the forum, and it seemed like the pot was too large. Specifically, I got this answer from a helpful forum user:  ""The pot should only be large enough to leave an inch (at most) of clear soil around and below the rootball. The reason for this is because, with a lot of empty soil around a rootball, over or underwatering is easy to do - in order to keep the rootball moist, all the soil has to be wet, but then your plant's roots are sitting in wet soil. Equally, its possible that the surrounding soil is wet, but the rootball isn't."" (link to the question:Euphorbia milii (crown of thorns))  I feel that the terracotta pots I have lying around which would be of a suitable size for my plant will have drainage issues, since they have only one hole. This worries me, since the plant I have to repot is sensitive to having damp roots. I put the Euphorbia in one of these anyway, with a crock to let water pass through the hole, but I worry about the drainage, since there is after all only one hole. I have yet to find any terracotta pots with more than one hole, by the way (side question: why is that??). I left it in there like that for two weeks with no improvement.  I did find two plastic pots, one tall and one stout, but not as wide as the tall one. Basically I cut out the bottom of the small pot, filled the large one loosely with soil, placed the plant in the smaller pot, and put the small pot inside the large one. the hope is that by watering the small pot, the roots will get wet, and all the excess water will drain to the bottom of the pot, since there is plenty of room for it to go. I have an illustration here:    All the soil in the pot is cactus soil. So, is this a good/bad idea? Is the drainage going to happen like I think it will? Did I just murder my Euphorbia?  Thanks! "
1914,Calathea mix - brown leaf edges,"I have a ""calathea mix"" (that's what the label says) that's supposed to look very much like this:  It is supposed to have wavy leaf-edges and a nice, rich red coloured underside.  But it actually looks very sad, with leaves sometimes rolling up, and all brown around the edges. New leaves keep growing, but often they start to go brown before they even come out of their little rolled-up baby stage.     I've tried watering more, watering less, spraying with water, repotting, adding draining... why can't I keep this plant alive?? "

1916,Do Golden Pothos need a day/night cycle?,My office has quite a few Golden Pothos and they are beautiful! I am wondering: how many hours of light do these plants need per day in an indoor environment? To go along with that I know that some plants need periods of darkness – do pothos require darkness each day?  As it may be of interest: there is no natural light for these plants at all. It is 100% artificial lighting. 
1917,How do I know when to take butternut off the vine?,"My family recently added butternut to the selection of fruit and vegetable plants in the garden. The plants are in a reasonably sized pot, growing onto concrete at one side and an earth/stubbly grass plot on the other.  Our particular experience that may be relevant is with potato and pumpkin, both from pots/bags and from beds/plots.  As I have not previously bought or prepared butternut and given the varieties that may affect what ""looks like"" a suitable fruit, how can I determine which fruit is ready to be picked, brought in, stored and possibly eaten?  In particular, what can a gardener of low experience check, for example from the size and colour of the fruit, any physical properties (e.g. tapping sounds), and the behaviour of the vines or plants?

What I know I should do:   Mow it down in stages   but not until it starts growing in the spring    What I know I shouldn't do:   Mow it all the way down at once   Specific questions I know I have:   Should I try to get a top-mower-height mow in before it starts greening, to open it up for air/light, since it's brown and packed down? How often to mow once it's greening?   1x week, lowering height each time? 2x week at same height, then drop height for the next week? Other?

1920,How long will my basil plants live inside?,I have 2 basil plants that are in 8 inch diam. pots.  They were outside but were doing poorly so around the middle of the summer I moved them inside.  They are now thriving! I generally harvest a few leaves at a time while cooking and I cut back any branches that get too tall. The lower stems are starting to turn woody but the plants are still growing well.    How long can I continue to do this?  Will a be able to harvest a consistent small amount of basil forever or should I take all the leaves and make pesto at some point (like I would have done if they were planted outside)? 
1921,How close can i plant perennials to a grapevine?,I have a few grapevines trained onto a pergola. I was thinking of planting a few perennials like roses and geraniums at the base of the pergola on all sides except the front. However my vines are planted a little more closer towards the center rather then towards the edges of the posts. Will my roses struggle to grow next to the vines or would they be ok? How far should they be planted from the vines?

1924,Mango internal decomposition,"I really hope someone will be able to help.  My Kent (probably) mango tree is mature, if small, and for years has yielded delicious fruit. For the last 3 years, we see an increasing occurrence of what what I assume to be mango internal decomposition - AKA jelly seed (note that this is a bit of a misnomer, as the damage is to the pulp around the seed, not the seed itself).  The fruit pulp in the center develop a jelly like texture, but even worse, a sour, fermented flavor. The fruit outermost side is tasty as always. This seems to develop before picking the fruit, and the sourness increases with time if is is left after harvest. The more colorful side of the fruits (they are mostly green when ripe) tends to be in a worse state.  As said, this has started about 3 years ago in a few fruits, and now I rarely find un infected fruits. We have a very warm mediterranean climate, with this summer being quite harsh. There was also an incredible amount of fruit flies this year, but we sprayed the fruits and had none infected with maggots.  The tree suffers a little from leaf rust, I will spray it with copper based antifungal soon after harvest.  Can it be the effect of extreme heat, or perhaps the fruit is infected with fungi? Can fruit fly ""stinging"" (I know that's laying and not stinging) transfer pathogens?  Any suggestion will be greatly appreciated. Shai  EDIT: Made it more clear that the damage is to the pulp, not the seed. "

1927,Diagnosing yellow spots on my cactus growing under artificial light,"I have owned a Mammillaria Nejapensis for the last few months which began showing unhealthy yellow spots a few weeks back and seems to be getting progressively worse. A photo of the cactus is attached.  Unfortunately, my room barely gets any natural light, which is why I chose to illuminate the cactus with an artificial plant-growth LED array from Amazon. I use a timed outlet to expose the cactus to 8 hours of LED light daily.  Would anyone happen to know if it is likely the the yellow spots are a result of insufficient lighting or some other cause I am unaware of? If it is the former, is there a lamp that might do a better job than the LED array I currently have?   "
1928,What is causing the yellowing on my English Ivy's leaves?,"Same unfortunate newbie from this thread  I have some ivy plants that two weeks after transplant are yellowing of the leaves and starting to look rather sad.  These were purchased as full size plants that were being grown indoors in the nursery, so not much change in light was transitioned to my home.  I'm wondering if perhaps I might be overwatering them?  Would a stint outside help?  Is this something I should worry about?     "
1929,Is it worth keeping indoor pepper plants alive over the winter?,"It's not quite time yet1, but I'm wondering if it will be worthwhile keeping my indoor peppers plants alive over the winter. What I've stumbled across so far seems to indicate they will probably just stop producing fruit when conditions are not good enough (lack of sun and/or low temperature). Is this accurate or can I expect further problems?  They won't be exposed to frost, but will probably be exposed to ""cold"" temperatures overnight and they will obviously get less sunlight (I won't be specifically heating/lighting the plants and I don't heat my home overnight).  If I keep them alive over the winter will they just start to produce fruit again in the spring? Will next year's fruit be of similar quality, size and quantity? Will having fully grown plants already mean they start producing fruit earlier? Will having fully grown plants expose me to other problems (eg, them becoming pot bound sooner)?  1. My side-motive here is to find out if I should re-pot my pot bound plant now to save it ready for next year, or if doing so will ultimately be a waste of time.  But I'd like to know what I should do with these plants generally as I've another three to work out at some point, so may as well get them covered now! "
1930,"What does ""an extremely popular host plant"" mean?","I was reading about sweet fern, and it says ""Wind-pollinated shrub that doesn’t attract bees or butterflies, but it is an extremely popular host plant for a wide variety of caterpillars: geometer moths, miner moths, dagger moths, underwings, saturniid, hawk and sphinx moths.

Do I want this in the middle of my garden, or a little ways away (i.e. 200 feet away in the middle of the butterfly garden)? "
1931,Caterpillars don't lay eggs so how is this happening?,"I noted a very large number of cabbage white (the yellow and black ones) caterpillars on the side of my house recently - the house bounds a field currently growing cauliflower. The caterpillars look fat and healthy, I'm not sure why they crossed from the field over my garden to the house - maybe to find somewhere to pupate?  The weird thing is that many of these caterpillars appear to be attached to, or sitting on, sacks of small yellow things which look very much like eggs. This is rather confusing - these are not new-born caterpillars next to eggs, they've clearly been eating in the field and come to the house later. I don't think butterflies would lay their eggs on the house rather than the plants, and even if they did why would the caterpillars return to the same place?  It looks like these healthy caterpillars are creating the sacs of yellow 'eggs' but that does not fit at all with the life-cycle of butterflies as I know it.  Is there any chance caterpillars can lay eggs in some cases and I never knew this? Or must something else be happening? "
1932,My sunflowers are dying. What to do?,"A few weeks ago I  bought a sunflower plant, the ones sold in big hardware stores with one flower that come in a 6"" pot. So I moved it to a bigger 12"" round pot the day after buying it.  As of today, the flowers have died and the leaves are greenish-brown. Im no expert, but they're not doing well. A small one started to grow , but it's all brown.  I water them every day, but it doesnt seem to help. I live in the Caribbean and they're in my rooftop with very little shade. In terms of temperature, we get 85 to 90-degree heat everyday, so it's horribly hot.  So what can I do? Could it be that it's too hot even for the sunflower?  Thanks. "
1933,What types of fruit are most likely to be eaten by vertebrate pests?,"So there are tomatoes in my backyard, and for some reason, nothing seems to eat them even though lots of birds visit the backyard, which surprises me.

1936,How long before hydroseeds are dead/dried out?,"I've dropped the ball. My new lawn was seeded in the middle of the week and we decided to go the hose+sprinkler route rather than irrigation system. I've tried my best with the little free time I have outside of work to rig up something that covers parts of the yard, but there are areas that are getting no attention since the application.

However, nothing happens at the fountains. Nothing. The machine's LCD status indicates that it's going but nothing happens.  I've never had an irrigation system so I know nothing about them. What might I be doing wrong. Could it be that some tap is closed somewhere that means the system isn't getting any water supply? If so, are these taps usually inside or outside?  Any help appreciated! "
1938,Why is it so hard to find pure perennial ryegrass turf seed in Australia?,"I recently bought 1KG of tall fescue from a hardware store but I have since realised that I would prefer perennial ryegrass. Why is it so hard to find this in Australia? It's easy to find cool-season seed mixes that contain perennial ryegrass but finding it by itself is proving very difficult. Is there some way of obtaining this? I'm not looking for a specific source but is there a way to obtain this seed before it is mixed into a blend and packaged for commercial use?   You might say that I should use a blend because a mix of seeds provides year-round growth, however I don't think it is necessary in my situation and after all,  pure tall fescue is available and it is a cool season grass. Surely there are people who use pure cool season grass seeds and don't want their lawn bastardised with 10 different grass types. "
1939,Dwarf Tamarillo Pruning and Care,"I live in west-central Minnesota on the border of Zones 3b and 4a (but within 3b). I started a couple of dwarf tamarillo trees this year from seed on the last day of February. I transplanted both of them once and have kept them outside in containers since the weather turned warmer in the spring.   I have found many of the things I have read online about tamarillo trees to not be the case with my tamarillo trees. For example, I've read from numerous sources that tamarillo trees are not tolerant of wind, are finicky when it comes to watering, and take at least a year and a half to two years to set fruit.   My trees have made it through several windy summer storms and I have just let the rains water them, and they seem to be doing well for the most part. And now today I noticed fruit is beginning to form, the plants being approximately 6 months old.   Having never grown tamarillo trees before, I have some questions about their proper care. Firstly, both trees have 3 main trunks. Should I let these three main trunks be, or is it best to prune them down to one trunk apiece? Both trees are approximately a meter tall at this point. And, now that they have begun to set fruit, is it even advisable to prune them?  "

I do not know anything specific to their species beyond that they are Clematis.   They are both in 6 inch pots and are about 16 inches in length. Should I plant them in the ground and find them next spring? Will they survive or should I attempt to bring them indoors?  I do not have a garden shed or area other then my house to put them in.    I do not want to lose them, as it has taken some time for them to grow as big as they have.    "
1941,Turning my existing lawn into something more presentable. Will tilling kill everything so I can start from scratch or do I need herbicide?,"I'm in Eastern PA and as it's just the start of April - I would like to turn my poor excuse for a lawn into a nice, level, uniform grassy green lawn. It's currently very uneven with high spots, low spots and rocks - I'm working on leveling everything by getting rid of the rocks, eliminating high spots and adding new top soil in low spots. This part seems pretty straightforward. I'm not sure how much of the lawn is actual grass and how much is unwanted stuff like moss and weeds. Considering I'm going to be doing this now (first week of April) - will tilling the whole lawn kill everything that's there now? Or would I need to treat it all with herbicide first? Here's the process I had in mind - I'm looking for some critique if I'm doing anything wrong:   Remove excess rocks &amp; high spots Fill in low spots with fill / top soil Till everything, mixing in some new top soil to get a consistent soil Level everything with a homemade drag level Spread grass seed Add an additional thin layer of top soil Use a lawn roller to compact everything Water &amp; wait   This is what it looks like today (April 2019):    This is what the yard looked like last summer (July 2018):    "

1943,How should I propagate day neutral strawberries which don't develop runners?,"I just planted a Seascape Strawberry plant, which is day-neutral. According to Home Guides, day-neutral strawberries do not produce runners.     Developed at the University of California, Seascape strawberry,   (Fragaria x ananassa) produces a high yield of large, firm, flavorful   berries. Seascape is a day-neutral variety, which means that unlike   June-bearing strawberries that produce berries in June and July,   day-neutral varieties produce fruit throughout summer and into autumn,   as long as temperatures are between 35 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit.   Day-neutral strawberries do not develop runners. Seascape strawberry is suitable for growing in U.S. Department of Agriculture   growing zones 3 through 9.   How would I propagate my Seascape strawberries if the typical way of propagating via runners is not an option?  I looked at my plant and verified that it does not have runners. Since Seascape strawberry's leaves are humungous, it would be easy to spot the runners, which have small leaves at the tip. No small leaves were seen.    Photo from Sakuma Bros.  Update  My Seascape has been producing runners like crazy. This photo was taken just a week after asking my question.     I don't have any recent photos, but since then I have been able to create around 10 new daughter plants. Even the daughters sent out their own runners, but I snipped theirs off. Don't want any teenage pregnancy, now do we?   I made the mistake of transplanting some of the daughters too soon. If I severed their runner when they were ""4 inch pot nursery"" size, they would shrivel within a day. It's best to leave the umbilical chord attached for a couple weeks. It actually doesn't do them any harm to leave them attached longer than necessary. I still have some daughters drinking mother's milk after a month - they're still lush looking.   Also, I learned that transplanting time should be well after runner severing time. If I severed the runner and immediately planted the daughter in my raised garden bed, it would shrivel within a day. However, if I sever the runner and let the daughter grow up in its container for another week or so, I could then transplant it to my garden bed without it shriveling. These daughters need time to adjust living away from Mother. It's not like a human where once they turn 18, you send them off to college without a transition phase. No, you have to hug them for a while and dry their tears. "
1944,Identification and question about possible sickness / parasite,"I got this plant a couple of weeks ago. The leaves were all soft and roots partly rotten.   I decided to cut away some roots, put it into new soil (not pasteurized though), cut away almost all leaves and put it in a bright spot. I gave it very little water first until the soil dried out, then I started watering slowly.  It grew some fresh green leaves, but they too are rather soft and weak. It doesn't seem to take much water in at all.  My questions:   Which plant is this? What's it's ailment, some bacterial infection maybe? What are the long excrescences that I marked?      "
1945,Tomato Sprouts is this normal?,  1st time growing from seeds indoor under grow lights. I started these tomatoes seeds 7 days ago. I read about leggy plants so I had them 3-4 inches from lights. Are they suspose to look like this? I have been searching for pics of different stages of growing tomatoes but have not found any resources. Thank you in advance for your responses!   I think they must have sprouted faster then the package stated. They were in a container with a dome. I was shocked when check on them day 3 and they had sprouted as package stated 6-7 days. So I guess I have had my first experience with leggy plants! So do I trash them and start over completely?  
1946,What time of year to mulch/feed trees?,"This answer recommends putting down a layer of compost mulch in the fall in order to slowly feed the tree. (In addition to the unmentioned weed control and moisture regulation.)  It makes sense to me -- I was ready to go out and spread compost around my apple, peach, and maple trees a couple of weeks ago until I did some reading that suggested I should wait until April.  The advice in books and elsewhere said that we should feed/mulch trees in spring in order to prevent stimulating new growth just before cold weather (to avoid winter kill). In addition, they caution against mulching heading into winter to avoid providing a home for mice or voles.  Which is correct? Is a late fall feeding really going to stimulate any growth? "

I'm wondering what the procedure might be to transplant a plant like this given that it was only planted a few months ago.  Is it better to leave the young plants and get new ones next season?  My only concern is whether the plant has a good chance of surviving the transplanting.  I've considered moving them into pots now before the freezes come in southeastern PA.  Is that recommended with it so close to frost? "

Unfortunately the month or so following were some of the windiest we've had and all of the leaves it had at the time were blown off and the tree bent somewhat in the direction of the wind.  Since then, the side of the tree that took the brunt of that wind has never grown its leaves back. Each year it has looked a little better, but it is still obviously flawed.  What can be done about this? Are the limbs dead and should they be pruned? Rotating it would give the bare side more light if that would help.     "

1952,How do I get rid of worm-like trails all over my Senetti plants' leaves?,"I have had a Senetti (more info) for about 18 months, and last year it was attacked by aphids. Initially the leaves had a worm like discolouration, as if something was attacking or eating them. Are the two things linked?  Some soapy water and some insect spray seemed to eliminate the aphids. I cut off many of the 'infected' leaves which almost killed the plant. I bought some new Senetti recently and they seem to have suddenly exhibited the same worm like attack. I want to save the plants from the same worm like attack    What is it, and how do I get rid of them?   A couple of other things in case they're relevant    Balcony is south facing and so I tend to give them a load of water every few days, depending upon weather I do put plant food into the soil to help them grow I seem to have a lot of very delicate spider's webs across some of my other plants (although I've not seen any spiders) I'm on the 7th floor so a fair way up for small flies to come the bees keep coming all the way up, so the plants must be doing ok  "
1953,Why is my Swiss chard suddenly wilting?,"I live in Brooklyn, New York, U.S.A.  This Swiss Chard has been doing well so far this season, and all the largest leaves you see here were green and strong as recently as a few days ago.  We had the hottest day of the season so far, a couple days ago- any chance that's related?  I also noticed increased ant activity recently. Worth investigating possible colony near the roots?  I have an overactive imagination.    The neighbors are happy: Cabbage, Arugula &amp; Collards.    UPDATE the answer is Leaf Miners.  Notice the white capsules on the leaves in the photographs below.     UPDATE three days after I purged the initial infestation from the Swiss chard, I happened to notice a single leaf miner burrowing into the leaf of one of my cabbages right next to the infected site!  I popped the bugger like a zit right there in the leaf.  Haven't seen any more in the 2 days since.  Lesson: be vigilant!  Keep your eyes open.  ALSO I've ordered some ""beneficial nematodes"" which many people recommend in order to help the ecosystem in your all-natural (read: pesticide-free) dirt good for plants, bad for little pest larvae.

I didn't take it out of the plastic wrap. I just put it in a small case with spring water.   Now it has a new growth growing at the bottom up the side of the stem. Is this plantable? How would I maintain this since I live in Ohio and fall is upon us? I would love to have a bush of these roses is this possible? I have pictures but not sure if I can post on here. I'm new to roses and how to grow them. Any info please? 
1955,Venus flytrap pollination,"I've just found out that my Venus flytraps (dionaea muscipula) is going growing several flowers this year.    I was wondering if it's worth trying to cross-pollinate them. In that case: how? when?  It also seems that one of the plants is giving not one, but two flower stems (the smaller one is still too tiny and almost not visible in the pic). Should I cut the smaller one? Or should I let it grow freely?  Thanks in advance for your advice! "
1956,When should I start worrying about holes and leaf damage in my brassicas?,"Brassicas are notoriously hard to protect and we have all seen cabbage and broccoli leaves stripped down to a sort of skeleton as a result of pests. But netting goes a long way to solving the problem.  I have some fundamentally healthy looking broccoli (under netting) but most of the plants have a few minor holes (ranging from 0.5mm to 3mm) in the leaves. Is this a problem? Are these even pests, or just some kind of wear and tear in the leaf structure?  "
1957,How should I start feeding an indoor plant after over a year's break?,"I have three indoor plants that I haven’t fed for over a year, since I repotted them. They have some yellow leaves and aren’t looking as healthy as they could. I am going to start feeding them with a liquid plant food. The instructions say to use 7 drops for 1 qt (approx 1 L) of water. If I do this, will it take quite a while to build nitrogen levels in the soil before they recover, or will they start looking good quickly? Is there any advantage if I increase the concentration? Is there any advantage if I run lots of food-laden water through them, rather than just filling until it can’t take any more?  I usually water them once a week by watering them until water runs freely out the bottom. This has kept the plants in a pretty good state for around four years, apart from this yellowing. "
1958,How should I save a palm I repotted too high?,"I repotted an areca palm, and unfortunately set it too high in the pot, so the top of the stems, which meet the roots, are slightly exposed at the top.  What happens if I leave it as-is? Will the plant adapt? "
1959,Pink flowering shrub with tomato looking buds,"What is this plant?  Red/pink flowers with 5 or 6 petals, orange ""buds"" or fruit(?) that look like tomatoes, many of which fall off. Compound, opposite, broadleaves with toothed edges.   "
1960,Is it really important to give blueberry plants acidic soil?,"I have two blueberry bushes which I planted at the end of the summer. Although I had read online that they prefer acidic soil, I didn't have the time to check the pH of our soil, and go out to buy something to make it more acidic. My bushes seem reasonably healthy (although perhaps suffering from a lack of water), but I wanted to know how important it is to give them acidic soil?  There are a few parts to my question:   Is this something to bother with, or just something to do if you are a really serious gardener? Does the soil acidity affect the growth and health of the plant, the fruiting (quantity and quality), both, or neither? If you would recommend adding something to the soil to lower the pH, what?   Thanks for your help! "
1961,How to take care of Erica Gracilis?,"I was at the store and I saw an Erica Gracilis and decided to buy it to give a bit of colour to my garden. However, I do not know how to take care of it. I was wondering what is the best location to place this plant, is it indoors or outdoors? In addition, should it be located in direct sun or indirect sun?  "
1962,Plants for under blue spruce tree,"Along the west fence of my yard, just on the other side in the neighbours yard, are three towering blue spruce trees basically stacked on top of each other.  Because of this, the grass doesn't grow that nice on my side of the fence about 8 feet out.  Now I know I could take measures to help the grass survive the spruce needles (raking often and balancing PH), but I also kinda want to put a flower bed and shrubs there anyways.  I am in Southern Manitoba, so obviously have a pronounced winter.  What kind of plants or shrubs might be good to plant in a bed that has high acidity due to spruce needles, and has shade almost all morning?  I was hoping there might be some perennials or hardy shrubs that might be suited for this environment. If not, I am open to anything that would thrive in this environment, even if they had to be planted every spring.  Does anyone have any suggestions for some plants in this area? Thanks! "
1963,How to prune this newly bought cherry?,I bought this cherrytree (hedelfinger) for cheap. Therefore you get what you pay for I guess. I want to prune it in a good shape(open vase/goblet as I read thats the best choice. However it currently has crossing limbs and also is 'flat'.  My question: which limbs should I cut and to where? Should I cut them all the way or look for outward pointing buds an cut above those? Or should I give up on the goblet shape and keep it as is and plant it as espalier kind of tree?     
1964,Problem with Crassula Tetragona,"I recently adopted this Crassula Tetragona plant from a friend. It's dropping leaves like crazy. This plant is in a south facing window in San Diego, CA.   I haven't repotted it so I'm not sure about the soil mix it's in. There are both brown dried up leaves and green leaves falling.   Could this be due to overwatering? Lack of sunlight?        "
1965,How does one build a bluestone paver patio with grass between the stones?,"The plan is to use 2'x2' bluestone pavers with up to 3"" of space between the stones. This would be placed on a base of 6"" of bluestone dust (as this has been more effective than natural screenings/fines at keeping ants from taking up residence).  I would love to have grass between the stones, but I'm concerned that the 2"" deep won't be enough soil.   Is this enough soil for grass? What are some considerations to help ensure success? Is this a long term solution? Will the grass cause the stones to shift/lift over time? "
1966,What element is needed to turn Hydrangea flowers blue?,What element is needed to turn Hydrangeas blue? Is it sulfur or aluminum? 
1967,What is the best frequency to fertilize fruit trees?,"What is the best frequency at which to fertilize fruit trees?   The first method is to dump a large amount of fertilizer to feed the plant one or two times per year. This method was the preferred method listed in my gardening book. The reason not specified. I question how this method is sustainable. Wouldn't the fertilizer seep out of the reach of the roots after a few good waterings?  The second method is to either use slow release fertilizer or use small amounts of fertilizer every time you water. This second method was never discussed in my book. I realize this method is more tedious, but I do have the dedication to do it if it is beneficial to the plants. This more frequent method also seems to avoid burning the roots.  If it matters, I have various fruit trees: pomegranate, cherry, guava, lychee, wax apple, dragon fruit, goji berry, blackberry, raspberry, and strawberry. Most are young and in containers. The bigger ones are in the ground.  "
1968,Why is the stem of my ZZ Plant drying?,Why is the stem of my ZZ Plant drying? It was fat like the other stems. Is it dying or doing something for its own good?  I am not overwatering the plant.    
1969,What is a safe proximity for a Boxwood hedge to a paver walkway?,"Background  I am designing a screen of narrow shrubs for a space between a sunken stairwell and an existing paver walkway.  The width of the area in question is 2.5' with a desired plant height of 5'.    As such, I've narrowed my search to one of Dee Runk or Green Tower Boxwoods; both of which I expect to grow 18""-24"" wide.  Question  With this proximity to the sidewalk, am I risking disruption/buckling of the existing paver walkway with the roots of these plants?  Any ideas what a safe minimum distance would be? "
1970,Is cow dung really bad for potted houseplants? (There are videos in the question.),"Disclaimer: This question might be off-topic or weird. This question is not to hurt anyone's feelings or to disrespect opinions and knowledge of any person or user here.  I do remember asking this question here but cannot find it. Why is cow dung bad for houseplants?.   Now people here tell me that it is a bad idea to use cow dung for potted plants. I once saw a video on cow dung and its magic on plants. To anyone who's interested:  [website][website]  Image      If cow dung is bad, why is this person getting great results from it? He has shown many examples in his video.  From what I know and understand, cow dung has too much nitrogen in it, which can cause root burn. It also retains water for extremely long periods of time which can also lead to root rot. That's all I know. But if that's true, how come the plants looks really healthy and lush?  What's the case? Has any gardener/user here ever experimented on this? What was the result: good or bad? "
1971,Caladium plant leaves turn yellow,"I have bought a Caladium Plant last week. When I was potting her, I accidentally cut a few roots. When I saw some of her leaves wilting I associated it with my clumsy hands. But just today I noticed that some of her leaves are now turning yellow.   I water her,lightly, more like sprinkling for about half a minute, once everyday because I read that they like to be moist. The yellowing I assume is predominantly because of root-rot. I've gathered with a little research that over-watering aids root-rot  Misc:   I'm growing her as an indoor plant. I place her outside my window (no direct sunlight) for a few hours (almost) everyday. Most of online blogs suggest watering to keep her moist. That's what I'm doing (Am I overdoing that?). Most of her leaves are quite healthy. Some leaves though are just rotting partly (no yellowing though). The partly suffering leaves suggest me that it's not over-watering. My diagnosis is that she has caught an infection.     I seek, as an amateur gardener, advice. Looking at her image, does it look like the yellowing is due to an infection, or over-watering? "
1972,Square foot garden companion planting - in occupied squares or not?,"This is our 5th year using about 160 square feet of garden space. We have never really played with companion planting though. We have several zucchini (16 squares, 4x4), squash (2x2), tomatoes (2x2), peppers (~2x2), etc.   When you are companion planting in a square foot garden, are you able to plant the companion crop in the squares that are occupied by the larger plant - could I plant a bunch of radishes and nasturtiums in the 16 square feet taken up by the 4x4 of the zucchini? Can I plant carrots in the 4 squares taken up by a tomato plant with the tomato in the center?  This would seem to be correct way since beans were grown at the base of corn and use the stalks as a pole...  Any feedback would be helpful. Thanks! "
1973,Should I treat freshly cut tree branches before using them as trellises?,"I have a bundle of branches from a North American Maple in my yard, just cut down while pruning the tree in the spring.  I'm contemplating whittling down some 2-foot-long sticks to use as simple trellises for foot-tall young tomato plants (one per plant, stuck into the soil at the base).  Is there any risk of the Maple sprouting and/or sapping nutrients from the tomatoes?  Should I heat them?  What's the best temperature to heat wood, in order to sterilize but not burn it? "
1974,what plant/vine is this?,What plant is this? Leaves are very small. How should I care for it?     
1975,How do (consumer) soil moisture sensors work?,"Wikipedia has a great article on soil moisture sensors, but it focuses on commercial/farming/large-scale settings. I'm investigating options for consumers, and I'd like to understand what technologies are available for my front yard. (I would also ask for product links, but I believe those are discouraged on StackExchange sites ...) So my questions:   What moisture sensor technologies are commonly and successfully applied by consumers? Investigating one such product, I came across the following gem explaining their technology:      Baseline Soil Moisture Sensors work by  sending a high frequency pulse   of  electricity down an embedded wire path.   The high frequency of   the pulse causes the  sphere of influence to move outside the  sensor   blade and into the soil around it.   When the pulse travels through   moisture, it  slows down.  The sensor measures the  speed, and then   converts this measurment  to a moisture content reading.   Assuming they don't mean ""the sphere of influence is moved by advanced magic muggles can't possibly comprehend"", what technology might they refer to and how does that work? "
1976,"Potted trees stored in cool basement are leafing out early, what to do?","Despite being advised to heel in trees or simply cover potted trees in mulch over winter, I did bring some potted trees indoors in a dark, cool (~50F), fairly dry (~30% relative humidity) basement. Sure enough they are leafing out before their outdoor counterparts and while nighttime temps still dip into &lt;30F freezing temps.  What's the best path forward for these trees to survive and eventually acclimate to a planted place? I've had young trees seem to die off in the past only to burst back into life at some seemingly random point over summer, so maybe it's worth prioritizing their acclimation to the outdoor climate even if they lose a batch of leaves/buds from it.  The species in question are hazelnut, linden, black locust, and apple.  Some options I've considered:  Leave them in the garage til it's warmer, and if so, what kind of minimum temps are OK for them (does it need to be >32F or can they handle some frost)? If in the garage, should I water them or put them in a slightly brighter area? If bringing them outside, any precautions I should take, like covering the pots in mulch as I would've in autumn? "
1977,Finding How many hours my orchard have been under 7°C,I have bought an orchard which has 42 apple trees 30 apricots and 22 walnuts. And I want to know if my orchard is suitable for apple farming or not. I have red that apple trees should be in a location that at least goes under 7°C at least 1000 hours in a year.  In this website I can see how whether was in my orchards area. [website]How can I calculate how many hours my orchard has been under 7°C.

1979,seeding a lawn over a ground stump,"I had a large Maple tree removed and the stump ground last fall, then removed as much of the mulch as possible.  Now I want to plant grass seed. there are still wood chips in the area that is approx 8-10"" below the surrounding area, and there is some solid wood from the roots that were not ground far enough. Would applying a composted cow manure then top soil be a good way to go? Should I layer it below the new topsoil or mix it into the topsoil? Any suggestions would be appreciated. "

1981,What should I do with this Ficus elastica (Rubber fig)?,"Something is wrong with my Ficus elastica (Rubber fig).   What is this white hard salt-like thing?  It is on the backside of some leaves. I cleaned this with water and cotton and it came off, but it was somewhat hard. Is it sap? Is it the thing which helps in rubber production? If yes, can I make an eraser with it?    Should I cut the aerial roots? would that be good or bad for the plant?     "
1982,Why is my Dwarf Jade plant dropping more than dozens of leaves?,My Dwarf Jade plant has been dropping dozens of leaves (both good and bad leaves) every day for the past few days.

1983,"In store-bought fertilizer for camellias, what's the difference between NPK 10-10-10 and say 4-4-4?","I'm looking to buy fertilizer for my camellias. I read on a couple of websites to use 8-8-8 or 10-10-10, but when I search online many brands sell fertilizers for camellias that have different compositions, sometimes as low as 4-4-4.  What is the difference? I understand it's the amount of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, what I am wondering is what will be the difference? Does a 10-10-10 fertilizer mean it has a higher concentration and hence I should use less?  Thanks "
1984,"Help! My cat broke the seed pod off my mango seedling, Will it still grow?","As I was planting my mango seedling I kept the seed above the soil because I liked the look of it it was really silly as my cat jumped up and paw landed on the pod snapping the pod off!  The mango seedling is about 2 inches tall with 8 leaves that still look rather healthy despite the seed pod being broken off 3 days ago, I also know that it has a very strong root. Does anyone know if my plant Will Survive or not?? "
1985,Why is the lower leaf wilted on all of these plants? Should I remove them?,"These basil plants have been thriving steadily better and better since being transplanted as sprouts.  However every one of this group of 8 in the end of a planter is exhibiting a wilted leaf, and it's always the lowest one.  What's going on here?  Should I snip off these wilted leaves?    "
1986,Concerned about wintering a potted banana tree,"I have been growing this Musa Basjoo plant from a small pup for about three years. It is now 6 feet. This was the first year that I will not be able to bring it inside the house for the winter.     It is just too large. I have been told that these plants will grow back if the trunk is cut, but I don't have the heart to do that UNLESS I HAVE TO. Any advice on how to care for the plant in zone 6 usa, where the winters can be very harsh, even with hardy bananas as the musa basjoo? I have seen trees that are cut return, but never plants in pots. I do not know what to do with this lovely happy plant during the cold months. Should I cut it? "
1987,How to grow a new Opuntia (prickly pear) from a cutting?,"I cut this pad which grew this summer from my Opuntia and I want to make a new one. I know I have to let it dry for some time before planting it, so that the wound can heal. For now I just left it on the soil, in a dry atmosphere indoors. But I have a few questions.   How do I know that it's ready? Will I see roots appear at the bottom if I leave it in this position for some time? Do I have to humidify the soil a little so that the roots can grow? Once it's planted, do I have to wait a few days/weeks before watering it for the first time?    "
1988,Will moss affect my indoor rubber trees?,"I've recently found moss growing very prettily in my outdoor pots, which I haven't paid much attention to over winter. I don't expect it'll do very well in summer out there, but I have Ficus elastica growing indoors and the bare soil isn't very attractive.  Can I transplant the moss around the rubber trees? I only water them about twice a week in summer and once a week in winter. Will that be enough water for the moss? Will the two species interact negatively? "
1989,Would holes in the sides of plastic pots impove drainage and aeration?,"Since the pots are plastic, they are not breathable. I made enough holes at the bottom to let the excess water seep out.  Some time ago, I made some, 1/4 of an inch, holes.     But when I watered it with nothing in it, some of the water was retained along the sides(since the bottom is slightly curved inwards). So I made some more, even smaller than 1/4 of an inch, holes. Now much of the water is removed, but not complete. I will show some pics:  More holes I made(looking inside the pot):      Water retained(I hope it is clearly visible):    Now comes the aeration/breathability. Should I make any holes on the side of the pots? If yes,    How many? How much bigger/smaller In what manner(refer to final pic with four pots with yellow dots that represents holes of diameter smaller than 1/4 of an inch)?   Should I even bother? Will that be good or bad for my plant and soil?   "
1990,How to preserve dried herbs from fungus/bacteria or even insect attack?,"My garden produces a lot of herbs, like mint, sage, rosemary, lavender, etc. I use to wash them, after gathering, and dry them in the shadow to preserve (as much as possible) their scent, color and beneficial qualities.  Once dried, sometimes it happens that tiny spiders appear in my (sealed) jar. I suspect they were present among the dried leaves, maybe in form of eggs when I filled the jars. I don't want it to happen again, either with spiders, or insect, fungus, bacteria, etc.  So, is there a way to ensure that any kind of unwanted life is destroyed, before storing dried herbs? The only idea that came to my mind is to put dried herbs in the microwave oven for a while. Could it be a good idea?  thanks! "
1991,What kind of grass is this?,  Can anyone tell me what kind of grass this is?  It's growing in my lawn in Central South Dakota in a partly shaded area.  I seeded the area with a sun/shade mix but the seed head does not look like the bluegrass/ryegrass/fescue that is supposed to be in the seed mix.  I believe it may be Downy Brome but I'm no expert.  Is this a type of grass I want growing in my yard? 
1992,Will my arborvitae survive the deer,I've planted several emerald green arborvitae in my yard in the Pacific NW.  There are many blacktailed deer in the area who like to munch on it.  I currently have a deer fence around the area but would like to remove it in the future. My question is:  how much/percentage of the arborvitae can the deer eat around the bottom and have it still survive.  I'm not especially worried about the fact that they may look like lollipops ... I can plant shrubs that the deer won't eat around the base.  But will the plants survive if the deer shear off the bottom … half?  1/3? I haven't been able to find anything that addresses this specific question.  Thank you! 
1993,When a compact Echeveria decapitated,"I have often taken the tip of some Echeveria species in order to promote branching. The branches are then used as cuttings. My process involves first taking away the tip, leaving all the leaves below the cut attached to the rosette's main trunk. A ""naked"" stem does not always generate new pups and may die as a result. Keeping the leaves will ensure new offsets start to poke out of the leaf-bases. As the pups grow, I take more leaves out of the main trunk and I often root the leaves as well. The end result is a ""mound"" of rosettes from which I can take new rosette cuttings.  I never do this process to the compact Echeverias. Unfortunately, all my plants are available at nurseries that do not keep (or do not get the plants with) the species lables. I identified one of my ""compact"" Echeverias as E. Lilacina, which is too compact to treat this way, because the main trunk is too short. On the other hand, I may take-off the tip if it has rotted (for whatever reason) or was damaged. In that case, would the offsetting rosettes be too squeezed and distorted? Would I be able to take good-looking pups this way, or should I resort to leaf-cuttings? "
1994,Will a homemade insecticide affect the taste of herbs or other edible plants?,I'm thinking about using a homemade insecticide like a small amount of dish soap/coffee/Aloe vera mixed with water for my Stevia plant which the insects seem to like. I'm worried though that what I use in the insecticide will end up making the Stevia leaves taste of these things like soap/coffee/Aloe vera.   Will this happen? Or do you put such a small amount in the water that it would have no effect on the taste? 
1995,How can I transplant this large oak tree?,"A few streets away, the homeowner said that if I can dig up and move the oak tree pictured below then it is mine. I would love to have this tree in my yard.  I'm not sure if you can tell from the picture, but this tree is a solid 15 ft tall. It may be upwards of 20 ft, it's hard to tell.  Also, the homeowner said this is a ""live oak"".  What does that mean?  If it matters, I live in coastal North Carolina.  Would a normal person like me with a shovel be able to dig up this beautiful oak tree and move it a few streets down to my house and transplant it in my yard?  What would the process be to do this?

1996,What options do I have for placing/installing a backflow preventer?,"I'm installing a sprinkler system, and have to install a backflow preventer and pressure regulator at the start of the line.  What I don't like about this is having random bits of plumbing sticking out of my yard where they'll get hit by things, and look unsightly.  There is already a stub for irrigation water inside the house (in the basement) with a shutoff valve and a pipe going back outside.  Is there an indoor or underground option for backflow preventers?  Or do they have to stick out of the ground somewhere?  Do they have to be higher than any point in the line past them? "
1997,Different fertilizer ratios suggested for golf courses and home lawns?,I was reading this article about care for seashore paspalum turf - [website]Why is there such a difference (almost completely flipped) between consumer lawns and golf courses for the same lawn type?

1999,Regrowing basil from bought plant,"I bought some basil which came with its roots (in a plastic container, not a pot) I thought it could be a great opportunity to regrow my own basil!    I have seen some videos that show how they take part of the plant and put it first in water, later to put it in a pot.  I’m wondering if having already roots (don’t know if they came ready to repot, maybe they’re dry?) makes it possible to skip the step where the plant is in water.     Maybe I didn’t take the right part of the plant for repotting (I have other parts with leaves)? How long should it be in water? I’ve seen some answers to problems where they state that the basil may have too much sun or too much water (or not enough). So I also wonder in what conditions should I take care of the basil...  Thanks! "
2000,No pressure in irrigation system,Last summer the sprinklers worked fine but when trying to replace them with drip we found the water no longer flowed. I opened the pressure regulator to inspect if it was blocked but it seemed fine. I can hear the gurgling of water when I turn on the system either with the actuator or manually. But water just barely flows out and only at the first sprinkler outlet. There may be some dirt or stones in the pipes. Is there any way to clear out the pipes without water pressure? Or how can I troubleshoot the lack of pressure? 
2001,Giving my palm tree a second life,"I didn't water at all my palm tree (bought at Homebase) for a couple weeks, and before that I neglected it. See it below.

2002,What to do about fungus in lawn?,"   Possible Duplicate:   Should I be concerned about mushrooms in my lawn?       Every time I mow my lawn, I find a few of these bulbs of fungus.    Sometimes they are brown like in the picture I took and sometimes they are more white and smooth looking.  I usually just scoop them up and throw them away.  When I manipulate them they generally throw a bunch of ""dust"" around which I assume are spoors that are spreading them potentially.  They are always on one side of the house which I'm guessing has some decaying matter in it due to a neighbor's pear tree.  Other than getting rid of the pears when I see them, is there anything I can do to stop these things from growing?  Are they particularly dangerous to the lawn?  Are they going to keep spreading?  And what the heck are they anyways? "
2003,Leaves on barbeque rosemary turning yellowish,A barbeque rosemary plant I bought last year was doing fairly well until a week ago when I noticed some of the leaves were discolored. Then today I saw that the plant was really looking poorly.   I live in California near San Francisco and we have had a lot of rain this spring. Could that have caused the problem? The plant is in a container with potting soil that drains fast and doesn't keep very much water.   An oregano plant next to the rosemary also has a patch of leaves that are not doing well. But at least part of that oregano is growing well. That makes me worry about the rosemary.    UPDATE 1: I see from another person's question that it may be spider mites: Best way to combat Rosemary Mites?  UPDATE 2: I thought the problem might be insects so I used a detergent spray on the plants. That spray brought out in view a bunch of fine webs I had not seen before. They look like spider webs rather than spider mite webs -- too big.   UPDATE 3: I found this link to a site about rosemary pests. My problem seems to be something else. The discoloration on the oregano and the rosemary seems similar. But the problem started long ago on the oregano and just recently on the rosemary.       
2004,Are ants/flies a threat to a raspberry bush?,"Ants in my garden seem to especially love this raspberry bush at the moment.  I also notice these two little things that look like tiny flies sitting on the leaves- except they are not moving, like dead flies.  Ants seem to be hanging out around them, but I haven't seen them actually take a fly anywhere.  Just curious, should I take action on the flies?  Or the ants?  I'm keeping my eyes on the leaves for leaf miners, and on the ground for aphids, but otherwise just letting the ecosystem do it's thing.     "

2006,"What is the most effective way to eradicate burdock, curly dock and mugwort from a field?","We've got a small ""meadow"" area that is in bad shape from new home construction. Despite heavy seeding with native warm-season grasses and proper mowing, the area is overrun with mugwort, curly dock, and burdock. If we don't take this step, the homeowner is going to install sod.  So we'd like to go off our typical organic approach and chemically remove the offenders in a single or single series of applications.    This would be a one-issue chemical treatment in an otherwise toxin-free management - meaning we would consider a series of broadleaf herbicide applications this fall/spring, but would then revert to natural management. We want to leave the native warm-season grasses intact. Everything else is fair game, but the real targets are those listed above.  I would say we would follow up with soil amendments, but soil ""improvements"" tend to favor weeds over our native grasses. We just need to give them a chance to get established.   What chemical would be most effective? When and how often should that chemical be applied? How should the area be prepared for this application(s)?   And finally, is there anything we're failing to consider? "
2007,What's digging holes in my indoor potted plants?,"I have a indoor basil potted plant in an office environment and over the weekend holes appeared on the surface of the soil, as if something dug them. The pots are next to a window, but it's closed at the weekends.   A few times I've I noticed cockroaches in the bathroom, but it's 10-20 feet away and the office is locked and the door is well sealed. It's an old building, I can see some holes in the ceiling, where the pipes are.  Do cockroaches like to dig holes in potted planets, or could it be something else?  How do I get rid of them?

2008,Should I prune my okra plants?,I have an okra plant which has already produced two okras. Now new leaves are growing and I can see there are two new okras coming from the bottom. Is that good? Do I have to remove both the leaves and the okras coming from the bottom?   Here's an image of the plant:   
2009,What should I do about ants and aphids in my mint?,"I have a pot of mint on my balcony.  The pot seems to contain an Aphid colony (probably a separate question on how to get rid of them).   But today, I noticed many ants in the pot as well.  The question is, are they here for the mint or for the aphids? What should I do? "
2010,"Replacement for an F15T8NDL 18"" lightbulb","I am currently using an F15T8NDL 18"" lightbulb for my plants in a light fixture, and would like to replace it with something much brighter. So my question is that if I add a higher powered bulb in the same fixture, will it automatically draw more power and be much brighter, or do I need a new fixture? And if so, what would be a good replacement bulb? "
2011,"'Climbing' black mulberry (morus nigra), is this real?","Ran in to this plant a the supermarket. It was only 3 bucks so I picked it up out of curiosity. I've started growing mulberry trees a while a go and did quite some youtubing and reading about them. Never have I seen or read about a climbing black mulberry. Google gives me 0 hits when searching for one. The picture on the label is definitely a mulberry, the plant in this stage look more like a blackberry to me.  Question: does this exist? can you train them as climbers (what would happen to the trunk size???), or is this a fake?      "
2012,Making emulsion out of slaughterhouse waste,"I have previously made fish emulsion to fertilize a small greywater garden; pretty much sealing fish waste (entrails, bones, skin) into oxygen-free plastic containers and leaving it for 6 months to a year, and using the diluted 'tea' as a fertilizer. I've just moved to a new island where fish waste is not that readily available, but there is a small slaughterhouse which primarily slaughters goats. Presumably the same process would still work using goat offal? Are there any other factors I need to consider?  Edit: I should specify that this won't be for foods which will be eaten. "
2013,automatic watering system for indoor plants,"I am thinking about building an automated watering system for some potted flowers.  They need water every day so staying away for some days has become impossible without sacrificing them (which is something I don't want to do).  So I thought about getting an aquarium pump, a timer clock and some tubes to have this happen without me.   My first thought was to simply pump out the water of a bottle or so, that way I would have the needed amount of water in the bottle, and when the timer clocks activates the pump it would get the water to my plants, so I could take 1 day off. Unfortunately pumps tend to break when they run dry and they might even catch fire. So that doesn't work.  My next idea was to put the plants above a reservoir, so any excess water could run back into the reservoir where the pump gets its water from. That way they would be watered for 1 hour every day (that is the smallest amount of time I can set the timer clock to) and I might even be gone for a bit longer. Problem is, those plants stand in soil. So some soil might get in the reservoir and damage the pump.   So does anyone have an idea how to solve that problem? Or maybe someone already has a working automated system and is willing to share the plans? "
2014,How can I stop paperwhite bulbs from developing mold when forcing them inside?,"I recently planted a few paperwhite bulbs in river rock with water. They've started to root and sprout, but I noticed one of them is developing mold. What's the best way to fix this problem?  Should I scrape the mold off of the bulb and hope it doesn't come back?  I would need to move the bulb to do so, and I'm afraid I could damage the delicate roots in the process.  Other notes:   I had been trying to keep the water level covering the bottom 1/4"" to 1/2"" of the bulbs, but now that they're putting down roots, I'm aiming for just up to the bottom of the bulbs. The bulbs are in a fairly sunny spot on our dining room table. The room has two walls of windows (South and West facing) that we usually keep the blinds open on. The temperature in the house has been between 70°-75°F for the most part. Possible a bit lower at night, since we really haven't started running the heat here yet.

2015,Another dying Meyer lemon tree,"I have two potted Meyer lemon trees, both about 20 years old, in 14"" pots. I live in Rhode Island, so the trees are outside from May to October, then in a west facing, roughly 70 degree kitchen, with large windows and skylights, for the winter. I have had various issues over the years, mostly from scale insect or over-fertilization, but have always been able to bring them back. Re potted (and root pruned) both trees last fall, using a mixture of orchid medium (lots of bark), perlite and potting soil. They are on pot feet in plastic saucers. I water once or twice a week until water runs out of the bottom. One tree is doing fairly well, but the second which has always had a weaker root system—looks terrible. Leaves drooping and yellowing, some flower buds but I know that's not necessarily a good sign.It's still green under the bark when I scrape the bottom of the trunk, however. Was fertilizing weekly all summer, but have not fertilized either tree since they came in for the winter. There's no evidence of scale.  What am I doing wrong? Can anyone help? These trees are part of the family!  "
2016,How should I deal with tree root pushing on brick retaining wall?,"We have a Mt Fuji, Prunus 'Shirotae', tree with a total diameter of about 8 meters (26 feet). We only have a small garden but love this tree. It's planted next to a brick retaining wall (goes down to our driveway). For a long time it's been fine but it finally started pushing out the retaining wall with a large root. The trunk is about 20cm (8in) in diameter and the root must be about 10-15cm (4-6in), so it's a major one. I'm sort of okay to just leave it and let nature take its course but an alternative would be to slice out the outer part of the root which is against the retaining wall. How bad would this be for the tree?  Overview of area:    Problem root:    Looking in more detail, I now see that the tree itself is probably pushing a bit now on the retaining wall. I think the only solution is to actually remove the retaining wall and perhaps rebuild it to suit the tree. Suggestions?  Retaining wall:   "
2017,Can I encourage my roses to produce more flowers and fewer long stems?,"I have standard roses.  As the weather warms, and after feeding with commerically purchased rotted chicken manure they are growing very, very fast.  Is there a way I can get them to produce more flowers rather than growing long stems like the one that goes out of frame in the top right of the picture below?  If I trim the longer stems off to bring it back to shape will that stop it flowering?  The roses pictured has been there longer than I've owned this house - so I guess it is at least eight years old.  I pruned the head of all the roses at the end of winter down to a few sticks.   "
2018,Differences between arugula and wild arugula,"I grew a wild arugula last year, and was very pleased with the plant.  I would like to grow more of it this year, and maybe to add some (non-wild) arugula as well.  Is there any notable difference between the two, except flower color, and annual/perenial classification? I mean any significant difference in taste, afrodisiac properties, optimal growing conditions, etc.?

2020,Solar powered electric help for winter roof garden?,"Winter is coming.  It's getting cooler here in the Bronx and I've been planting kohlrabi, peas and other winter veggies. But my garden is in pots and I fear the roots will freeze. But then I had and idea... what if I took some of the solar panels that I salvaged and have not yet found a use for and made some kind of ""winter plant helper"" ? I could collect light all day then artificially extend the sunlight with a few extra hours of UV light. Or I could put in a thermostat and heat pads ...   but maybe it makes more sense to try to find some bales of hay (impossible in the city without a car, but I'll try) or build a cold frame.  Is there any logic to my idea for winter electronics for plants? Is it worth a shot? "
2021,Multiple hedge planting,"I currently have a very well established Hawthorn hedge(it’s been there about 15 years). It has always been trimmed around 7 feet high and maybe 3.5 feet wide.      Unfortunately new house have been built on the other side of that fence with noisy neighbours. I am working on making that Hawthorn higher to reduce the sound they are making.   However,  I would like to possibly add another plant like a laurel which has very dense foliage and excellent as a sound barrier. Within the Hawthorn, I have Holly and an Ivy sparingly growing as well.   Can I plant a Laurel in between to make this natural fence denser? Will it grow?  Can I use other plants?  If it might struggle to grow, can I pit it first, let it grow high and strong before I plant it?  Any other ideas? "

2023,What's the best way to remove Junipers?,"I moved into my house a couple of years ago - part of the backyard is sloped (roughly 75' x 10' / 23m x 3m) and the developers planted what I believe to be Blue Pacific juniper along the hill to prevent erosion.  I'm interested in completely getting rid of the juniper and having a landscape architect rework the backyard perhaps creating a few tiers on the hill rather than having a consistent slope.  In the interest of doing some of the work myself, I'm curious about the best way to go about removing the juniper: is there a proper way to kill it? Should I plan to completely up root it by hand?  Any and all suggestions appreciated! "
2024,Can drained water from potted plants be used again to water another house plant?,"I'm wondering if it's okay to use water that has drained through a houseplant to water another plant. Is it safe for both the other plant and the soil? What I mean is that we use at least 500ml (2 cups) of water for each pot on an average basis. A lot of the water is drained from the pot, so if someone has no trouble collecting the drained water, can it be re-used to water another houseplant?  This might seem nonsensical, but consider this when you have to water 30-40 or more plants. What one will achieve via this is conservation of water. "

2026,Cyclamen hederifolium tubers - which side goes up and which down?,"I just received some tubers of winter hard Cyclamen hederifolium and planted them right away. On one side of the (flat) tuber I noticed a kind of spot which looked like it had been cut off before drying. I even saw some dried roots and thought naturally that this side must go down.  Now that everything is planted I thought again and I'm not so sure anymore. I'm asking myself that what if the roots are coming out of the same spot as the growing stem?  What shall I do?  EDIT: I read on the cyclamen.org FAQ (at the bottom, search for 'silly question' on the site) that I should have done it the other way around. Growing point up and convex/even side down. But as they are tubers (like potatoes) is this important? Will they grow anyway? "

In addition, I wonder whether different genus plant can be hybridized, because I want to plant sweet basil, together with holy basil and wonder if it'll cross-pollinate with the chilis. "
2031,How long is bacillus thuringiensis active?,"A few weeks ago I sprayed my broccoli and bok choy plants with bacillus thuringiensis in an attempt to control caterpillar numbers. I'm pleased to see no new caterpillars (pieris rapae larvae) since then even though I have seen eggs laid on leaves.  However, bacillus thuringiensis is said only to persist on the leaves for a few days so why is the effect lasting so long? I think the recommendation is to respray after three weeks so it's not just me.  Do the bacteria numbers increase in the soil after application, or is there some other mechanism that suppresses the larvae?  Ps: diy expansion of the bacteria using a milk culture "

Are there any tricks I can incorporate into my design to smooth the water flow automatically. Right now I have to poke/plug holes and constantly tweak the system.   I feel I may be missing some major design principle of such systems? Any hints? Or things I should study to find a method on my own. "
2035,How closely should herbs be spaced?,"Newbie herb planter here who is very confused by all of the different information online about how best to start planting herbs.  I have started with the following basic herbs:  Basil Oregano Coriander  I have three ~15cm planters or so on a windowsill that gets good sun. I started out by just lashing a handful of seeds into the pots. While the herbs started out strong, they now seem to have stalled. Is this because they have been sown too densely? I don't intend on re-planting outside (live in an apartment with no garden), so how many seeds should I be placing in each planter? I've read online that basil seeds should be sown ~10 inches apart, but surely this would mean I'm only looking at planting one seed per pot, or else I'd need huge pots completely unsuitable for a windowsill.  Fundamental questions I know, but I can't find consistent info. Thanks in advance. "
2036,Less invasive alternatives to willow for living structures,"I want to create a living willow arbour (something like this: [website]Am I right in thinking this rules out willow, as the roots are likely to cause problems?

The tree had a noticeable bend to it when when it was transplanted.  I tried staking it, but that appears to have made things worse as the top is growing very crooked.  I've been doing a bit of research online and it seems that staking is a somewhat contentious practice.  I've removed all the staking.  A couple of questions for the community.  I don't mind a little bend, but the current bend at the top is excessive.  Is it likely the tree will straighten up if I leave it alone?  Can I use guy wires to help fix this or will it only make matters worse?    Thanks for any input.   "

2047,What should I do about a tree that is growing over my retaining wall?,"My house I recently moved back into has a tree in the side yard that has over-grown the small retaining wall after 10+ years.  I didn't know this was going on as I was an absentee owner for a while, but now am faced with roots that have squeezed on top of the wall bricks.  I'm trying to widen the retaining wall to give the tree more room, but should I try and remove the bricks?  I'm a little worried that if I remove the bricks the tree will become unstable.  I see one root has managed to grow out of the bricks.  I will try and make the wall taller too so the roots have dirt up to the bottom of the tree.   This is a beautiful tree and I don't want to have to cut it down, but it was certainly an error to plant it in this small of an area. Bad landscaping company for not planning ahead.

Many people have seen and enjoyed this trick with romain lettuce:  [website]I do something similar with lemon grass.  It makes me wonder: why not have a growing zone in the kitchen for keeping fresh produce sold in whole plant form? Couldn't lead to better taste, longer lasting and maybe even more abundant food?

2051,Newbie with yellow/falling avocado tree leaves,"First time newbie here:  I've received an avocado tree as a gift no so long ago (April 3rd) since I always wanted to have one (although planting it myself from scratch hehe). However, my plant has been having some problems since I had it. I'll list out all the information I can so it'd be easier to explain. It's a Hass plant.   I've watered it twice since I received it (the 3rd and the 8th of April) (with tap water, my bad, and the pH in Madrid's tap water seems to be from 7 to 8,5 , so it's alkaline. [website]The climate here is cold these last couple of days, but I leave the window closed during the night (Madrid, going 5 Celsius to 15 these last couple of days. I have not used any fertilizer, but as far as I can understand, I might need an iron fertilizer due to the problem I have.   Some leaves have turned yellow and then brown. The location of these leaves were not in the bottom but in the middle of the plant, so it doesn't seem to be too much water. The first 2 leaves that were too brown are still ""watery"" sort to speak. They're not dry. The 2 other leaves that are also now brown ARE dry.   Reading online, I should feel that the soil around the tree is at least a bit compact when I press it and it does feel that way, so I'm not sure about watering it even more because it doesn't feel that it needs to be watered.  I've tried to notice any bug on the underside of the leaf or in the top, but I don't see anything.   And unfortunately, I don't have any external area to leave the plant because I live on a high floor.   Could it also be a change in the environment due to the different location now?  I also leave some pictures for you to see.  Any recommendations? Thanks!        "
2052,What is this purple flowering serrated-leaf succulent?,This is a waxy-leafed succulent with purple tube-shaped flowers.  I bought this plant at a yardsale in Virginia eight years ago.

2053,How can I limit the height (depth) of our English (Common) Ivy?,"We have ivy growing in the front yard, and I like it. It requires no attention other than trimming to keep it off the house, tree, sidewalk. My wife doesn't like that it keeps getting higher. Instead of just laying on the ground it's over a foot and a half high most places, and two feet deep in some. I think if I just cut it down I'll take off leaves and leave nothing but vines, then the sun will get through and I'll have a million weeds. I want a nice, low covering of ivy, 6-12 inches, like it was years ago.  Is there any way to accomplish this?   Do I cut it back as much as possible and then pull the weeds until it recovers the ground? Seems like that would look awful.  Thanks in advance. "

It appears to be fused with the stem, unlike scale. The red peel was thin. Underneath, it was the same green color as the inner stem.   What are these red bumps? Are they pests or part of the tree? This is my first cherry tree, so I know nothing about their peculiarities.    "
2057,NO fruit on my Hybrid orange/lemon tree,"why do i not get any blooms on my hybrid fruit trees? live in south fl. has ample sun, gets plenty of H2O! has ground cover under the tree. tree is 4-5 yrs old. did have some fruit 2yrs ago?????? "
2058,Dealing with overgrown gravel and weed membrane,"I have a 8m x 3m bed in my garden which has a mix of well-established shrubs (Weigela, ornamental cherry, smoke bush, roses), ground cover (ivy and honeysuckle), and red valerian, lemon balm and lungwort.  I recently dug up a snowberry to replace it with a hydrangea, and found that the bed is actually about 20cm of gravel with two layers of weed membrane under it.  It has obviously been there a long time as enough leaf litter and detritus has built up to turn the gravel into poor soil, into which the valerian and the other smaller plants are rooting.  The weed membrane is largely intact and is blocking the roots from spreading into the soil below.  I'd like to clear some of the ivy and try planting some other plants in there.  My aim is to slowly move towards permaculture/forest gardening ideas, growing more edible plants.  But all the roots tangled up in it mean removing the gravel and membrane is extremely difficult (apart from the intrinsic difficulty of shifting large volumes of gravel!)  The soil under the membrane is well-compacted clay with apparently little organic matter.  Any ideas how to deal with this situation?  I had thought of putting a fork down through the membrane to open up some holes and then just planting in the gravel, but it would be pretty poor soil.  Should I focus on improving the gravel and leaving the membrane alone? "
2059,Is my crepe myrtle dying because of winter season?,"I grew my Crepe Myrtle early spring and then knowing that winter was coming, I slowly put it inside to get it used to the indoor dark light and dry atmosphere. It's been two weeks now that I let it always inside and the lower leaf are starting to dry and die. I added an Humidifier yesterday hoping it could help. But for the light, I can't make any miracle as my window isn't really facing the sun anytime during the day. Just some low ambient light i'd say.   Is the lower leaf dying a normal behaviour of three during winter? Or is it slowly dying? What could I do to save it?  Side note: I live in Quebec Canada, so it's gonna be 6-7 month of cold temperature so I must keep it inside...    Older picture:   "
2060,What type of soil should I use with fruit trees?,"Background: We live on a large mountain. And the soil we have here is full of small, medium and large rocks everywhere. Throughout the time we've lived here, growing trees is really hit and miss. Due to our ignorance of planting trees and types of soil to use.  I know now that specific trees require specific elements (nitrogen) and a specific pH level in the soil in order to thrive.    Should I remove S/M/L rocks from the existing soil before planting new fruit trees? Should you ever use top soil when planting new trees when replacing existing soil? If not (2), then what type of soil is recommended for planting fruit trees? How often should someone water fruit trees? Is there a general understanding of the elements needed for planting fruit trees, and the pH level in the soil?  "
2061,Why are my anthurium leaves rapidly turning yellow?,"  My white anthurium had been sitting in the entrance way with frosted glass (and therefore receiving diffused light) from last June to this January (Northern hemisphere). It was doing perfectly fine until I noticed a few leaves falling off last week. I moved it out of the cold entranceway into the living room on a window by the radiator thinking it was reacting to the cold temperatures. I also lifted the pot out of its container and realised it was full of water - clearly I've overwatered it. The next day I noticed brown spots at the edges of some leaves so I moved it to the other end of he room, about 8 ft from the window. Today I can now see the leaves have yellowed almost immediately. Is it too far from light or is the overwatering responsible? I'm really concerned and wondering what I can do to rescue the plant? "
2062,Newer watering system lacks pressure,"A couple years ago I had someone repair and replace front yard yard watering rubber piping with pvc, and replace drip system lines.  He did not put heads on the drip lines.  I have noticed that the lines do not seem to have the pressure that they used to have with the old system. I should have notified the contractor sooner, but I was disgusted with his services and did not want to deal with him.  He also laid sod in the back yard that only partially took.    How can I get more pressure in the drip lines?  is there something I can do or do I have to hire someone to fix the problem? "
2063,Gummosis and girdling,"Let's say there is a fruit tree (for example, a plum) that has gummosis. What is going to happen (with the respect to fungi, bacteria, surrounding environment, including roots and soil), if such tree is girdled? (The idea is to create a snag useful for wildlife)  I suppose there are different outcomes depending on the root cause of the gummosis, but is there a positive scenario among those outcomes, worth trying? "
2064,Will glyphosate based herbicide work with a food thickener?,"I would like to thicken some Roundup to form a drip-free paint for targeting weeds in groundcover beds. If I use Thick-It starch based food thickener, will I get the result I want? I would be watering down the Roundup 4-5 times normal, because of how thick it would go on. I could also add a wetting agent if it would help maximize contact. Does anyone see any problems with this idea?  "
2065,What are these black round dry spots on my Aloe Vera leaves?,"The leaves of my Aloe Vera are covered with black dry regions of round form. They are found on new and old leaves, at the middle and on the edges of the leaves.  What could be the reason? How should I treat it?  It does not look like the question Black patches on aloe vera leaves because in my case the shape of the leaf is changed, the leaves become thinner at the place where the black dot exists.   "
2066,How to turn a field of high grass/shrub into lawn or food forest?,"I have a 1.5-acre section that has not been properly maintained for many years. It is covered with high grass with some shrubs of willow, gorse and broom:   (the grass is actually much higher now as the photo is 1 year old)  The plan is to either make it a nice and clean green lawn that would be regularly maintained, or food forest, or both as I am actually planning to build on the land. Either way, the section needs to be easy to traverse, so the vegetation needs to be kept under control — especially gorse; the soil would have lots of gorse seeds now.  What would be the steps and what machinery would need to be involved? Does it need to be bulldozered/plowed/harrowed first? Or can the vegetation be simply cut somehow so that mowing and/or tree planting could proceed right afterwards? "
2067,Is something eating my peperomia?,"I’m new to house plants, and I bought a peperomia and snake plant. My peperomia was doing fine, growing new leaves, enjoying life.. But I realized that the new leaves were being munched, and the big leaves started getting black and holey? Ive read up on how peperomias dont like to be wet so i think ive been watering him correctly. Could it be a bacteria virus? Or from the sun (I have a south facing window with a sheet over it so its not direct sunlight) Or maybe an insect? I picked off little black things at the bottom that I thought might be scale insects but again I wasnt sure. please help, am I just a concerned plant mom who shouldnt worry? Or is something serious actually going on?     "
2068,Aquatic plants growing conditions,"I am a beginner gardener. I wanted to know if aquatic plants can grow in a small (100 x 10 x 10 inch) outdoor water tank filled with clean tap water? Also, does the water have to be treated in any way?  Also, are there are any good books that you would suggest? And any particular water plants that would easily grow in London?   Thank you. "
2069,Low-maintenance vermicomposting in a tall bin?,"Most vermicomposting instructions I've found use either a shallow bin, or a stack of shallow trays.  I'm looking for an effective but low-maintenance approach, and I won't need to harvest the compost very often.   I'm wondering: What if I simply use a tall, narrow bin - like perhaps a narrow kitchen trash can, about 1' by 1' by 4' deep? The idea would be to add compostable waste at a rate of 1 foot every couple of months, so that the worms can stay in the top foot or so, and anything more than a foot below the surface should be entirely composted by the time it's too deep for the worms.   Air holes drilled along the side could allow some aerobic composting to continue in the deeper soil, in case it's not fully decomposed, and a drain hole at the bottom could release excess leachate. No work at all would be required until the bin is full, at which point I could scoop out the top layer with the worms and set it aside, then harvest the rest of the bin all at once.  Is there any reason this wouldn't work? Is there a name for this approach? "
2070,Is June too late to start growing vegetables in a northern/cold climate?,"I've gotten into gardening recently and I have a lot of herbs and small plants on my balcony. I have a cabin about a 30 minute drive away with a decent amount of land. I was thinking about building some raised beds there and growing some vegetables. The only real issue is that I live in Sweden's Zone VI. Snow usually comes in late November/early December, and it usually melts in April/May. Bearing that in mind, am I too late to start growing vegetables this year? Should I wait until next year and get a head start on it then? It feels a bit depressing to wait, but at the same time, spending money and time pointlessly would feel bad too. "
2071,What is proper way of disposing weed treated with herbicides?,I would like to know what is proper way of disposing weed treated with herbicides? Is it safe to use tree killed by herbicide as firewood? 
2072,Is it possible to save this aloe?,"My friend moved into a new house where the previous owners had left this aloe. She didn’t want it, so it was given to me, but I don’t know how to save it. Because of the droopy leaves (and somewhat squishy leaves) I’m guessing it has root rot (I have never had an aloe plant so that is a guess) but the leaves are full of gel and there’s a miniature one growing off of the base. I read somewhere that a terra cotta pot and succulent or cactus soil is best for aloe, so I’m planning on getting that this weekend for this plant. My question is, is this plant salvageable? I don’t want to go buy stuff and put in the effort of reporting if it’s going to die anyways. Second, what do I do with the little plant growing off the base? And finally, some of the leaves broke in transport today, do I cut the whole leaf off or will it heal?  Thank you for you help!  "
2073,What will this blackberry need?,"On a whim, I bought a pair of plants for my container garden. They were labelled raspberry and blackberry; however, I'm not certain about the blackberry plant. The blackberry that used to grow by my old house looked a lot more like the raspberry than the blackberry I just bought:    (Now that I look at it again that's a terrible photo. I can take a better one if you want.)   Obviously that raspberry plant is going to want a trellis, and they'll both need bigger pots. But will the blackberry also want a trellis? Or will it grow into more of a bush shape? "
2074,"Which plant is this? “Dead ends,” pruning, watering tips","This plant has been in my possession since last summer (I moved into a new, and otherwise empty, apartment one year ago). I wanted to keep it, but because there are no labels, I decided to water it only when the soil felt dry, which ended up being about once a week. Also, it gets bright indirect sunlight (in Western Europe, 47°N), and never direct sunlight.  This seems to have worked; new leaves are growing, and it generally looks healthy. Can anyone tell me what the plant is called?  There are some issues, though. Some leaves have “dead ends” (not easy to see in the picture), i.e. the tips of the leaves look dead (or at least not healthy). I assume this isn’t normal, so how can I fix it? Is it safe to prune those leaves, or in general?   "
2075,Do nutrients always flow downward in soil?,"I've been reading and watching planting techniques. Many people place fertilizer at the bottom of the planting hole before putting in the plant. The first example is from Osmocote's fertilizer instructions:     When transplanting annuals from flats or when re-potting, mix into the   soil and growing media at the bottom of the hole before planting.   The second example is from this guy's guava planting video. He chucks a frozen cut of fish into the hole.   I always thought that nutrients would flow downward. Water can dissolve nutrients, and since water flows downward, the nutrients go along with it. So why then would one place fertilizer at the bottom of the planting hole? There's a chance that the roots can grow so fast that it can chase after the nutrients that are flowing downward, but why take that chance? Why not place nutrients at the top of the soil so it drains down into the roots? Unless, of course, nutrients can flow upward. Is that possible? "
2076,Should i use rocks in a (VERY) large container for gardening? (no drainage),"Alright so, i""m starting a large project and i have two current plans, i""m not very sure which to go with.  I'm extremely new to gardening I'm in coastal north carolina, lots of rain. For my eagle scout project, I'm planning on converting a large 15x5x3 feet Brick fountain into a flower/vegetable garden in my local retirement home. There's no drainage holes except for a large concrete overflow pipe that sits about a foot off of the bottom.The bottom of the fountain is solid concrete. After a heavy rain, water seems to puddle up to about 6 inches off of the bottom of the fountain.  Plan one: Fill the first 6 inches of the fountain with Large rocks, then fill the rest with a few truckloads of compost/soil mixture. my idea is that since the water already puddles that high, it'll keep the soil from becoming oversaturated. (I'm talking big jagged 6 inch in diameter rocks) Instead of the water staying saturated in the soil, it'll fall through and make a pseudo-water-table in the bottom. However, someone on reddit commented there would be issues with the ""perched water table"" being too high, and the rocks not helping.  Plan two: Just fill the whole thing with the compost/soil mixture.   Any thoughts?  (edit) I'm planting things in the outer, bottom section. the middle is to be filled with smooth stones and a neat statue that's being provided by the establishment. :P   A sub irrigated planter sounds awesome! but i'm not sure how i'd go about getting a layer of air down there, i guess maybe putting a layer of mesh over the rocks could possibly work, but i'm not sure how to go about that without ripping the mesh, that's about 2 feet of dirt that'd be piled on top of it. also when it comes to the other plan of just drilling a drainage hole in the bottom, the inside of the fountain sits about 3 inches lower than the outside, so i'd have issues with puddling.   Idea 3? Fill it with dirt and place pots on top.  any input is appreciated, i've never grown more than a cactus before "
2077,My bean plants appear to have rust,They're a variety called 'yard long' I think. Could somebody confirm or let me know what else it could be? What's the best way to treat them?  It has been a pretty wet spring. We're in zone 3/4.  Oops - here are the images:  [website][website]
2078,Is it harmful for birds to have a house hanging on a walnut tree?,There is a belief in my area that it is not healthy for humans to sleep under a walnut tree.  Is this valid for birds too? Is it harmful for birds to live in a bird house hanging on a walnut tree? 
2079,Why does my apple tree not bear fruit?,"I currently live in southern Massachusetts. When an apple tree in my backyard blossoms and the little apples begin to show, they all disappear and begin to fall on the ground. FYI, there are also inch-worms all over the tree. Why is this happening? What can I do to prevent it?  EDIT:  The tree is about 6 years old and it has full sunlight, about 8 hours from morning (6 am) until late afternoon (4 PM). We have 3 of these trees and all these trees are in the same condition.   Pictures:  Full Image   Image of leaves   The result of some-type of insect (probably inchworms):  "
2080,Identify bonsai & maintenance advice for total beginner,"I got this as a gift and have no idea where to start! Scared to water it!    Firstly, please could someone identify the species?  I'd like emergency advice so it lasts a month or two while I read up - watering, trimming, etc. It looks like it's grown wild for too long with some very long new growth as per picture.   Questions from the spot of reading I've done:   Will scissors do for the moment? Should I cut only brown stems, or green or either? (I did read a bit about node counts and fresh growth) Watering: moisten or soak? Special considerations eg time of year?  "
2081,"Is there a fast-growing, inexpensive privacy plant that can be started in winter?","I live in a flatshare, in a room on the ground floor (first floor for North Americans). To prevent people from looking into our rooms all the time (there's a parking lot in front), we have outdoor blinds/screens (about 5ft/1.5m high and 15ft/4.5m wide) made out of bamboo.  I would like to cover those outdoor blinds/screens with some green. I've been thinking of Ivy because it grows so fast.  Are there any other plants that can quickly cover the outdoor blinds/screens that I would be able to get seedlings for and start right now? Or is this a completely idiotic idea because Winter is the wrong time of year to start any outdoor plant?  I'm in southern Germany in a climate that Wikipedia calls ""temperate seasonal""; there is some chance of snow, although usually only a few days a year; the low end of winter temperature is about -2°C (28°F).  Additional information:   Outdoors underneath a balcony. Facing North-ish, it doesn't get a lot of sunlight. Ideally, I would plant them in containers but planting them in the ground is also an option. Flowers would be nice, but an evergreen covering is also acceptable.  "
2082,Egg shells and peanut casings in pot soil,"I was reading up a few weeks ago on fertilizing and someone, somewhere said that grinding down egg shells would be a good idea to increase calcium in the soil.  Now this made me save some egg shells and peanut casings. My question is, without grinding them down, would it be a good idea to mix it into the soil when planting plants like peppers for example? Would the same apply for, for example, banana peals?  The reason I ask this is because my brother said he wouldn't do it since potting soil already has an over abundance of nutrients and it would likely damage the plants. "
2083,Should I throw out soil after rot?,"I have sadly had a potted monstera succumb to rot. I tried taking clippings to no avail, but now that it's gone, I am wondering if it's safe to reuse the pot and soil with another plant?  Can the soil be reused? Can I need to give it some kind of treatment? Or is the nuclear method required (blow it all away)? "
2084,"Is it normal that heat mats for plants do *not* have 3-prong, grounded plugs?","I'm searching for some 2-4ft long 1-2ft wide heat mats to start plant seeds and cuttings on. In shopping around on Amazon I see that most (or all so far) heat mats have polarized 2-prong plugs. Shouldn't an electrical device designed to generate heat and be near water have a third, grounding prong?   Oddly enough most (also all so far) thermostats I've found specifically designed for plant heating mats have 3-prong outlets built onto them for mats to plug into, and the thermostat devices themselves have 3-prong plugs to go into a 3-prong (ideally GFCI) outlet.  Does anyone know the reason for this, or have any tips on where to find grounded heat mats for plants? "
2085,My tomatoes got hit by a freeze,"Most of them are coming back. 12 out of 15. Will these produce this year if I can keep them from freezing again?  They've been babied in a heated greenhouse ever since.  I know I'll have to harden them off before going into my unheated greenhouse but hate to spend anymore time or room on them if they won't produce well.  I'll plant these tomatoes on the southside of my greenhouse where they can get direct sunlight when I pull the plastic up.  These particular tomatoes are the regular garden varieties, not meant to be grown in greenhouses.  Another reason I'm worried I'm wasting space...or would it be better to keep them in pots and just move in and out of the greenhouse to be able to get sunlight? And wait until my hothouse tomatoes come in the mail to be planted in my main greenhouse?   "
2086,How should I prune a half-dead bush of rosemary?,"I have inherited a garden in a hot and arid climate with a half-dead bush of rosemary.   As you can see in the photo below, a part of the plant is dead, but another is doing okay.  How should I deal with the plant to ensure the live part makes it? Should I simply cut away the dead parts? How should I deal with the roots?   "
2087,Can white pines be sheared or trimmed?,I have a dwarf white pine that suffered a fair bit of winter burn this last hard winter.  My horticulture courses said you could trim white pines for hedges.  I would just like to trim once for shape.  What will taking a pair of hedge shears do the eventual look and shape of a white pine?  If I trim it once do I have to keep trimming it? 
2088,Why do the leaves of my avocado tree have brown edges and spots?,"I have inherited an avocado tree in a hot, arid climate in a very windy spot.  It has been watered well, but its leaves look like something is wrong with it - they have brown edges.    Perhaps it's been watered too well - the soil it's in appears to be a bit dense and loamy:    What should I do?   Should I try to loosen the soil manually?  "
2089,how long is it safe to walk on fresh grass seed,"How long can I safely walk on my fresh grass before I start causing damage.  I added a layer of top soil to my lawn and overseeded on Tuesday evening. I raked the soil as level as I could by eye and then used a long 2x4 to do a final level. I used a hand spreader and then raked the seeds into the top soil.  It's been raining pretty steady. Temperatures around 6-8C overnight and 7-12C during the day.   I did't have time before initially, but I was still contemplating renting a water-filled roller.   Would it be beneficial to roll out my yard at this point?  Would this help with the levelling and soil contact with the seed? At what point should I stay off my lawn? Is it ok to gently walk on my lawn to water through the entire sprouting stage?  thanks "
2090,What do I do with cover crops before planting vegetables in a raised bed?,"I have a raised bed that I use to plant vegetables. Over the winter, I have planted fava beans as cover crop to get some nitrogen in the soil.  What should I do with the fava plants before I plant the vegetables?  Should I cut the top and leave the roots in the soil so they can provide nitrogen or should I uproot the entire plant?  What should I do with the part I take out (whether that be the top only or complete plant)?  Do I put it in the compost bin or mix the top with the soil in my raised bed? "
2091,Extending Life of Cut Flowers,"I was reading this article on Extending the Life of Cut Flowers and had a couple of questions.  As was also pointed out on How to keep my roses fresh?, you should cut the stems at an angle under running water to prevent air from getting in the stem.  Alternatively, some sites actually suggest cutting them under water.  Q1: Isn't the stem exposed to oxygen when transferring it from the running water to the vase? Are you supposed to mitigate this somehow?    Also, the article lists some additives to help extend flower life. Here's a recipe to add to the water in your vase:   1 tsp. Sugar - Feeds the plant which helps buds open and last longer 1/4 tsp. Bleach - Reduces growth of Bacteria and Fungi 2 Tbsp. Lemon Juice - Adds acidity which improves water flow to the stems   Q2: Using this recipe, can I premix a whole bottle and then add it as needed, or will the ingredients neutralize themselves over time? Q3: Should this be done in conjunction with replacing the water every couple days?  If so, should each fresh batch of water get it's own plant food cocktail? "
2092,Should I cut the top off of this bolting lettuce?,"My garden is on a roof top in the South Bronx. I get a lot out of a little space, but I tend to only have one or two of each type of plant.    Most advice I find is for terrestrial gardens with rows and rows of the same plant. I also find that my plants do strange things, like this lettuce that seems to be bolting in the fall. I thought this was a spring occurrence?    Would it be a good idea to cut the top off?    I've had some good success replanting the root of a lettuce after eating the top. But, then again, maybe I should try to collect these seeds and plant them.  What is the best next move? "
2093,Most effective method for growing moss outdoors?,"I have a bare patch of shady ground in my background, about 10 feet by 15 feet in area, where I'd like to start growing a healthy layer of moss this year. I have a limited budget, less than $100 US. I've come across several approaches to growing moss:   1) Transplant live moss to the target area (a possibility - there is plenty of moss growing elsewhere on my property),  2) Run live moss through a blender and spread the slurry (presumably containing live spores) onto the planting area,  3) Purchase moss spores or live plants from a garden store or online.  Does anyone have experience successfully growing moss? Which is the most effective technique? "

2095,"After picking strawberries, how should I prune the fruiting stems?",I have Seascape Strawberry plants. They are day-neutral. Some squirrels and I have eaten the strawberries. What should I do with the stems that have been eaten from? Should they be cut away or will they grow into something useful (more leaves or more strawberries)? The eaten fruiting stems I speak of are the finer claw-like stems in the center of the following photo.    
2096,Is this plant beyond saving?,"My company recently moved offices and we adopted some plants left by the previous inhabitants. While many were in bad shape, all but one are recovering quite well and I am not sure what to do with this one. It previously lived in a hallway where there is never any sunlight and is now in an office with daylight. We water it weekly. Does it need more/less water? More/less light? A bigger pot? Some possibility to climb? I am absolutely clueless about plants and would hate to see this wonderful creature die due to my / the previous owners lack of care.

2097,Can I rejuvenate a very old lilac bush that has regrown from the base?,"I have a very old (about 120-125 yrs. old) lilac bush. It was cut almost to the ground 20 years ago. I had been told that this was how to control giant lilacs. It had formerly been 18' high and 25' across, and was hard to mow under. I regret this step, and the bush has never looked good since. The spruce tree behind it has really grown, and the lilac is growing at an angle, with thin, spindly stems.    The shrub is on foundation soil from the house It gets full sun from noon to about 7 pm I fertilize with compost and Spray-n-Grow Perfect Blend I don't water it, but the soil stays moist most of the year I've treated for hornets in the past when they were an issue chewing bark Most of the growth is root suckers-the old stumps are mostly rotted out   I like to keep as many 'historic' plants as possible on my property. Assuming I want this one to live and recover, what should I be doing to maintain it, or keep it from going downhill?  "
2098,What are these growths on my winter hardy Opuntia?,"I received some winter hardy prickly pear pads from a friend last fall. They rooted well, survived the winter well (better than many other plants around here), and are putting out new growth. On the new growth there are small growths slightly resembling swollen yew needles. Are these supposed to be there? Are they going to become thorns? The old pads don't have thorns anywhere near that size.    "
2099,Is inosculating trees for shape practical for the home garden?,"I've recently discovered a very cool method of tree training in which saplings are trained to a rigid form, and fused (inosculated) at certain points, to become a desired shape. If I follow the basic methods I found on Wikipedia, will I have good results? Do the trees require additional care? Is this a good idea to try out, or will it be a waste of time? See pics below for ideas I might consider trying.          "
2100,Can I successfully cross-pollinate different species of Aloe?,"Okay, I have the big guy from this question, and the little guy from this question. I believe, from their different growth habits, flowers, and mature sizes that these are different species. I have tried to pollinate the big one, without success. It is now putting up a new flower stalk. I think some of the bloom time on it will overlap the existing flower stalk (the first one for this plant) on my smaller plant. Can I successfully cross-pollinate these two different aloes? I this is entirely a waste of time, I won't try. If this is possible, how would I go about it?  Pictures below of the two plants:   "
2101,What are some good landscape design planning softwares?,"My goal is to create a landscape plan/map for my yard. So, basically, the first step is to create a scale drawing of my lot. I recently attended a couple of local workshops on ""site planning"". In the workshops, the idea is to make measurements to identify the house ""footprint"" on the lot using graph paper. From there, one creates ""bubble diagrams"" with ideas for various plant material and hardscapes like in the following pictures (click to enlarge)  Source: Left, Right                I'm looking for some software options to help me along with this. So far, I am exploring Google SketchUp and also Inkscape. What are other options for creating such layout maps?   Cross-platform solutions would be nice, but if not, please indicate which OS it supports. Free and commercial software are both welcome.  Note: I am personally using a MacBookPro and an Ubuntu machine. Windows options are certainly welcome as well. "
2102,What is a practical strategy for removing dandelions and bull-thistle from my lawn without them returning?,"So I asked a question about how to remove the dandelion and thistle invasion from my lawn, and saw a similar question which mentioned an excellent tool. So I went ahead and purchased the Fiskar thingymabobber for removing deep dandelion roots.  Now the question is, how do I actually remove the dandelions/thistle without them coming back? I've tried, for a span of a couple of weeks each, strategies like:   Random weed removal Remove weeds in a certain area Remove weeds of a certain type   As far as I can tell, this is not really effective, because they're still everywhere.  What is the right strategy to remove weeds without them re-infecting cleaned-up areas and coming back?  Edit: I guess I need to be explicit about this: I'm not interested in any form of chemical control. This includes:   Herbicides Pesticides Anti-Weed fertilizers   I have young kids, and some agriculture going on, so I cannot afford anything but my already picked hand-weeding approach. "
2103,Is my newly planted weeping willow in shock?,"This spring, I planted a weeping willow tree (salix x) in my yard, in an attempt to help dry things out. I'd heard they love wet conditions, and can grow up to 8' a year. Well, it has been almost two months, and my tree has not grown. It has turned yellow and developed dead areas on the leaves and stem-tips. My first thought is, maybe it was too much of a shock to move straight from the 16"" nursery pot into the saturated soil in my yard. The tree was a little over 6' tall. Is this the problem? How can I relieve the shock?        "
2104,Should blueberry suckers be removed?,I have a potted Sunshine Blueberry plant. I noticed suckers started appearing a few inches from the main trunk. Should I leave those suckers there or cut them off? I have read that suckers on big fruit trees don't produce good fruit. Is the same true for bushes like this Sunshine Blueberry?  The sucker is emerging from the dirt on the right:    This is the whole plant:   
2105,How to approach liquidambar with respect to pruning?,"I've got two young liquidambars, both planted in last two months, both 70-90 cm high, but from different nurseries. One of them is basically just one erect branch with leaves, and another has a main branch and 5-6 erect branches branching very low.  Is there any imediate need to prune the second one? Generally, should I leave these liquidambars alone (not prune at all during their lifetime), or they need some pruning?  Both nurseries referred them as just ""liquidambars"", no cultivar is indicated at all. They are fairly rare in my area, and I was happy to find and buy them, even though there was not much info on what the exact species they are actually "
2106,"Sterilise or pasteurise oyster mushroom substrate, why not microwave?","From what I've read, when you grow oyster mushrooms you can either sterilize or pasteurize the substrate, and pasteurization is supposed to be better because it preserves micro organisms that help reduce contaminants.  Recommendations for pasteurization seem to require heating for a long time, why is this - don't things die quickly in heat ?  I didn't have a thermometer to get the proper temperature so I decided to sterilize instead.  I experimented with microwaving my substrate in a jar to sterilize it, which people I've read on forums say isn't a good way to sterilize.  If I microwave substrate until it's sizzling, which I did, what is going to survive ?  Why isn't this a sure fire way to sterilize anything ?  thanks. "
2107,Will leveling uneven lawns with extra sand kill future lawns?,"I just removed my old front stoop: it was a wall of field stone, filled with a layer of pea stone and 2x8x8 cubic feet of sand, and finally covered by slate. I want to level my very uneven lawn with this sand. My lawn is terrible and I plan to sod or bring in top soil and reseed next spring (I should have done it in the fall but I couldn't get it done in time).   The lawn is less than a quarter acre.   Will putting thick layers (up to 5 inches in some places) of sand throughout the yard hurt future lawns?  If I plan on putting a layer of top soil on top of everything, is it ok if I don't mix the sand with top soil (some answers to other similar questions suggest 50/50 mixes)? If I plan on growing a lawn on top of this sand, do I need to weed before I pour the sand on top?   I live in the Boston area and the lawn is in partial-to-full sun.  Based on these questions:    How do I encourage lawn seeds to germinate successfully? Making a yard that&#39;s settled more level? How to fill low spots over existing grass in my yard?   I would guess that the answers to my questions are (1) yes I can fill in my lawn, (2) mixing 50/50 is probably better, but not necessary if I plan on putting a layer of soil on top (I don't know how much is needed for it to be ok?), and (3) I should probably weed before I cover things with sand, because the weeds are likely to push through.   Any clarification/correction to my own answers are greatly appreciated.  "
2108,What's this hole in the Cabbage leaf?,"What's this hole I just discovered in the leaf of this otherwise very healthy Cabbage?  I've got yellow insect cards nearby, and beneficial nematodes in the soil, which have collectively done wonders for little flies.  Is this a chance visit from an insect?  A sun or chemical burn?    "
2109,Why are my Dracaena Fragrans leaves browning from the base?,"I just brought home a Dracaena fragrans a couple of weeks ago, and it is in dire straits. Hoping someone here will have some ideas.  The problem(s):   Leaves turning brown from the base of the leaf (not the tip).  Brown leaves easily pull off with just a tug. This seems to be happening to leaves near the top of the stalk. White fuzzy substance just visible at the tip of the stalk, near the small new leaves. Yellowing leaves. Small holes in some leaves.         I have considered lots of theories but am not sure what to think. Some things I've considered/tried:   Too much sunlight? I originally placed the plant right next to a southwest-facing window. We are pretty far north (New Brunswick, Canada), and during the winter I figured a jungle plant would prefer all the sunlight it could get. I've subsequently read that the dracaena fragrans developed in shaded conditions; maybe it was too much light? I have moved it away from the window. Too cold? There is a heater right under that window, so I thought the plant would stay nice and warm. But my husband says the top leaves look almost like frost damage to him. Maybe the chill from the window damaged the top leaves? Over/underwatering? I've read all the warnings about overwatering, and made sure to test before watering by feeling the dirt with my finger at least 1-2"" below the top. It often felt wetter than I expected, and as a result I've watered less than I would have otherwise (about 1 liter every 2 weeks). Maybe this is still too much? The pot does have a drainage hole. Fluoride in the water? We have well water and I don't know what the fluoride concentration might be. I have ordered a test kit; in the mean time, will leave water out for at least 24 hours to let fluoride/chlorine evaporate before watering, though I've read conflicting reports as to whether this actually works. Too dry air? We have a Venmar air exchanger that controls the humidity in the house, and in the winter it does get pretty dry. Maybe a tropical plant needs more humidity? Though I've read that humid conditions can also contribute to fungal infections, which leads to my next point... Fungus or pests? There is a white, fuzzy substance of some kind visible in the crook of the top of the stalk, by the newest leaves. Google has suggested mealybugs, spider mites, and powdery mildew. I haven't been able to find any bugs anywhere on the plant, but the fuzzy substance doesn't look quite like the photos I've seen online of powdery mildew, which seems to be spread in a thin, even layer over the entire surface of leaves. This is concentrated in one spot and is maybe 1/2"" deep.   So, maybe multiple problems going on at the same time. I'm frankly just kind of amazed and dismayed that this nice-looking plant has gone downhill so fast. I have other houseplants that seem happy enough in the same room (a fuschia and an ivy plant). Any ideas?  "
2110,How to get papyrus houseplant to grow more fully?,"Inherited this when it was full and thick but dried and browned stalks. Hadn’t been watered in weeks.  Cut all back, repotted as it was root bound, and surprised it started growing again. But it’s very thin. I had cut off tops of a few viable stems and propagated. The pic shows two tallest stems and there are several shorter stems opened or close to opening up. How do I get it to be more bushy? I cut one to propagate but there are so few that I don’t want to cut more. Do I just wait and hope more pop up?   "
2111,How close can I plant flowering cherry trees to a garden wall?,"I have almost 100m of Victorian brick wall bordering my garden    I want to line the inside with flowering cherries so they overhang the drive, how close can I plant them without risking damage? Or are such trees unlikely to cause problems to this wall?  The type I have chosen is Prunus Pink Perfection  You'll note in this photo you can just see some trees on the left. I have large (diameter 6-8"") holly trees a few feet away and even some yew/leylandii/laurel tree only 1-2 feet away. No signs of damage to the wall but I don't know how the roots vary by tree type.  I should add that I do not know how far down the wall extends but given it is 7-8 feet high, it must have some sort of foundation? Additionally, the road itself is hard-packed. So I'm wondering if this would act as a natural barrier - the roots would 'bounce' off?  I'd really love the trees right next to the wall so they hang over the drive - what can I do to protect the wall if this is required?  "
2112,What disease is this (tomato plants)?,"I got these seedlings that i re-potted. The bigger leaves get white/yellow spots and the baby leaves go dark as they sprout and wilt very fast. I have a few varieties in small containers that seem to be all affected  What is it? Can anything be done? Are these beyond repair?      EDIT: I have coriander nearby with similar symptoms, mini leaves wilting and spots on the older ones   "
2113,Preparation for a new lawn to prevent weeds and encourage growth,"Two Years Ago  About two years ago, the lawn in our back garden was full of dandelions. We decided to replace it with brand new turf, the kind you roll out into place. I tried my best to remove the dandelions, tap-root and all.  Today  Looking at it now, it's in a sorry state. The dandelions are back. I removed thirty a couple of weeks back, and there are probably twice as many left, if not more. There are large patches of clover, and another weed that produce rather nice and very tiny purple flowers. Where there is grass, most of it is dead (brown and straw-like), or it's twice the height of everything else.  Questions  I accept that I will probably have to start over, but before I do that, I would like to know what I can do to reduce the chance of this happening again.  I read somewhere that weeds tend to grow in places where grasses find it hard to grow. Does that mean my soil needs treatment? If so, with what?  When I dig up the soil, in places there's about 5cm of soil, and then nothing but sand. Is that a problem?  Note: I'm only interested in non-chemicals/organic solutions, though please feel free to explain that option as it might be useful for others :)  Update 1 - photos  Here are some photos I just took. I suppose it looks greener than I led on, but it's very patchy. If I were to mow it, you'd see it better. The dandelion heads I've been picking off whenever I see them.       Update 2 - Location and habits  I'm in The Netherlands and not near the coast, just in case that makes a difference.  I don't mow that often because our lawn mower isn't adjustable, and tends to cut quite short. Moreover, when I laid the turf I ended up with bumps. Only a few, but as you can imagine, the mower takes them right off. Also, there are patches where what looks like grass grows really fast, while the rest stagnates.  When I laid the turf I actually pulled up the old turf as well - it was a lot of work. "
2114,Growing fruit at a higher hardiness zone,"I understand that growing fruit trees in a hardiness zone that's lower than recommended has a chance of your tree dying from frost damage.   However, what is the effect of growing fruit trees at higher hardiness zones than recommended? What happens to the tree and the fruit?   Today, I just bought a Hinnomaki Red Goosberry from the local nursery.     At the store, they claimed it was the correct zone range for our northern California town. However, when I went home to do more research, Starkbros says my zone is higher than the recommended range.    "
2115,Posts for a fence line raised garden,"I am going to build a raised garden along a fence. According to this YouTube  tutorial: Building a raised garden bed - Part 1, the holes are dug up so that the posts can be fixated to the ground. When I watched it, I was wondering if installing posts in the ground was necessary. I will use the posts to attach siding walls to them but is it necessary to install posts in the ground?  Thanks, "
2116,(Artificial) turf vs. (Artificial) grass,What is the difference between turf and grass? Specifically the artificial type. And what is the proper word for the artificial type such as the one used on football fields/tennis courts? Are mixes of artificial materials and natural grass/turf materials used on sports fields and courts? 
2117,Vermicompost Consumption Rates,"I'm constantly like a worried mother towards my worm bin, and I know that isn't right because the worms supposedly thrive off of neglect.   I had red wigglers in my bin before I had to get European night-crawlers after a suggestion that they are more hardy. Now, my 360 Worm Factory is seemingly full of both, so the population doesn't seem too bad.  I had some problems with moisture (way too dry for a long period of time), but recently I've fixed that. My worms have balled up recently and I'm trying to figure out why but I think it's a moisture thing again.  Anyways, my question is this: how long do worms take to eat things? I thought the general rule was every pound of worms can eat 0.5 pounds / day? If that's the case I probably have 200+ worms and they can't finish one fourth of a banana peel within multiple weeks! Could it be because of my environment issues?  Is there a chart I can look at that better describes the rates, or perhaps an online search engine where I can view nearby worm-keepers to maybe get help?   Thank you! "
2118,Is it safe to eat dandelions previously treated with a selective iron herbicide?,"Three years ago, I started trying to reduce the number of dandelions in my lawn with a household selective herbicide named Scotts® EcoSense® Weed B Gon® (MSDS and retailer product page). The manufacturer's web site says:     Weed B Gon controls dandelions and other broadleaf weeds without harming the grass. It is made from iron, an ingredient found in the natural environment.   The last time I treated the lawn with Ecosense Weed B Gon was about one year ago. I still have all the dandelions, but this year my wife has said that she wants to try making food products from the dandelion roots in our lawn (examples of dandelion foodstuffs).  Is it safe to consume dandelions from a lawn previously treated with a household selective iron herbicide?  "
2119,How does one create a sparse canopy?,"I am looking to grow a fig tree indoors and was very inspired by these pictures.

2120,How do I get rid of sand spurs?,"How do I get rid of sand spurs?  These suckers pop up all over my lawn around this time of year, and I'm not sure how to get rid of them other than constantly pulling them out. Obviously I can't use a broad-leaf herbicide or anything like that. What can I do?   "
2121,Will fruit/vegetables split with heavy constant watering?,"I've heard that fruit/vegetables will split with inconsistent watering, but will it split if it can get water to its roots desires (i.e. ""I go any deeper and I'll drown"", or ""if we get a heavy downpour my roots will cut back"")? If I get enough success the first season would it be a great idea to save enough seeds for next year as I think the plant starts industry doesn't grow seed for heavier waterings (garden environment conditions of a floodplain)? "
2122,When is the best time to plant Knockout Roses in North Georgia?,"I live in North Georgia (USA) and I want to grow a rose bush. Knockouts are sold around here all the time and are fairly cheap, and I'm wondering when is the best time to put one in the ground?  I started one this past spring and lost it to a combination of over watering, black spot mold, not enough sun, and then drought (hey, it's been a fun year).   I'm going to pick a sunnier spot this time so the mold shouldn't be as much of an issue and will take care and do a better job watering too.  Should I start one now (later October/early November, we should be getting a frost any day now) or wait until Spring? "
2123,Tofu as a growing medium?,"I just had a strange idea of no actual significance, but I was just staring at a block of tofu and wondered if you could plant things in it. Has anyone tried this?

2125,Can I plant English Walnuts on earth berms above poorly draining clay soil?,"I'm in Zone 6a, and I'd like to plant some English Walnut trees (not Black Walnut!), but have rather clay-ish soil. Also, the area where they'd need to be planted tends to get about an inch or two of standing water for about four days after heavy rains.  In reading about English Walnuts, I see two things particularly mentioned about English Walnuts is they don't like clay soil and don't like standing water.  My intention then, would be to dig a foot deep into the ground, fill it in with better soil, and raise up a small earth mound 2 feet tall of the better soil, and plant the tree on that.  (I'm thinking of a 3x4' mound a foot deep and 2' high, structured with logs for hugelkulture and planted with grass and shrubs to reduce irrigation)  The walnut's roots will rapidly expand beyond the good soil of my earth mound down and out into the surrounding clay-ish soil; however, the tree itself would be raised up off the ground by 18"" or more. Would that greatly increase the walnut's chance of survival, or would this become a losing battle for me?  Note: Despite the soil in that area being clay-ish, it's not so clayish that other trees (native and planted) haven't thrived. But it sounds like English Walnuts are particularly sensitive? "
2126,Advice on caring for large potted Ficus Benjamina,"I live in Berlin. When a friend was looking to offload her large Ficus Benjamina, I volunteered to care for it. She has been in my home now for ~10 days and appears to be getting used to the place (some initial shedding of leaves, but stabilized now).  I have the following questions: 1. should I prune her? She seem to have many wispy branches growing all over. Also, the longest branch is bent and growing along the ceiling (which I personally like) 2. what'd be the optimum level of water that she needs now? She is inside a 60cm diameter pot. Any thumbrules to follow here? (Initially I noticed the tips of her top foilage turning brown and increased the water quantity. It helped)  Thank you very much for your answers :) This is the first tree of this size that I am caring for.  "

2128,Do blueberry bushes do well around pine stumps?,"We are purchasing property next to us that has a row of pine trees. I would like to cut a couple of the tree's down because it will be a sunny and acidic place for blueberry bushes. Can I leave the stumps and plant the berries in a circle around them? The stumps won't bother them if they are planted 3 or 4 feet away, will they? "
2129,Will rhubarb grow well with ginger in MN?,"I recently planted some rhubarb in the middle of my yard, and am considering putting ginger with it.  I was wondering if: ginger would grow well mixed in with the rhubarb? will it keep the grass at bay?  I heard that ginger grass is used in cooking. will it keep the wildlife away? "
2130,Is it possible to graft fruit/flowering trees onto a well established jacaranda tree?,"I have a large jacaranda tree in my front yard (perhaps 30-50 yrs old). I recently pruned a few branches that were about 2"" thick. You can see one fresh cut in the picture below and there are a few more in different places.   Now all of these are within an arm's reach and I was wondering if it would be possible to graft a scion from a fruit tree or another flowering tree onto each of these new stubs. Normally, grafting is done between ""similar"" plants. The wikipedia article on rootstock says:     The rootstock can be a different species from the scion, but must be closely related.   But how ""close"" is close enough? Same genus/family/order? It might be easy to find similar flowering trees to jacaranda, but is it possible at all to graft any fruit trees onto this?  I haven't set my mind on any particular fruit/flowering tree and this is more of an experiment rather than wanting to actually grow something for consumption (if it works, well and good!). If it matters, I'm in Southern California, so there really isn't any winter to speak of and temperatures hardly go below 8-10 ºC (46-50º F).   "
2131,Why is my snake plants' leaf fading in color?,"I've had this snake plant for quite some time, but recently one of the leaves has been fading in color.   The mix I'm using is perlite based, and I water it once a week. I give it sunlight in the mornings, and in the evenings I put it back on my table away from the window.   What am I doing wrong? Should I cut that leaf off? Also, I want to use rocks instead of perlite mix. Can I switch to rocks only? Will it grow with only rocks?    "
2132,Does this Tangelo look root bound?,I bought this tangelo tree on the cheap from a nursery because it looks a bit sick... I live in Melbourne Australia so we now only have a couple more months of summer left before autumn.  I'm wondering if it would be best to put it into a bit bigger pot or bag? now or just give it a feed and try to look after it while the fruit ripens? or should I thin out some of the fruit to not stress the tree out so much?  The tree is currently in a 25cm pot and is about a meter tall - going by the size of the trunk it's a few years old at least?  Thanks!   Here is the root ball also!   
2133,How do I care for potted apple seedlings over the winter?,"On a whim, this spring, I planted several apple seeds in a large pot just to see if they would grow. Two seedlings have come up and are very healthy looking, despite being munched by deer, and the hot, dry summer we had. They are about a foot tall with several branches and very leafy for their size.  I am very interested in keeping them going. Should I keep them inside in the winter, since they're in a pot? Should I transplant them now, before the ground freezes? I do want them to go through their winter cycle. I'm more concerned with the roots freezing than them drying out too much.   USDA Hardiness Zone 6 - Middle Tennessee. Winters are fairly mild, but we do get one or two hard frosts and a couple of good snows. Occasionally we even get an ice storm. The pot is a good 24inches (600mm) or so across at the top rim. Both trees are in the same pot. The other seedling is an avocado tree.    "
2134,What is the latest time to split mondo grasses?,"We have the black variety lining each side of our front walk.

2135,"How to dispose of sand, concrete rubble and field stones?","I have three piles of rubble from an old stoop I just demolished. Here are some pictures:  1) sand pile:   2) concrete rubble pile:   3) and field stone pile:   I have a few questions about how to dispose of this debris.   First, in a related question, I found it was unwise to disperse the sand across my lawn, even if I was planning on replacing it with sod next fall: Will leveling uneven lawns with extra sand kill future lawns?  My questions are:   Will landscaping companies want these materials if I offer them free of charge? If not, is posting an ad (eg in craigslist) an effective method? Are there cheaper methods than renting a dumpster?   Any advice related to disposing of these materials is much appreciated.  "
2136,"Why are ""naked"" LED lamps so deadly?","Several months ago, I made the following experiment: Make a plant grow inside of a box with artifical lighting. I bought this lamp (15W):        And removed the white sphere from it, so it got like:         It burned my plant completly. After that, I bought several fluorescent lights and this experiment made me think that plants need to be far away from the lamps (at least 1m). This belief gave me some problems, I spent a lot of time with basil and lettuce never growing more than 1cm and never knew why because they weren't growing but several other plants were. Eventually, I decided to move them to very close my fluorescent lights and - to my surprise - the lamps didn't burn them plus, they are finally growing! See the following photo: That plant is very close to the lamp, ~2cm max and there are plants that even touch the lamp and don't get burned (This is a stand with 4 T5 54W each).        As that plant is light hungry, I decided to make another experiment. I put another of it near a LED light, this time, I used the following:        It's a 50W LED flood light. I put the plant at that distance (~10cm):        And it got completely burned as you can see here:         I have another experiment with fluorescent lights and the lights are VERY close to the plants, as in:        And just as the other plants near the fluorescent lights, they don't get burned (that section of the leaf that looks burned is just because the leaf is old. The rest of the plant is completely fine). I measured the temperatures and got 40 degrees celsius in both fluorescent and LED flood light so it doesn't seems that it is heat that is killing them but then, what is? Can we adapt LED lights for plant growing with some filter similar to the filter I removed from the first lamp? I didn't test that lamp with filter but I will eventually.   NOTE: I know that there are lamps specialized for plants, I have some of them but I'd like to adapt standard LED lights because they are much cheaper.  "
2137,What are methods of increasing the protein content of garden vegetables?,"I read a random article about the effects of a certain fertilizer on tomatoes and how it happened to increase the protein content of the tomatoes relative to other fertilizers (1, 2) and it piqued my interest.  I've also read that wheat grown at certain parts of the year have more protein content as well.  Aside from choosing to grow lentils or some other high-protein plant, what are the methods of increasing the protein content of your garden edibles?  If they vary by plant family group, then what are the methods that work for different family groups? "

2141,Can the bananas of this variety be eaten?,"I recently purchased this banana tree in a flower pot. I've attached two photos with its label. Do you know if the bananas of this variety can be eaten? (Does the ""\"" icon over the fork and knife mean that they can't be eaten?)  Moreover, should I have it in full sun, or is it OK if it's in shade? Finally, how often should it be watered?    "
2142,"What size, and how far apart, should support posts for a trellis tunnel be?","I was thinking of building a trellis/vine-tunnel (not sure what it is called). Which I want to grow a variety of edibles (grapes, and maybe some northern kiwi vines) and flowers.  Every species seems to have its own recommended support spacing, but I was wondering what a good generic spacing is for Canada, Ontario (I am sure the tropics produce more dense foliage), as I do not know exactly what will be going on it. Speaking of being in Canada, do I need to worry about snow buildup? Will vines produce such a dense crosshatching that snow would build up in the winter? And what sort of weight should I expect per square foot / meter (are we talking hundreds of pounds per support or thousands of pounds)?  General dimensions might be around 15 feet wide by 14 feet high by 40 feet long.  Never gotten some of the extreme snows some places get in Ontario, but the ground can build up a few feet at times (but I have a few rickety roots with very little incline and have never gotten more than an inch or two build up).  Zone: 6b, I guess. I did not know what this was until a few minutes ago. "
2143,Do aphids return to the host plant after being sprayed off?,"What happens to aphids after you spray them off a plant? Do they wander around until they find a new host, get rescued by ants, die, or something else?  Am I just moving them from one plant to another by spraying them off? "
2144,Does Rebutia grow better when grafted onto an Echinopsis?,"I have tried growing rebutias before, and failed because the plants lacked vigor and grew slowly.

2145,"When a flowering plant isn't currently flowering, what is that state or phase called?","Is there a technical term for when a plant isn't a seedling, but isn't producing flowers, reproducing, or going dormant? If there are synonyms for that term, I'd love to know them as well.  As an example, say we have a plant that flowers late summer. But I'm interested in its appearance and habit from spring until it flowers, what do I search for? A common problem I find, is that most photos of plants are taken when they're fully in bloom. Look at an image search for Prunus tenella, as an example. "
2146,Ginger plant too tall for its own good,"My ginger plant is about 33 inches (85cm) tall now, and still plans to get taller. Is this normal? I'm afraid it will fall off and break its stem, and I really don't want to hurt the root down there by installing a support rod. Is it okay to chop off the top of the plant, so that it would stop growing taller?   "
2147,What is wrong with my cactus? (Red spots),"  Is it dying? There are these weird red marks, is this a fungal infection or sunburn? "
2148,Can my lavender be saved?,So my lavender plant isn’t looking so good. It is dried out on 3/4 of the plant. Has been this was since Aug.  I think it may have gotten some exposure to roundup through the roots since some weeds were sprayed in the area.  Can it be saved?  Or should it be pulled and replanted?   
2149,What variety of clematis is this?,"Two years ago we thought we had bought a clematis 'Nelly Moser' - but when I look at the flower, it doesn't look at all how it should look. The petals are neither pink nor white but purple, and they're not dark in the centre and light at the edges but vice-versa. The flower's centre is yellow, while Nelly Moser has a purple centre, and the flower doesn't even have the same number of petals - ours has six, while Nelly Moser seems to have eight. Does anyone know which kind of clematis we might have instead?      Edited to add:  Wow, you guys are quick! I live in the Netherlands, which should be hardiness zone 10. The clematis started flowering in April, and is still flowering (I took the photo above this morning). I guess that would make it an early vine? And it flowers off new wood, not old wood. And I measured the diameter of the flower - it's about 6-7 cm (roughly 2,5-3 inches) which seems small to me, I think earlier flowers were larger. There are more flowers than this one, but they are too high up for me to reach! And I (very slightly) photoshopped the colour of the clematis to be a more accurate representation of it's real-life colours - and wouldn't be surprised though if you wouldn't really see a difference...  2nd edit:  It might be useful to add that I suspect it might be pruning group 3, not 2. We hardly pruned it this spring, and during these past few months it really grew a lot! It's now about 2-2.5 m high, and looks as if it's dying/drying out at the bottom, while all flowers but one are high above my head - we'll definitely prune it back hard next year! "
2150,How do I naturally eradicate a stand of invasive bamboo?,"I am on a 1 acre hill-side near the Oregon coast. The previous owner of this property decided it was a good idea to plant some type of invasive bamboo that covers a good 50% of the property (mostly the sloped backyard facing the ocean) and never maintained it. It covers a sloped area about 150ft by 50ft (running laterally along a hill). The bamboo is about 10-15ft tall and VERY thick! It is very aggressively killing everything else.    I'd like to restore the hillside to its natural species like ferns, silktassel, ocean spray, ninebark etc. I'm pretty discouraged reading about how difficult a task this might be and it seems as though all of the suggestions are basically: mow, wait for it to regrow and spray it with as strong an herbicide you can legally buy. Repeat process multiple times. I may be restricted on heavy herbicide use as I have a creek running through part of it which feeds the community water system. I'd have to ask my water district manager, but prefer not to do this regardless. My ideas thus far:    Hand root out all of it, a section at a time replacing slowly with a faster growing native bush / ferns etc. Cut it all down at once, cover with black plastic. Cut it down and mulch in native species, the idea being the mulch would kill the bamboo while supplying nutrients for the newly planted natives. Tie it off/lasso with a cable / rope and pull it out in large clumps with a tractor then compost it or burn it. Buy a goat!   Which is most feasible? Are any of these methods likely to work?  I'm not 100% joking about the goat! "
2151,Mushrooms on crab apple tree trunk,Should I do something about these?  Does it signify something bad?   
2152,What is this fast growing plant and should I rip it out?,"So we planted a big new garden, and I think my wife sprinkled some assorted seeds (possibly wildflower?) and now we have three huge plants growing that don't seem to either produce flowers or fruit/vegetable of any kind. The stalks are quite thick for being at most 6 weeks old and they are a purplish color. Any ideas what it could be? Should I rip it out?     "
2153,Regrow beans from the garden,"I grew some green pole beans (variety unknown) this year from commercial seed, and I'd like to harvest some seeds from the plants to regrow for next year.  How do I do this?  I tried just picking some beans, pulling the seeds out of the pod, and starting them in a wet paper towel in a baggie in the window, which is the same way we started the commercial bean seeds. They just rotted.  Do they need to grow longer than for eating, and if so, how do I know when they are ready? Is there any treatment or preparations required before planting? "
2154,Help with apartment gardening and lighting mainly concerning bougainvillea,"I have recently moved apartments to be closer to school, and sadly where I have moved is a basement apartment without a patio or windows that get a lot of sun. I have a fair collection of plants and I want to continue adding to my collection. My two biggest challenges right now seem to be a lack of space and a lack of light. I have purchased two LED grow lights and that has seemed to help the plants I have come back to good health (except for my bougainvillea). My bougainvillea seems to be rather sad and has lost all of it's main leaves. They stay green and just fall off. Could this be because the grow lights do not provide sufficient light? (pictures will be posted after classes today) Could over crowding due to little space also be a cause of leaf loss?       "
2155,Some True Date Palm Questions,"I had the following date palm just installed and I have a few questions I'd love to get some expert options on:       It came tied up as I expected and the place that sold me it said I should leave it tied for a month. I read up to 2 months online. What would you recommend? The tree seems to have a lot of frond and not a lot of trunk. Do the roots look too exposed to you? Would you add some more soil around the roots or do you think it's fine the way it is? How often would you water the palm given that it's just been installed? And how often after it's been here a while? How would you set up the irrigation for it? I was going to do dripline irrigation in a circle around the palm? Would you add a drip emitter as well or something else entirely?   I'm in Sacramento, CA so it faces a long hot dry summer. "
2156,How competitive is the oyster mycelium mushroom?,"I keep reading that oyster mycelium, once it has grown some, will out-compete other organisms. To what degree is this true? Will it eventually push out green mold? "
2157,Can I plant garlic in the spring?,"Usually I plant garlic in the fall and let it go through winter and into spring. But what about growing it in spring? What care is needed for growing it over the spring/summer, if it can be done? I live in zone 4 (−30°F/-34°C). "
2158,How do I improve drainage vertically through clayey soil?,"I live on a hill where the soil has lots of clay.  My back garden has been terraced with small (1m) retaining walls.  The net result is that we have several lawns / gardens with the following properties:   Surrounded on all sides by concrete retaining walls. The top 20-30cm is good soil; the remainder is clay. At the bottom of some of the retaining walls (i.e. a bit less than 1m below the surface), there are periodic drainage holes.   So the drainage is quite terrible -- the water can't get out the sides, and it can only sink slowly through the clay.  To improve this, my idea was to dig a trench ~30cm wide along the side of the retaining walls (where the drainage holes are), fill the bottom 50cm with sand, and the rest with dirt, and then run drainage pipes from the rest of the lawn to this trench.  On the other hand, I have also read: ""Don't mix sand and clay; that's how you get brick"".  Is this a good idea?  Will it work?  Are there better options?  Edit: Photos below (excuse the laundry -- we can't let a sunny day go to waste :-) )  The corner with the manuka (centre first image, bottom-right second image) is evidently a little lower than the rest of that lawn, and thus in heavy rain it can be under 5+ cm of water.    "
2159,Solution for rose slugs?,"Landscaping our yard, I went a bit nuts for roses and got a lot of them before I realized how tough they are! Tough to keep happy I mean. My main problem has been rose slugs -- little caterpillars that are really sawfly larvae. They have been really doing a number chewing holes in the leaves, almost killing the plants. I have tried, on various occasions  -- Squishing by hand  -- Pesticides (Neem and imiclopramid I think--""rose spray"")  -- Ladybugs  The ladybugs disappeared in 2 days. The squishing is effective but tricky -- once there are old holes it's hard to find where the caterpillars are. I'm not even worried about the ick factor. Pesticides seemed to work but I want to avoid them, and definitely don't want to use all the time.   Is there a secret trick I'm missing? What strikes me as strange is the rose books barely mention them, but they're my biggest problem. Is it a hot/dry place problem? (San Diego here) Do I have to give up on my roses? Are roses one of those things where people love them because they're practically impossible to succeed at? ;) "
2160,Does compost replace fertilizer?,"I make compost in my backyard.  I also buy fertilizers for vegetable and fruit plants from the big box stores.  My question is really when to use compost vs. fertilizer?  Can I eliminate the use of fertilizers if I have enough compost or do I have to continue to use the combination. If the latter, when do I use each of these?  Interested in practical suggestions based on what other's are doing. "
2161,How do I reduce the amount of fruit my pear tree produces?,"I have a 10m peer tree that every year produces hundreds (thousands?) of small pears. Every year the pears are destroying the grass underneath, and require a lot of work to clean.  Is there anything I can do (such as sterilize it)?   Otherwise I might have to cut the tree down. "
2162,Why can't I  get reticulation to work in spring?,Spring has sprung and it's time to turn on my reticulation (bore).  My retic worked back in May but now (October) I turn it on and no water comes out.  I can hear the pump going but no water comes out. Any ideas? I only ran it for a couple of minutes because I heard you can blow up the pump if there's too much pressure. Do I have to let it run for a while to fill up the pipes? 
2163,How much space do watermelon plants need? What do I need to know to transplant seedlings?,"I have a row of watermelon seedlings, each separated by 2 inches, except that in several places two seedlings are growing together about half an inch apart (where I had sown two seeds in the same space). The plants are 3 inches tall.  How much space will these seedlings need?  I have empty space in the garden where cantaloupe seeds did not germinate. How should I move the watermelon seedlings to the available space? East-central Wisconsin climate. "
2164,Plants Fungus Infection,"I am new to garden and I have a tomato plant that is infected by fungus.   I would like to ask how fungus infects the plant? Does the disease affect the soil, plant or both? "
2165,Shall I cut off the suckers when my apple tree is in bloom?,"I was away for 4 weeks and my apple tree became totally full of blooms!! I had not cut its suckers this year, and the last 2 years they may not have been cut properly.   This is a beautiful Golden Delicious apple tree that is over 20 years old; we moved in here 5 years ago and I normally do not water it. Should I? It has been quite generous in giving us loads of apples except last years when I think we cut the runners late too! What should I do next year?   Shall I leave the suckers alone? The whole tree is full of them, but it is also full of blossoms? How can I help keep it happy? "
2166,Benefits of wiping the dust/dirt off the leaves?,I was cleaning the leaves of my plant by wiping them with a damp cloth. But my sister came and said that don't waste your time and let the plants be in natural state. So here is my question:   Why we clean the leaves of the plant? Is it just to make them look more green and fresh? Or is there a bigger picture I am not seeing?  Of course potted plants. 
2167,Pine seeds which I planted two months ago grew early. What should I do?,"I don't know much about gardening. But I want to. I always wanted to grow many bonsai trees in my home and exotic trees in my garden. So like two months ago, I picked pine cones from ground and collected their seeds. And I planted them. I planted about 30 seeds and half of them become seedlings (I don't know the term but they are tall and green now) by last month. I am so happy for that but, winter is coming and I am not sure if they survive it.  What can I do about it? I know that bonsai's slowly dies indoor (I tried it last year and my olive bonsai almost died). So are there any product that can help them survive the winter? "
2168,Is this a climber? Any idea what it is?,"enter image description here I inherited this beautiful rose plant when I bought my home.  I live in Florida.  I studied pruning online and thought I did pretty well, but I don't know if I should prune it way back next year during our one (sorta) cold month of January.  I do deadhead and the branches I've cut seem to do very well.  It mostly blooms on the end of very long branches.  Sometimes in groups of five roses and sometimes just one rose.  It blooms over and over.  I'm thinking it's too ""leggy"" as there aren't many roses in the mid part of the ""bush"".  What am I doing right?  Wrong?  Oh, also they have a pretty scent, not too strong.  Thanks so much!   "
2169,What are these dark brown spots on my tomato leaves?,"I have these dark brown spots on my tomato leaves that appeared over the weekend. I'm only seeing them on one branch. The rest of the plant looks fine. The nearest I can tell, it looks like spotted wilt. The leaves are starting to draw up and die. Should I cut this branch to avoid spreading? If not, what's the best way to get rid of it? "
2170,"What is this low-growing plant with small yellow fruit found in Roanoke, Virginia? Is it edible?","What is this plant? The little marble sized yellow fruit (tomatoes?) grows on a vine and close to the ground. Is it edible?  I found it near an abandoned nursery in Roanoke, Virginia, where other tomatoes thrive wildly.     The picture is sourced from my facebook page.  It's available for public viewing.  "
2171,Best time to plant red potatoes,"About a year ago, I kept some red potatoes in the cellar. Most of them were edible, but some of them began sprouting so I didn't eat them. Now, I want to plant these remaining potatoes in the garden. When is the best time to do this in Israel? Should I wait for the rain season? "
2172,Why can't I compost dog & cat faeces?,Looking at this answer made we wonder again about why we don't compost dog and cat faeces. Any guide to composting will always caution against including dog (and cat) excrement (examples here and here).  Is it simply that pet faeces are dangerous to human health? Or do pet faeces not actually have much composting value in their own right? 
2173,How should a reel mower be cleaned after mowing?,"So I finally said screw it to my old gas mower, and decided I wanted to skip gas altogether (I hate small engines with a passion, my mower was the only gas yard tool I had left), so I picked up a discounted-end-of-season reel mower. I suppose I should probably clean it after mowing, but I'm not sure how. Is it OK to gently spray it down with a hose? Can I get away with oiling just the cutting edges after mowing, or are there other parts that need oil? Would veggie oils be suitable, or should I go for a petroleum oil? Are there any other major concerns that need to be taken care of between every use? (I know about sharpening the blades and adjusting the cutting bar, not necessarily HOW, but at least about) "
2174,What's the best way to remove 2-6 inches of dirt from my yard?,"I am landscaping my yard and need to remove from 2-6 inches of dirt from the entire yard (about 2,000 square feet) to get it level with the rest of the property. The dirt in the yard currently sits higher than the foundation of the house due to overgrowth &amp; gophers.  What is the best piece of equipment to rent to help with this?  Do I need to have training/experience to rent/use a tractor (excavator, loader, etc)?  I have no experience using tractors, but am a quick learner. Should I attempt this task myself, or would it be more cost effective to hire someone?  EDIT: I am looking to rent from A Tool Shed  EDIT 2: Responses to a few of your answers:    I have called 811 (Call before you dig) and had the utilities marked. There are none in the yard. I will be moving the dirt to my front yard in an effort to make the front yard level I will be softscaping (adding sod, trees, bushes, irrigation) After removing about 4 inches, the dirt becomes very clay-like, so I don't anticipate any settling. I will be tilling the clay with soft dirt and fertilizer before the sod  "
2175,Do I have a Crepe Myrtle Bush or Tree?,"About 2.5 years ago (December 2016) I bare root planted several Crepe Myrtles.  They were all about 6"" long and I received them following a donation to the Arbor Day Foundation.  Three of these have survived and interestingly all have displayed completely different growing patterns.  One of which doesn't seem to be adding height.   After 2.5 years its only 1.75 feet high! The other two have already reached 4ft and 5ft. See pictures below.  I know there are a ton of varieties of crepe myrtles. While the Arbor Day Foundation said they'd send me trees, I'm beginning the think the one isn't.  Is there any way to identify if indeed I have a bush variant? Otherwise how much time should I give it before I can safely say its not a tree based on it's growth rate?  If it's going to be a bush, I'd rather relocate to my garden area now and get a tree in there instead.  If it'll help with answers, I live in south Texas. Zone 9a. I've maintained a good watering and fertilization schedule throughout their life. No major issues.  Crepe Myrtle 1 - 1.75ft high. Bush?   Crepe Myrtle 2 - 4ft high. Assuming this is normal tree like growth   Crepe Myrtle 3 - 5ft high. Assuming this is normal tree like growth  "
2176,My aloe Vera plant is getting flat leaves,"I’m not going to lie I haven’t been taking the best care of it in the last year. The leaves however are getting really flat, not just lying flat (which I read is from lack of sun) but the leaves themselves seem like they have nothing in them. They aren’t thick like the others.  Also I am so new to this any other tips and tricks would be great. Such as how do I know it’s in the right pot? How do I repot it? When do I repot it? How often should I actually water it? How much water should I give it? His name is Francis and any advice on helping to keep him not only alive but well is very much appreciated. He did have dead leaves but they have been snipped off and soil was put on the ends (I read that helps seal the leaf from the aloe coming out?)  "
2177,How can we help our garden frogs in an arid climate?,"I live on an arid island off the African coast, off the grid in a very sparsely vegetated area, far away from any neighbours. The summer has been fairly hot and most vegetation has dried away, waiting for the rainy season.  Somehow though, there are some frogs living in our garden!    (the photo was a lucky shot - they usually keep out of sight, which is just as well, as we have many predatory birds that usually hunt for the many lizards out here.)  We suspect they survive by living in our underground cisterns. However, one of the cisterns has broken, and since then, they seem to have taken up residence in our largest watering can. Which is fine, but we are unsure about how to best help them:   Should we occasionally change the water in the watering can, or do they like it when it becomes pungent? Should we be doing anything to help them procreate? There are two frogs that we know of. We can't build them a pond, but could erect a smaller structure. Is there anything else we can do to help ensure they're doing ok? It seems so miraculous that they manage to make it at all in this type of area.  "
2178,Can an aloe plant that's completely rotten at the base be cured?,I had a potted aloe plant that looked like a set of leaves coming out of a single spot at ground level. One day it just fell apart - the leaves and the roots got completely rotten at ground level and wouldn't hold leaves together and to the ground. Leaves otherwise look alive - they are just damaged at the end where they were connected to the root.  According to this answer aloe plant leaves can be planted on their own and can perhaps start growing as separate plants. Will that technique likely work in my rotten case? Do I have any other options? 
2179,How do I get rid of tar spots appearing on my maple's leaves?,Preliminary reading suggests that the only way is to rake up the fallen leaves and get rid of them.  Will this do the trick?  Is there a way I could keep the leaves for compost without propagating the tar spot fungus to next year? 
2180,"Should I remove the tiny, cute, white and red bugs from my Umbrella plant (Variegated Schefflera)?","I wiped the leaves of this Umbrella plant (Variegated Schefflera) some weeks ago. Now I am seeing all these white and red bugs on the leaves of the plant. I can easily take them off with a stick. After taking one off, it doesn't seem like they are hurting the plant, but who knows? I don't know anything about them.   How should I get rid of them or should I leave them be? Are they eating other insects that can hurt my plant?      "
2181,How much late spring cold have damaged my walnuts,"Unfortunately, last night temperature in my garden in Avenliq. East Azerbaijan of Iran country dropped to -3°C and these are my walnut new sprouts after that.    will these bear any fruit?  should I do something?(for example cutting darkened new growth) "
2182,"hoya in the garden, behind a pergola","I have a huge pergola, beyond which there is a garden. The roof one solid unit, so no light or rain may pass through. The garden is dominated by fruit trees, and then two small plots of cacti, far from the pergola.  The pergola has no gutter, so the rain drops straight under the edge. My climate is a hot Mediterranan and I live close enough to the coast to get mild temperature changes. I expect the precipitations under the pergola's edge to be much greater than for the rest of the garden, because the roof drains all the water to that side.  My plan - The two storage sheds under the pergola stick-out when viewing the garden. I need to install a trellis that runs all the way up to the pergola's roof. The Hoyas will climb-up the trellis and will cover-up the view. With time, they will be sufficiently large to flower and provide new cuttings to plant elsewhere.  How are my growing conditions? - Do I have to worry about the water draining to the garden side in addition to my regular rainfall? I have purchased my first Hoya, H. Kerrii, and I wil add H. Carnosa. Which other Hoya types are good for that setup? "
2183,Does it matter which side up a seed is planted?,"I've got some seeds which I couldn't identify and I'd like to know if it makes any difference if I plant them the ""wrong"" side up or sideways. Would it significantly decrease its chances to grow? Or does it depend on the seed? My seeds vary in sizes from 2mm to 6cm in average diameter, but I'm interested in answers for all possible sizes. "
2184,How to help this avocado tree?,"The tree lost a lot of it leaves over the last year and the upper parts seem to be dead wood by now. However it has sprouted a lot of new branches in the bottom portion as visible on the picture. The soil is probably not ideal (heavy clay), but it must have been standing here for a while judging by its size.  Is the tree even having a chance long term?  Will it help to trim the dead top portion?     "
2185,How is nutritional value in fruit and vegetables measured?,"We often read in books and Wikipedia that certain fruits or vegetables contain certain amount of vitamins, minerals and other elements.  An example can be seen on Beetroot in the box with nutritional value.  I can imagine that these numbers are only averages and certain minimum ideal conditions must exist for the vitamins to be present. We often hear that supermarket fruit and veg may not in fact contain the nutritional value that is claimed. The soil may be contaminated. When the product is stored and transported part of the vitamins and minerals may be lost. So supposedly healthy food may not in fact be all that healthy. I was little upset when I read that carrot juice may be nitrate concentrate instead of healthy juice.  It's good idea to grow your own fruit and vegetables and have control over your own food.  And now the question: How is nutritional value measured and how are ideal conditions identified? What is the science dealing with these topics?   If I grow my own fruit and veg how can I perform my own measurements? Is there any literature dealing with these topics? "
2186,Placing eggshells on top of potted plants?,"In general, is there any benefit (growth, soil quality, etc) if I place eggshells on top of my potted plants?   My mother often does it to provide it organic material. She's not much of a scientist. I always ask why she does it. She explains that just does it because she's been advised to by others with more experience and swears by it.  Thus my other question: If there is a benefit of egg shells, what is it? Why is it helpful to do this? "
2187,How to get rid of really thick ivy carpeting some ground?,"I'm trying to reclaim an area which has been left wild for a few decades from the looks of it. Maybe 100 square meters, flat andtotallycovered in ivy (regular English kind). In places, the ivy is up to a foot thick of layers and layers of roots all crisscrossing. I think maybe each year leaves fall and a new layer of ivy grows on top. It's like walking on a sponge.  How can I best clear this? I tried quite a large fire but it seems very resistant. I guess the same to weed killer.  I think the nature of well separated layers means each fire can only get one later each time, it's naturally self insulated?  If I could kill the ivy so it would start rotting I could wait a year to use the land... Maybe I could use a rotorvator or similar to chop it all up after killing it with powerful weedkiller then just leave? Though I still have a pile of ivy pulled off a wall 2 years ago that shows little sign of decomposing "

2189,Do snake plants (sansevieria) stop growing if their tips get damaged or broken?,I heard on a video on Youtube that a snake plant (sansevieria) will stop growing if it loses its leaf tips or if the tips gets brown or broken. Is this true?  Many of the tips of my Snake plant are either broken or brown. Is there anything I can do to make the plant grow bigger? Or is that all? 
2190,"What is this plant with highly variable 3-5 lobed palmate, smooth edged leaves?","This plant blew in months ago and quickly grew up. The shape of the leaves vary. No two leaves look exactly the same in profile but usually has the same basic form but often one of the lobes are missing. Typically about 5 lobes.   Now believed to be palmate. Maybe pinnate?  It has smooth edges and is shiny. Edges curve under slightly.    Further information from previous comments:   Found in my garden in Western US. It randomly grew in. We have a lot of strange things ""blow"" in like lantanas of different colors, snapdragons, petunias, a basil, etc... the leaves do look kind of like a fig. It is less than a year old and has had no fruit we have noticed. Next door neighbor has a fig tree but this plant does not look like their variety which has large and broad leaves. Currently thinking maybe a hybrid, mutant, or still undetermined variety of fig or fig-like plant.   Can anyone find anything more definitive than fig-like? "
2191,Why isn't my lemon tree growing?,"We planted a lemon tree five and a half years ago. Today it's about the exact same size as ever.     I've tried using citrus fertilizer, but to no avail. We've had dry summers and wet summers, but nothing changes. I'm in Melbourne, Australia  What's going on? Is there anything else I should tell you? "
2192,"What procedure should I follow to compost bones, fat, and rotten cooked food?","I have read that composting things like bones and fat should be avoided as it can get smelly and attract pests.  However, I expect that there are a lot of nutrients that I am wasting if I threw these things in the garbage (or the city compost).  So, I am planning on building up a new compost pile this fall and letting it run till next fall.  I have a ~2' diameter, ~3' tall compost bin.  I am planning on lining it with composted manure and bone meal to deter pests.  I will supplement the heavy kitchen waste with plenty of branches and leaves.  Will this work?  What else should I be doing (esp. about the pest deterence)? "
2193,Why should a pot be only an inch or two bigger than the previous pot when re-potting?,"I have read, seen and heard from folks here that the pot for planting a plant should be bigger by the previous pot by only either one or two inches. I don't understand why. No one has explained this anywhere on the web.   Is this has something to do with the owner of the plant (gardener) or specifically to the plant?  I mean, how would a plant know if it's being planted in a way bigger pot or not? In fact, isn't re-potting a plant in a bigger pot better for the plant, too? More space, infrequent re-potting needs to be done. Here I am stretching it:     Suppose a plant is potted in an 8 inch pot. It needs re-potting every year. Now if we plant the plant in an 12 inch pot. It will get more time to be in the pot. It will not be disturbed by moving it another pot every year or two.

2195,Storing apples - how do I improve my success rate?,"Here's my apple store a few weeks after I put them into storage:    As you can see, already quite a high failure rate. And even for the apples which still look sound as of today, are they still at risk? Or if they've got this far without rotting are they basically now set to store OK through the winter?  But my main question is, how do I improve my success rate? I can guess that the key things are:    don't store obviously damaged apples  cool, even temperature darkness dry, with good air circulation   If my list is correct, which out of those is most important? Is there anything I've left out?  In my case I did pick windfalls rather than harvesting them from the tree (is trying to store windfalls hopeless? They looked unblemished at the time). The temperature may have been a little high. Is that enough to explain the high failure rate? "
2196,How much rain is too much to garden in?,"When organizing community gardening events, weather sometimes gets in the way. In most cases a little rain or cold doesn't hurt and the event goes on with dedicated gardeners doing their thing in the rain. In some cases though the weather is too severe, as is the case with thunderstorms or high >30mph sustained winds.  In terms of precipitation alone, how much rain is too much to garden in? For example, &lt;5mm seems like fair weather to garden in, 10mm is probably OK too for people not too bothered by the rain, but >15mm seems like it's pushing it to even ask folks to show up. What threshold is used by gardening organizations to decide when to cancel an event due just to rain? "
2197,Is my woody old sage plant finished?,"I have an old woody sage plant (I think it's sage) in my herb garden. It's probably several years old and no longer looks in great shape. Also, I have allowed the grass and weeds to smother its base.    If I pruned it back and weeded it, would it come back good as new? Or is it best to start again? "
2198,How often should I fertilize vegetables?,"I only ever add fertilizer after I remove a previous crop and break up the soil a bit, but should I be adding fertilizer to vegetables that take 10 or so weeks to grow, such as zucchini?   How frequently should I add fertilizer? Are there particular types of fertilizer that are good to add while a vegetable plant is growing? How can I add fertilizer if I am using mulch such as hay, should I just sprinkle it on top and water it in?  "
2199,Are all plant materials suitable for cold compost?,"I commonly heard people saying oily or meat products should not be added to their compost, but I've rarely heard anything about plants in this regard. In particular, I would like to know the rules about small-scale (I have lid-covered bins of 70cm (27in) side and 80cm (31in) height) and cold composting.   Do fresh pruning waste carry seeds of weeds so that they should not be used in cold composting? For instance, I have a bag of Duranta repens prunings (leaves and branches) collected last week. Is it suitable for cold composting (I heard it is toxic as well as a weed)? How about general grass clippings?   Also, if anyone also knows about Duranta repens C/N ratio, please also tell me. I don't want to start a new thread for such a small question. "

2204,Are 'winter' varieties important when sowing beans & peas in late autumn/fall?,"This list of jobs for November suggests sowing peas and broad beans. The comments section is more specific about varieties to go for, namely: Aquadulce for Broadbeans and Douce Provence for Peas.  How important is it to use the suggested varieties? Would using any old beans/peas result in nothing at all, or just produce slightly inferior results (or something in between)?  Should I expect germination and a small plant over winter, or do the seeds just sit there in the ground only for something to appear in Feb/Mar?  The comments also suggest they go straight into the ground, but presumably starting off in pots will also work? "
2205,Do I need to prune my leaning Meyer,"My Meyer lemon previously had a problem with some spotty yellowing of its leaves shortly after purchase as per this question but seems to have largely recovered. However, the stem is on a serious lean on account of the heavy fruit on its branches.    And the main stem has a split in it as well which can't be helping    And there appears to be some mild early magnesium deficiency with tip chlorosis    So, should I just cut the stem below the split to alleviate both problems and let it bush out below the prune?  Or just remove the fruit? "
2206,What are some succulent plants that are suitable to be planted in my office?,"Many gardening websites recommend succulent plants as the best plants for indoors such as an office. It's true that they require minimal care with respect to water, but the websites usually don't tell you how much sunlight they need to live on.  The best scenario is an outdoor garden with full sun, comparable to the dry desert environment which most succulents can survive and thrive. However as the websites state that they are suitable to be planted indoors, can we just assume that they can accept minimal light such as the light from the fluorescent tubes (not the extra one, but the default one in the office) in a normal office? Of course not.  I think there maybe some succulents that can live in such environment. So what are some  succulents that need a fair amount of sunlight to live on, and what others need relatively less sunlight?   EDIT: Office conditions  Hong Kong is a subtropical region which is relatively warmer than some other places. In winter, the outdoor temperature is above 10 degree Celsius and it's much warmer indoors in a sealed office with people moving around. I guess it's not below 15 degree Celsius.  For the light, the default lighting we have is fluorescent lighting. If the plant is placed on the windowsill, it'll get some sunlight through the glass. "

2208,Machinery/instruments to clear/trim vegetation on a sloping medium-sized section,"I am trying to work out how to effectively keep vegetation under control on a 1.5-acre section, a large part of which is on the photo below. It is covered with high grass (now much higher than on the photo) with some shrubs of willow, gorse and broom:    The goals are:   To keep the gorse/broom down as local authorities require so; To make the section look nicer and easy to walk/traverse as I am planning to put a residential dwelling on it, so certain spots need to be clear for vehicle access, foundation and drainlaying works etc.   Several options have been on the table:   Spraying. This used to be done by the previous owners but I am not keen on it as I want to keep the land ecologically clean with the views to start gardening on it at some point and/or keeping goats; Mechanically clear it up once (e.g. with a digger) and let sheep graze on it. Too much hassle with the sheep for now, but maybe in future; Turn it into a lawn or food forest, or otherwise manage what vegetation grows there. This appears to be a whole science to dive into. A very good but not quick solution; Mechanically and selectively clear/trim it now and again. This is what this question is about.   So, what machinery and/or instruments would be the most suitable here? Mowers? Diggers? Bulldozers? Hand-held trimmers and chainsaws? Note that there is a slope on the section (roughly about 15-20% of it) which would be quite unsafe to drive a small machine on, but the rest should be fine. "

2210,Monstera (Swiss cheese plant) brown patches on leaves,"I've gone through some of the previous posts for Monstera's but couldn't quite find anything like this. I bought a new Monstera about a week ago and it seemed to be adapting well. New leaves were unfurling, it seemed strong. But some of the leaves have started drooping a bit and I've noticed some brown spots on some of the leaves.   Some information:   I haven't' watered it since bringing it home since the soil was a little damp. The top seems dry so maybe it's time to water. I'm wondering if the room it is in is too cold. Possible?  Because of the little shiny patches, I thought it might be a scale infestation and I did find a little cottoney string (just one) on one of the leaves. But I cannot find any scale bugs. I've never had them before so I might just not be seeing them.   Anyone have any thoughts?   UPDATE: Added photos of the outer roots.  Pictures:       Thank you! "
2211,Magnolia grandiflora: How is flowering affected in case of propagation by layering?,"I've got a 10 year old Magnolia grandiflora that flowered last year for the first time.  If I manage to propagate it by layering, would the new plant have flowers the first year after separating from the mother plant? Or would I have to wait certain number of years again? In such case, would I have to wait another 10 years, or perhaps 2-3 years?  Is ability to flower affected by the age of the plant's ""branch material"" only, or perhaps also by size of roots, age of roots, etc.? "
2212,Keeping basil fresh as long as possible....should I remove the plastic?,"I'm wondering how to keep my basil usable for cooking as long as possible. Bought this today from the shop:    On the label it says ""Keep in the light and water daily"", but I'm not sure if I should remove that plastic thing, so maybe it could breathe better. I've read some 'basil storage' posts around the internet like this, but none referred to basil in soil.   I've had another one for like 2-3 weeks, which died in the last couple of days, because I forgot to water it lately. This one:    So, should I remove that foil around it? Will it help prolong its lifetime? "
2213,Is it wise to shred leaves and leave them in a corner rather than bag them?,"Rather than bag this pile of leaves and leave it at the curb    I used a tool to collect it and shred it    then dumped it in the corner of the yard.    It will freeze in a few weeks. What will the result of this experiment most likely be? Will I find some nice (and organic, to boot) earth instead of this pile next Spring, or will I just find a lot of rotten leaves with a cornucopia of unpleasant insects that will go around to harm my yard and my two small plots of vegetables? "
2214,Why isn't my self-watering planter wick carrying water all the way up beyond the dirt line?,"I am trying to make a self watering planter, with a reservoir at the bottom.  It has 4 polypropylene ropes (0.25 inch) which are supposed to wick water up toward the dirt.  The water is about 1 foot below the dirt, because I'm testing it to see if it'll carry water when the reservoir is low.  It's definitely carrying the water up through the air that far.  My problem is that it seems to wick up to the dirt, but once it hits the dirt, the water doesn't go much further up.  The area where it touches the dirt is vaguely wet, but that's about it.  The rope actually goes to the top of the dirt, but the water stops following it once it hits the dirt.  My hope was that the water would follow the rope and moisten the dirt as it goes up.  What can be causing this?  Is the dirt sucking up the water faster than the rope can bring it up?  Do people normally need to water from the top to jump start the capillary action? "
2215,How much watering does aloe require?,"An aloe plant I have on my table now has leaves with yellowish ends and I'd like to somehow address it. I Googled for a while and found that in case of aloe this may be a sign of either underwatering or overwatering.  The plant is about 120 millimeters tall with diameter about 250 millimeters, the pot is about 120 millimeters tall with diameter about 100 millimeters filled with ground almost to the edges. I water it once a week pouring about maybe 20-40 milliliters of water.  How do I know if I water aloe right? How do I know if I'm underwatering or overwatering it? "
2216,"What is this small plant with large dark green leaves, and how do I care for it?","A friend just gave me one of her houseplants during her move to another apartment. She doesn't know what the name of this plant is and she didn't give me any instructions on how to care for it. The way she cared for it was just watering when it seemed dry.   I love plants and really want to care for it so my question is, what kind of plant is this and what's the best way to care for it? How big will it grow and will I need to change the pot at some-time or another?   "
2217,Temperature on the radiator,"So I am having difficulty sprouting my chili seeds using the ENO method (wet cloth) because I believe the temperature at my place fluctuates too much between 16°C during the day when I'm working and 21°C when I'm home.  Now I was wondering what temperature the radiator gets when it is on and if it would - for example - be better idea to plant the seeds in soil, cover the container with foil and put those directly on the radiator to get the ground to warm up? Since I believe the ground will stay warm longer during the day and night when the radiator is off. And it won't get the direct heat from the radiator itself so it won't ""cook"" the seeds being on there directly.  What are your thoughts? "

2219,What is afflicting this sick Bay Laurel (Laurus Nobilis) -- and how do I fix it?,"I brought in my bay laurel (aka sweet bay, laurus nobilis) to clean it, and noticed an infestation of tiny ""bug sacks"" underneath the leaves, along the veins. What are they? I don't see any actual insects crawling around, (with my bare eyes).  I can get them off the leaf easily by exerting a tiny amount of pressure with a wiping rag. Is there a household product I can use, such as acetic acid, or some concoction of tea tree oil, that would remove them? I wish for them to magically fall off and disappear.  Climate: This plant lives in Vancouver, BC  (wikipedia: Climate of Vancouver). It is not hot during the day, and it could not be any rainier. The pot sits on the north side of the building. Sits rarely in direct sunlight, since it is cloudy all the time and a nearby large conifer casts shadows. It stands on a covered patio most of the time        Topside (full res) Underside warning: rated 18+ horror (full res) Underside closeup (full res)  "

2221,What's affecting this tomato plant?,Can anyone tell what's wrong with this tomato plant? Is it disease or deficiency? My areas been having issues with late blight the last few years. One spot seems to have a concentric circle around it but otherwise doesn't look like early blight to me. I'm not very good at determining diseases though.  Also noticed a couple of small black bugs on some of the leaves but don't show well in the photo. Look like flea beetles.

2224,Ornamental grasses losing shape,"After trimming my decorative grasses this spring, I noticed that many of them have lost their shape. Mostly by expanding their base.  And some of them have lost their middle - there were no stalks to cut. Looks like they were suffocated by the previous year's clippings and dead leaves.    What's the best way to fix this? Especially for the ones with the lost middle.  They haven't started growing yet. Should I uproot the expanded areas and replant them in the middle, or will it fill the middle back in by itself?  Located in Chicago. I'm not sure of the species but from searching I would guess they are types of feather reeds. "

2227,How much space should I leave between apple trees and elderberry tree?,"I would like to plant one or two apple trees and possibly an elderberry tree in my front yard. I have about 85ft of south facing lawn between a birch tree and my driveway to use. How many trees can I fit in that space? I am thinking of planting an apple tree on the corner near the driveway (see drawing) and then either an elderberry or another birch in between the birch and the apple tree, but if possible I would like one more apple tree.   I am also wondering if an elderberry is a bad idea? I like elderflower and -berry juice, but I know that the berries can leave quite a mess. Would mulberry or another birch be a better idea? The point is to also create a bit of privacy and I am not sure which tree is best for that.  Thank you very much in advance!   "

2230,Starting on a Grassy lawn in time for Spring?,"im in zone 6a and I just recently moved into a home with a fenced in backyard. It has a large-ish raised bed...but i'd actually like to do an in-ground garden this year since i've never had the chance to.  Thing is...spring will be starting in a couple of months, and the lawn is grassy like any other lawn. is there a no-till approach that will at least get me to a ""planting time"" by spring?  I've heard of lasagna gardening, but I know that takes time. Could I perhaps place some cardboard over my area (planned to be 8x4) to at least kill the grass and then just dump some soil/compost over it till April/Spring planting time?  Or would the cardboard not be decomposed enough by then? "
2231,Why are some clippings of this plant apparently pure green and others mottled with yellow?,"I saw this question on “Why is the foliage turning yellow on this climbing indoor vine?” and have a tangential question. Plants in question are pictured. All indoor plants.  So understand the concept of natural variegation in these leaves but I am puzzled. On the left-hand side of the picture the green leaves are fairly solidly green. On the right-hand side, there is clearly some variegation of yellow spots.  For a bit of background, I live in NYC. The deal is clippings of this specific plant have existed in my family since the 1970s. Basically my dad bought this in the early 1970s, and kept it alive up until the 1990s when he passed away. I took the plant and I would start making clippings to make more plants and more plants.  As far as I remember, for the past 15 years or so the leaves were solidly green. But in the past 2 years I moved into a new building and the water from the pipes is—frankly—not so great. I drink bottled and filtered water personally but use tap water to water these plants.  Many of these clippings were just sitting in jars of water until a few months back when I potted them. But after I potted them and placed them in a sunny window I was stunned not only by the mottling of yellow, but also the size of the leaves and stems on these mottled clippings is noticeably larger than what I ever remember them to have been in the past. Growth also seems quite aggressively faster than what I remember.  Which is all to say: What would cause this big difference between the plants on the left-hand side of the picture versus the right-hand side of the picture? Could it be something in the water from the tap? The fact they are now in a pot? Level of sunlight in a new location? Maybe something connected to the terra cotta pots? Some are pots made in Italy and others made in Germany if that matters.  In the great scheme of things, I’m not complaining about any of this. But as someone who essentially has grown up with clippings derived from this plant for decades, I am a bit baffled as to why this kind of sudden change has happened now.   "
2232,Why is my lucky bamboo turning yellow?,"I have a wrapping of bamboo stalks, maybe 20 or so stalks tied together. 3 or 4 stalks have died one at a time the past 2 months - they start to get yellow-greenish, then more yellow over time. The rest of the stalks seem totally fine (even right next to them). I've had it about a year, it was fine for 6 months or so.  Things I've tried:   Use only room temperature distilled water Wash out the roots and scrub container (no chemicals) Less light More light Inspect for fungus/bugs Remove yellowing stalk and soak the whole thing in water to try to propagate it (it just rotted)   Pics of lighting situation, pot, etc (late afternoon, it's generally brighter in the day but not super bright): [website]Last things I'm considering are:   Use some kind of fertilizer (one answer stated this? [website]Get a magnifying glass to check for tiny bugs Change the pot up (either bigger with pure water, or plant it in dirt, but this feels risky since only 1 stalk dies at a time..) Take a healthy one and try to make many clones of it just in case it does die Do something about the roots? I have heard that them having a tangle of roots is actually normal, but it does look root-bound.   This plant is sentimental so I want to try my best. "
2233,What are these small white balls that appeared on the soil in my greenhouse?,"As a pre-emptive starting note, there are a lot of questions with similar titles but none I could find with pictures looking the same to what I have here.  Around a week ago, I applied lawn clippings to the surface of the soil in my greenhouse as a mulch. The soil was previously free of visible weeds or other pests and I'm aware that I may have made a mistake in introducing non composted grass clippings.  Today I noticed hundreds of small white balls that have appeared in several areas. They seem to be either eggs or some type of fungus. The fact that they appear to be ""growing / deposited"" on a plastic plant label makes me think that fungus is less likely, as I'm not sure that it would grow on a plastic.  In one picture a strawberry plant appears to be attacked.   What are these balls? Are they harmful to my plants? If so, how should I deal with them and what precautions can I take in the future?       "
2234,Is there a limit how many branches I can graft onto a mature apple tree?,"I have 5 mature Bramley apple trees - I think at least 10-15 years old, I do not know the rootstock but they are easily 6m high so I assume something large; they are also in great soil and get a decent amount of sun and little wind.  However these are the only fruit trees which came with the garden and seriously, who needs 5 Bramleys and nothing else!? I've started planting other eating varieties and crab apples but was also interested to try grafting as a way to avoid removing one or two nice trees to make space.  Is there any practical limit to how many branches I can replace with grafts either per season or as a fraction of the total tree? I've been offered multiple types and am kind of curious to make a ""Franken-tree"" where I just replace as many branches as possible with a range of varieties - an orchard on a single tree so to speak!

2235,Is this plant (Radermachera ) sick? Leaves turning yellow and spotty,"Previously I did not know the species of the plant in the picture. (The one with the owl ornament). I finally found the sticker. It is Radermachera.      In last couple of week I find that many leaves start to turn yellow. Some of them even developed some dark spots.     Is this plant in distress? If so, is there anything I can do to make it well again?   Location: Sydney, Australia  Edit  As per @stormy's suggestion, I will add photo of the underside of the leaves. I am a total amateur.

2236,Over wintering late planted fennel,"I was very keen to grow some fennel this year (doesn't it smell incredible?), but wasn't able to plant anything until quite late in the year, and so my plants are now only 10-20cm high and still in small pots.  Is there any way to over-winter them to give myself a head start next year, or should I just make some tea with what I've got / chuck it on the compost heap, and make sure I start earlier next year? I'm in the UK, Zone 8  If it's worth trying, should I bring the pots inside, or would the plants naturally die back and re-grow from their root stock if I just left them outside?  Any fennel growing tips would be appreciated, I'd love to have a good stock of them next year. "
2237,When to repot vegetables into normal earth?,"A month ago, I sowed some tomatoes, paprika and kohlrabies into nutrient poor sowing earth. They are growing nicely, but I am wondering, when it is time to repot them into normal (nutrient rich, pre-fertilized) earth.  Right now, the paprika are about 4 cm/1.6 in tall, carrying massively green leaves.  The tomatoes are about 6 cm/2.5 in tall and their leaves got a bit darker in the last days.  The kohlrabi is up to 8 cm/3 in tall and looks great with fresh looking green leaves.    Is there a rule of thumb for when it is time to repot into fertilized earth, that can be applied to all vegetables?  And do I have to add an intermediate step and plant them into a normal/sowing earth mix, before putting them into 100% normal earth? "
2238,How to introduce an overwintered banana tree back outside for the summer,"We got a banana tree last year and brought it inside to overwinter it. The tree was never put into the ground, it stayed in a large pot and is still in the large pot.   Our overwintering method was to cut off every leaf besides the two topmost leaves, place it in an area of a room with very little sunlight and not much artificial light either, and not water it.  The tree lasted Winter just fine; a good portion of the leaves are dried and brown, a good portion of the outer part of the trunk is also dried and brown, and one of the leaves didn't make it either, but it's still alive and we didn't lose the 5 feet plus of growth that we achieved last Summer.  But now the threat of frost is over and we need to place it back outside. And while there are tons of information about overwintering a banana, I've had trouble finding much information about bringing it back after overwintering it.  What steps do we need to take to bring our banana tree back outside? Should we slowly introduce it to sunlight similar to introducing seedlings to sunlight, or will it be fine to just place in direct sunlight and leave it there? What about watering it? The soil is currently bone-dry and it was only watered once over winter with about 2 cups of water. Should we start watering it slowly or should we just take the hose to it until it's saturated?   Any and all suggestions are appreciated. "
2239,Is this pineapple dying?,"One month ago I brought home a store-bought pineapple (fairly beat up one) and decided to plant it. Planting process went like this up to the moment of asking this question:   I cut off almost all fruit flesh from the head of the fruit so it won't rot and placed it in a glass of water. I also stripped away several bottom layers of the leaves to expose new/old roots. It produced some roots around 3 weeks ago, so I planted it in a pot of citrus soil mix with a layer of keramzit on the bottom for better drainage.  I initially used some rooting fertilizer to aid the development of the roots. The pot was then placed next to a window and radiator, so it would have some natural sunlight and constant, warm air temperature of around 20 - 25 C.  Additionaly I provided the plant with a 400 lumen plant LED placed 30 cm over it as it is currently winter where I live and there is not that much sunlight coming through that window.  I was watering it with normal drinking water in around one-week intervals (soil was drying up after around 7 days). Any excess water was emptied from the bottom of the pot.  I've also cut off dry ends of the leaves.    It looked like the pineapple was feeling comfortable in this spot, because in spite of it not growing at all in the top part, it has developed some more roots - I can feel a resistance when trying to really gently pull the plant out of the soil.  Despite this progress I've noticed yesterday that the central leaf of the plant became yellow and dry, so I've watered it well as the soil looked dry too. It didn't help and today it looks worse (dead):    But the ""center"" of the plant does not look that dead to me:    4 days ago this central leaf looked healthy and green - NOTE This leaf is not a new growth. It was on the plant already when I brought it home. It is hard to tell, if it grew at all during that month. If it did, then only by a few milimeters.  UPDATE  I removed the pineapple from the soil and tried to examine the roots as Graham Chiu's answer suggests. The roots were tightly covered in soil. I didn't want to scrape it off, because i didn't want to risk damaging them. Some parts of the roots were vibile and they looked hairy and white (like on the unclear photo below). The roots also overally seem firm and strong - I wouldn't call them mushy for sure.     Before replanting I've removed some of the dead leaves from the bottom layers to enable more roots to grow out and I've discovered 3 things:   There were a lot of little white spots hidden under these leaves - Possible new roots? Two of these white spots placed on the top of the plant are particularly big - Possible new leaves or center bud? There is some kind of weird leaf damage. It looks like something has pierced several layers of leaves - Maybe some kind of worm? - but it does not go all the way to the center of the plant and it stops with a little spot on the next leaf after the one visible on the photo below.   Damage:    One of these big white bulbs:    I've replanted the pineapple in a bigger pot, so I won't have to stress it one additional time later on, if it starts growing. I've used the same citrus soil as before, but this time I've mixed it with some regular homeplants soil. I've also applied this rooting fertilizer once more as the packaging says that it can reduce replanting stress. I've also watered the new soil. Bottom of the pot was layered with keramzit just like before and the plant sits now away from the radiator, 50 cm under this LED lightbuld that I've mentioned before.  A similar question was already pretty much answered on this site here, but I think it does not exactly apply to my situation (Is the center leaf also the ""central bud"" of the plant?) and I would like to know:   Is this plant dead? If it is not already dead but dying, then what can be done to save it? What are the possible reasons for this leaf to suddenly dry up? Could it be that the plant is trying to shed old leaves to make room for the new ones? Did I do anything wrong in the whole planting process? BONUS QUESTION AFTER UPDATE - Could it be, that this big white bulb visible on the last photo is a new center of the plant and the old one will just simply die off?   "
2240,Upper limit on light intensity?,"What is the upper limit on the light intensity for growing plants indoor in a hydroponic system? Except my electricity bill off course :-)  e.g. Are 1000W HPS light per sq.m. ok, as long you can keep the heat under control? Or what happens when I add too much lighting?  I'm trying to grow thai basil (horapa and krapao), bird eye chili's and thai eggplants at a high as possible efficiency because we use them at our restaurant.  "
2241,What do when your flowering plants shoots its growth?,"I live in south India. Right now the it's summer here  transitioning to occasional rainfall. So the temperature is much controlled than previous week.   Problem : Over the years I have noticed, my flowering plants(ex:Geranium) tend to grow very tall without many leaves at the bottom and few leaves crowded at the top. And  these do not flower also. Eventually they break in the off season like winter and would not grow back.    Why does this happen?  What should I do with the plants which are growing as tall as 2 ft?  Apart from feeding nitrogen fertilizer, am I missing anything?  "
2242,Yellow leaves tips,Recently I noticed yellowish tips on my plant's leaves. I have this plant for the last 3 years and never had an issue with it. It was always healthy.  What might be the cause? Too much water?   A month ago I switched it from a medium sized pot to a large one to give it more space. 
2243,Is my Kalanchoe healthy?,"I first adopted my K. Blossfeldiana about a year ago from a friend of mine. When I got it, the flowers had all wilted and were falling off. Since then, it only blossomed around 2 or 3 flowers (single flowers, not bunches). Moreover, the bigger leaves fell off and new leaves never grew to the same size. Still, it never stopped growing more stems and leaves and is much larger now than it was when I first got it.   What worries me about it is that some of the leaves are yellowing and that some of the leaves curl inward towards the stem. The yellowing leaves aren't crispy, but soft. I expect this is due to overwatering, so I'm not overly worried about it. I've reduced my waterings since then. At times, the leaves will bend downwards from their base at the stem. The leaves themselves will look fine, but they won't be perpendicular to the stem. Is that normal? If not, any comment on what the cause could be is greatly appreciated.  Finally, the tallest stem is somewhat flimsy and is leaning to the side. Is it normal for it not to hold its form?  There probably isn't much wrong but I am somewhat of a doting plant owner and want to make sure my plant is doing fine. There are pictures of the plant linked below. Thanks in advance!      "
2244,How do I prepare rocky soil for planting an avocado tree?,"I would like to plant some avocado trees in my garden. The soil seems very stony (&lt;3cm in diameter stones on average, but a couple of bigger ones) and they go down at least 30 cm.  Do I need to do anything to the soil in preparation for the fruit tree? Will it be okay with the stony soil or should I remove the stones within a certain distance?  The research I have done mainly talks about removing stones from flower beds but not bigger plants like trees.  The tree is about 1m tall and was home-grown by my dad. He lives in another part of the country but there are simmilar soil conditions there. There are other avocado plants in the area. A neighbour has a couple too, I believe. I live in Swellendam, South Africa. This is a map of the soil in the country:    I live in the bottom left province where the soil conditions are mostly red and green:   "
2245,What is this problem on this succulent?,"I have this succulent in my indoor since last few months. I just moved it outside few days back and now they look like this.    This is how I ruined this plant :(    I moved it to sunlight which was all of a sudden. Then the leaves looked burnt. So, I watered too. I uprooted the plant today, the soil looks wet.   Currently, the leaves are dropping as you can see that in the pic. Color is also turning to reddish instead of green.  I am not sure if this is sunburn or over-watering. How can I save this plant? Also, should I trim the empty branch at the top ? "
2246,What is this flowering tree,We have this tree that spontaneously planted itself  5 years or so ago. We decided to let it go and see what it is.

2249,"Laying new topsoil, what if anything to mix in for worms or to kickstart healthy ecosystem?","For reasons that would take too long to go into (tl;dr version - a combination of mass gradual soil movement needing soil engineering, bad development, old paving/topslabs,  + ground levelling to address long term ground issues) the entire top 20-80cm (8-30 inches) of old paving, sand and soil under it is being stripped from a garden (approx size 6 x 14m), and will be replaced with new topsoil when structural and soil movement issues are remedied. Because of the nature of the issues, its not practical to keep the old soil and reuse it (tl;dr #2 - no storage space for such a volume while works going on, economics prevent doing it bit at a time). The ground below is a deep clay soil. The old ground level was sloped, so the depth removed will vary from place to place. The location is close to London, England.  The work is underway, so whether a better way might have existed is pointless now, this is how it is. So the end result will be a new topsoil layer. The work should prevent soil movement in future but water may still tend to flow in the soil in one direction, as adjoining land will be higher in one direction than the other.   My question is about the choice of new topsoil. We get to choose what to put back when the work is done.  I don't know if there are different kinds of topsoil, or some that have organic matter mixed in for worms, or whatever else is needed to allow a healthy soil ecosystem to be established. Perhaps some topsoils are ""new"" and sterile and others are ""recycled"" and more varied, but I don't know if so. I have the possibility to choose a specific kind of soil, or to premix it with nutrients. While the soil will mostly be laid with grass seed, we would like a fair bit of fruit plants and maybe a fruit tree or two in it, but even if we didn't, we'd like to help the soil to be established with a helping hand toward a thriving subsoil, that is also sustainable (ie reduce nutrient leaching and help nutrients to replenish), and a good soil, whatever that means.  What should we do / what are the options?   UPDATE:  @stormy - see reply to @Bamboo below, the original question contains links to photos before the work. The garden was originally on a slope and had been cut away. While the houses are in good condition for over 100 years, all the gardens on that slope have subsidence/soil movement, and show cracks/bulges/failures in retaining walls and some have substantial retaining concrete. Because of other circumstances time was very pressured and foundations needed redoing in 2 places anyway, so the ground was dug and a new engineer-designed retaining wall will go in. Before the heavy equipment all goes, and while I still have access for large items > 1.5m wide, it's a good time to get into the garden, whatever will be the new top layer of soil.  I haven't heard of seed spraying services, can you point me to any (I couldn't find links). The main reason for seed vs sod is cost, after so much unexpected work the economics override most other things. If seed can be done, then the cost saving will be a big help. Water in this area flows towards the houses and into water drains rather than into next door gardens, but because gardens are at different levels there may be flow of subsurface water from higher to lower gardens as well. I can put in trenches easily.   There isn't a chance to design the beds at the moment, there's too much else to do! So I want to get the topsoil ""about right"" and the hardest work done.  I might need to leave it idle and covered (or even in its large bags) until the Spring season while we fix the rest of the house structural issues, then come back to it in a few months and remove any weeds, plant seed, decide beds/ditches and anything else. But it will be easier to get the soil in now, while I have access for large/heavy items.  Update 2  It turns out that a 2.5 ton digger makes a superlative soil breaker if the bucket is jiggled and the soil allowed to scatter out of it. The soil looks a lot better than I expected, now that the broken glass, rocks and weeds/debris are mostly dealt with. A lot will have to be removed for structural reasons and levelling, but it should make a good soil. I may need to mix something or other in, or put a few inches of topsoil over it so the original soil is not near the surface (I found quite a lot of broken glass throughout, and no way to remove it all).  Essentially the digger and crude removal is getting quite a nice soft crumbly mix. Probably needs fixing somehow as its clay and will quickly clump again and be non-draining, but I'm fairly confident now that I could mix in whatever's needed to help with that, in a matter of a few days. I'm down to bare soil throughout, and whats left to do is trenches for structural concrete work, levelling and putting in structurally viable subground retaining walls against soil movement (originally sloped/cutaways at boundaries), and returning the garden back to being a garden not a building site.   So my previous assumption that it's not practical to keep the old soil has been changed.  If I sift+keep the needed amount of the existing soil instead of getting new, and I want to modify it to be better in terms of nutrients, drainage, or other qualities, I can probably do it instead of buying new, and mix in whatever is needed instead - but what is it that I should be doing?

I want as much color as I can get with continual blooms either from one plant or a mixture of plants  I am handicapped so I'd prefer it be as maintenance free as possible. I've never planted vine-type plants before. Do they send out tendrills? Do I need to train them? How do I prune them to keep them from turning into a jungle or""overflowing"" at the top of the railings? If it matters, I won't be able to plant until August. I also need something that's maintenance free during the winter (no covering up to protect) and it must be a  perennial. Would Clematis work and, if so, how far apart should they be planted? I appreciate any help you can give me to make my ramp look as beautiful as possible.  Sorry to be so specific but I need it to be handicap friendly. I can only garden in my Hoveround so I am limited. Thank you!  p.s. I tried to post a pic of the ramp but it wouldn't let me. I can provide one another way if it helps 😊 "

2255,Vegetable Garden Spring Weed Control Strategies,"I love my vegetable garden, but every spring it looks like the Amazon, and the task of clearing the overgrown weeds is not enjoyable.  One fall, I took cardboard and laid it down over my beds and covered it with straw.  The following spring, I lifted the cardboard, and voila, the bed was perfectly prepped and ready for planting.  It was glorious.  I have already restarted this process for the remainder of the garden but was hoping to get some alternate strategies.  While the cardboard/straw works well (from what I can tell), it:   Costs money...  straw isn't as cheap as it used to be Takes time - collecting cardboard from local stores, flattening it, laying it down to shape Isn't exactly beautiful, although the straw does take the edge off   I can't help but think I'm not the first person who's had to deal with this.  I am very interested in and open to cover crops, but bear in mind my goal is to minimize the work I have to do in the spring, when I am busiest.  Do cover crops create work for me in the spring, or do they just die?  Aside from cover crops, are there other low-cost strategies I can apply now to control weeds in the spring?  For what it's worth, I've tried burning the weeds in the spring with a propane torch without much success.  Also, two limitations I am bound by (admittedly self imposed):   No tilling -- I have no-till beds, and I am married to the idea No Artificial chemicals like Round Up -- I'm 100% organic in my veggie garden   I am in North-Central Indiana, zone 5b.

2262,"For a patchy lawn, is it better to apply pre-emergent or a lawn patch kit in the spring?","I live in Middle Tennessee, and the heat of this past summer was brutal on my lawn, which is a mix of fescue and bermuda grass.  We aerated and overseeded it in October to help fill in and fix the patchy parts of the lawn that died off and were overtaken by dallisgrass and crab grass because of the heat.  I put some compost over the parts that were especially barren, and the grass seed there is coming in really nicely.  In retrospect, I should have put compost over all the patchy parts, because I have a few sections of lawn that look like this, where grass is coming in nicely via the aeration holes but still looks pretty patchy otherwise:    (Also, pardon the sloppy look of the lawn - after a few weeks of watering the new seed, I finally mowed the thicker, healthier parts of my lawn but tried to leave the areas with the new grass seedlings untouched).  Long story short, I'm curious about what my next step should be in early spring to increase the health of my lawn.  Would it be wiser to apply a lawn patch kit to fill in the remaining patchy areas with more grass seed?  Or should I apply a pre-emergent instead, to fight the seeds left by the above-mentioned weeds that plagued our lawn?  The latter obviously counteracts the former, and with my goal being to continue to fill in the barren parts of my lawn, I didn't know if one would be better than the other in the springtime. "
2263,"Pruning clippers covered in copper - curse, blessing, or neglibable for plant propagation?","How I got clippers covered in copper  ""Dusting off"" some pruning clippers I noticed much more rust than I expected. I usually maintain tools well but lost track of this pair for a bit, and I guess they suffered from wherever they spent that time. I let it sit in vinegar then scrubbed it with ""steel wool"" - worked great. The clippers have a bronze hue to them now though, which brought to my attention that the steel wool I used was copper coated and the copper had rubbed off on the clippers. I didn't think much of it and finished the job with that scrubber since that's what I had in stock at the time. Admiring the rust-proof, bronze-hued clippers, I'm happy to be rid of rust but am left wondering if the copper coating will have any significant affect on plants I use these clippers on for propagation activities.  Is this good, bad, or negligible?  At first I shrugged at the clippers now being coated in copper, but then I recalled how copper has great antimicrobical properties which makes it wonderful for doorknobs. Since I use these clippers for propagation purposes, them being coated in antimicrobial didn't necessarily seem like a good thing. Preventing infection - great; preventing growth of new plant tissue - very counter-productive.   On the other hand, copper is a micronutrient many plants use. Could minor doses help newly clipped plant stems?   Ultimately, it's probably negligible, and in the future I'll continue to use whatever ""steel wool"" variant I have on hand. Still, I want to ask and see if anyone has insight about this here. "
2264,Growing multiple pepper plants in one pot vs just one plant per pot,"I'm a real hot chili lover, and yearly grow about 50 plants from about 10 varieties. I'm used to grow 3 plants (of the same variety) in a single 40 liter pot. While I do get good results, I'm still not sure if it's a good idea to put multiple plants in one pot, or just grow one plant per pot.  Let's assume I can only place 10 pots of each 40 liters for space and maintenance reasons. Cost of seeds and germinating them is negliable as 10 seeds cost just max 3 EUR. Cost of potting soil is quite more expensive however, let' say 8 EUR per 40 liter. Would it be a better idea to only put 10 plants in 10 pots, or place 30 plants in 10 pots? Or would another setup be better? What would give the most return to investment, and why?  ... EDIT ...  For illustration purposes, these were my plants last year:  21 may 2017: just placed outside (germinated in februari, first grown indoors as we can get frost until may here)    6 july 2017    A single picking of peppers (unfortunately I don't have any later pictures of the plants)    Close up of 2 satan's kiss and a 'peter' pepper.

2265,"Pruning a Lilac in November (South East, UK)","The leaves are falling off the 6'x6'x10' beast of a lilac I inherited from the previous homeowners, and I'm wondering whether now is an appropriate time to start reducing the height.  The plan was to take the front 1/3 or 1/4 of the canopy away this year, leaving the rest to flower, look pretty, and shade my pond through the next season; then repeat each year until it is a manageable size.  So I have two questions:   Is pruning at this time of year likely to cause problems, and if so, when would be a best time to prune? Am I correct in assuming that the pruned section would likely produce leaf and/or flower (pond cover) within a year?   Thanks, James  Addenda from the responses so far:   Image from mid July (pointing roughly north).  The main bush hasn't changed much, but I've thinned out the front (below that sandstone slab), excavated a waterfall  and created an alpine rockery:  Why:  It's a bit unweildy so needs reining in, blocking late afternoon sun down half of the garden. Health:  Seems quite happy.  We did not have the house when it was in bloom, but there is evidence it put out a fair number of flowers.  "
2266,What insects killed this red cabbage?,"Watering the lettuces, I spotted a Red Cabbage head leaning sideways on the ground.  On close inspection, here's what I saw:    Three little worm-like bugs having a feast of the bottom of the stalk of this head of red cabbage.    Their posse was crushed by hand.  The cabbage will be cooked tonight.  Now what?  two days later  Neighboring Mesclun, Red Sail, Collards, Arugula and the other three Red Cabbages are all basically well.  Photographed on a warm sunny day just before being watered:    These are growing in an above-ground planter built a couple of months ago in the backyard of a 3-family apartment building in Brooklyn, NY.  There is heavy duty landscaping cloth under the planter. Worth noting, the wood I built the planters from was reclaimed, though I inspected each board thoroughly and (I believe) they were bug-free.   But.. see that yellow card?  It's a sticky trap to kill hatching larvae, placed there one month ago when A swiss chard planted in that exact location suddenly wilted!!  As Stormy points out, next season it would be advantageous for the lettuces overall to be dispersed throughout other locations, or with companion species besides cole crops.  I'll update this post as the cabbage root excavation continues.   aha!  Fiasco Labs has ID'd the bugs as termites.  What an outright terrifying little species those are.  Confirmed watching spine-chilling YouTube videos, the motion of their ""feasting"" is very distinct.  Questions about Termites:   Are Nematodes known to mitigate termites in soil? Can termites just appear out of thin (local) air?  Might they have come from the wood in the planters?  From the ground?  Are termites just around, like mosquitoes?   also  A few weeks ago, Nematodes were added to all of the soil in the various planters. Scanmask was used, and I did my best to not over- or under- populate my garden based on the instructions. We hope beneficial Nematodes put the hurt on all nefarious bugs! "

2270,What soil mixture should I use for my office Schefflera?,"I'm on here again, asking more questions about my office's Schefflera that I'm in charge of. You can find pictures and a previous question here:  Whats the next step to improving my schefflera?  I think I need to repot it now. I've been told it's almost as old as the company and I doubt it's been repotted much since then. When I first came to care for it, I started playing with the watering schedule. I read that they like to dry out slightly and then be soaked. Well, I watered it a decent amount for the size of the pot and it stayed sopping for almost a week. I started watering it more lightly and letting it dry out down 2-3 inches before watering again. Basically, every other week. I've recently started fertilizing all the office plants once a month. It's not very often, but they are all in low light, so I figured I shouldn't over fertilize them.  The Schefflera has shown pretty good progress and has at least doubled the foliage on the top since I took it over. I've even had new growth about a foot from the base. You can see that growth in the linked post. That growth has since died off, but a few days ago, I noticed two new growths slightly above the one that died off. While the other growth got tall before dying, it never leafed out. These two new growths are very close to the trunk, but have tiny leaves. I'll try to get pictures to show these growths as well as the dim lighting the room gets when the office light is off, which is often.  I know the plant needs more light, but it's not really up to me. I'm just doing the best I can with it. I believe it needs to be repotted. I'm guessing that it's possibly gotten root bound, but I think it's probably rotted some of the roots because of the water retaining soil that's in it. It's currently in a 14-16"" self-watering pot (depending on how warped it is where you measure). I found a 20"" on sale at Big Lots. I can drill holes in it and put a tray under it. That will fix the drainage issues.  I need to know a good soil mixture for this plant. I have more of the miracle grow, water-retaining soil on hand in the office. I also have half a bag of compost from Home Depot. I figure that I can mix the half bag of compost, which is courser, with the miracle grow, some orchid bark I also have on hand, and maybe some perlite. This mixture seems like it would retain some water over the week, but drain much faster and not become easily compact. What do you guys think of this mixture or would you do something different?   I realize that I may lose the little growths on the base, but I think I should take the chance. I think it's akin to lopping the flowers off plants if the plant is weak. You may lose something, but the plant will be healthier and you'll end up with more growth in the long run. Thanks.  Edit: I took some more pictures I'm adding. You can see that a lot of the leaves are drooping. I had it on an every other week watering schedule, but we got a Friday off for a holiday and I plum forgot to water it till the next Friday. There was a lot of drooping. It perked back up some, but it may be like orchids in that once the lack or water damage is done, it just doesn't stand back up. I also tried to show the low light levels, but my phone brightened the first shot up. The others have the room light on. You can see the new growth on the trunk.  Edit (10/19/2015): I repotted the plant last Friday before the weekend. I'd bought a 20"" pot for it and I drilled a couple of 3/8"" drain holes in the bottom, as well as several around the side at the base. I didn't see a specifically 'tropical' potting soil and knew the moisture control held too much water. I ended up using about half and half Miracle Grow potting soil and Miracle Grow's natural compost which is a little chunky and I though would help the drainage. I also added a good bit of perlite to make it lighter an airier. I had my hands covered in dirt and couldn't take pictures, but there wasn't a lot of root left. I could have fit most of the root ball in my two hands. I had figured that the constant moisture was probably rotting them, but I was hopeful when I started letting it dry out more and it started putting on a lot of top growth. I repotted it in this much looser soil, with drain holes. I think that between the drain holes, the loser soil, and the fertilizer from the potting soil, hopefully this plant will start growing some good roots. If the little plantlets growing near the base take off. I probably will lop off the top. I'm still nervous about killing off an office relic, so I'm being cautious. Thanks for the help. I'll try to update this post in a couple of months to let you know whether it improves or declines in the new setting.          "
2271,Is it possible to plant iris seeds in early spring?,"I've saved seeds from my irises from last spring with the intention of planting them. However, most of the guides I've read have suggested planting them in the autumn.  Is it possible to plant the seeds in the spring? If so, how should I go about this?  Notes: I live in the UK. "
2272,How do I improve my success rate at growing scallions in bottles of water from onion heads,"When I was younger, my family would grow scallions by taking an old glass bottle, filling it with water to the brim, and putting a regular onion head on the bottle so its bottom would touch water. It would grow roots and start growing little scallions.  I tried doing that again, and met with varied success. Some onion heads produced scallions after a week or two. Some took 2-3 months. Some never did.  Is that a good way to grow scallions, and if so what can I do to improve the success rate? Buy specific kinds of onions? Add something to the water? Anything else? "
2273,How much water should I give to a 20 foot Italian Cypress tree?,"I have an Italian cypress tree in my backyard which is about 20 feet tall.  How much water should I give it? Also, how frequently should I water it?  I should point out a big caveat.  The tree is dying and starting to turn orange.  It might be dead already.  The main cause of this is the California drought and my lack of watering it.  It's been alive for at least 20 years (without any external water intervention).  But now I fear it's dying (or dead) and the lack of rain is accelerating it's death.    "
2274,What is the correct way of placing echinacea seed in soil?,"Some of the internet sites claim that echinacea seed should be placed at a small depth of 1/4 inch into soil, but not covered at that time, the reason being that they need light to germinate. And just after they germinate, they should be covered with 1/4 inch layer of soil. (This suggestion seems to be valid for both growing from small containers and directly outdoors)  Is this true? Is that crucial? Does someone have some related experience?    Update:  The content of a bag I bought from a local seed shop: 0.5 gr, it should be around 90 seeds    All seeds are 2mm-3mm long.  The exact species is Echinacea angustifolia. The seed shop says the germination rate is 60%, but I doubt it, it is unusually high, but we'll see.    Update - Match 8 - day 0  Three seeds are placed in each cell, on the surface of the soil, and lightly patted. So there were around 130 seeds in the bag. I found that seeds just 'glued' to my wet finger, so I used just my finger to spread seeds, cell by cell, three at the time. The soil was wet, but I also sprinkled water over each cell afterwards.    I have more seed bags for starting them in the garden directly, but I am going to do it in mid-spring.    Update - March 9 - day 1  I covered the tray with a transparent nylon cover:    The tray is not 100% sealed, but I gather this is enough to keep the soil moist.  The cover is actually a cover for shirts and other clothes that dry cleaning shops regularly use.  I intend to keep the cover for a week. I am going to open it every few days for 10 min, to refresh the air.    Update - March 4th - day 4  I wanted just to refresh air around seeds today (by removing the cover for 10 min), however, unexpectedly, I discovered that some seed already sprouted! I removed the cover permanently.    Update - April 6th - day 29   "
2275,How do you measure soil temperature?,"I've been given the instructions ""plant young plants only after the ground temperature reaches 70°F (21°C), about 2 to 3 weeks before the last frost.""   I looked up ground temperatures in my area and it never goes above 60°F (15.5°C), measured 1m (3ft) down. So how are you supposed to measure the 70°F (21°C)? On top of the soil, 10cm (4in) below, or above or how?   The way I understand this instruction, I can never plant these. Or at least, it makes no sense to expect these temperatures 2-3 weeks before the last frost. "
2276,Why is this years-old vine dying and showing strange beige spots?,"My housemate has a hanging plant, we think it's a form of vine, in her room. It's her favourite plant and at least 10 years old. Lately, it's started thinning out massively, leaving dried leaves on the floor. The leaves have beige spots:    The leaves' back side shows brown spots:    What is this, and what can we do to fight it? Could it be a fungus? "
2277,White and brown spots on cacti,"I've been away for the last two and a half weeks, and upon return I noticed a few of my cacti had developed white fuzzy spots, which were not there before.  In the worst instance, one cactus appears damaged and oozes brown liquid in one spot, as well as something that looks like sweat on the rest of its body.  I watered all of the plants profusely 10 days before leaving (which was roughly 1 month ago), and was sure to remove excess water from the pots. Before this watering, the last time I watered the succulents was 2 months prior.  Almost all of the affected plants are placed in a miniature greenhouse from IKEA. Due to an oversight, I left both top panels closed before leaving, so I assume air circulation was limited.  The plants are in front of a south-facing window, and on sunny days it they can get large amounts of light and warmth, so the lack of air circulation may have affected them negatively.    I read an article saying that the white spots may be caused by mealybugs. It seems treatable but I'd like to understand whether this is actually the cause of my issue and what the best way to treat this instance would be.  My questions are:   What are these white and brown spots on the succulents? Is there something that can be done to eliminate them and heal the plants? What is the cause of this issue, how did it spread to so many plants at the same time, and how can I prevent it reoccurring?   EDIT: It seems like this is a very widespread mealybug infestation. I spent today removing as many as possible, but I'm sure there's more. They're on at least 10 of the plants, maybe more. I'm not sure how they've spread so fast and so widely (I hadn't seen any prior to leaving my house 3 weeks ago, though admittedly maybe I hadn't looked carefully enough). Do you have any tips for clearing these entirely?    This is the cactus with white spots and a large brown spot of fluid oozing from one point on its body:        This one has multiple fuzzy spots and some less fuzzy and more defined small white spots:      This one has just one fuzzy spot on one of the tips:      This one has spots all over its body:       In one instance there are spots on the soil:       Two of the cacti outside the greenhouse also have fuzzy white spots. The white spots are new on the one in the first picture, but the one in the second picture has had fuzz at the top for a long time and I'm not sure if it's due to the same causes.    "
2278,"How large a tree can be ""bare-rooted"" for planting?","Upon receiving an estimate for moving a 12"" caliper maple with a crane, a client's landscape architect proposed looking into whether or not it would be possible to save money by bare-rooting the tree rather than balling/burlapping and then lifting it.   Edit: in response to Graham Chiu's question, I would expect the root ball to be in the 8' diameter or larger range.  We don't think it is a feasible idea, but that could just be because we've never done this before.  So, it it possible to do a bare-root transplant of a tree that size? How big does a tree have to be before it is no longer possible to do it that way?  Finally, if it IS possible, what are some tips to improve the chances of success? "
2279,Organic or Traditional lawn fertilizer: which is safer for areas with young children?,"I have a new lawn that was started in late August in the Boston (MA) area. The installer says it's time to apply fall fertilizer. My new lawn looks pretty good: there was broad germination; there are some bald spots; and in the shade there's some thinner uptake. It's starting to yellow slightly. I'm currently watering twice a week for approximately 30 minutes.   I have young children who want to play on the lawn, so I want to be careful about exposing them to the fertilizer. I bought two fertilizers with the plan to use one of them, and I could use some help answering questions in order to pick one.   The two fertilizers are:   Scotts® Turf Builder® WinterGuard® Fall Lawn Food -- This has no pesticides and a fertilizer mix of 32-0-10 Scotts® Natural Lawn Food -- This has no pesticides, is ""organic"" (bone meal) and has a fertilizer mix of 11-2-2   Questions:   Is the traditional fertilizer safe for my children? The online documents say ""Kid and pet friendly when applied as directed."" Is the organic one any safer? Online says ""Kid and pet friendly."" The organic bag is 2x larger by volume even though it covers only 80% of what the traditional one covers. Why is that? By percentage, the organic one (11 + 2 + 2 = 15) has less actual fertilizer than the traditional (32 + 0 + 10 = 42). Does that matter much? Should I use a broad fertilizer for a new lawn (organic one in this case) or the fall mix (traditional one). It's a new lawn, so root growth is key, which is why I would think the organic one with its (admittedly small) phosphate contribution would be good.    Any advice about fall fertilizers for a new lawn and fertilizers with kids is much appreciated.  "
2280,Concerns with breathing in fine particles from soil,"I've been filling planter boxes (PB5s to PB12s) with organic soil mixes, with a tiny amount of synthetic fertlizer.   Is this bad for my lungs? The environment wasn't windy, and the soil was moist enough so that any airborne dust was unnoticable, however I've found very fine particles turning my mucus black after work. I was unable to wear a mask for other reasons.   I'm not sincerely concerned with this due to the brevity of the job, however i'm wondering from a theoretical perspective if this would ever be an issue if I held the job long enough? Could it be carcinogenic or reduce lung capacity as it blocks alveolae?  "
2281,Should I dig through roots when removing a mound from around a tree?,"I am a first time home owner, and didn't know that a mound around a tree was bad. A 2' deep, 10' wide mound had been put around the tree a few years before I bought the house. I want to remove the mound but now there are small roots in the mound and to remove most of the mound I would have to shovel through them.   I think the tree is a maple.  Would it hurt the tree to dig up those roots?  What about using a hose to cause the soil to run off? How should I proceed in the best interest of the tree?   "
2282,Why are my Sprinkler's no longer rotating?,"I have an irrigation system that's about 7 years old. I started to notice that some of my sprinkers' (MP Rotators) are either not rotating or doing so at an extremely slow rate.  I've done several steps in attempting to resolve the problem but with no success.  Hoping someone has further guidance for me.  Steps I've taken:  First I cleaned each filter within the spray heads to ensure there was no clog. No luck. Then I bought a pressure gauge and discovered that my spray heads are anywhere from 60 to 80 psi. The spray bodies are basic Orbitz brand, so I started replacing them with pressure regulating spray bodies from Hunter. I've verified the pressure is now around 38 psi.  Despite all this, the rotation problem persists. I've run out of ideas. I still haven't replaced all the spray bodies yet, so wasn't sure if I need to get an entire zone on pressure regulated spray bodies before I see a change?  Update: Adding photos.  Also realized the old spray body isn't Orbitz but...I think Rainbird?  Old and new spray bodies     Filter and in the ground     In action. Streams look good, they just aren't rotating.   "
2283,White spots and patches that look like mold in water tank used to water plants automatically,"When I leave for multiple weeks I leave an automatic water pump to water some of my more needy plants. When I returned, I noticed there were white patches on the water pump, as well as on the surface of the water in the tank I used.  This had happened the previous time I set up the automatic water pump, which stayed in the water for about a month, even though it took much less time for the issue to develop this time and the patches are much more prominent.  Last time I encountered this, I tried washing the pump with hot water, but it doesn't seem to have prevented the issue occurring again.  Once removed from the water, the patches on the water pump became dry and broke apart.  I am unsure whether the presence of this substance in the water has affected my plants negatively. The two plants being watered from the tank are a Spider Plant and a Dracaena Massangeana. While the leaves of both plants look droopy and there is some tip burn (which may or may not have been there before), I haven't noticed other symptoms.     What are these white spots in the water and on the pump? Should I throw away the pump, as the substance may have spread all throughout it?     Pictures:    "
2284,Zone 6b edible Ficus (Fig) hardiness/overwintering,"Two years ago I purchased and grew a wonderfully beautiful brown turkey fig tree in south Toronto, Canada.  Alas, it died as I overwintered in in an unheated garage which I thought might be sufficient. Last year, I purchased a Mission fig which I overwintered indoors. Since it was warm and received some light, it grew, but terribly leggy and anemic. This spring, I allowed it to grow without pruning, leaving its spindly and lanky growth alone. It provided me with 6 edible fruits.   My question is:   Do I attempt to again winter this tree in my unheated garage? This time, I would take more effort with its insulation. This way, I will more likely recreate a better dormancy period in hopes of more fruits next year. In addition, since my tree is only about 5' tall with about 8 branches, would now be the ideal time to prune since I believe that they fruit on new growth? is the Mission hardier than the Turkey? (It was also a particularly bad winter when I lost my Turkey).   Or  Do I again bring it in the house, pare it down to fit, and keep new growth at bay?  Or  The hardest but likely best method?:  Dig a trench and bury the bugger?  I'm thinking @kevinsky might chime in here. fingers crossed. @stormy, I know you know the answer but you're way too warm to know the plight of Torontonians.  "
2285,What is this flower-like succulent with hair on the tips?,"Could you please identify succulent in the following picture? I like its strange symmetry. What is its hardiness zone?

The plant in the question linked to in a comment (that claims that the two questions are duplicates) doesn't look like the plant from this question. They may be the same genus or species, but the point is to discover the exact, or approximate, variant or cultivar. "

What is a good reference database for resolving such issues? "
2288,Cactus turning white/brown/yellow,"I believe this cactus is a cereus jamacaru but I am not 100% sure. I had it in relatively low light room but across from a south facing window in the sunniest spot of the room. I watered it once before I noticed something was wrong. It started out by turning yellow and a little brown at the top and now it is starting to turn white. I repotted it and used a soil that has better drainage and the pot it is in has a hole in the bottom too. I even transferred it to different levels of light (maybe too quickly from what I've read) I also believe it has scale insects. After researching how to remove them, I started the process this morning and I have also ordered a cacti insecticide just for future prevention. Are there any other diagnoses? I don't know if I'm correct and I am wondering if there is a way I can cut the bad parts off or if it will even recover. Any Ideas? The attached picture was last week- it looks worse now and has since been moved to a less sunny place- it was out in the sun for a day or two.  "
2289,Help determine lighting requirements for wintering small plants indoors,"I live in zone8. I have a few plants I've been experimenting with. I broke a few stems off a friends tropical flowering plant they got at Home Depot, and have been propagating them successfully, but they'll have to come in for the winter. I also have a lemon tree I grew from a seed at the bottom of a cup of Sonic tea. It's doing well, and I put it out this summer, but I'll have to bring it back in for the winter as well. The leaves on it have gotten a lot yellower, where they were a pretty green from when it sprouted March-before-last, till when I put it out this spring.  Anyway, I've been looking around at lighting options. I don't have room for some massive system. I'm not looking to completely replicate the outdoors, just make them comfortable and healthy till I can put them back outside next year. My bedroom stays a comfortably warm temp, but the lighting is moderate to dim, even with two windows. One each faces west and south. I have been putting plants under the south facing window and they do pretty well. I have a lamp on the dresser beside that window I leave on from about 6:45am to 10-11pm. I put the smaller plants under this light.  I'm just learning about the light requirements and I know that ideally you have a 6500k and something around 2100k for the red and blue spectrums. I looked this morning and the bulb in the lamp is a 5500k CFL. I saw a guy on youtube who had some setup where he could get two bulbs in a single clamp reflector hood. He put a 6500k and a 2700k in each hood. I'd like to know how to get two bulbs in one shade, but he would hang one shade over each group of seedlings or smaller plants, or he'd surround a larger plant with multiples of these.  I have a small area of floor space clear under a wall mounted dvd shelf. I think I could easily clamp a reflector to the bottom self and direct one of these duel bulb reflectors at the floor, where I'd set the wintering plants. They're all roughly the same height. I feel like even if two bulbs aren't ideal, that they'd still be a huge improvement over one window and a lamp. I still worry I'll come home to find that my plants have been knocked out of the way and my cat is lying under the 'sun' bulbs, but that's another problem. I'm considering replicating the same set up on my dresser for my year round indoor succulents and tillandsia. I can also probably set my orchids at the fringes and get them good light as well.  Does this two bulb setup sound like it would be okay for keeping the plants alive and healthy through the winter, when I'm not trying to get anything to put on massive growth or flower, or do I need more? By winter I mean that it's now 10/9/2015 and I'll have to bring them in anytime between now and the first week in November. I won't be able to put them back out till the end of April or the beginning of May. I might be able to put them out a little sooner, but would have to keep an eye on the temp. Also, I haven't found out much about the wattage and how it affects the plants. I've seen that you need to use the 6500k and the 2?00k, but I've found both of those in multiple wattages. Thanks for the help with this.   Again, I'm just trying to keep them healthy over the winter, not put on growth or flowers. I'm also not going to buy pricey and hot HID bulbs. I figure CFL's are cheap, compact, and safe to leave on in my room unsupervised. Thanks again. "
2290,How best to Germinate Sweetcorn,"I'm wanting to grow some sweetcorn (Its mid spring here, so I believe I should have enough time).    My concern is that the sweetcorn is going to be grown very close to the home of my wifes free-range chickens - so I have a couple of questions -   If i plant the sweetcorn 3 cm below the soil, are the chickens likely to  find and consume it ?

2291,How should I remove a patch of the wrong type of grass from my lawn?,"In the foreground of the picture, you can see a brown region.  This is a different type of grass than the buffalo that makes up the remainder of the lawn.    I would like the whole lawn to be buffalo for a consistent look.  How can I achieve this?   This small area of different grass has persisted for a number of years.  It looks brown now as there has not been any rain for about 10 days.  When it rains, it will come back green again.  The buffalo seems to grow better in summer, while the other grass grows better when it is colder.  It's spring here now so I thought it might be a good time to address this.  Can I spray this with round-up, and allow the buffalo to grow in from the edges.  Do I need to physically dig it up?  Edit: I dug up the patch. About 15cm down I hit cement. The soil was quite compacted clay.  It's not clear to me what this was. Might have been an old path across the yard "

Last year I rotated several pots from tomato to peppers and vice versa, and top-dressed all with LARGE bag of fresh potting soil -- herbs did well, so did green onions, but peppers and tomatoes suffered. What do I need to add to the soil to make it healthy? Does to be more than all-purpose fertilizer -- like calcium or something? Iron?

2300,Can rubber gloves spread plant diseases?,"I use thin rubber gloves when gardening.   It's autumn here in zone 6, and I'm in the process of pruning and pulling up spent perennials and all manner of wildflowers which have been growing since the spring. I leave them until the bees, butterflies and insects have had their fill of the flowers, at which point many have visible leaf mold, fungal diseases, and insect damage.  In a different area, healthy annuals such as marigolds, dahlias, petunias, verbena, begonias, cosmos and snapdragons, will continue to produce flowers until frost if I keep dead-heading them. I also have shrubs that are fine and just need the usual preparation for winter.  I generally handle a variety of plants in one gardening session, but have begun to wonder if diseases can live on the rubber gloves, and if so, for how long. Can they be deposited on, and cause damage to, un-infected plants?   Should I rinse or change gloves between tasks, or is my concern unfounded?  "
2301,How do I prepare and sow a lawn organically?,"Sowing a lawn organically seems to have 2 problems that need solving:   Killing the weeds prior to sowing Avoiding weed growth after sowing   Once the soil is levelled, I'm considering trying the false seed bed technique to kill off any remaining weeds before sowing grass. Wikipedia's article on false seed beds suggests hoeing the soil after 2 weeks, and probably repeating that step again at least once to be sure. If the technique is repeated enough, perhaps weed growth after sowing can be mostly avoided?  Has anyone had experience sowing a lawn with the false seed bed technique? Is there any other advice that might be useful?   Background:  I have recently built a house and the earthworks have resulted in approx 180sqm of a bumpy and difficult mixture of soil and pebbles around the house that I'd like to be lawn.  I know there are heaps of weed seeds in the soil as lots have sprouted over the last few weeks. Our first step will be to have the land levelled with a small digger as there's too much soil to shift by hand - this will hopefully kill off most of the weeds currently growing on the surface, but I'm sure it will also expose more weed seeds.  I have obtained quotes from tradesman for sowing the lawn, but they want to spray with a broadleaf herbicide several weeks after sowing to kill off weeds. Researching the ingredients in the proposed spray (picloram being one), they appear to be very safe in the short term but very little appears to be known about long term effects. It is also toxic to aquatic life, will readily drain through soil into the groundwater (our region uses mostly groundwater for irrigation and drinking!), is long lived, and may affect plant growth when it ends up in our compost. Interestingly, picloram also appears to be considered inappropriate for residential use. Going organic seems like a sensible option!  Thanks!  Update: I hoped the grass would win competing against other plants. After having some issues with birds eating the seed on the day it was sown, I resowed some areas then sprinkled sieved soil over the whole area to protect the seed. It took about 3 hours to sieve enough soil.  Now, something like 10 months later I think, the grass is growing well, however clover is healthily coexisting with the grass. In a few parts which didn't get enough grass seed, the weeds, such as plantain and ox tongue, are much more prolific, so it's clear the grass is dominant enough to keep them down where well sown. I've dug out a few thistle and ox tongues that established themselves amongst the grass.  I'm allergic to beestings, so my daughter might be too, which is why we'd rather not have much clover around; it attracts lots of bees in summer. One suggestion I've had was to add nitrogen fertiliser to make the clover bolt and then die off. I'm not sure whether any organic fertilisers would be adequate for this, or whether I'd need to use a non-organic one such as superphosphate.  "

2306,Lifetime of a Poinsettia,"I have a Poinsettia that I've been caring for since xmas. I've taken a look at online guides and they all seem to be focused on making the leaves turn red near xmas.  Is this a process that's crucial to the life of a Poinsettia? What happens if I treat it as a regular house plant (i.e. just regular care, without the whole complete darkness process)? Does it just die off by itself after a while?  I'm interested in keeping it alive for as long as I can and turn it into a large bush, rather than have its leaves turn red each xmas.  Its current state:   I haven't done much more than watering it so far, while keeping it in indirect sunlight in a ~22 C room.  It had about three or four leaves that covered the surface of the soil entirely, all of them having large edges that were sort of rusty and completely dry (the edges stopped advancing in the past couple of months), sort of like this:    I cut those leaves off and revealed that the plant also started branching out from near the start of the stem.

And if so what would you use to cut it?  Thanks 
2308,Why does my house plant have brown leaves?,"Why does my house plant have brown leaves scattered all around? I water it when it's dry, it gets enough sunshine. It's growing fine as the vines are getting longer. But the brown leaves won't stop coming. Maybe I shouldn't be doing this, but I cut the brown leaves off and they come right back. What am I doing wrong?   There are no rocks at the bottom and no fertilizer. I do water it a lot. It's a hanging plant as well. I use water from my kitchen faucet, as I do with all my other plants, and I have no issues with them at all.         "

2310,How do I take care of a Port Jackson fig bonsai?,"A few years ago (4ish, I think) my girlfriend at the time brought me a small bonsai, a Port Jackson Fig (if I remember right!).  I have managed to keep it going so far. At this point, it is more a ""small tree in a pot"" than a bonsai. It hasn't really even been shaped, and I enjoy it looking normal.  I'm going to be honest - over the last 5 months it has been left totally unloved. My watering was random, often with large gaps in between and when I did water, it was normally too much water. So now it's looking very sad. It only has about 4 leafs left on it, they look healthy but there are very few!  I'd like to know how to get it back on track. I haven't changed the soil in ages, so I assume that's step one. What next?  Also should a fig bonsai be inside or outside? Full sun or shade? Even through I've had it for 4 years now, I feel like a bad dad and I'm asking for your help with a crash course in bonsai love.  Any help would be amazing. I've had this thing for so long, that I would hate for it to die because of me!  "
2311,Why is my peperomia sad?,"  I moved her to this pot about a year ago and was really thriving for a while. I have noticed she doesn't like cold but does like light, but has made it through several different apartments with me despite the varied locations. Now she live in a room with indirect daylight for most of the day and I water heavily once a month or until the soil is dry.  There also seem to be tiny centipedes on the dirt, none of my other plants have them.  They freak me out.  She seems all droopy. Am I not fertilizing enough? What would be proper care? "
2312,Planting new between established cedars (emerald)?,"I moved house and the garden has a row of cedars that are about 6-7ft tall and have been there for approx 10 years (looking at old satellite photos). The are planted with gaps between the trees that I would like to fill. The gap varies across the row, but many of them I can easily step through to the other side. Can I plant new cedars in the gap to create more of a hedge or will it kill the established ones? Or is there an alternative that i can plant that will add height? I would like privacy without having to fence.  Thank you. "
2313,How much human interference is required to help daffodils spread?,"I have quite a few daffodils planted around the perimeter of my garden, and although I see them spreading each year, I was wondering whether I could help thicken the daffodil border without buying new bulbs.  Should I dig up bulbs and split them? Or is that likely to damage them? Is there something else I should do to encourage spreading? "
2314,"How much seasonal, internal die-off of Arborvitae is natural and expected?","How much ""natural"" (i.e., without damaging factors) die-back from the inside of an (otherwise healthy) arborvitae hedge should be expected each year? Stated another way, would an arborvitae in ideal conditions experience any natural, seasonal die-back, or would it remain entirely green? If so, how much internal die-off is normal or even ""healthy""?  I am aware of the original arborvitae die-off questions, including on internal die-back and about new plantings, but I believe this is a different topic.  I'm mainly interested in the general case (""could it be normal?""), but I'll describe the specifics. One of the borders of my lot has a well-established (15+ year old) Arborvitae hedge -- specifically Thuja occidentalis / Northern whitecedar. Seasonally, in the fall, some amount of internal foliage turns brown and dies off. The plants otherwise appear vigorous. The plans seem to recover each spring to a reasonable degree, but this year's growing conditions, and the die-off symptoms, have both been worse than normal.  If it matters, I believe it to be the probably the Emerald Green / Smaragd cultivar. This is in the Northeast US. They are in full sun. The die-off is all internal, and doesn't look like whole branches or spotty (as for pests), or whole areas (as salt damage), or systemic or from the tips (as roots, water, or nutrients). However, if die-off always implies damage, I'll look harder!  There is no shortage of empirical evidence that Arborvitae don't live up to the ""vitae"" (""life"") part of their name, and I have (separately) seen many of these symptoms. There are plenty of resources on arborvitae, but I see only passing references to ""normal"" die-back -- one such article.  "
2315,What should I do about a dead lawn and weeds in California?,"Our lawn had gone from beautiful to being overrun with weeds. Since the drought in California has continued for so long we just basically gave up and now all grass and weeds are dead.  Yup, we have a large dirt yard.    I'm hoping for an end to the drought this winter and if so, I may reseed the backyard.   Will any remaining weed seed that's there start growing too?   Any idea how to ensure it's gone?  "
2316,How warm should soil be for propagation of hardwood black currant cuttings?,"I have hardwood cutting from a couple of black currant bushes collected this winter. Many have been planted in small pots as I'm getting them started indoors on a warming mat. The warming mat is hooked up to a thermostat so I can control how warm the mat gets based on a soil thermometer inserted 1"" into one of the seedling pot's soil.  I wonder, what temperature is optimal for these cuttings? As a general rule of thumb I'm thinking 70 degrees F? What I've read on blank currant propagation so far has not mentioned temperature for starting them. "
2317,"Scoria coarse ""sand"" for my Haworthias and others","I don't find horticulture-grade pumice available locally. So, I bought some scoria and sifted it.

I have kept it until I find what to do with it.  My question - Which to use for the following plants: Haworthia, Gasteria, Aloe, Echeveria and its allied species. Is the finer grain of any use?  My climate - Csa according to the köppen climate classification: hot Mediterranean.  Edit: Climatic data for Tel-Aviv in this link. No rainfall in summer (but very humid), high rainfall in winter.

2320,Can I simultaneously kill off grass and sow wildflower seed?,"I'm planing on establishing a fairly large area - 1000 sq ft - as a sort of wildflower meadow.  The area is currently lawn with pretty good quality soil.  I live in Asheville, NC zone 6.    Here is my question:  I have established wildflower meadows by seed before and have always cleared the area of existing grass and weeds before sowing the seed.  My tiller is not currently operating and I really don't feel like hand digging the whole area to remove grass, so here is my plan.  I'll cut the grass super short and add a thin layer of compost to the area.  I'll sow my seed onto the compost and compress with a roller.  I will then cover the area with cardboard for two to three months (until grass is sufficiently dead) into the winter.  I will then remove the cardboard at the beginning of spring or earlier and hopefully be left with no living plants but a nice wildflower seed bed.  I will be sowing the seed in a few weeks so it naturally stratifies over the winter.    Will covering the seedbed with cardboard for a few months affect germination negatively?  I'm aware some flower seeds require light for germination, however, if I removed the cardboard before spring, then it should be fine yeah?  I'm interested in hearing what ya'll have to say about this.  It would sure save me a lot of work!  Here are the species included in the mix I will use.    Annual Baby’s Breath, Annual Phlox, Black-Eyed Susan, Clasping Coneflower, Corn Poppy, Four O’Clocks, Gayfeather, Gilia, Indian Blanket, Lemon Mint, Lance-Leaved Coreopsis, Leavenworth’s Tickseed, Moss Verbena, New England Aster, Perennial Lupine, Plains Coreopsis, Purple Coneflower, Scarlet Flax, Scarlet Sage, Sulphur Cosmos and Tree Mallow.

2321,Is it possible to grow bell pepper from store-brought bell peppers?,"I was wondering if it is possible to grow bell pepper plants from the store brought bell peppers. Of course, I googled it it says that we have to dry the seeds first and then plant them in potting mix/ use paper towels, but my first attempt of the green bell peppers did not work. I am planning on trying with the red and yellow ones, which are ripe. Please give me some advice on ensuring better germination rate. Average temperature here is 26°C. Also, is it really necessary to dry them if we are planting them right away?  Here was my previous question on my first attempt, which was a failure.

2322,How should I treat brown patches in my St. Augustine grass lawn?,"We recently got a love letter from our HOA to re-sod or treat our lawn and I am trying to see if I can fix it myself or should seek professional help.   Our lawn (St Augustine grass) was kind of neglected this past summer - we were out of the country from July- mid August and the lawn was not watered regularly. Before we left, I mowed the lawn to the lowest setting on my mower. The lawn was green and healthy. But when we got back, there were a lot of brown spots and some dried out dead grass.   We don’t have a sprinkler system so the only water it got was from the occasional rain shower during that 6 weeks. We live in Houston and this summer was really hot – 90 to 100&deg;F every day.   Can I put in fertilizer to revive the lawn? If so, what type of fertilizer do I need? Since I didn’t water the lawn regularly, does it only need watering? Do I need to re-sod?   This is what the lawn looks like. The curbside one doesn't look really good.     "
2323,Spraying Poison Ivy in the Fall,"So I've been slowing pushing back on some poison ivy on my property using Round Up Poison Ivy Plus Tough Brush Killer. I normally try to go in two times a year, once in the spring and once in the summer and spray whatever I see growing. All the big growth seems dead now and I'm basically working on small shoots that I miss each time. This year I've been a bit behind the times and just am getting around to it. Will it be effective to spray poison ivy in the fall? Or should I just wait until next spring. The leaves on these plants are starting to orange. (I'm in New Hampshire and its October if that matters) This is what the website says but I'm not sure if they are still growing around now:     WHEN TO APPLY Apply when weeds are actively growing. For best results,   apply during warm, sunny weather (above 60�). Spray when air is calm   to prevent product from drifting onto desirable plants. Rain or   watering within 30 minutes of application will NOT wash away   effectiveness.   Also as a side question in a few years I plan on cutting down the other brush in the area and converting it to grass. How long do the vines from poison ivy need to dead before I don't need to worry about getting the rash from them? "
2324,Thrips in strawberry plants,"this is the first time I am trying to grow strawberries on a balcony . I built wooden planters for like 60 plants. Since last week all were doing great. They are blooming like crazy and they have a lot of green fruits. I noticed that a lot of plants started having brozne like dry spots on fruits. A didn't know what was going on and after a lot of googling I figured out that my plants are infested with thrips. Just to be sure 100% sure I searched them and found them under leaves and in blooms. I still have a lot of green fruits that are totally fine but I know that if I won't do anything I am probably going to lose all fruits.  My question is how to save my plants. I have mainly everbearings and dozens of june bearings. I know I will have to probably use pesticide to kill the thrips but I know that it shouldn't be used when plants have blooms and fruits?  Is there any option that I would cut all the green fruits and blooms and maybe some leaves, use pesticide and then wait for new blooms and fruits?  thanks for the help "

2326,What are these barely visible white spots and brown edges on my citrus plant?,"I have a citrus plant and something else growing in a pot. The something else had some barely visible white mold-like spots for a few months, and now its and the nearby citrus plant's leaves are starting to get dead spots. I have another citrus plant in another pot but it doesn't have any white or dead spots like that. What are they? How can I treat them?  Two citrus stems(?) and one unidentified plant stem are growing in the same pot, and the other pot has only one, bushier citrus plant with no problems like that. The white spots are only now starting to appear bigger and more numerous on the unidentified plant. The brown dead spots on the citrus plant have only started appearing from about a month ago. I replanted and moved the pots since then. The white mold-like spots used to be only on the unidentified plant's one leaf, and now it's on its every leaf, and the citrus leaves near it are starting to look bad for some (possibly same) reason. Both in a pot, grown from seeds, inside on the window sill.  I recently repotted them both to get more soil under the roots which were accumulating on the lowest parts of the pots, and before both pots were regularly watered to the point where thick layer of moss (~1cm from root to top of the mossy mass) grew on about half the surface of both pots. I've removed moss when repotting. If it was that, I guess both plants would be affected the same, but they're not.  Last week I moved both plants on the window sill where lack of light (as opposed to being on the balcony in the warm months) and central heating radiator is causing a big temperature change, some leaves to drop quicker than they normally would. Again, only one of two pots is affected very noticeably.  Photos of the unidentified plant, its white spots and dead spots:        Photos of the citrus plant:      And the overview of pots (affected and unaffected respectively):     You can see the outline of the old soil in the affected pot surrounded by new soil. The other pot is in the same position, but has soil on top to cover it up, so it's not visible. "
2327,What is this shrub and has it come back from the dead?,"We had this deciduous shrub in our lawn for many years. Its height was about 1.5m - 2m. This photo is from a couple of years ago.     Strange thing is that this spring it seemed to have died. We reckoned to return that area to lawn. I cut the dead plant right back to its stump (thinking to remove that later) and turfed over the remainder.   Not long ago I noticed fresh growth from the stump. Is the full shrub now going to come back from the dead and be good as ever?   And can anyone identify it (either from the old photo, or from the new shoots?).  Here's the fresh growth (if you look closely, you'll see that the shoots are definitely coming from the original stump.     "
2328,Why are these leaves white on my plum seedling?,"What in the world are these? This is my plum seedling and he is pretty small, but all of his other leaves are large and green. However, he hasn't grown any proper leaves in a while, and all he's putting out are these white ones all clumped up. It looks like a flower but it isn't (and also it makes no sense given his age). What's going on?  He is on a south-facing window, so I think he get enough sun. I have other plants on that window and they don't seem to be suffering. I water it when it gets dry to the touch. Could that be the issue? Do plums need more water? Is the soil type wrong maybe? This is just generic indoor plant soil.   I live in Canada.     "
2329,Is this a chili disease or just bad treatment?,"Some days ago I found out that my chillies had some kind of small worms-looking things. Probably thrips or something else.

After that I added also added fertilizer, since some of they looked like it was time to get it.  So now I wounder, are all these spots consequences of all up and down last week, or could this be some kind of virus?  ""Bacterial leaf spot""?  24th of April, looking really good:    Then the 4th of May I sprayed them, after I had sprayed the plants:  The top of the plant turns black, the leaves get just sad, dries/curls and dies.

2330,Family pool on lawn all summer - what can I do to help the grass underneath recover?,"Like many families with children we have a large (15 foot) inflatable paddling pool taking up part of the lawn for the entire summer period (roughly May to Oct).  When we pack away the pool, there's naturally some serious damage to the lawn underneath.    But after about a month, and if October and November are at all warm, the grass starts to recover a little, starting with the outer part of the circle.  By May the following year there's quite a good recovery (just in time for it to be squashed again). Are there any steps to help the grass survive the pool and/or recover faster? For example:   tougher grass species applying feed anything else?  "
2331,How to grow purple yam from the grocery store?,"I bought some purple yam from the Asian supermarket. I think they are true yams because there's laws for correct labeling of yam versus sweet potatoes.     Cut open one end to show you the purple flesh inside.    My question is how do I grow new yams from these? I've been reading some online articles and I'm hearing some confusing information:   One website said you you can use small tubers. From the pictures, I don't believe I have any tubers.  One website said all yams in USA are actually sweet potatoes because they can't grow in USA. So they suggest to grow like sweet potatoes by submerging half in water to grow roots and slips. But what if this was imported from another country and this is a true yam? Is the growing process different? One Youtube video said to cut an inch off from the end that has roots and put the roots pointing down into soil. Then cover with two inches of soil. Looks like I only have one yam with two tiny roots. How would I be able to grow the ones without roots? No one really mentioned how to water them as they are growing roots. Do they like moist soil or drenched soil?  "

""We"" plan to build it out of mafia block (see below). A slope will intersect the face of wall perpendicularly, and cover it diagonally from  one corner to the other (other diagram).   The plan is to create a substantial footing out of 3/4"" crushed stone, and to have a 3' wide drainage space behind the wall - also filled with 3/4"" crushed stone.

2336,White ring of pus forming around branches,"I have attached a picture of white ""pus"" like growth at the base of branches on my redwood tree.     I looked through the posts talking about white fungus growth on trees. But I am not able to diagnose if this is the same thing. Can anyone please identify what this growth is and how to heal this? This plant is very dear to me and I really don't want to see such a magnificient tree dying.   Additional Facts on how I am growing the tree: The tree is about 3 years old and ~17 inches tall. It is planted in a 2 gallon pot. Should I repot into something bigger or wait till the tree gets a little bigger? I water it well every 2-3 days and I live in sunny Southern California. So it receives sufficient sunlight year-round. I used good potting soil and I supplement with fish fertilizer (which has strong nitrogen content), as redwood trees like nitrogen rich soil. "
2337,"In general can hardwood cuttings be stored, and how?","I've been experimenting with various cuttings taken during the winter (so hardwood cuttings). I've had some failures: taking from plants that (I now know) don't propagate well from hardwood cuttings, or simply having &lt;100% success rate with cuttings that 'should' work. I also had some encouraging successes.  One thing I'm uncertain about is how to store cuttings, if that's possible at all. So far I gather the cuttings I take in a bundle wrapped in a damp cloth, then bring that in a dark cool place to overwinter until I'm ready to stick them in pots or in the ground. Since they seem inert, I don't water them at all, but I notice that by the time I revisit the stems and cut them to appropriate sizes to be stuck in soil, the cloth and stems are both pretty dry. As noted, some have worked, some have not, so I'm unsure of how good or bad this method is.  So, how can I store hardwood cuttings, if at all? Should I be watering these inert cuttings over winter, and if so at what pace or moisture level do I want to keep them? Should I put them in the freezer wrapped in a damp cloth or dry cloth? I've heard of sticking them in buckets of slightly wet sand and keeping that sand slightly wet and in a cool dark place over winter but haven't tried that yet. Does storage depend a lot on the species or are there general rules of thumb for all hardwood cuttings? "
2338,How can I propagate mint?,"I bought some mint twigs from the supermarket, and I needed only a few leaves. The rest of it was surplus, and I didn't want to throw it away. Knowing that mint is an invasive plant, I assumed it was hard to kill and could reproduce from basically any part of it, so I tried to put the twigs in water to see if they would produce roots. After three days, most of the twigs appear to be dry and dead. A small number of them, however, till have some leaves that appear healthy, so I still have hope. No roots though.  I have two questions:   Is this a possible way to propagate mint? How do you get mint, considering that the plant does not give seeds? I know that you can look for runners somewhere, but I don't know where, to be honest.  "
2339,Is it worth paying the extra for F1 hybrid seeds?,"These days, the seeds on display in garden centres are usually a mix of F1 hybrids and traditionals. And F1 seeds are invariably priced a quid or a couple of quid extra.  My question to expert gardeners is: when is it worth paying the extra money for F1s? Or rather, given that (I assume, for most of us) our time, energy and effort is more valuable than a few extra pounds spent on seeds, when is it ever not worth paying extra for F1s? "
2340,what to plant after daffodil dies out,"I have a large fields with daffodils.  After they dies out, weeds grow in the field. I am thinking about what can I grow in between the daffodils while the daffodils is active or in the field after daffodils dies out.  I guess that I can just grow annuals in the fields after daffodil dies out? Of course there is a short period when the yellow foliage from daffodil is visible.  But that's OK to me, I am mainly concerned with weeds dominate the field in the summer and fall.  I was thinking of growing other perennials (which bloom in summer/fall) in between daffodil. But it looks like daffodil grow earlier and quite tall and will shield sunlight from the other perennials (which starts growing later). The field is densely populated withe daffodils.  When daffodils falls down to the ground, they will likely cover the other perennials, So growing other perennials in between daffodil may not be a good idea.  I don't want ground cover plants like hostas. It's just green plants.  I'd like colorful flowers.  So looks like my  option is to plant the seeds for annuals after daffodils is completely yellow and falls down to the ground. so I have to plant fast growing annuals.  The field is very large, buying annuals is too expensive. Start seedling in pots looks too much work.   My search yields these annuals: Marigolds Zinnia 4 o'clock stock sweet asylums  Ideally I'd like annuals that are fast growing from seeds, blooming in summer/fall, fragrant and deer/rabbit resistant.  Any better suggestions?  Thanks. "

2343,How can I safely keep snakes away from the compost in a community garden?,"I managed a small community garden with a small orchard and farmland. Lately, there are snake sightings in one of my cold dead leaf compost (the snake is a juvenile Ptyas mucosus). Apparently, the damp, dark and earthly-smell compost environment attracts worms and bugs, which in turn attract some frogs and geckos and in turn serve as the food source for snakes. The compost bin is in a location where many people could get nearby for farming.   I have already reminded the people, and discussed with my boss, the possibility of changing the compost to a hot one or relocate the compost bin farther away from the farm. Besides these, what can be done to discourage the snakes from coming and to ensure the safety of people?   Please suggest ways that do not change the basic functioning of the community garden (e.g. must keep on doing composting). Perhaps something  non-toxic that can be added to the compost to give a smell that deters snakes?  Some photos of different angles of the garden are shown below (the photos were taken a month ago after a typhoon with no farming activity started):       "
2344,How many mint seeds should you plant?,I received a package of 50 mint seeds. They seemed small so I just planted all of them in a wide 10 liter pot.  Was that too many seeds in too small of an area? How much is too much?

2346,What is wrong with my acer (and can I save it?),"I got given an acer about this time last year, and put it in a pot because I didn't have anywhere ready to plant it. It did fine last summer, and looked good in the spring with new leaves coming out, but then the tips started dying back (colour going out of the stems and leaves dropping off), from about the middle of April. I tried cutting the worst affected stems back, but it has continued to spread. Now most of the leaves are wilting or look like they are dying. I'm in the Midlands in the UK. I have been watering it through drier spells, we've just had a week of quite a lot of rain.  Is it verticillium wilt, or something else? Is it a goner, or is there something I can do to save it?  picture of my unhappy acer  Edit: Still looking for an answer on this, although by a few days later basically all the leaves had shrivelled up and dropped off. I think it is most likely dead given it's late spring/early summer here. But I'm still interested to know what caused the problem, whether I need to clean the pot up before using it again (and what to clean it with), and whether there are certain plants I should avoid putting in the pot if it's a disease that can be transferred between species.

2347,"Do herbs & spices need dark time, in order to develop flavors and nutrients?","When you grow cannabis indoor, it is considered beneficial, to have lights turned on up to 24h / day, during the ""grow"" phase. While this would prevent blooming, it is beneficial for building plant material.  When you grow spices and herbs, such as rosmary, savory, thymian, parsley etc., wouldn't it be beneficial to have the lights on 24h / day? Or do they need some dark time?  I have them in a room, which receives some indirect sun light. In addition, I have some grow lights on top of them, which are on for about 14h per day, during the day.  My idea is, to increase the lighting time to 24h / day and make use of the much cheaper night electricity price by either artificially lighting only during the night or artificially lighting 24h.  Would this be a good idea or do herbs and spices definitely need dark time? "

2350,First sweet potato crop -- Now what?,"OK, so, I just harvested my first batch of sweet potatoes:    (Holy crap, there are few things as satisfying as going on a treasure hunt in the dirt and pulling out a big ole hunk-o'-dinner!)  But...now what? I'm just a novice gardener and confess that I still don't really know what I'm doing.  Do I brush off the dirt, or will that bruise them further? Can I rinse them off and set them out to dry or will they mold?  I've read that sweet potatoes need to ""cure"" for a few weeks to let the enzymes activate and get all those good natural sugars cookin' up -- well, I don't have anywhere in the house kept at 80 degrees with 90% humidity. I can still cook em and eat em, right?  There are also a few bug holes (no pesticides, nothing); the holes aren't too deep, I can cut around them to get the good stuff. But how bad is that?  How will these keep?  Do I need to spend all weekend baking pies and chips? Lol "
2351,Building a DIY greenhouse  - where to start?,"I'd like to build an inexpensive, removable greenhouse over the back deck. The deck is approximately 20' x 8'. I'd like to build it for easy disassembly and storage in the summer.  I've never seen anyone attempt to cover their deck with a removable greenhouse. Are there some issues I should consider in planning a project such as this.  I'm looking for suggestions for the covering. Does it matter if the covering is clear or would it work better if it was green tinted or semitransparent? I'm also considering using Tuftex clear corrugated plastic roof panels. Is a viable option?  Any recommended resources pertaining to this would be greatly appreciated.  Additional info: Although, topically overcast and rainy we currently have about 9 hours of daylight. I live in ""USDA Hardiness Zone 8a-8b"" where the average low is 20°F through 10°F. Snow is unlikely and minimal at 0-3 inches in a year. High temperatures for the winter and spring would be in the low 40°F through 70°F.   As for orientation of the deck, the long axis runs east-west.  Here in the Pacific North Wet (as I call it, instead 'West') an abundance of rain seems to harm some of the plants, especially the tomatoes. Just the act of covering the tomatoes in the fall season seems to greatly extend their lifespan. In fact, I've got six tomato plants covered on the deck that are still producing and tomorrow starts the first of December. It is getting cold enough though that I have to pick the tomatoes green or yellow and let them ripen inside. I'm guessing that if I were to cover them in a greenhouse, it would produce an even better outcome.  Purpose for building a greenhouse over the deck: - Cover six large plants of tomatoes. - Keep the herbs through the cold, wet winter seasons.    (Example: rosemary, thyme, basil, mint, lemon balm, lavender, green onions, etc.) - Growth of a late fall produce    (Example: lettuce, spinach, etc.) - Shelter flowers - Grow starts in the early spring - Ability go out on the deck without getting cold &amp; wet.

2352,Is it too late to top this cayenne chili plant?,"I'm trying growing out chilies for the first time (well, first time from seed, last year I bought some and aphids obliterated them after one happy month), and I'm having some mixed success.  The cayenne pepper has been growing much faster than the hotter variants I've planted. The plant looks happy enough, but the stem is quite thin and for a while it needed some support. I've read that lanky growth is sometimes caused by too much fertilizer promoting leaf and vegetative growth too early, so I cut back on that. I can see a sturdier stem with cellulose forming, but as a window plant I would be afraid to take it outside for a few hours on a good day, as I am not sure it would withstand any sort of wind.  This is what the plant currently looks like (just repotted). It gets all wobbly when moving the pot:   It has been started exactly two months ago (28/02/2019), which, in hindsight, considering how much sun the UK-midlands get, might have been a bit too early, but I was very eager (or was I?).  I've been looking at what I can do to thicken the stem and make the plant stronger. I've since removed the supporting stick and the cloth binding it to it (I've seen on this site somebody comparing support to an arm cast - your arm feels weaker when you remove it).   The one technique I've found used, especially on young chillies, aimed at promoting stronger stems and bushier growth, was topping (example with pictures). All the examples I found showed great glorious success. However, all of them were done on somewhat younger plants than mine, suggesting to top just after the first fork appears. However, my cayenne already made a second fork by the time I found out about topping, and it's putting out flower buds (better seen on the close-up below).  My questions are as follows:   Is it too late to top my chilli?  I am leaning towards ""not too late"" here, and while doing it, I'm also considering trying to clone what I cut off while topping, as suggested in this discussion. (I think it's one of those things which will hurt me more than it will hurt my chili).  As I literally just repotted it, I would first give it 2-3 days (or more if needed, but the previous times it recovered after a day) for the repotting to take, and then top it. If I am still on time, where do I top it?  My options here are:   Top below the red arrow (second picture), or at the thinner red arrow to leave an extra node. This is the ideal height around which I would like it to ""bush"", and it is below the first fork. But it means cutting quite a lot of things off. Top at the purple arrows (on the same picture). This would be topping below the second forks. But it is quite high up the plant, and I am not sure if it would get the stem sturdy enough to allow it to support that height.  If it is too late, do you have any other suggestions on how to make the stem sturdier?     PS: In my research I've come across this post on chilli prunning and topping, but that one is talking about prunning/topping in the spring, on old plants which have overwintered  PPS: (Bonus question) If I do go ahead and top it, I will definetely try to clone the parts I cut off - there is nothing to lose at all since I would be cutting them off anyway. Since they have flower buds on them, should I remove the flower buds from the potential clones, to allow it to route more power to the leaves and developing roots? "
2353,How long do cherry seeds store for?,"I read on this website that:     Store the jar of cherry seeds in your refrigerator for 8 to 12 weeks. Cherry seeds, and trees, require a period of cold, usually 90 to 150 days each winter.   The article concludes with planting the seeds after the requisite 12 weeks:     Leave the cherry seeds in the refrigerator until the last hard frost of spring has occurred. Plant the cherry seeds [...]   Unfortunately, my seeds are now dry, so 12 weeks will put me in early October; 150 days will put me in November.  Will these seeds survive, dry, for an additional 5-6 months? Should I simply hold them dry (not refrigerated) until I'm 12 weeks from the last frost (eg. mid-Feb)? "
2354,Help! My Song of India (Dracaena reflexa) plant is dying!,"Few weeks ago (probably 2-3), I was re-potting some of my plants. One of the patients was Song of India. The other two plants had severe root bounding. After re-potting them successfully, I started working on the Song of India. I tried the slow and tedious approach. It would take some time to explain how the plant got into that serious situation, but it will extend the question if needed (I will post it if anyone is curious). I had to re-pot as the previous pot was ugly, and I got this as an Indoor plant.  In a nutshell, the roots broke off or came off, I don't know. But the plant has absolutely no roots(at the time of re-potting). Like, 9/10 roots came/broke off, including the main root. Now the plant is dying, obviously. It has lost almost all of its leaves.      The right stem lost most of its leaves. I am thinking of cutting the right stem completely to make new buds appear if this plant survives. But I'm not sure if this is a correct decision.   Or should I cut off both the stems? But then there will be no leaf for photosynthesis. Or should I clip the leaf? If yes, how much? and on all leaves?  What should I do? It's Winter here. Not too cold, but it will get too cold in coming months. Living in New Delhi. "
2355,Overwintering pepper plants,"(Zone 7, Memphis, TN)  A friend and I are starting an organic community garden in a nearby neighborhood and are currently building up the soil and laying out plots for next spring.  This season, I grew several varieties of peppers in my home garden, and would like to donate them when we start planting out there.  But first, they have to survive the winter.  Never overwintered crops before. These are fully matured peppers, 3-4 feet high 2-3 feet wide. I figure there are two routes to go, here: either mulch the crap out of them, perhaps put up some cold frames (never done that either) and hope the roots will survive the frost, or transplant them to (very large) pots and bring them inside.  What should I do?  Edit: They're in raised beds, which I've read are automatically a few degrees warmer, and there's room for a good foot, foot-and-a-half of mulching (leaves, wood shavings, etc). After exploring the site, my gut right now is to harvest all the peppers before the first frost, trim the plants back to their main stems, mulch hard and throw up some cold frames. Does anyone have any experience with this? Is it worth all the effort? "
2356,Can I save this dire-looking plant?,"Last summer, a plant has been offered to me, supposedly unkillable.  However, I am not one to back away from a challenge, and a winter later, it looks quite dead to me.    However, there seem to be a sliver a green left, so I wonder if I can try and save it.    Is it possible to save it? If so, how should I tackle this? "
2357,Can I save any of this orange harvest? (probably under-watered tree),"The house I'm renting has a number of fruit trees. I'm in San Jose, CA and with the drought, it has been a challenge to give them the right amount of water while still conserving. It seems the mature orange tree is suffering with the same level of water that the larger mature lemon tree next to it is apparently thriving on.   The fruit on the orange has mostly stayed small and the leaves are starting to curl. The fruit is just starting to yellow, so I guess it isn't going to get any bigger. I've already seen a few split oranges, and the rains are (hopefully!) about to start.  Here's what it looks like, although I guess you can't really tell that the fruit is small.   I'm wondering, is there any way to nurture this puny fruit through to harvest or am I too late? (I'm expecting much of it to split as soon as the rain really starts.) Or is the tree so stressed right now (as evidenced I think by the curled leaves) that I should just remove all or most of the fruit anyway?   Some other potentially useful info - the soil in the yard is not great (a lot of clay), although again, the lemon tree is doing fine. There has also been a lot of squirrel activity, and some specifically around the orange tree, so it is possible that their tunnels have damaged the roots. (I have previously stepped through the soil by the orange into a squirrel tunnel.) "
2358,What is this clumpy 20-30 cm high yellow-flowered plant?,"I never noticed this plant in my garden. Now I see it in several places. Is this an aggressive invader? Or a well-behaved wild flower?

2359,What is the name of this tree and is it dangerous for our daughter?,"We have two identical big trees right behind our property in Southern California that just started dropping their pods and seeds into our yard and we're having a hard time to keep our two-year-old daughter from tasting them. I've spent the last hour or so on Google and various tree identification websites, but I can't for the life of me (or my daughter?) find out what this tree is called so I can check whether it is poisonous. I don't even know why this is hard, since the seeds alone are quite unique and should provide a lot of good keywords for a Google search: It has 3 seeds per pod. The seeds are very black and covered by a bright red waxy skin.  Here is a picture of the leaves and pods lying on a letter sized sheet of paper (the pods are about 3/4"" wide and the leaves around 4"" long):    One of just the seeds in the pod:    And here is the whole tree:    The only thing that I've found that has even remotely similar looking fruits is the Ackee, but its fruits are much bigger and the skin is a white flesh, not red and waxy.

I also have a feijoa tree that does not look so poorly, but hasn't sprouted any new growth at all since it has been planted.    This is in comparison to a nearby feijoa tree that gets the same amount of sun and rain, and was also half destroyed by a fence falling on it, yet is sprouting leaves and buds.

2361,Trying to save orange tree -- pruning and general questions,"I've been undertaking a campaign to save my orange tree and have made some progress. I live in Arizona and wasn't adequately watering it before, but have since mulched around the tree and deep water it more thoroughly.  I've also fertilized it and I think I see some improvement (at least haven't seen it worsen), but I have some more questions on things I might be able to do to help.   Pruning the dead branches/twigs that are still on there. In this album you can see there's a few larger branches (first picture: the one starting on right, curves over left, is entirely dead) and some smaller ones (second picture) I planned to remove.

2362,Can you save seeds from Zolushka potatoes grown from true potato seed (TTS)?,"I'm wanting to grow potatoes that don't have any genes for cytoplasmic male sterility. In other words, I'm wanting potatoes that fruit like tomatoes (they actually do exist), productively, so I can grow them from seeds instead of tubers.  I know you can buy Zolushka potato seeds (TTS: true potato seed—not the same thing as seed potatoes) at Park Seed. However, I don't know if the resulting plants have a chance of having cytoplasmic male sterility or not. Do they? Do they fruit? That's my question. I mean, buying the seeds is worth much more to me if I can save my own seeds every season or two.  Additionally, if you know where I can get some other kinds of TTS that don't carry a cytoplasmic male sterility gene, feel free to let me know. I see that Joseph Lofthouse has a landrace he's working on, with TTS. I don't know if he sells seeds, though, but I could ask him. It sounds promising, anyway. "

2365,Can I use herbicides in flood conditions without harming good plants?,"In Arizona, USA, it is monsoon season, meaning that our dry, arid, and rainless state suddenly gets a lot of rain over the period of about two months. This sort of flooding is perfect for spreading seeds and germinating weeds.  My yard has horrible drainage, so when it rains, the yard becomes a flood pool two inches deep, including around our fruit trees and non-weed bushes. Optimally, the solution is to hire a landscaper to fix this drainage issue (it isn't good for the house, either), but right now my finances cannot afford it.   Problem: The monsoon is sprouting all the weeds.   Question: What can I do?  I feel like my only solution is to futile hoe the entire yard every week.  I am worried if I put down herbicide spray or pellets, the next rain will make the yard a pool again, diluting the poisons and spreading them to my non-weed plants and trees.   Another way of approaching the question might be ""Herbicides are rainproof, but are they flood proof?"" "
2366,Can indoor mint grow all-year round?,"I'm growing mint in a flowerpot, and it's been growing fine all summer but now it seems to be fading a bit, some leaves turning yellow/brown and falling off.

2368,Improving soil for grass,"My lawn is slowly being taken over by clover, I would be ok with this if the clover and the grass embraced diversity, but instead there are patches of one or the other.  I understand clover likes soil with low nitrogen levels which probably explains the voracious spreading.  I also understand it replenishes nitrogen back into the soil.    My question is,  if I let the clover take over, and let it naturally replenish the soils nitrogen level, will the clover recede once the nitrogen levels rise?  I am ok with the next year or two (our first kid was just born) letting this process happen, but only if I know I can eventually get back to grass with little effort.  I am not ok letting the clover consume my lawn if in a year or two I need to rototill and reseed everything.   Is this approach ok for someone who doesn't have a lot of time to focus on his lawn?  If another approach would be to get nitrogen back into the soil, what is a good method?  I went to starbucks twice and got big bags of used coffee grounds and spread them over my lawn (pre clover attack) but judging on the current situation, I don't think it did much.  "

2370,Pruning tips for Vietnamese Coriander/Mint,"Recently picked up gardening again and started with a small but diverse range of flowers,herbs and vegetables. The last time I did gardening was back in the 80's I have been educating myself as I go along and already controlled a outbreak of Green looper caterpillars. So might be green(not a bad word here)  in certain terminology. The main point is these plants have been with me for about 2 months and getting established.  After the insects signed a peace treaty I started pruning some of the basil plants and even some of the thyme. The results have been awesome with the plants growing back with renewed vigour.   The Vietnamese mint/coriander(Polygonum odoratum) has been growing nicely but getting a bit tall and not as bushy as I would like. In my mind there is a fundamental difference between Basil and Vietnamese mint as the mint does not branch as much as Basil. The mint seems more like a true mint even though it is not a mint at all. Thus creepers instead of branching out.  I been searching on google on pruning tips for the Vietnamese mint but its either in Vietnamese or very light on details.  So in a nutshell.   Any specific pruning techniques required for the Vietnamese mint? In general pruning seems to help the plant by removing the dead/sick/infested parts of the plant and this mean the roots can use the extra energy to produce better growth. Is this theory valid for all plants. I tend to prune every 2-3 weeks and not heavily just take some tips away to ensure the plant does not grow tall top heavy and yields less than I would like it to. Is it too much or too little? Most advise mention a couple of weeks and a couple in mind is 2... 3 is a crowd but I am just pedantic at times.   Any pointers would be appreciated. "

I've read that I can treat the leaves with something (ie. qtip with alcohol, neem oil, etc), but I work 7 days a week and that's impossible considering all the leaves of all the plants I would need to treat.

2374,Does peat moss negate the effects of perlite?,"I am repurposing a fire pit into a raised garden bed. From my readings, it seems like the popular soil mixes for raised garden beds include peat moss, compost, topsoil, and vermiculite. I have the first three ingredients, but I am lacking the vermiculite. However, I do have a bag of perlite laying around. Since perlite aids in aeration while peat moss aids in moisture retention, would mixing the two together cancel their respective attributes?

Anyway, I ordered some Leonotis Leonurus seeds (about 50) online and I plan on growing them so I can use them for their psychoactive properties (they are completely legal where I'm from). However, from what I've heard, the effects of the plant are quite mild when compared to other plants such as marijuana. The chemical that makes Leonotis Leonurus psychoactive is called leonurine.  My question is, how can I breed Leonotis Leonurus plants to create more potent (more leonurine, so stronger psychoactive properties) strains? Would I need special equipment? Would I need other plants? Would it take a long time (3+ years)?  If what I'm trying to do has already been done with other plants like marijuana, surely it must also be possible to do this with Leonotis Leonurus. "
2378,How can I ensure a crop of potato seeds?,"Background:  I did an experiment where I put the cut seed potatoes directly onto a live lawn, and then covered with 4"" of premium bark mulch. The plants did exceptionally well, and I noticed that a large number of the flowers successfully set fruit. I have an estimated 450 fruits.  Questions:  I would like to save the seeds, and try to start some new varieties (just for showing off).    How can I make sure the fruits don't drop? What differences should I look for when the fruits are ripened? How do I store the seeds?   Pictures:     Update:  As of 8/8/14, the plants have dropped the fruits, which are darker, more purple, and they have started drying out. The seeds inside are still soft and white. "
2379,Japanese Maple Prognosis?,"When I bought my current house 2 years ago I inherited a beautiful mature 8' tall Japanese Maple (probably planted soon after the house was built in 1972).  From outward appearances it seems to be vigorous and healthy. Here's a winter picture showing the structure.    At some point, probably over a decade ago, the prior owners removed a large limb low on the tree but rather than pruning at the collar they left about 8"" of stump protruding.        I've had other things on my mind, but finally got around to really examining the tree and noticed the branch stump seemed to be rotting, so on advice of a local arborist I cut the stump back to the collar, where it should have been cut.      The rot extends deep into the tree.  An 8"" screwdriver went in with no resistance.  That means the rot extends into the main trunk heart wood but I can't tell how far it has spread there.  Question: Is the tree doomed in the near future, and is there anything I can do to preserve it or prolong its life?    Should I be doing anything to prevent accelerating damage, such as fill the hole to prevent water from entering, etc? "
2380,What's happening to my cactus? Why is the base of the cactus drying?,"The base of my cactus seems to be drying. I water it once a week. I bought it 3mos. ago. Just recently, I have seen some whitening at the base of the cactus. It was small at first but it grows bigger and bigger. I dont know what to do since it is my first cactus.  I always put it in sunlight every morning and get it inside immediately when the sun is starting to feel so hot or when the clock ticks 10am. Please help me.   What's happening to my cactus? Why is the base of the cactus drying? "
2381,Dangers of powdery mildew,"My neighbor has a medium sized tree right against our common fence that had a bad case of powdery mildew, so he decided to cut it down today. We have plants on the other side of the fence, and a lot of the powder was in the air, and a few of the branches fell on our side of the fence, spreading even more of it.  Should I be worried about effects on other plants?  We don't have the same tree, but we have a lot of other trees and veggies, including a Goji plant that gets something similar.  Also, is it dangerous to be around the powder?  We both wore masks while he was cutting it.  I sprayed the area with water to wash it off the fence and plants - hopefully that was OK.  Our weather has been sunny and hot lately, if that matters.  Thanks for any help or suggestions.  "
2382,"Can I plant rhubarb roots in mid July, in Michigan?","I am new to growing rhubarb. I live in Michigan and it is mid July. I found some clearance rhubarb roots and decided to give them a try. Can I plant them now, so they will come up next year? Also can I start them inside until they get bigger and then plant them? "
2383,A list of obtainable plants that need very little light?,"I have just moved into my new flat. And again, I'm noticing that plants make the difference between a place feeling rather dull and dead or being nice to hang out at.  So here is my central question:  Can somebody provide me with a list of plants that grow with (very) little light?   This is not the darkest apartment, but it's not exactly sunny, either.  More specific details:  I'm particularly interested in plants that would grow in my bathroom, which only has a small (maybe 8 inches high, 1 foot 6 inches wide) indoor window that  admits some daylight which comes from the wall with all the outdoor windows across. Of course, humidity is high in the bathroom as well, so the plant should also be ok with that. On the bright side, it's not too cold there/ I could keep it a little warmer - wouldn't want to keep it tropical though, to be honest.  Since this is not a purely theoretical question, the plants you mention are required to be somewhat obtainable through normal outlets.  Some people might now scream ""Oh noes! No plant will ever grow in this dark cave harboring you and thoust will perish slowly"", but somehow, my hopes are still high about the plant growing part...  I'm thinking about moss, so there is at least some plant that might make it in my bathroom.  But I also can't shake the hope that there must be a couple of other plants used to growing in darker forest places below thick branchwork, where it might always be quite dark.  Any ideas?  Edit: I would also be glad to hear what problems the respective plants might entail (any particular bugs or hardships in keeping the plant from wilting off etc.). "
2384,Who/what is eating my mint?,"Who/what is eating my mint? What should I do about it? Can I do something organic? I had destroyed my mint a year ago by spraying a pesticide, so I don't want to go that route.   I live in Jaipur, India. The current temperature is 22-35 degree C (70-75 F).      "
2385,Little brown spots on my variegated rubber tree,  Hi  I have these little brown spots. When I google mostly the issue is with browning leaves (from the sides)  I’m not exactly sure what these are from. They were propagated in water and recently been moved to fresh soil.  Watered it-with drainage holes and a very mulchy soil.  I put it next to a south eastern window. Since it’s vairegated I thought it needed more light. (I live in the northern hemisphere)   Is it sun damage? Or something in the roots? It’s literally been less than a week with the transfer from water to soil. 
2386,What is the optimal raised bed depth for Brassicas?,"I built two large raised beds in my new garden, but couldn't manage to fill them to the top. The bottom is closed with cardboard and has a layer of prunings and hay 1-3 cm deep. I planted anyway 10 young cabbage plants, 10 kales, 10 broccoli plants. I tried to gather the compost around the points where I would put the small plants. In their actual state, they have an available depth to root of about 7-8 inches, and space on the side about 50cm.    Would that result in any problem for the plant growth? If I am to add some more soil later on, should I replant everything, or I can add directly on the top of the actual ""small mountains"" on which the plants are?   Notice: I live in Bristol, UK, and here it rains quite a lot throughout the year.       "
2387,How does removing spruce tips affect the tree health and growth?,"I recently learned that spruce tips are edible. Having an abundance of spruce growing around here I'd like to harvest some for culinary experiments.  My question is, how will this affect the trees' growth and health?  If I remove the new growth at the tip of a branch will it still be able to create new growth this season or in years to come?  Will it injure the tree? And in any case, what would be the most responsible way to harvest these tips with minimal impact on the tree? "
2388,"What is this fungus in my indoor snake plant's pot, and is it harmful?","I've had a snake plant growing indoors for about a year. Twice now in the last month I've had to remove some fungus that sprouted over the surface.  The planter is located next to a patio door, which was open (we also have a screen door) for most of the spring, but is kept closed in the summer/winter.   Is this bad? Should I get rid of the plant, or perhaps re-pot it? What kind of fungus is this?    "
2389,How can I save deer ferns after a drought?,"I have several large deer ferns. Some started to drop significantly during an unusually high summer drought in the Pacific Northwestern USA. I watered immediately and they did not perk up. They are still alive no doubt, but still haven't perked up after a dry fall. I wanted to relocate the ferns this fall and split them up. Do I have to wait now? What can I do to perk these guys up? "
2390,Transplanting Tulips from Northern to Southern Hemisphere,I want to buy Tulips in the Northern hemisphere in bulk and plant them in the Southern hemisphere.My main concern is that this will mess up their internal bio clock and result in big losses of bulbs. When would the ideal planting time of the year be to achieve this? Should I perhaps let them rest for a season to get them in sync with the climate here? Any advice would be appreciated. 
2391,Can flowers change colour after forming?,"I'm actually studying for a chemistry exam, and in the Wikipedia page for Hydrangeas, it states that      In these species the color (flower) is affected by soil pH.   So the plant evidently takes the nutrients from the soil, and depending on the pH the flower will be different colors. However me and my friend were having a discussion on whether the flower can change color after forming. For instance, if I had a red hydrangea flower, and then suddenly acidified the soil, would it be possible that this red flower change color to blue? Or would the red flower remain, and only new flowers be blue? "
2392,Should I be worried about cold snaps affecting my sugar maple seedlings?,"I have tried growing maples and this is my fifth attempt. I started vermicomposting in May of this year. It is direct vermicomposting (earthworms in the pot, and feeding them in the same pot that I will grow my tree in).  I first started with batches of vegetables without any leaves to cover them up. For several months I did this until the smell became not as strong as ammonia but definitely nitrogenous. Since then I've added batches of already fallen leaves. I haven’t given them wood at all, just scraps and leaves. I continued adding batches of carbon rich leaves until now. I tried adding nitrogen again but I got that nitrogenous smell again. I have only aerated the soil once because of the worms.  I have a mature sugar maple seed in the freezer to stratify (mimicking winter). I have had it in there since June or July.  I plan on planting it on March 21st when I know it is spring. But I am a bit worried about my maple. Cold snaps happen here in March and sometimes it extends all the way out to the end of April. But March is the best time to plant the maple. I know maples are cold hardy (and heat hardy as well, we have hot summers here, up to 100+). But I would still be worried about a tiny little seedling in a cold snap.   I once had 2 trees that survived for 3 years (I planted them from seed in 2012 I think) but that third winter was bad for those trees. My trees kept getting wounded in the winter. I used tape like a bandage but after those wounds healed, there were more wounds and all these wounds drained the life out of the little trees. How did I know? No leaf buds even in May.  The reason I am worried about cold snaps is because I know that at least for some plants, cold snaps can cut off seedlings from their roots due to the cold weather.  Should I bring the pot inside in March and then plant the maple inside by the back door (it is a sliding glass door with a screen door) so that it can get sunlight without worrying about the cold? The pot is big, definitely big enough to hold a tree for at least 3 years.  I can tell my maple apart from weeds even as a shoot. My maples have bigger baby leaves than the weeds.  The kind of maple I am growing is a sugar maple. So should I bring the pot inside and plant it in March or should I just plant the maple outside in March where the pot is now (in a sunny spot on my patio)? In either case in February I plan to get the seed out of the freezer and warm it up before planting it from seed in March. "
2393,What is the best mowing direction on a hill?,"I use a riding mower to cut my grass. My yard has a short but somewhat steep slope on one side.  The instructions for my lawn tractor say to only cut up or down a hill, not across it, but doesn't explain why. The mower can make it up the hill but it's clearly struggling and I'm worried about needlessly stressing the powertrain. Is there some technical reason I can't mow across the hill, or are they just worried about the mower tipping over?   It seems like it would be a lot easier on the mower to go across it, and I'm confidant it wouldn't tip over, but I don't want the engine to seize up or something else dramatic. Does it make a difference if the engine is splash-lubricated or has a pressurized oil system (and if so, how can I tell?). "
2394,What is the best way to over-winter bananas?,"The new house also has a couple of banana trees! What is the best way of over-wintering them? I am in USDA Zone 8a and we've just started to get frosts.  From the research/asking around that I've done, it sounds like there are two main approaches: dig them up (like dahlias in the UK); or cut them down and cover them up with leaves or burlap.  One tree is pretty small - less than six foot including leaves. The other is much taller - well over 12 feet with leaves. This latter one is already showing signs of frost damage and it is also too big to dig up - and even the smaller one might leave a large hole (I don't know how big the roots are).  So covering them up sounds the best approach. How far should I cut them back? To ground level? To a few feet? They're pretty hefty: Is there a recommended way of doing this? Time to sharpen the hatchet, or learn how to use a machete?  (the latter would give the proper tropical feel to the exercise!) It might seem an odd question, but is there a particular way of burlap wrapping? Multiple layers, or just string &amp; sacks?  I'm assuming they are a hardy variety of banana, but I really don't know if they are plantains or sweet bananas. The large one would imply they've been over-wintered before but my experience in Costa Rica is that bananas can grow very fast in the right conditions.  Although it would be very cool to have fruit, I think I'm resigned to them being purely ornamental plants - I understand they require a frost-free winter before they will have any chance of producing fruit.

2395,Do wattles have the same ability to fix nitrogen from air as other legumes?,"Do wattles (roughly Australian Acacia species) have the same ability as other members of the Fabaceae (legume) family to fix nitrogen from air via symbiosis with soil bacteria? For instance, it's well known that peas and beans do, but what about the more tree-like legumes?  It's not a completely academic question for me. I'm wondering if planting wattles would be a useful way to gradually improve the surrounding soil by adding nitrogen, while being a chance to plant native species.

2396,How can I get rid of these bugs on my African violets?,"I had two pots of Saintpaulia (African Violet). They've been doing pretty well, lots of flowers, and breeding! However one of them has starting having bugs. When the blossoms open up, there are one or more of the three types of bugs. I've been trying to kill them with a cotton swab dipped in white spirit/ alcohol, it's helped a lot in reducing the bugs, but still there are some. I was observing my other pots, and they were all fine, until the other one had some flowers recently and I found a few bugs there, as well.  These brown bugs are the largest among the three that I see:    The second type is the white, small bug, I know there are lots of white spots on this picture, but not all of them are bugs! Just a few. They're pure white, with pure white limbs! Very small.    The third type that I don't have a picture of, is yet another brown bug, but long and thin, as if it's a very thin, narrow piece of stick, or just a thin thorn.   Is there an efficient, easy, home-made solution to this issue?  This is how the overall plant looks:    And this is the baby pot born from my other pot. They seem to be doing good, as well; but I noticed the leaves seem a bit curly. Is this also a bug/fungal, or is that normal?   "

2399,A single large sunflower among herbs - a good or a bad idea?,"My idea is to start no less than a giant sunflower ('Titan', I plan just a single plant) on the northern border of my small herb garden with thyme, salvia, arugula, parsley and such.  The reason is to attract polinators, and add some vertical accent in that area. Also, to tease the curiousity of neighbors ;) haha.  Sun light will not be a problem! The sunflower's shade will be on the opposite side, which is a path and a wall anyway. I could also cut some sunflower's leaves that are too low. But what about underground? Can all the roots coexist? I have a feeling that something is wrong with this idea. What do you think? "
2400,Should I do a soil test before or after amending soil?,"I want to plant blackberries, raspberries, and a vegetable garden in the heavy clay soil in my backyard. So, I plan to heavily amend it by spreading 3"" expanded shale and 6"" of compost and working that 12"" or more down by double digging.  Since I don't know this soil's history, I think a soil test is a good idea so I can learn what other deficiencies I need to correct via fertilizer or pH adjustments. Should I send in soil samples before or after I amend the soil? And if after, how long do I need to wait after mixing all the soil up?  I don't think it matters for this question, but I live in a suburban house around Dallas. Zone 8a. "

This is a new method. It is a fungicide that kills and controls aphids, mites, whitefly and I think a few other problems.  It is a Bio Pesticide (not to be confused with safe).   "
2404,"When trellising pumpkins, do I need to fertilise more heavily?","This year I decided to try trellising my pumpkins and am wondering about the impact this might have on the fruit, since the vines won't be putting down roots as they run.

Is this even needed? I'm not looking for huge fruits, but will still be limiting vines to 1 fruit per vine. "
2405,Young saplings in winter temperatures periodically,"I noticed a few days ago that the young saplings started unfolding their leaves already(except for the one in my pot outside, maybe frozen soil is preventing the growth of leaf buds for that sapling for now). Night temperatures have been below freezing while day temperatures have been above freezing. The trees are sugar maple, white oak(i think so at least), and elm(not sure at all what kind). I am in Columbus Ohio.  Is this normal for the leaves to start unfolding on saplings before the last frost? Is this freeze thaw cycle corresponding to day night cycle in March not a problem for saplings unfolding their leaves or is it a big problem with the potential of having the leaves frozen off? No new branch growth yet. "
2406,What is this whitish feather on my Echinacea seedlings?,"My multicell container with Echinacea seeds was covered with a transparent nylon cover for several days, and I just removed it, and spotted an unusual thing. Take a look at this white stuff in the middle of this seedling:    There were three seeds in the cell - each seed was just placed on top of the soil and lightly patted. Two other Echinacea seeds that didn't start (yet) are visible in the photos as having paler brownish color.    Is this normal? Or some kind of fungal infection caused by excess moisture? If yes, is there a cure?  The exact name of the plant in question is Echinacea angustifolia.    Update after 5 or so days:   the ""feather"" seems to disappear after several spraying of water (that I must do in order to maintain the soil moisture) I added a very small quantity of soil to this cell to provide better support for seedlings seed, that had been lifted a bit by the root the same cell looks like this now:      the same cell but from different view angle:      other cells:       Update: I started a couple of seeds of a different Echinacea, Echinacea purpurea, and there is that same 'feather':        It looks Echinacea seedlings do have this fine hair, but, for example, I didn't see any traces of such hair in Rudbeckia seedlings (Rudbeckia is a close relative to Echinacea).    Update:  I noticed the similar, even stronger, effect in my Lupinus seedslings:     "

I have some lettuce and tomato seedlings germinating in this soil. Soon I will need to move them to a bigger pot.  Can I use the same seedling soil (plus fertilizer?) for growing the vegetables, or will I need to buy a different kind of soil? If different, is general-purpose ""flower pot"" soil suitable and safe for growing vegetables? "
2408,Mixing Alcohol Solution for Paperwhites to Prevent Legginess,"This year's order of Paperwhites came with the advice to make a 5% solution of alcohol (drinking and rubbing both work; the latter is much cheaper!) in water, and use that once the stems are 1-2"" high to prevent legginess. I'm willing to try but want to be sure I'm mixing it right (since too much alcohol is bad for paperwhites as well as people).  I am using 70% rubbing alcohol and I want 16 oz. of 5% alcohol. I think I do the math like this:  .7x = .05 * 16 x = (.05 * 16) / .7 = 1.14   So I need a little over 1 oz of rubbing alcohol (approximately 2 Tablespoons plus another 1/4 teaspoon), plus enough water to make 16 oz.  Is that right? And has this worked for anyone else?  Here is the research link (thanks to @kevinsky): Ginning up a better paperwhite narcissus "
2409,Are the yellow leaves on my Massangeana due to root rot?,"I bought my Massangeana (Dracaena fragens) 15 months ago, and he's be doing really well. Started off with a few burnt ends, but I switched to filtered water and he was good again.  In the last couple of weeks I've noticed some leaves have suddenly turned yellow.  I'm not sure if this is root rot or something less serious.  I've tested the trunk of the plant with a finger nail and it's still firm (not mushy, the bark doesn't scrap off either). Also, I've tried pulling gently on the yellow leaves and they're not falling away. They're very limp compared to the green leaves, but they're not falling off.  This plant is particularly personal to me and I'm desperate to save it. If it is root rot, I'm under the impression the plant is pretty much done for, but I wonder if there's a chance I can grow a new plant from cuttings?  Or equally, does this plant really look and sound like it's got root rot (pictures below)?  Really hoping someone can help me.  Thank you so much in advance.  Click to enlarge   "
2410,Understanding tree rings and estimating the age of this tree,"Our neighborhood is filled with oaks, and I have at least 6 or 7 on my relatively small property (~0.3 acres).  I've always wondered how old they are, and if they pre-date the house or not (this house is just under 20 years old).  My neighbor recently cut down one of her oak trees due to disease (I don't know the details).  It was similar in size to mine - some of mine are smaller and some of mine are bigger, so I figure its age is a rough average for the age of my trees.  I checked the recently cut cross-section near the base of the tree, and while I can clearly see some rings on the inside, they are only distinct for about the inner third of the tree.  I've successfully ""aged"" other trees like this, so I'm not sure what is going on here (the lack of discernible rings doesn't seem like it is caused by the chainsaw).  In case it helps I'm in North/Central Florida.  Upon further inspection: The original and very indistinct photo of the tree was from when it was freshly cut down a week ago.  I just took another picture today and the outer rings stand out substantially more, although now I'm more confused.  Some sections in the middle are still very indistinct, but the outer rings appear substantially larger than the inner rings.  Is this normal?  I could understand differences in age/climate making tree growth more favorable, but it appears to be a factor of 2 or 3 difference, which makes me wonder if these outer rings are something other than annual growth rings.  Presuming that the large outer rings are normal annual growth rings, then I think I can find at least 30 distinct rings.  There are areas where there are obviously rings but I can't see them, so I'm guessing it is about 40 years old.  Any guesses as to how old this tree is?  Am I ""interpreting"" it properly?   I've also embedded the pictures below, but doing so required shrinking them.  The above links will take you to the original, higher resolution images.   "
2411,How do I grow Snake Plants from seeds?,I bought about 300 Snake Plant (Sansevieria) seeds as they ship better than full plants typically.  I've been having a lot of trouble getting them to grow and have found very little information on doing it optimally as every resource assumed you have access to a fully grown Snake Plant.  How much water ?  How much light (lux) ? 
2412,What features should I look for in a fertilizer spreader?,"I have been asked to purchase a fertilizer spreader for someone as a holiday gift.  I'm completely lost as to what features are worth extra money and what features are not.  The recipient has an approximately 10,000 square foot lawn and about half of that is currently completely under leaf cover and very shaded.  The other half is grass.  The terrain is flat in parts but steeply sloped in others.  It is quite bumpy.  I believe the spreader may be used for spreading seed as well as fertilizer.  I see spreaders with pneumatic tires get raves, but is that overkill for residential use?  Would simple plastic plug tires handle bumps and slopes just fine?  What are the pros and cons of a broadcast versus a classic drop spreader?    Is there benefit to the bigger hopper sizes that will hold enough fertilizer to cover the lawn without refilling, or does it make sense to go with a cheaper model that requires a refill part-way?  Are there any features I should consider that aren't on this list? "

2414,"Tips to help an ash tree, trying to grow from the roots of an EAB victim","Two years ago, emerald ash borer struck my region.  I and several of my neighbors made the tree services rich, taking down the trees before they came down on their own and causing damages.  I lost three trees total (although I gained 2.5 cords of firewood).  Of those trees, one of them was special.  All of them were covered with little D-shaped holes, all of them had pieces of loose bark, and all of them had few if any leaves on their lower branches.  But that one had much better bark adhesion, and many more leaves in its upper branches.  Further, there are now a few saplings growing around that stump- they are full of leaves and almost 4 feet (1.3m) tall already.  I've convinced myself this tree was of hardier stock than the rest, and possibly genetically pre-disposed to EAB resistance.  I want to encourage that.  While I burned out the other two stumps, I've left this one, and would like to give these saplings the best chance to make it.  I started this April with an Optrol (Imidacloprid) soak, and will continue each year.  What other steps should I take?  Among the things I am wondering:   Should I pick one sapling and focus on it, pruning back the others?  Would this allow that one to maximize use of available nutrients and moisture?  Or would it be better to wait a few years and see which ones do best on their own?  Or would it be best to let it grow as a multi-tree? The stump.  It is maybe just larger than one foot (0.3 - 0.4m) around and the same in height.  The saplings are sprouting right at the edges of the stump.  Should I cut it lower, cut it away from the edges of the saplings, leave it alone, or other? This year, some blue-white shelf-shaped fungus grew on the stump.  Should I do anything about that?  Does this change the answer to the above?  "

2416,How to manipulate a cactus with thick long spines?,"I'm thinking of buying a cactus. Shops have a lot of those and one of the variables is the size and density of spines. Cacti with rare huge spines (something like 15 millimeters long and about 1 millimeter thick) look appealing, but I wonder how practical such cacti are to manipulate.  For example, if I want to transplant one - will I need some super strong gloves that won't be pierced by the thick strong spines or will any gloves do?  How to manipulate a cactus that has thick long strong spines without harming hands? "
2417,Can I plant sod over a drip irrigation system?,"I've pulled out some plants that we don't really like, and we're trying to figure out what to do with the space of land. I'm thinking the easiest solution would be to go out and buy a few pallets of sod and just pack it down to extend the yard space.     My question is, what can I do about the irrigation lines? I don't want to pull them up, since they're pretty extensive and would likely cost several $100 to replace if we needed to. I'm not sure if drip irrigation is enough to water sod though?  If it's not enough, we can replace the heads on our sprinklers at the edge of the bank so that they spray 180 instead of 90 degree (currently they're only spraying the existing sod) and increase the length of time they're on -- so that's not an issue. If we go that route though, can we just lay the sod on top of the irrigation lines, or do I need to pull them up and cap them off somewhere before laying anything down?  The sod I'd be laying is St. Augustine. I'm in Florida, USA. "
2418,Fixing bad shape almost dead shrub,"I live in Pacific Northwest and since last summer, I didn't take care for this guy:    Now it looks very bad shape. I guess lack of sun is part of the problem.  What can I do NOW?   How should I care for this one moving forward? "
2419,What should I do to keep my peppermint plant alive?,"I decided to buy a small peppermint plant to have in my room this year.  I put the plant in a new pot with additional soil and I've been keeping it indoors for most of the time in a place where it has lots of sun (I live in Spain) and I've been watering it when the soil dries (I read in the internet that this is the right way to water it). It seems that something is going wrong because the plant is not very lively and it's turning a bit yellow in some zones.  This is the current status of the plant:    Also I've been encountering very little flies around the plant, is this normal?  This is my first gardening experience and I don't know what I'm doing wrong. How should I take care of the plant? "
2420,Safe Weed Killing in a lawn,"My question is this :  Given the type of Grass I have as pictured below and all these different kinds of weeds I have - what kind of weed killer do I need to use to kill the weeds and promote the grass to grow.  I know if the weeds were something I wanted to grow they would for sure be dead, and if I wanted the grass dead for sure I would have it growing everywhere as the only green thumb I have is in how to grow weeds (and for those of you thinking to be funny - that is weeds with an S ).  1: I do not know what kind of grass I have so I am not familiar with what kind of weed killer I need to use in order to allow the grass to still grow. I do have a picture... below.. see that single beautiful green blade (yeah I know it is a rare beast in my 'lawn'.    2: I do not know what kinds of weeds I have but I have pictures - I know one is a dollar weed others I don't know..        Dollar and Others??   StrangeGrass  "
2421,Training Japanese vineberry,"Context I have been growing this Japanese Wineberry (Rubus phoenicolasius) for 2 years, and it was already 2 years old when I bought it. See annotated image below. I have usually pruned it by removing the ""old wood"" canes in late summer, after they have fruited, and training the ""new wood"" ones onto the fence support that you see, to prepare them for the fruit that comes on then in the following year. The fruiting shoots of the plant come off the main cane in early spring, and flower in early summer.   Question: I would like to train the plant into a permanent frame (a bit like you would do with climbing roses onto a wall); this would create a set of permanent canes, which become increasingly ""woodier"". Would fruiting still happen from side shoots of these main branches? Will the tips still grow and allow me to shape these canes even further? Will this weaken or reduce the new canes? Should I still keep these?   "
2422,Can young sunflower transplants take a light frost?,"I realize that sunflowers can grow easily from direct-seeding, but to get some earlier sunflowers, I thought I'd try starting them early (since I've heard that works well, too).  I've heard that sunflowers can be sown up to two weeks before the last frost (although they recommend after the last frost if your season is long enough), but what about transplants? Is the same true for them, or do you definitely want to wait until after the last frost to transplant them if you want the plants to survive? I'm just wondering if the young plants can take a light frost. "
2423,What are the scratch marks on the undersides of my tomato fruits?,I am seeing scratch like marks on bottoms of my tomatoes.  What is causing this? Possibly chipmunks? I have tried eight solutions with no results.  
2424,How to reduce leaf size on Ash bonsai,Five years ago I asked here about ways to train this ash (Fraxinus excelsior) seedling into a bonsai.  The little ash bonsai has now grown and it's in his 4th year. See the photo below. Any suggestion on how I could limit leaf size at this stage? Or should I leave it to grow to its final trunk/branch shape first?   
2425,What should I do after a tree removal and stump grinding to prepare for grass?,I recently had a large tree removed and the company also did the stump grinding.  They covered the hole with the mulch from the stump.  My question is what should I do next considering I am wanting to eventually seed grass in this area?  Should I remove the chips or let them sit? 
2426,Can I just apply less of a higher fertilizer?,"I'm wanting to apply 10-10-10 to my blackberries. 10-10-10 and 13-13-13 costs identical for the same quantity bags.  Since those numbers are just percentages, and in this case they are in equal ratios, can I safely apply the 13-13-13 instead of 10-10-10, and just apply 75% of the amount instead?  Why don't they just sell 33-34-33 (e.g. adding up to 100%), and people use very small quantities? Seems more economical than shipping useless filler. "
2427,In which part of the fridge should muscaris (grape hyacinths) be stored?,"I put my muscaris in the part of the fridge where I store fruits, but I heard that some people store them in the freezer where it's much colder.  However, won't the freezer freeze them to death? Which one is better? "
2428,"Growing healthy, bushy, dark green redwoods","I’ve recently planted some redwoods (coastal redwoods).  I’ve noticed that some redwoods in my area (Sacramento) are gorgeous, dense (thick with branches), and are dark green.  Others in this area are skinny, straggley, and lighter green.  I very much want my redwoods to be the former.  But how do I make that happen?? "
2429,what fruit tree rootstocks can grow in very shallow soil?,"I own some property close to Owen Sound, Ontario, in Canada plant hardiness Zone 5b.   The land is mostly a hardwood forest with rocky soil and maple, paper birch and some other hardwood trees grow there.  There is a cleared section in the middle that I would like to grow some fruit trees if possible, but unfortunately, in many places there is no soil (rock is exposed) and the deepest I could dig anywhere was about 1 foot.  are there any fruit trees I can grow in such a shallow soil? If I decide to make a say, 24 inches raised bed over the stone, will any fruit tree grow there?  In local climate the temperature can drop to -30 - -40 deg Celcius.  Thanks  EDIT: as promised I am giving a couple more pictures of the hard  bedrock exposed. I went there digging with a pickaxe but I could not dig more than 12 inches before hitting bedrock anywhere.  My next plan of attack would be to go the raised bed route.      "
2430,Is my ginger stem too thin?,"  I placed my ginger indoors beside a window, and they started growing. Some grew really fast, and some hardly at all. Why is this the case? Also, are their stems too weak/thin? I used a pair of wooden chopsticks to support one of the stems as I was afraid it would break. Do I need to add compost? I have been using potting soil all along (for the past two months). "
2431,I've read that composting can reach up to 140 degrees - does this affect my plants?,"I plan to do approximately a 1'x1' curved ditch between my garden rows filled with wood chips, and manure, will this make the plants get too warm, or will it keep the soil cooler like cover crops do?? "
2432,Why is there concrete buried across my entire backyard?,"As I was planting a few fruit trees last weekend, I discovered an odd and very annoying phenomenon. About 6"" down from ground level, I ran across a 2"" layer of really crumbly concrete/gravel mixture. Beneath that was clay for as far as I dug. The dirt above the concrete layer was slightly better quality topsoil.  I found this in every one of the holes I dug for the trees, which spanned a length over 60' about 10' away from my privacy fence. (The trees were dwarf fruit trees, hence the closer spacing. The recommended separation between trees was 15'.)  At first I thought I discovered some sort of massive French drain covering the entire backyard. But when I looked closer, I realized it wasn't just gravel - it was actually crumbly concrete. Does anyone have any idea why this was in my backyard? And will it significantly affect the trees I just planted? "
2433,What to do with these black-eyed Susan seedlings?,"I started black-eyed Susan seeds ten days ago: (I just sprinkled tiny seeds over grid-type container filled with ""soil for flowers"" from the supermarket)      You can see multiple new plants in almost all cells. The cells are 5cm x 5 cm (2 inches x 2 inches).  Should I:   choose the strongest in a cell, and remove the rest? but when? try to transplant surplus seedlings in a separate container? leave everything as is?   I am inexperienced in doing this.  The desired end result should look like this, if possible:    (photo credit: Gardening with Charlie Nardozzi)    Update - day 15  Almost all cells have seedlings. The growth is somewhat slow.      Perhaps I didn't press the soil enough, and the seedling don't like that? I am a little worried about relatively slow growth in the last 5 days.    Update - day 25  First true leaves appeared: (the hairy ones)   "
2434,What is the best way to compost a large pile of leaves with minimal effort?,"Where we live you have to bag your leaves. We have about &frac14; acre and lots of trees, so it's really impractical to bag all of those leaves. I was thinking of simply making a big pile and trying to compost them, but I'm looking for some tips.   I don't really have a way to chop them up, so if I leave them whole, what is the best way to compost? Should I cover the pile? If so what's the best type of cover? Is it worth adding something to the pile to get it started? "
2435,Can this rubber tree be fixed,The main part of my rubber tree looks like a slingshot. The main truck is 3 feet long before it splits into the 2 branches. If I cut off those 2 branches will any new limbs come out of that trunk? If so how much of the trunk should I leave?   There is some new growth at the bottom off an old limb but it is just another branch that's going to grow out at a bad angle.   Is my only hope with this plant to keep it from falling over to cut back the 2 branches? If so does it matter how far I cut them back?   
2436,Advanced care of an indoor avocado plant,"I have a 6-month-old indoor avocado plant that is growing nicely. I have cut it back a few times and it is now about 1 meter (3 feet) high:     How often and how much should I prune my avocado plant? Can I just remove the leaves from the stem's tip, or should I cut off a chunk of the stem itself? What should the size of the pot be? I had to move the plant from beside the window. Now I'm looking for a new location where it will continue to flourish. Is fluorescent lighting OK or does an avocado plant need sunlight? Any other tips from someone who has successfully grown an indoor avocado plant over a span of a few years?  "
2437,Leveling Stack Block,"I'm building a stack block wall using interlocking block. The base level went well - things are level and all the block are stable. But as I layer on additional levels, minor inconsistencies in the blocks are making them imbalanced. Some of them wobble up to a couple millimeters.  I've tried adding small amounts of sand to level the intermediate blocks. They just seems to make the problem worse the higher I go. I'm building the wall to be 7 blocks high (1st block and a half set into the ground). The problem really shows at about the 4th block, but even the second row wobbles a bit.  Will this impact the stability of the finished wall?  How do I fix it? Redo the whole thing?  Additional Information:  I'm repairing an existing wall. The wall is 3 feet high. I've dug out the wooden steps and removed the block immediately next to the steps to put in new stairs. The existing wall appears to have been built on a mix of coarse gravel and sand. Behind the wall is landscape fabric and behind that is garden bed soil (purchased specifically for growing garden vegetables). "
2438,How do I prepare my hyacinths for planting out?,"I received a couple of hyacinth bulbs in small pots that have flowered nicely, and I'm wondering what the best way to prepare them for planting out in the spring is.  They have 8 inch stalks with flowers, which are now starting to look a little weary. Should I just pop the bulbs outside now? Or perhaps plant them, or possibly even remove the stalks and just plant the bulbs? "
2439,Insect Infestation of Chinese Elm,"My Chinese elm suffers from an infestation that I am having a hard time diagnosing &amp; treating. About a week ago, I noticed tiny, rod-shaped white spots, mostly on young leaves, which spread rapidly. Some close up images (complete set including videos here):       Other possibly relevant information:    Afflicted leaves suffer quite a bit, particularly the young ones.  I've not noticed any other stadium of those insects, in particular no winged forms. That seems to exclude Whiteflies &amp; Thrips. My googling skills have not turned up any other common pests that match those in appearance.  I've submerged the tree in soap water for ≈ 30 minutes on two consecutive days: That seems to curb their population a bit, but it unfortunately quickly rebounds (within ≈12h).  I am based in central Europe.   So, my question is: What could this be and how can I treat it?  "
2440,Growing Avocado from Pit," I’m no gardener nor do I have a “green thumb”. I found this pit inside an avocado that I cut the same day that my 8yr old son brought home, what looked to be, a successfully germinated pinto bean from science class so I got inspired. I named the pit Seymour and went online. The Internet said peel the skin off the pit but there were so many white strings on it I didn’t take all the skin off. One end had a stick coming out of it so I put that end up thinking it was a tree and the other end had thick white tentacles with tiny white things on them so I put that end in the water. The white strings outside the pit were drying so I covered them with wet paper towels every day. The little white things, that were on the big white thick tentacles, were turning brown and the stick wasn’t doing anything - but the thick tentacles in the water were drinking almost half the jar of water every day and at was exciting! But nothing else was happening - Thinking I confused the ends of the pit, I flipped it. The end of the stick was dark black and dry so I trimmed it to where I could see a little lighter color dot in the middle of the stick, I took off the rest of the skin and cut off the strings that were completely black and dried up. I put the stick and the strings in the water, and the tentacles up in the air.  Still not much is happening with Seymour - He’s drinking but not as much as when his tentacles were in the water. The excitement of adding so much water to the jar every day is gone; some days the tentacles have a slight light greenish appearance as if they will start turning into a “branch” then they go back to being white. The little white dots that were all over the tentacles are dark brown.  Is Seymour slowly dying or dead? Am I confusing which end to put in the water? Or is Seymour, the seed itself, confused? I’ve uploaded some photos but I’m not sure if they added or not.  The only thing I haven’t tried is to drop the entire seed in the water - HELP! "
2441,Triage and identification for an orphanned plant,"I found this plant outdoors by a trash can, and decided to take it home. I didn't notice any infestation on it, and cleared off the yellow/brownish leaves (somewhat soggy) that I found on it. My questions - one - what is it? and two - can it be saved?   "
2442,Will chili fruit ripen if it's a bit cool?,"  I had a bunch of chilis come in around Feb/Mar and since in Auckland NZ (Southern Hemisphere). When should I harvest? It's a very temperate climate and we only got 1 minor frost last year.  Ideally, I'd harvest once everything was big, red, and ripe but I'm guessing that everything will shut down soon. We're currently getting highs of 17-18C but will drop to ~10-13(?) in 6 weeks or so. "
2443,How much water do these hydroponic office plants need?,"A large company near our office has moved to another building. We got the chance to take over some of their office furniture, including two pretty massive office plants.  Click on pictures for full size.  Plant 1       Plant 2      The point is, we don't know what kind of plants these are and how much water they need. The plants have been left in the old office for quite some time and they look a bit dried out.  I gave one of them water until the water level meter was at the ""optimum"" point (7 liter). The problem was that most of the water started dripping out of the pot and the water level dropped to ""minimum"".   What kind of plants are we dealing with? How should we take care of them? How do the water level meters work? It seems that watering the plant until the optimum point has been reached is not possible, because the pots start to leak water.  "
2444,"First time home owner, leaky basement, and a poorly graded yard.","First time home buyer here looking for some insight on proper drainage around the base of my house.  I'm looking at digging a french drain on the side of my house because water pools there when it rains. We recently had a ton of rain where I'm located and that pooling water caused my basement walls to start leaking rain water.  On top of that I'm going to grade the side of my yard away from the house to help keep the water away.  My question is: What's the best practice when it comes to grading projects? I've got fake stucco siding and I've heard I need to leave some space between the stucco and dirt, so critters/bugs don't get into it. Is that correct?  Also, would it be a good idea to throw some quarter round gravel down along the base of my house and then build the dirt on top of that? My neighbor did that and he says it's been working well for him.   I think I've got the basic idea for a french drain down, I'm just more-so looking for the best materials to use for the job.  "
2445,I live in the country and have no grass growing. My land looks like a field and I have no experience,"My land has no grass growing. Its full of stickers and other weeds. Don't know what they're called. Do I need a Tiller for the area where I want grass seeds to grow? I'm a widow with limited income, and could not afford to have that done by a professional. I only like to have grass growing just in front of my house. Could I just throw grass seed out on the area where I want grass to grow? Would it choke out those stickers and other weeds? I'm 77 years old and not in the best of health. Is there a easy way for me to get a small patch of real grass to grow and enjoy walking on it, without having those annoying stickers stuck to my shoes? Could that be accomplished? I live 23 miles going South out of Abilene, TX. Since my husband died, it has been my dream to have a always green patch of grass to walk on. You would make my wish and my dream come true, if you could tell me, that it is possible. Thank you for reading my maybe impossible dream. Sincerely, G. Hammer. "
2446,ZZ Plant in ICU. Root rot due to water. Need help quickly,"I will explain how this happened, but one stump just came out easily, and I suspected root rot. Now, I took the plant out and examined the roots and found rot rotting with the tubers rotted too.       On the first plant, I cut the two tubers(potato) right away cz I got frightened. And I washed the roots to get rid of the bad soil with possible bacteria from root rot. And I also took the liberty to remove all the rotted or rotting roots.  Now this is what is left of it:      What should I do? I am thinking of re-potting in a better soil and wait. Or should I throw away this plant or consider propagation? "
2447,Is it OK to skip watering outdoor plants in the winter in California?,"I live in the San Francisco Bay Area. In the summer, as it almost never rains here, I end up watering plants in the backyard every 2 to 3 days. In the winter, it rains more regularly. However, when it doesn't rain for periods of a few weeks in a row, should I then be going back to watering, at least for non drought-tolerant plants? Or are the plants in semi-hibernation, making watering in the winter unnecessary? "
2448,Nursing my green buttonwood back to health,"What is eating my green buttonwood? I have included pictures below to show what I mean.     I have seen what appears to be tiny black dots on the tree, but I haven't been able to get a great photo of them.  What can I do to get my tree back to good health?  The tree is planted in my yard, which is in South Florida. Thanks to the great users here for suggesting that I take a picture at night. I was able to get a good shot of the bug that is eating my tree.    I ended up using sevin spray on the leaves and I put Diatomaceous earth on the ground below the tree. I haven't seen any weevils in a few days. "
2449,Should containerized plants be periodically rotated relative to the sun?,"I have the assumption that plants grow more foliage towards the arc of the sun. With containerized plants, I assumed I could rotate it every week to help it develop more balanced foliage. Are the assumptions correct? Is rotating plants beneficial or harmful to the plant? "
2450,Can I keep this tree without it destroying my fence?,"I have an unplanned (privet?) tree growing right at the base of a fence. It's currently around 15' tall at the peak, but not particularly wide.   I don't dislike this tree, except for the danger to the fence. Is there anything I can do to keep it without it eventually damaging the fence?   "
2451,Small Baby tree growing its roots right next to the base of my house. Should I be worried?,Should I pull out the tree? It stands at roughly 10 feet tall. With green colored branches. The stem of the tree is indeed brown and wooden. I have no clue how deep the roots are. Will the roots damage my home? 
2452,How to grow an olive tree?,I would like to grow a small olive tree in my balcony. Preferably I would not like my tree to grow larger than 2 meters tall and gives me nice organic olives. Length can also be controlled by the size of the pot obviously. What do you suggest?  Edit: What are the common diseases and pests of an olive tree? 
2453,How can I choose the best wood and wax to build an interior planter?,"First post on the forum, please let me know how I can improve it before downvoting :)   I would like to build a rectangular planter, (W: 40cm (15in), L: 1m (39in), D: 20cm (7.5in)), in which I would grow grass. It will be kept in interior most of the time.  I am concerned that over time, the wood might become mouldy, and I am not sure how to design the bottom of the box (should it have holes to let water/air through?).   Would you have any advice as to which wood to choose, whether I should apply wax, and whether there is a best way of designing the bottom of the box (eg with holes, or put gravel at the bottom and soil on top)? "
2454,Are my Salvia flowers dying?,"I just dead headed all my salvias about a week ago and they aren't looking so good.

2455,What is the blossom strategy of chili peppers?,"This is my first year growing chili peppers in pots. I would like to know if chili peppers blossom constantly during their fertile growing period, or do they blossom in ""waves"" all the time or sometimes?  My peppers were blossoming nicely, but they stopped recently. They have several blossoms now (mid Jun). Can I expect more blossoms during this summer?  "
2456,How to automatically vent a cold frame during the Winter?,I am working on building a cold frame and have purchased a Univent automatic opener to vent the cold frame by lifting the lid/light.  However the Univent opener is not supposed to subjected to freezing temperatures or it will break.  That is surprising to me because it seems most people would want to use an automatic opener during times of the year that there are freezing temperatures.  Does anyone know whether a Univent opener can handle freezing temperatures?  What are some alternatives for automatically venting a cold frame during the Winter? 
2457,What should I do with perennials in pots over the winter?,"I had a small stone planter box built in to my front entrance.  In this planter I had a handful of perennials.  I needed to have my driveway torn up and repaved this year, and I thought it would be neat to have the contractor re-do the planter at the same time.  In preparation, early this summer I moved the plants from the planter into portable pots and placed these on the front porch above where the planter box had been.  I fully expected to replant them in the new box just a few weeks later.  Well, that contractor did a very bad job (I paid them for the driveway, but refused to pay for the planter, and they agreed) so I am going to have to start over with a different contractor next spring.  The plants have been in those pots for several months now.  I think some have died, but others might be salvagable.  The location is U.S., Ohio valley region.  What to do with those portable pots during the winter, to maximize the chance that at least some of them can be brought back next spring?   A.  Leave them where they are, as-is.  B.  Leave them where they are, covered with a tarp or similar.  C.  Bring them into the house. D.  Toss them out and buy all new perennials after the new planter is ready, since the damage is already done and they can't be saved. E. Other?  "
2458,How can I rejuvenate my overgrown Elaegnus & Deutzia?,"My elaegnus and deutzia bushes are 3 or 4 meters tall. They are bare for the first 2.5 meters, and above that is the foliage &amp; some shoots that appeared this year.   If I cut all the stems back to about 0.5 meters (18″) from the ground now, in mid July on the south coast near Brighton (UK),   Will I get new growth this year? What do you think the result will be next year? Should I expect any flowers?  "
2459,How much water logging and salinity can Eucalyptus trees tolerate?,"I was reading a study (Growing trees on salt-affected land) talking about planting eucalyptus trees on salinity and water logging affected lands, which can reclaim the land as farmland after one or two decades.  If I want to plant some eucalyptus trees, what is the maximum salinity and water logging in which it can grow?  Examples of salinity and water logging with increasing severity:     Flooded field      Water damaged field      Standing water in field       Water logged shoreline   Are any of these examples possible places in which eucalyptus trees can be planted? "
2460,Are woodlice eating my carrots?,"I lifted some carrots this evening. It being December these are carrots which have been in the ground some time. They're big and fat, they need cleaning up and the damage needs cutting out, but basically most of them is OK to eat.  As I clean them up I see that there are holes and tunnels, the usual with root veg which has been a bit neglected. OK, slugs, I'm thinking. That's fairly normal.   But as I work on them a bit more I find woodlice in the holes. Are woodlice a root vegetable pest, will they eat carrots, and have they made those holes? If so, is there any way to control them and keep them out of my veg?  Or are they just sheltering in holes made by other creatures? "
2461,"How can I improve the soil in a new allotment, which is covered in wild grass?","I am in the process of getting hold of a standard style UK allotment, 10 poles or about 10x25m (2722.5 sq. ft., .052 acres) The plot will be covered mostly in wild tall grasses, and is likely to have been that way at least 6 months to a year.  The plot is the Bucks area, which is South Central England and the climate is temperate.  Will wild grasses have an impact (positive or negative) on the quality of the soil and it's minerals/nitrogen? By the time I've cleared out areas ready for planting it will be autumn. I'm thinking perhaps the best thing would be to plant a cover crop, like clover, over the majority of the plot and turn it over ready for planting in earnest in spring.   Would this make sense, or is the soil as good as it's going to get (using natural nitrogen fixing methods) right now?  Any thoughts? My aim is to fertilize the soil naturally using cover crops, compost and liquid feed (hopefully from a wormery). I will be growing squashes, root veggies and salad greens for the most part. Nothing too difficult, just simple vegetables that I would actually eat. "
2462,Basil stem turning brown after pruning,"I'm a gardening beginner and recently pruned my first basil plant (about two weeks ago). I bought special pruning shears because pinching the stems took a bit of a pull, and I didn't want to harm them and thought that a clean cut would be better. I also washed the shears before using them. I'm not sure if this is normal, but the main stems have turned brown where they were cut. Those bits are also pretty dry and I've noticed some browning on the uncut smaller stems at either side of them. Is this a sign of infection due to the cut? If so, what's the best course of action? Do I attempt to cut/pinch the brown tips? Any advice would be helpful as I cannot find a similar case online.  Thank you!  "
2463,Testing Soil with rapid-test by luster leaf,"For Christmas I got one of those small kits that test the soil using a chemical enclosed in capsules. The one I got does Ph, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potash. And today I gave it a spin, and this is my results.  Ph - 7.25  N - 0  P - 0  K* - low  These results were horrible. I did plenty of video watching and review reading to find that this may not be to inaccurate? I want to know if I did something wrong here. And to help people understand what I did I listed the steps below.  1) Gather 15 samples from around my garden (it is large) and mixed it in a ice cream pale  2) Put some directly in the test tube (Ph), added capsule and filled with water to line specified in the directions. Let sit  3) mixed rest of dirt 1:5 (dirt:water) and let settle. Took the clean-ish water at top and added to test tube half way, added capsule and filled rest of the way. Let sit for 10 min  Basically all I did. I did make sure everything got shaken well so I wasn't ""testing the surface"" of the dirt.   I want to include that my dad added a few years worth of ash from the wood stove to the garden, he stopped 6 yrs ago and am wondering if that is part of the problem.   So to conclude what went wrong? What did I do or are these tests simply to cheap?   *I think this is the letter for potash "
2464,Does putting vegetables next to each other cause a conflict?,I have a school project related to farming. For this project I should grow some vegetables in an indoor application.  And let say I have to grow them in a big container in the same soil and next to each other.  Does this cause any harm at all to the vegetables?  Should I make an advanced research for all combinations?  I am planning to grow some of following plants:   Carrots Broccoli Garlic greens Lettuce Ginger Cucumber Spinach Chard Arugula   Also I appreciate if you provide any source about that issue. 
2465,Spacing for Loquat trees,"The previous owners of my property left me three young loquat trees. They are all in the same planter, and are much closer to structures (and to each other) than most advice I see online at 8' from the house and 3' from the nearest fence.  Two questions on these:   Should I remove the two smaller trees to let the biggest one have the space? Is it feasible to prune the tree(s) and keep it(them) from damaging the fence or house while still growing large enough to bear at least some fruit?   Note: The large trunk in the middle of the picture is a stump from whatever was there before. The loquats are the three smaller trunks that surround it. This is just to get a sense of scale and spacing.   "
2466,How should I protect a buried fountain reservoir from freezing?,"I have a buried fountain reservoir that cannot easily be protected from rainwater. It soon fills and at some point this winter will freeze over.  Is there anything I can put in it that will prevent it from getting damaged? Something that would prevent or reduce pressure from splitting the sides?  [update]  The pump is already out, so I am not so concerned about that. "
2467,How do you move bonsai across the US safely?,"I'm planning a move (Colorado->Virginia) at the end of June and have several bonsai trees that I need to transport across the country with me. What considerations should be made in this transport to be sure the trees have the best opportunity to remain healthy and thriving?   I have Procumbens Nana, Green Maple, Fukien Tea, Schefflera, Doug Fir, Siberian Elm and Ponderosa Pine.  Is a moving truck or trailer going to be too hot for them? Would watering them heavily and bagging them before the drive be a good idea? What else should I be thinking of?  "
2468,String drip system while summer away for 1 month,"Is it suitable to string drip while summer? I am away for 1 month in April. I have 10 pots in my garden. so I decided to create string dripping. But is this suitable? If not, then what is the best option for self watering ??   It is Mid Summer In Maharashtra.  I had chilly, tomato, rose, lemongrass, and like plants and had enough water source.  Any suggestions accepted. "
2469,How to properly germinate almond seeds and start growing them?,"I've already attempted growing almonds in my usual ""just plant and water"" way which resulted in a large pot of moldy soil and no almonds after a month, whereas all my previous attempts with seeds from other types of plants were consistently successful, and there were no mold problems whatsoever, even though they've all been growing in the same soil.  Internet says US has a problem with almond seeds where they're all pasteurized, even if labeled ""raw"", so it's hard to find truly raw seeds there, but I'm in Europe, so I guess it shouldn't be a concern.  Various sites list methods where seeds need to be soaked in water or damp cloth for several weeks or months and kept in the fridge. Some sites say the fridge stage only needs to last from 8 to 24 hours. Youtube videos show storing seeds in a jar filled with water, stored in a kitchen shelf behind closed doors (no light). I'm not sure but I think this has to do with the fact that most people don't try to grow almonds, but eat them instead, and this method gets into the search results and related articles about growing them, so this part is unclear.  Mold has been a big problem in my previous attempt, and various articles say that it's to be expected, but there is not enough information on how to prevent or remove mold from the seeds without harming them and being effective at the same time.  So my questions here are:   What are the steps for germinating the raw almond seeds? How long to soak them in the water? At what temperature (is the fridge necessary)? Is sunlight going to be a problem? How to avoid/remove mold? How can I tell that it's time to plant a seed?  "
2470,"What are these 3' to 5' tall plants from my new back yard, and how should I remove them?","I just moved into a new apartment (in Brooklyn, NY) with my own backyard. My girlfriend and I are very excited. However, my backyard is overgrown with that vine-looking-green-stuff.  My current plan is to go to Home Depot, get a pair of gardening scissors and a bottle Round Up. I'm thinking of cutting down the plants, put them in plastic bags to throw away, and spray the whole bottle of Round Up all over the backyard. I am not looking to put lawn or anything - just hard soil to put a table and a couple of chairs will be good.  Should I go ahead? It's not poison ivy, right?     "
2471,Aloe ferox or aloe broomii?,"I have this plant for at least a dozen or so years, I do not remember the source. It survived all ;) Her spines are very hard and sharp, colored at the ends in brown/red. They are on the edges of the leaves and one row also in the middle of the bottom of the leaf. It grows very slowly, recently the lower leaves began to die and the plant began to form a kind of trunk. I do not know if it is normal, whether I should worry about it, I have not changed anything in the way it was treated. Perhaps aloe has reached the age of creating a trunk? By the way, what do you think about it?  I really care about its correct identification. I think it's either aloe ferox or broomii. Maybe some other species of aloe? Help me please.       "
2472,What should I do when a courgette-plant's stem has split open?,I have one courgette plant in my bed and it seems to work well.   We just had 2 super hot days (35 C) and I just saw the the stem (which has become really dark recently) has split open very close to where the stem is coming out of the ground. It must have happened either last night (slug damage?) or during the day (heat?).  The plant does not show any negative signs as I would expect from such a hungry species even only after a short time.   Is there anything I can/need to do avoid problems?  What could have caused this?  EDIT: Added some pictures. Click to zoom in.

2474,How do you determine the viability of tomato sprouts?,"We have a handful of tomato plants from seed which sprouted before we got grow lights.  Most of them look like:    Should we just accept these won't make it? They don't look like I would think they should, that's for sure. Is there a clear way to identify when tomato plant sprouts are viable?  For reference, our pepper sprouts (which sprouted after the grow lights came) look a lot nicer and considerably less spindly. "
2475,How can I tell if a maple tree is male or female?,"How do you know which maple tree is the male or the female? Do you need both to produce beautiful maple trees?  Should I plant one of each in my sister's yard? She only wants one, but I think two would be better, one of each (male &amp; female) although I don't know which is which.   There are many babies under each, do those come from just one of the trees?    "
2476,Why do my seedlings need more and more water?,"I started Echinacea angustifolia and Rudbeckia hirta seedlings recently.  I do watering by spraying if I can see or touch almost dry soil in cells. In the begining, I sprayed the trays with water every 2-3 days. However, the need for water increased as seedlings developed! Today and yesterday I needed to spray them twice a day.  Is this expected? Do you guys have similar experiences?  The pictures of my seedling trays:  Echinacea:    Rudbeckia:   "
2477,What is a long-term solution to a goathead infestation?,"I live in New Mexico and bought house with a yard that is absolutely and totally completely infested with goathead plants (For those unfamiliar, here's what their seedpods look like--should be pretty obvious why you don't want them in your yard!).  After a week of heavy rains, here's what sections of the yard look like:    Pretty grim. Thankfully, they die in the winter, but not before growing little stickers to reproduce with that fall off and nestle into the dirt. So I think I may be able to kill them all off in a few years by simply killing the larger plants before they grow any stickers. Without a new supply of stickers, eventually the ones already in the ground should stop sprouting--I hope. Then again, they are perennials, so that may take a loooong time.  Does this sound like it will work? Has anybody else defeated a goathead invasion? I'd like to avoid poisoning the yard if at all possible because there's a lot of nice wildlife in the area. I anticipate living here for a while and can be patient about it, so I'd like to avoid simply covering the whole yard in plastic and putting gravel over it as many in the area do. "
2478,What are these orange spots on my fiddle fig plant?,I've just noticed some orange-like spots on one of the new leaves on my fiddle fig plant. I water it once a week or whenever the dirt is dry. It sits in my window from morning to evening time. Is this a sign of something wrong? What's going on?      
2479,Morning vs Evening Sun?,So I am going to be planting some flowers into a few flower beds in my house. The sun essentially rises in the back of my house and sets in the front. So this gives about half/half as far as sun goes (With the south flowerbed getting slightly more sun since it's not up against the house).  Should this matter as far as partial/full sun? I'd imagine each side is getting at least 4-6 (Which is considered full sun right?) or should I go with plants that can mainly do partial sun.  (BTW plants that need full shade won't be totally screwed over if they get 4-6 hours of sun but spend a good amount of time in the shade right? Same thing for Plants that need full sun?) 
2480,How to avoid fungus in a rainy season?,"Last summer I decided to grow a tomato plant but I didn't know how to take care of it properly. After 2 months, it had caught early blight fungus. Since I am an amateur gardener, it took me a while to realized that it was fungus and in the mean time other plants were infected as all pots (i grow plants in pots) were adjacent to each other. Some plants such as parsley turned brown (nor early blight) whereas curry plant started to dry out.  I read that one of the main reasons of fungus is overwatering. But winter is around the corner and this time I want to avoid fungus (lesson learnt). What measures should I take to avoid fungus? I can think of the following:   Separate pots from each other. Do not overwater plants. Should I cover the plants when it rains for a whole week or more? Seaweed to cover the soil?  "
2481,Are unmulched leaves any good for my tree?,"I have an old Silver Maple tree in my front yard. Can I just rake the leaves to a bunch under the tree trunk, without mulching?  Will it have a similar fertilizing effect to mulched leaves, or will it just be frozen garbage during winter/thawed garbage during spring/dead lawn patch during summer?  "
2482,"Is this white fluff on my indoor grass bad for the plant, people, or pets?","For our cat, we have some grass in flower pots on the windowsill. I don't have the package with the seeds any more, it said something with cat grass.    On some of the blades, there is some white fluffy stuff:      The soil is flower soil from the hardware store. I try to water the “plants” every day but sometimes forget. Sometimes they had a little too much water and were sitting in a little puddle that got soaked up eventually. The pots are directly next to the convection heater.  Is this something to worry about? Does it cause any health problems to us or the cat? Is there something that one can do against this? "

2484,Radicchio/Chicory from Seed,"I am growing radicchio from seed for the first time and am worried about its germination.   Should I start the seeds in soil or soak them first? Also, would it be recommended to place the pot under grow lamps indoors during the germination period or only after they have sprouted?  Finally, if I would like 18 plants to grow successfully, how many seeds should I plant?

2486,What is the problem/disease that causes bobbly peach tree leaves?,"What is the likely cause of the bobbly forms on the leaves of a peach tree? Does it matter or is it just some natural anomaly that doesn't affect the tree's health? If is it a concern how can it be treated?  The tree in question is about 1m (3 ft) tall, so not very close to maturity yet.  On the left is a bottom view of a bobbly leaf; on the right is top view.  UPDATE: Further to the question, can anyone give information about how leaf curl is different when cause by a virus (e.g. Begomovirus) instead of the Taphrina deformans fungus which is apparently the much more common cause? And how would treat it differently?    "

Do you guys know what are the goods and the beds of each plant when you compare them? Which can you recommend? I am interested the most in their wildlife value, but also in all other aspects of growing them. I live in zone 8a, my soil is clay, and I have all kinds of sun exposure places for them. "
2488,Why have my yews lost all their needles?,My yews lost all their needles this winter (I'm in New Hampshire). I planted them 3 years ago and this is the first for this. Will they be ok? Will the needles grow back? I hope so- I really do love them. 
2489,What type of tester works best for measuring soil pH?,"I want to measure the pH of soil in my potted plants (especially for the dwarf citrus trees that I just bought).  I've seen many different options: expensive laboratory-grade meters, cheap digital meters, analog meters, pH test paper strips, and so on.  What type of meter works best for home gardening?

When should I apply GrubX?  I have lots of moss in some areas and dandelions have been growing.  When should I apply a weeed&amp;feed product? "
2492,UPDATE: Is there a tarragon lookalike OR can tarragon be flavorless?,"I grew some tarragon this year, but didn't have the opportunity to use it until a couple weeks ago. However during harvest I didn't get the licorice smell, so I crushed it and still no smell. I chewed a tiny bit of it between my front teeth and spit it out, but it tasted like plain green leaf, like grass.  Did I get a tasteless lookalike or did I somehow not give it what it needs to have any flavor?  When I say tasteless, I mean there was no way to tell at all that this wasn't just a tasteless weed.  For all other intents and purposes though, it sure looked just like the tarragon I used to grow years ago. Maybe I'll take a picture tonight and add it to the question.  New update 3/30/2016:  Ok so after last fall's discussion and this being a new spring, I did my research and made sure that I would get French tarragon for my herb gardens this spring. I was looking for sources for plants but all the nurseries are saying not for several more weeks. I am thinking to myself why? It is supposed to be a cool weather plant, but ok. So I go to Home Depot, by some root hormone and off the the grocery store where I can buy fresh sprigs of tarragon. I buy to boxes giving me about 20 sprigs to play with as cuttings. I put them in a bucket of water to make sure they can get rehydrated after being in a plastic tube for too long...the next day they look chipper. I get to cutting them up and defoliating the stems and I thought, I'll try one of these leaves and feel good about that nice anise flavor.  No taste, again. Ok maybe a touch of taste, but not at all what I remember and this time from a sprigs sold as French tarragon in the produce section of the grocer for use in food. Listen I am not looking for an herb that's as strong as licorice candy, that's not the problem, the problem is I can barely tell if these leaves have any anise taste at all to them. I even balled up several leaves and chewed them up...nothing.  So now I am getting frustrated. And I am looking all over the web trying to find some hint of why, and I run into something I hadn't expected.  In this question and the comments to answers, I mention tiny yellow flowers. Well when I found pictures of Russian tarragon flowers, well they didn't look all that tiny, and to be quite honest they didn't look anything like the flowers I remembered. So I looked at some more tarragon flower pictures until I found what I had...it looks like what I had been growing all those years ago, may have been Mexican tarragon which is actually a variety of marigold. That explains why I was able to grow nice flavorful tarragon from natural reseeding. It also explains why I was able to grow it all year long even in the Florida summer. It is considered and acceptable substitute, but that really leaves me wondering. That tarragon was very strong licorice flavored, and none of these artemisia tarragons seem to have any flavor at all.  Am I missing something here? Should I really be looking for Mexican tarragon for the real tarragon flavor? That kinda throws me for a purist loop.  Update 3/20/2019 -- Haha, I forgot about this question. So as it turns out, I helped Stop And Shop discover they were getting russion tarragon delivered as french tarragon. Once that was solved and they got a new shippment in, I was able to produce the cuttings I mentioned above. They've lived in pots the last two years and were put in the ground next to my foundation on the south facing side of the house this past fall. I am hoping they made it through the winter so I am not rooting out cuttings from the grocery store again. "
2493,What kind of sunflower is the best for making a flute?,"Probably like many other gardeners, I like and plant many kinds od sunflowers - I've got many dry sunflower stalks from the previous year, and I would like to do something useful and creative with them.

2495,Why do blueberries need acidic soil?,"I know that blueberries need soil in the range of ph 4-5, but no one ever says why they need the pH in that range. I've heard that it may be because of a lack of available iron at higher pH, and that other plants emit acidic in their root zone to create iron that they can use. So is it all about the iron? This chart of nutrients avaiable by pH is also interesting...it looks like the only nutrient available at low pH is iron. But if iron is the limiting factor, it looks like it is available up to pH 6.5. So why the pH 4-5?  "

2498,How do you deal with disposing of bougainvillea branches?,"I have a number of overgrown bougainvilleas that were hit by frost damage last season.  As such they have a lot of unsightly, dead branches on them.  This spring I plan to do a severe pruning, but I'm dreading it.  Bougainvillea's have some nasty thorns on them, end even when doing some simple trimming, I'm always covered with scratches, and the toxic nature of the thorns make my skin itch for some time.  They are also a royal pain to get into trash bags as they simply shred them if you aren't careful.  What is the best way for dealing with disposing of a lot of bougainvillea branches without looking like I tangled with a pack of angry cats?   [edit] I should clarify. severely pruning back the bougainvillea's will create a lot of very thorny branches, often quite long ones.  When I have trimmed the plants in the past, I ended up doing a lot of cutting the branches into smaller, more manageable pieces so that I could shove them into trash bags.  I'm not looking so much as to how to keep from getting cut up, although the suggestions are great. I'm really looking for an idea of how to dispose of the branches.  How do people that have dealt with a very large amount of these thorny branches deal with them?  They don't compost well as they are.    Perhaps could I burn them?  I know I can't do that with plants like oleander because of the toxic nature of the smoke, but what about bougainvillea?      "
2499,"What soil quality is now, after staying under a pile of grass clippings for a year?","I left a pile of clipped grass on my lawn, of diameter and height 2m, untouched for a year. It shrinked significantly, but it is still of formidable size, and it is almost like compost now. I am going to move it elsewhere.  But what is the condition of the soil beneath (under) that pile? Would grass grow again, or weeds, without my intervention, once the pile is removed? Is that soil richer or depleted now?  It used to be fairly rich lawn soil. "

2501,How should I overwinter Kaffir Lime indoors?,"This spring I bought a small kaffir lime plant (too small to call it a tree yet) for future use of the leaves in the kitchen.   It spent a happy summer in his pot outside, but now winter is approaching and it needs to be moved indoors.   We have literally decades of experience with a common lemon tree, but that specimen is so large, old and hardened off, it lives outside unless night temperature threatens to drop below -4°C (25°F). I don't trust the kaffir baby to be this resilient yet, so it has to come inside soon.  I will provide the brightest, yet coolest spot available, possibly supply additional lighting, water carefully and generally keep an eye on it in case it brought any pests inside that escaped close examination. It will be moved outside whenever weather permits - especially during frost-free periods.   Question: Are there any special requirements for a Kaffir Lime that are different from a regular lime? What would be a reasonable temperature threshold, given the fact that it is only about a foot high and still in a smallish pot? I know that mature lemon trees in Italy occasionally get snowed upon and so did ours without any ill effects.  To give you an idea about size:    "
2502,I want to lower the pH of my soil around my blueberries without changing the pH of the entire bed,"I've got 3 Jersey blueberry shrubs planted in my greenhouse, in the ground.  They are 3' wide and 2' tall, producing berries nicely.  They'll be bigger in the years to come but this year I planted squash in the soil between them that are very healthy. The blueberries are showing signs of nutrient deficiency (rosy colored leaves) I'd like to lower the pH (it is 7 in this bed, the rest of my beds are 6.5) just around the blueberries themselves.  What would be some ways of doing this?  Can I use a very diluted amount of vinegar.  If I lower the pH to 6.5 just for this year will that be O.K.? What is a good compromise that satisfies both plants? What other vegetables enjoy acidic soil? "
2503,Are there downsides to planting in fall in Northern California?,I'm a new homeowner and need to replace plants in our lawn in Northern California). Is it okay to plant now or is there a reason to wait for Spring? Is the main difference flowering? Will plants root and survive now?

2506,Is there an easier way to aerate my compost besides turning it?,"I want to be a good composter, but turning my pile is backbreaking work.    I was looking through a gardening magazine today and I saw a contraption that was basically a three foot long pole that had 6"" arms that fold in along the side when pushing in, and then expanding out when you pulled it out.  The idea is that you just plunge it in and pull it out a bunch of times and blammo - aeration.    From Double Winged Compost Aerator  Do these types of things actually work, or do I just need to stop being lazy if I want to aerate my pile? "
2507,Dark green patches on aloe vera,"I’ve had this aloe vera plant for about seven years. Three years ago it became too big to keep indoors so I moved it outside to a shady spot. But each winter, I bring it back inside. It’s warm again so it’s time to get the aloe back out. I moved it outside three days ago after I was confident that there wouldn’t be any more frost. And these dark patches cropped up.  The patches have more than doubled in size since they appeared yesterday. There were no patches before it went outside. When inside, I would water it once in about 4-6 weeks. It got a good soak the first day it was out; more than what I’d normally give it.  Is it sun damage? Was that last water too much of a flood? Maybe I need to repot again? Could it be these dark patches are healthy? Someone please help! "
2508,Should my spruce tree roots be covered?,"  This Norway spruce's roots have always been on top of the ground. The soil it is growing on is very hard white dry soil with a layer of decayed needles on top. It has been growing fine so far, but would it be healthier if I covered all the exposed roots with topsoil? I do not know if this would harm the tree.  Edit: I added five wheelbarrow loads of dirt. Can I grow grass there? "
2509,How to combine watering and fertilising of Bonsais,"I have read in many places that one should not fertilise a dry soil, so I apply my liquid fertiliser after watering. But because I water my trees up until water is dripping from the drains, as soon as I start applying the fertiliser, water starts running down through the drains, so it feels like I am only wasting the fertiliser.   In sum, I should not fertilise a dry soil, but if it is not dry, it feels the fertiliser doesn't stay in the soil. So is there an optimal schedule to fertilise and water bonsais? For example, only fertilise one day after watering? Or maybe I should ignore the first 'rule' and fertilise instead of watering (since it is diluted in water anyway) when fertilisation is due? Or maybe liquid fertilisers are not ideal, and I should buy solid fertiliser? "
2510,Help identifying cause of yellowing fruit tree leaves?,"thank you for any insight any of you might provide.    I have four fruit trees in my yard, a Red Haven peach planted in Fall '17, a Liberty Apple and a Ginger Gold apple planted in Spring '18, and a Mericrest Nectarine just planted in Spring '19.  I live in zone 6a and have moderately sandy soil.   Starting a few weeks ago I noticed that the peach tree had yellowing leaves, especially the smaller inner leaves.  Given that we have had a very wet spring, about 18 inches this spring and 4 in May, (rainfall this spring) I have barely been watering the trees.  None of my other plants (azaleas, hydrangeas, etc) seem lacking for water.   Can anyone tell me why my leaves are yellowing?  Too much water? Too little water? Nutrient deficiency?  Some kind of infection?    Thanks again for any input.   Here are some pictures of what I'm talking about:  Red Haven Peach:  You can see the yellowing leaves as well as somethine eating the leaves I think on the peach tree.     Mericrest Nectarine  The nectarine tree seems to be doing well, but is now starting to yellow as well.   Apple trees  Again, starting to yellow on the inner leaves.   "
2511,How do I prevent raccoons from eating my corn?,"This harvest I was not able to pick a single corn cob.  Some large animal(s), I suspect raccoons, got to them before they were ripe (I would find peeled and gnawed corn littering the lawn and the corn stems bent down when I got home).  I had crushed garlic all over the garden.  This kept the rabbits away, but was not effective against the large animal.  I am looking for a solution that does not involve putting a fence around my garden patch.  Are there plants that raccoons are repelled by?  Has someone tried prickly plants to make the patch unattrative to raccoons?  I am told these are very intelligent animals, so I think the solution will have to be a mix of good ideas. "
2512,How can I kill English ivy?,"I'll be moving to the Seattle area in a few weeks and am starting my garden planning. The house we're buying has a small, shaded front yard with a large tree in it surrounded by about a ground cover of a few hundred square feet of English ivy.  Living in the Northeast, I've always hated the invasive pest that is English ivy. I'd like to replace it, probably with another shade-tolerant ground cover--I'm thinking of trying lingonberries, but I'd even prefer pachysandra to the ivy--at least the pachysandra won't climb my walls and poke through my basement windows.  The first step, though, is removing the ivy.  Short of (1) digging through the whole patch pulling up every piece of root and throwing it in the trash, or (2) soaking the whole yard in glyphosate every day for a month, is there any way to get rid of the stuff?  It sounds like ivy doesn't like alkaline soil--would digging it out and liming the soil stop it from coming back? And if so, how quickly could I then dig in some sulfur to get back to a low, lingonberry-friendly pH?  If possible, I'd prefer solutions that would let me dig up one patch at a time, so I'm not left with completely bare soil (and an invitation to weeds) until I get the whole front planted with something else. But with how fast ivy spreads, I know that might not be realistic.  So who's done it? Who's killed off their ivy, and how did you do it? "
2513,Why do my pumpkins develop rotting black dots after harvesting?,"I have bought a number of pumpkins from a gardener. I'm storing them in the basement at about 12°C (54°F).   A couple of days ago, most of them started showing small, rotting black dots that grow rapidly.  Early stage:    Advanced stage:     Out of interest  - where do these come from? Were the pumpkins stored at too cold a temperature by the previous owner? (We've had really cold nights the past few weeks.) Or was 12°C too much after all? I was told that was the temperature to store them at, but I didn't check.   Is there anything I can do except cut out the rot, cut the good parts down to pieces, and store them in the fridge until it's time to eat them? (I guess the answer to this one is ""no"".)  "
2514,Bonsai not shedding leaves in autumn,"I have a chinese elm bonsai plant. I used to keep in indoors for the winters, but this year we have moved and I don’t think we’ll have enough sunlight during the winter inside the house, so I decided to leave the plant outside for the winter. The plant was outside from the spring. Now the autumn is in full swing and all the trees here are almost without leaves, but my elm doesn’t seem to shed its leaves at all. This troubles me, as the temperatures will drop soon and the tree can’t stay outside with the leaves still on. What should I do? Should I take it inside? "
2515,Is this the air-cleaning fern?,"I found numerous suggestions for plants that clean the air in this question.  One of the plants mentioned is the boston fern. I have many ferns growing in our backyard, and managed to cultivate a few quite easily. However, I'm not sure that it's the right kind of fern. How can I be sure? Is this, in fact, the boston fern?   "
2516,Tomato leaf veins bloated and white,"I moved some tomato seedling to their own cups from their starting cells (seeded two plants to a cell) about three days ago. I noticed that some of the leaves on the plants are curling in and on closer inspection it looks like some veins on the leaves look white and bit puffy. Seems to affect a bit of the stem as well. I’ve been growing them inside til now, have started hardening them today. This seems to be an issue with maybe a third of the plants  Is this an issue and are there any steps I should take to deal with it? Should I isolate them from the healthy looking plants, pinch off leaves, etc., or is it just overwatering or shock?     "
2517,How can I pack my potted plants for moving (across the US)?,"I'm faced with moving across the US soon.   As my climate zone will be changing, some of my outdoor potted plants will have to become indoor plants. However, I would like to take as many as possible with me.  How can I best pack plants for travel? I have a mixture of sizes: some are in 6"" pots and some over 7' tall (I'm particularly concerned about the latter), with several dozen pots in between. Maybe techniques are different for each.   How can I keep the soil intact and not making a mess of my truck and other belongings? Are there clever techniques for keeping plants from getting crushed? I'll likely have a moving truck and my car. "
2518,How to understand if my tree's roots are girdling,"Some time ago I planted the dwarf (M27) apple tree shown and described in this question. At the time of planting, I am afraid I didn't dig a very wide hole, just twice the lateral size of the pot in which it came in.  Also, the soil here is very heavy clay, therefore I am seriously worried that the tree's roots might be girdling in the future, just moving in circles in the clay ""prison"". The tree is grafted on a dwarfing rootstock M27, and when I planted it (1 month ago) it was 2-year old.   What are symptoms that can tell me if the roots are girdling? Is there anything I can do to actively check? And what would be the best season to do that?  "
2519, Is it a good idea to build a paver patio near a large established tree?,"I would like to build a paver patio next to a large tree that has a 3"" wide root at ground level.  I do not want to damage the roots of the tree, so it seems like my only option is to build a raised paver patio.  If I do build a raised paver patio what material should be used for the perimeter? I assume the roots will be a problem when building the perimeter, for instance if I need to bury the perimeter 4"" deep how do I deal with roots that may only be 1"" deep?  Am I putting the tree at risk by burying the surface roots under a patio?  I've considered building a raised deck instead, but I would really prefer a paver patio.  Are there any other options for dealing with a situation like this?  Thanks for the help.  Edit: I believe the tree is a New Zealand Christmas tree.  It's 20'-25' tall.  The patio would be about 5' away from the trunk. "
2520,Do these watermelon plants show signs of mosaic virus?,"I salvaged and planted three watermelon seedlings a few weeks ago after my, somewhat flimsy, greenhouse blew over in a wind storm. The seedlings seemed to be thriving in their new homes, but this past week they have taken a turn for the worse. As can be seen in the following two photos.        tl;dr;      Do the two photos of the watermelon plants show signs of either tobacco mosaic virus or cucumber mosaic virus?   Note that the second photo has a red circle around what appears to be a white soil fungus. This fungus was not present before this morning but is now at the base of two of the three watermelon plants. I'm not sure what this fungus is, but I did notice it on some of my other transplant's peat pots.  But back to the mosaic virus, I've noticed and removed winged aphids and ants carrying aphids on the watermelon plants. I've read that aphids and thrips are big spreaders of mosaic virus. Which is why I have been spraying a watery mixture of Dyna-Gro neem oil and Dr. Bronner's unscented pure-castille liquid soap every seven days, since before the seedlings were transplanted. I've also occasionally used food grade diatomaceous earth to try and curb the ants, I don't want to kill the good insects though.  Also, one of the watermelon plants has a fissure in the stem running from just above the soil to the first set of leaves. As seen in the following photo, which also shows a closer view of the white soil fungus mentioned earlier.    I think this was caused by a pest, either below ground or above it, but I was wondering if this kind of fissure could be caused by a period of under or over watering?  My main question is, do the first two photos of the watermelon plants show signs of either tobacco mosaic virus or cucumber mosaic virus?  Note: I'm not familiar with the proper tags to use, or if you think I rambled too much, please feel free to edit my question. "
2521,"Just *how* hardy are leeks, kale and brussel sprouts?","I'm wondering if these plants will last another two weeks to Thanksgiving.  I live in northern Vermont and the gardening season is well over.  We turned over and composted the beds, and have had many frosts by now.  Yesterday there were the first snow flurries of the year.  We took out most of the plants other than kale, brussel sprouts and the leeks and have been enjoying them right up to now without any apparent problems. But this is the first time the ambient air temperature has been around freezing during the day (upcoming weather below).  As we transition from fall to winter, will these three vegetables be ok for another two weeks?  And if not, what is the best way to try to make them last to thanksgiving?   "
2522,What insect/disease causes lemons to look like a Cthulhu and how can this be prevented?,"Earlier today, pictures of weirdly shaped lemons were shared on reddit. The top comment there says it is a case of citrus bud mites, which actually seems to make sense.  My questions are:   Is this really the cause of the deformation or could it be caused due to other non-insect factors (similar to blossom end rot in peppers &amp; tomatoes)? How can one prevent this from happening/attacking (if possible)? Post attack/occurrence, how can one control this insect/disease? There is a comment on that thread that describes an organic solution. Does that seem reasonable? Are there other/better alternatives?         Image credits: Evan1 (left), VanillaCocaCola (right) "
2523,Potted poinciana leaves turning yellow,"I have some poincianas in pots that I started from seeds back in early July. In the summer, I kept them outdoors on the balcony and they mostly did quite fine, although later in August, some of the leaves on the lower branches would turn yellow with some areas remaining green, giving the impression of spots. The yellowed leaves also stopped opening up with the sun. I did a little research and discovered that poincianas generally prefer drier soil, so I reduced the amount of water they get.  Once the weather started to cool, I brought them indoors and put them in a bright and sunny spot. I have been trying to keep them very dry (watering lightly every 2 or 3 weeks), and while plants seem to be growing new leaves (although slower than in the summer), I'm still seeing lower leaves turning mostly yellow and then falling off.  How should I be watering these plants? I'm concerned about under-watering, but it seems that almost any amount of water lately  is over-watering and causing leaves to turn yellow and fall. To be honest, they're not obviously wilted from lack of water, but they're still rather small (they are between 5 and 5.5 inches tall) so I was worried that too little water and they'd die and not recover. How can I safely water them without killing them?  The yellowed leaves are mostly on the right here, though you can see that one stem on the left side of the image is developing some yellowed leaves as well, closer to the trunk. The progression of yellowing always starts near the trunk and moves towards the tip.   Close-up of yellowed leaves.   Another angle.  "
2524,Understanding magnolia propagation method,"I've taken many cuttings of various plants, and in general have had success dipping in rooting agent and putting the cutting in water. I was delighted to discover that you can also take cuttings from most trees, but when I looked up the method for magnolia propagation it seemed unintuitive. I was instructed to place the cutting in a small pot filled with perlite, then seal in a plastic bag and spritz every 10 days. I understand that some plants prefer less water, but I was surprised that I wasn't supposed to give it at least an initial watering. I would expect the bone-dry perlite to, if anything, pull out water from the cutting tip. Can anyone explain the reasoning here? Would it be impossible to clone a magnolia in water? Are there any sorts of general methods I can apply to cloning other trees?  "
2525,"Keep plants alive and healthy, but at a reasonable size?","My fianc&eacute;e has several plants, including a basil, pepper (as in, green and red), and tomato. There’s also a poinsettia but that one is less of a problem.  We live in a small one-bedroom apartment; the plants are on the window sill. The basil and pepper plants are actually in 2 liter soda bottles with the tops cut off. The tomato plant originally was too, but, well.  The plants have grown considerably, especially the tomato plants (which are now in three separate pots and still growing). They take up a considerable portion of the window now, and their constant attempts to out-reach one another for sun have made them extremely top-heavy and unstable (soda bottles are not great for this). The tomato plant, in particular, seems to have outgrown its own strength; even with supporting dowels, the branches just grow farther than they can hold themselves up.  Is there anything we can do to keep the plants, but keep them from getting bigger? Ideally, get them to shrink a bit? We enjoy having plants in the window, and the fresh ingredients (though, for all its impressive size, the tomatoes have yet to actually produce a tomato, and we only ever seem to get one pepper at a time), so we want to keep them, but this is already kind of a problem, and it seems to show no signs of slowing down.

2526,How to save Lucky bamboo yellow stem due to overpruning HELP,"  Hi, Had this lucky bamboo in a water with stones jar for over 3 years already. I made a terrible mistake of over pruning its babies and regrowing them in another jar. I think I took out 3 pieces out of the course of 1 week. It started turning yellow the week after. Cleaned the water and jar, removed the stone, replaced it in water jar and observed but it seems its not regaining its green color. Yellow going down the stalk. Never had problems in the past years just only when I overpruned them  Question:  1. How to save the lucky bamboo?  2. the roots combine with another stem (healthy), shall I separate them?  Thanks "
2527,Camouflaged worms on indoor plants,"I have worms growing on some of my plants, mostly those that are indoors. They eat the leaves voraciously. I've noticed them on spider plants and on the plant whose picture I've attached. Once they get big enough I can grab them with something and throw them out, but sometimes I see that leaves are being eaten and can't find them because they're too small. By the time I find them, they're quite big - about an inch long. Normally I only find one or two at this stage, and they don't move often - only if I shake the branch/leaf they're on or touch them with something.  What are they called? Is there a better way of dealing with them? I've marked them with red ellipses below.   "
2528,Source for cheap large plastic tubs?,"I'm looking into setting up an aquaponics system, which requires me to acquire a large tub (on the order of 250L, relatively flat) to use as a grow bed for the veggies. Does anyone know where I could look to find a source of such tubs? Perhaps disused from some other purpose? All those I've seen commercially seem exorbitantly expensive for what they offer.  In addition, I've read something about ""food grade"" materials (usually regarding plastic) for this use. If the containers are not designed for growing good, how can I determine whether the material is suitable? "
2529,How do I know when to harvest my artichokes?,"At the beginning of the UK summer I planted some artichoke seeds. What I didn't realise is how monstrous the plants would become. They're huge and taking over my vegetable patch. I've had to regularly break leaves off them to stop them strangling my other plants.  Anyway, they're now producing heads, but I'm confused. Some places say that the first years heads should be cut off and the plant left another year before harvest. If that's the case, I might as well kill the things now as I don't have the space to let them grow.  If you can eat the heads of a first-year artichoke, I can't find any advice on how to tell when they're ready to harvest. I found this question, My Artichoke Flowered, Now What? which illustrates why I need to know - they'll flower and be wasted otherwise. But it doesn't tell me how to pick them at the right time.  So in summary: - Can I eat the heads of one-year old artichoke plants? - If so, how do I tell when to pick them? "
2530,Mulch/compost over partially exposed roots,"Location is Portland, Oregon.  TL;DR I want to plant shrubs and shade tolerant ornamentals under trees in one corner of my lot. The soil is clayey and very compacted, and due to long-term slow erosion the tops of some of the tree roots are partially exposed.    Question: How to amend the soil around the trees to allow planting, is compost or mulch the right way to go? What should I be considering?  Longer Version  One corner of my lot has several trees, as shown here. The triangular area is about 45x55 feet, about 1240sf.    There are two 80-100' tall evergreens that I think are some form of cypress (the large trunks in the middle). The two on the left and right are maples, and then there are the two double trunks that I believe are firs.  That corner of the lot is higher than the rest by maybe 2 feet, and it looks like over the years erosion has exposed quite a few roots.  The soil is clayey and very compacted and hard even after rain.  Here are some closeups of the exposed roots.        Question: What needs to be done to the soil to    protect the exposed roots; and  make it easier to work the soil to plant other plants   "

2532,Caring for & maintaining thyme,"We have some thyme in our perennial bed and after seeing that it is quite frost hardy I'm realizing I don't know much about this plant.  Specifically, I'm interested in how best to keep harvesting occasional leaves for cooking.  Initially I assumed it was an annual plant, but that appears to be wrong.  I had been considering digging some up and seeing if it survived inside for the winter (it would be nice to have available), but I'm not sure if that would work.  A little googling also seems to indicate that it becomes woody after a few years. Will it continue to produce the leaves I need for cooking?  Or should I just replace it with a new plant every year or two?  Sorry for the sprawling question.  The connecting thread is how can I keep this plant in it's most productive form for as much of the year(s) as possible. "
2533,What are these weeds & how can I prevent them?,"In one of my past posts, I asked how to seed my 20 x 25 ft backyard.  I had great results by following your recommendations.  I also left 1 1/2 ft as a bare ground border, keeping it weeded by pulling anything that popped up. I want to use that for my organic gardening. This past summer I tilled in the grass clippings and vegetable peels from my kitchen.    I'm hoping that the ground will have time to decompose this over the winter, however, toward the end of spring I saw a number of big plants! The first one on the left now has purple berries on it. The one in the middle is a 4 foot giant that popped up out of the blue. It looks like a dandelion on steroids! The last one on the right looks like big crab weeds. Are they just that?   Any idea what these are? Can I eat them? Are they some kind of poison ivy? Can I just pull them and they'll be gone?  Click on pictures for full size view.     "

2537,What should I do about this sagging mandarin tree?,"My mandarin tree started sagging when its fruit started coming in. Now most of the branches are sagging. My suspicion is that it was allowed to get too tall. I've roped it to minimise the chance of catastrophic failure.  Is there anything I can do for it, short of forfeiting the fruit for this year? Do you see a risk of branches snapping and damaging the tree as a whole? What about later on? Should I drastically prune it, and if so, does anybody have any tips?   Apologies for the images; my garden is small and the lighting isn't great.  "
2538,Is my bougainvillea turning into a magic beanstalk?,"I have a few bougainvillea plants around our house in Southwest Florida. Two are doing OK, the hanging one is bursting out in color with red bracts and white flowers, and there's this one...   This is the second time this year that there's been a single branch (?) shooting skyward like a magic beanstalk, and each time from a different part of the plant. On this one the bougainvillea-stalk is over 5 feet tall.  None of the other plants has exhibited such a behavior (a single branch growing way, way longer and higher). This 'stalk' hasn't shown any tendency to show any color.  Is this something normal? Is this plant trying to become a tree? Is it hurting the plant letting this grow so tall? Should I worry about a giant climbing down and messing up our pool?  Click on pictures for full size.    "
2539,How long does it take for the compost to ripen?,"I’ve got a compost bin (a big plastic box with air holes) that’s used by two or three families. We have been putting kitchen scraps and stuff into the composter for about a year now (mostly vegetables). The composter does not stink, it gives a nice earthy smell even when I turn it (which I do every two or three weeks). Today I even found earth worms in it, which I was very happy about. The only thing that troubles me is that the stuff inside does not look like it could be used for plants anytime soon, there’s a lot of small pieces of stuff, not everything is properly brown, in short it does not look much like soil, not even in the oldest layers.  So how long does it take for the contents to turn into soil? Is it possible for the process to somehow stop? (The winter is quite mild this year here, temperatures seldom dropping below 0°C (32ºF).) How do I know I’m on the right track? Are there some “milestones” that could be seen from how the stuff looks inside the composter? "
2540,How long after a lily scale is planted should I expect a flowering size bulb?,"I have some Madonna lily bulbs that I would like to scale. If I planted them after the last frost in spring, how long will it be until I get a flowering size bulb? Does it matter which scales I use? "
2541,Old leaves of Chinese Elm bonsai have gone brown at the edge and yellow at the center and then falling off,"I have a 7 year old Chinese Elm bonsai. So far it has been growing new shoots without any problems. As of last week I noticed most of the leaves of the old shoots have started going yellow at the center and brown at the tip. After a while they become crispy and fall of the tree. It only seems to affect old shoots, as far as I can tell all the new shoots look normal to me. I’ve attached a picture for reference.     I normally wait until the soil looks dry (it changes color) before giving it a thorough watering.  Is this natural? Or could this be caused by overwatering? Under watering? Over fertilizing? What should I do?  I’ve also noticed a thin layer of white crust forming on top of the soil. "
2542,Why is the ground  moving around my tree?,Quick question. There are 3 tree surgeons in my local area and none are available today...  I have a tree which is about the height of my house. If I wrap my hands around the trunk the trunk is about 2 and a half hands around. At about 10ft the trunk stops and branches come out making the crown? The leafy part of the tree.  The tree is about 10ft from my conservatory. If it hit my conservatory I can foresee broken glass but really the tree doesn't have enough mass to to destroy or do any real structural damage.  I do not want this tree to come down. I don't know if I can wait and hope through the night. I was thinking about giving it a little prune. As the tree still has leaves I figure I just need to take off a medium sized branch which has a lot of leaves on it. This should reduce the wind resistance and keep the tree upright.  Has anyone done something like this?  I feel that I could tackle this with a step ladder and hack saw without too much difficulty and without any real danger. 
2543,Can blueberry bushes survive in clay soil long term with the right help?,"Last year I planted three 1-year-old blueberry bushes in my back yard in clay soil and I've added several inches of mulch and soil amendments, but have a feeling that they won't do well in clay soil long term. If I keep adding organic material/mulch and work on the acidity with amendments, could they do well long term? Or should I make plans to transplant them at some point? Is clay soil too compact for blueberries to do well? I was thinking of moving them into a mound of sandier acidic soil? -- I'm in (Minneapolis, MN USA) Zone 4 for reference. "
2544,Brown leaves on avocado plant,Why are the edges of my avocado plant leaves turning brown?  It is kept indoors near a window with indirect light.  Should I cut it back to restart new leaves?  Could it be root bound? 
2545,How do you tell if a tree is male or female?,"I was reading through some of the questions on fruit trees, because I've been thinking about getting some blueberry bushes and cherry trees, and I see a lot of people mentioning that the trees don't self-pollinate, and that you need a male and a female tree to get fruit.  I thought that flowers had both male and female parts, and that the pollination was just from bees transferring pollen to other parts of the flowers. But to me, that sounds like there are trees that have flowers with only female parts, and trees with flowers that have only male parts. And then trees that self-pollinate that have both flowers.  If there are trees that are only male or female, then how do you tell what sex of tree you have? Do you have to look at the flowers to know? "
2546,What do I do with my avocado plant during arctic winter?,"I am going to start with describing my plant and how it has grown and its living conditions, and then I'll ask my questions later. So I have this indoor avocado plant which I planted from a nut and it is dearly loved by me. I named it Bertil. It is about eight months old, about 40 cm/16 inches tall from the soil up, and due to arctic climate I cannot plant it outside. I just moved a little more south so it won't be affected by the eight months of darkness, though it will get a little darker during winter. Also our house is a bit cold, around 18 &deg;C (depends whether or not it's sunny outside). I don't know what soil I used, my mum just recommended it. And I don't think there is a lot of salt in our tap water as the main source is surface water from lakes etc., but I could be wrong. I water it daily, but not too much. I keep the soil moist. Some say I should let it dry out and/or soak it once a week. I am confused.   Some history of Bertil. I repotted it during summer, late June (it's now late October) and it had a huge growth spurt since then. I originally had two plants, where one had two stems from the beginning, but died of unknown reasons. The one that survived originally had just one stem, but after repotting and a car drive it suddenly had a new, long stem, which in the end is the one that grew to be 40 cm. The original stem hasn't grown more than 2-3 cm.   I try to keep my plant in the sun and at not too low temperature. I don't over water it (I think). I have been reading here for tips, and I noticed it was recommended not to water in the saucer or have gravel/rocks in the bottom, and I have/do both. It has gotten pretty big now (as mentioned), but there are a few things that worry me. The bottom leaves especially and some of the above have started to curl a little at the tip and I know they should be smooth. Also the lower leaves have gotten brown tips. It's rather healthy otherwise and there is new leaves at the top. Some time ago I plucked it at the top to encourage the lower leaves to be bigger, and it has helped. The top leaves are huge! But I am worried. Especially now that winter is approaching. How much sunlight does it need, what is the ideal temperature? Should I water it differently, or how should I water it? It's doing ok now, but some of the leaves have started to curl and turn brown at the tip; is this a warning sign?  So the questions are:   Should I do something as winter is coming along and it will be colder and darker? Why are the leaves curling and what can I do to prevent it?   Is my plant dying?  Should I perhaps repot it and how?  Am I watering it wrong?    I would truly appreciate if someone would take the time to reply because I would be very sad if this plant died. Also it is a wonder something hasn't gone wrong earlier as I probably potted them too early in the ceramic pots.  Here are some pictures of it now:     "
2547,Cabbage and Broccoli Pests,"I have planted around a month ago several small plants of cabbage, broccoli, kales, and arranged also a raised beds for herbs.   1: Pests. Lately, I noticed that most of the plants had been bitten, some of them almost destroyed. I took some measures to keep slugs away, having caught at night many slugs hanging around.  Now, it seems that slugs are not as numerous as before, but little holes still appear on the leaves. I uploaded some photos.   How to figure out what is attacking the plants? What should I try in order to get rid of it?  The big damages you see in the photo has been produced before the slugs were kept away, the little holes came up later.   2: Fungi. Another strange issue is that this morning some clusters of fungi appeared on  top of the compost in my raised beds. Is that any good? Should I get rid of them? How? It can be of help knowing that my beds are filled with cardboards at the bottom, a layer of prunings (mainly small tree branches) and hay, also there is some nettle and on the top some coffee-grounds have been crumbled now and then.        "
2548,Is it possible to graft together a self-pollinating cherry tree?,"Earlier today I asked this question: How do you tell if a tree is male or female? because I've been looking into fruit trees and learning about what is needed for them to bear fruit.  So based on this new knowledge that some trees need a male and a female tree to bear fruit, I was wondering if it would be possible to graft a branch from a male cherry tree onto a female cherry tree. That way, instead of having two cherry trees in my yard, I could have one tree that would pollinate itself with the grafted branch. Would something like that be possible? "
2549,Plastic glasses as containers for seedlings - yes or no?,"Is it OK to repurpose plastic glasses as seedling containers for the mid-phase between initial development in trays, and final planting in the garden?  (I am going to make holes with a cigarette at the bottom of the each glass; this is the cheapest solution that I know)          The glasses are available in sizes 200-500 ml.    EDIT: I read (see, for example, this question and this question) that light affects microlife in soil, and even that root can think it is a branch (!), so transparent or semi-transparent glasses would be in that sense unsuitable, but I hope, since this is only temporary, this won't have significant impact. "
2550,Root removal when removing shrubs,"I have two arborvitae trees that are near the front entrance to our house. Many years ago they were planted way to close and now they need to be removed.   We have decided to simple plant perennials there instead, like a big batch of black eyed susans or something similar.  Our goal is lower and more color.   my question is can I just cut the arborvitae at ground level and let nature takes its course with the roots?  Or do I need to remove the root ball?   Over time I would assume the roots would decompose was hoping patience and nature could replace an aching back and blisters.   "
2551,Rose Canker and remedy,"Is this rose canker? If not what is it? How to identify canker? My plant's stem has gone blackish at some places and woody in others. I tried looking into the available images on the net for canker, and I am confused if this is simply a woody stem or a canker. Also, how should a healthy 5.5 feet tall rose plant's stem look like? Green? Woody? Blackish?     "
2552,Can I save this basil?,"I'm very new to this field, and these plants are all I have so far. A few days ago I bought them from IKEA and left them in the kitchen. My bad, I know and I apologize for it.   Now I'd like to save these plants, if it is not too late. I've read that basil likes sun and, it is not so good for it to live in the indoor environment. I live in south Poland so I'll keep them outside of my kitchen window. I'll water them in mid-day.   For now I don't know what to do in order to save them, so I have some questions:     Does the basil on the left side have any chances of survival? It doesn't seem likely, but there is still some green on the leaves.   The one from the right has some leaves with black spots. Should I remove them entirely or only the black spots?   I live on the second floor of a big building. My apartment has windows facing east and west. Is it recommended to move the plant during the day in order to have more sun, or is it recommended to leave it in the same place?    "
2553,What houseplants will best filter the air for a retirement home?,"My grandpa lives in a retirement home. I visit him on every Friday, so after browsing on this site, I was thinking to buy a plant or two for his room. Do you have any recommendations? Which is the most recommended plant for a bed room in order to purify the air, which doesn't require too much care? Of course I can ask some of the nurses to water his plants. If the weekly schedule is not good maybe I can buy an automated system.  He lives in South Poland and his room has a window to the west side. Because he is living in a retirement home, I don't think that climbing plants are a good choice. Can you recommend to me   the names of some plants that will filter his room air? I'm interested about filtration, because care problem can be solved (I think). "

2555,Can a plant survive bottled in its own ecosystem for 50 years?,"I came across a story on about David Latimer, who put spiderwort plants into a bottle garden (""terrarium"") in 1960, watered it in 1972, and then sealed the bung. The plants have been living, thriving even, in their own ecosystem since.  The story was reported in the Daily Mail.     Thriving since 1960, my garden in a bottle: Seedling sealed in its own ecosystem and watered just once in 53 years         David Latimer first planted his bottle garden in 1960 and last watered it in 1972 before tightly sealing it shut 'as an experiment'   The hardy spiderworts plant inside has grown to fill the 10-gallon container by surviving entirely on recycled air, nutrients and water      Here it is again in The Times. There are a few more places this article can be found in various forms on the web.  Now this question text is copied from this Skeptics question. The reason I am asking here is that I have seen the exact same story and have the exact same question but, somewhat shockingly, noone on Skeptics thought to ask a botanist or even a biologist if any of that is remotely true.  Now, I am no botanist or gardener or biologist but I know the Law of Concervation of Energy. Which states that the amount of energy/matter at the start WILL be equal to the amount at the end if you consider all factors. Meaning if plants consume water and nutrients there is no way they can extrude the same amount they have consumed in order to consume it again.  Am I right in my thesis? Is this story possible? "
2556,What is this 'bleeding' mushroom?,"I photographed this weird looking fungus growing out of an open cut in a tree (not sure what type of tree it was) on my parent's property last weekend in central Texas after some heavy rain. The mushroom was dark brown on top, with orange-colored fringes that seeped with this honey-like substance. Under the mushroom was a mass of swirled material with a woody appearance, though I suspect it was part the same or perhaps a different fungus.     I don't know too much about mushrooms. The 'bleeding' around the edges of the mushroom reminds me of Hydnellum peckii or ferrugineum, but it lacks the 'teeth' on the underside of the mushroom (you can see that it's fairly smooth in the top part of the second image). The coloration and general shape reminds me of Phaeolus schweinitzii, but I don't know if that species can produce this kind of 'sap'. Can anyone help me identify what kind of mushroom this is? And what is the swirled material below it? "
2557,Help me identify this small plant and how to take care of it,"Please help me identify this plant. It was a gift and I don't know what plant it is.  I want to know what plant it is so that I can take care of it properly. It's starting to brown and some leaves are starting to fall, I think the way I water it is wrong.  Size: The plant + the pot, has a size comparable to a small mug or creamer pot.  Color: initially all green, but it's turning brown from the node and the stem :'(  Smell: it has a subtle smell i can't describe.  Leaves: i think you can say that it's scaly??? I'm not sure how to describe it.  I searched in google, and some plants with scaly leaves and with similar appearance are conifers. Is this a juniper? Hmm..I don't know. Im kinda lost, really. Please help me out. Disclaimer: I haven't seen a juniper in my life.  TIA     "

2559,How to prune a Zelkova seedling turning into a multi-trunk tree?,"In October '18, I started growing several Zelkova trees from seed.  One of them, pictured below, is doing remarkably well. However I'm concerned about it's branching structure.  Almost immediately from the start, the lead stem split off four ways. They are all about the same height and I can't tell which is the dominant.  I'd prefer shaping this into a single trunk tree but am unsure if I should prune this early in life?

The issue is that this plant has a lot of white areas, as shown in the pictures. These have been there for a long time now but I don't have any idea what they are. Perhaps it is a fungus?   In addition, one of the stems turned brown a long time ago. A couple of days ago, I tried to peel a small patch from that brown stem to check if it has a disease which I can recognize, and the stem underneath is still green.

2562,Do I use grass seed or just weed and feed for dead lawn spot?,"So I sprayed some weed killer and now my lawn has yellow dead spots all over. Maybe I made a mistake    If I know it looks like this, I wouldn't even try.  So how do I fix this now?   Option A:   Rake off the dead grasses, put compost down Few weeks later, put grass seeds over the top   Option B:   Just put weed and feed over it --> I expect the grasses will grow back and cover the dead ones (not sure).   Option C:   Basically option A but no compost, just grass seeds. Someone told me compost would burn the seeds (??!)   Thought?  UPDATE 1  I am in Pacific Northwest "
2563,How to seed grasses correctly if the area has moss and lack of sun,I just bought a bag of seeds from Costco: Pennington Smart Blend  [website]My lawn has many dead grass spots due to some plants being in places I didn't want them 2 weeks back. It also has mosses.  I raked them all to make the surface a little rough then spread the seeds down like the photos        Questions:   Did I spread it enough? Should I put compost? Because there are some mosses?  
2564,How do I kill this salt cedar?,"The front yard of my New Mexico (USDA zone 7a) house has a salt cedar (Tamarix ramosissima), which is growing like a huge bush. Its salt uptake appears to be preventing anything else in the vicinity from growing. I would like to kill it so that other things can grow in the front yard, and also so I can replace it with a large fruit-bearing shade tree.  I cut it down to a stump this spring, but to my horror, while I was puzzling over what to do after that, it has grown back to its full 6-foot-tall size by now. I am amazed by its growth!  Some people recommend drilling the stump and dumping glyphosate into the holes. Other people recommend burning out the stump and roots. What would work? For stumps in general, and for an incredibly tenacious salt cedar in particular? "
2565,How to increase chance of maple seed sprouting?,"It is official. My momma is looking for a house to move in to. If everything goes well, she will get the house in August and move everything that we want to move over the next few months afterwards. So this is my last chance to grow a sugar maple before I move. Unfortunately, the soil in the pot outside that has the elm sapling in it from last year (an elm seed just happened to fall into the pot and grow) is frozen solid. I mean, yes it is more periodic than all the time now but still, I can't get through frozen solid soil to plant 1 or more seeds. So my mom and dad will buy me some soil to grow the tree or trees in. Maybe they will buy a deep pot too but I don't know.  I have to have at least 1 seed sprout relatively soon. The year before last I did 3 seeds at a time once the soil moistened up from the ice and then waited a week or two before planting new seeds to see if any would sprout. However, none of them took root, not even later on when the ground temperature was warmer.  I already gently feel for the seed taking up most of the non-wing space of the samara as a sign that the seed may sprout. Maybe with this new soil, one or more seeds will sprout unlike the past 2 years (first, outdoors after soil moistened from ice, then indoors (the indoors one looked like it was taking root but it never sprouted)) where I have been lucky to have 1 seed growing its roots. I pick only the brown seeds, even if some of the green seeds also have the seed taking up most non-wing space in the samara. Is that why very few have sprouted because stratification or no stratification itself didn't affect the chance of sprouting (or at least not significantly)?  Should I try growing both the brown seeds (stratified over the winter) and the green seeds (straight from the tree) if the seeds are large enough to see if this has an effect on sprouting?  But other than placing it in a sunny spot, and watching and waiting, is there anything I can do to help the seeds sprout or at least increase the chances of one of them sprouting? The brown ones will likely have already been stratified naturally but as I said before, I haven't noticed a difference in the chance of sprouting between stratified and non-stratified. However, the maples that lasted 3 years before they died, those were grown from non-stratified seeds (straight from the tree on March 21). I know not to water the tree if it has been raining because the soil will be plenty moist. I only water the trees once deeply when I plant them and during dry spells in the summer (even then, I will be less likely to water a sapling in a dry spell than a seedling) because I find the rain of spring and fall to be sufficient for growth.

2566,Mango seedling has stem and leaves but no root!,"I've got two problems with my mango seedlings:  Problem #1  I have germinated a mango seed in water, it now has a decent stem and healthy-looking leaves. It is currently still in water, indoors, in the brightest spot in my house getting maximum direct sunlight (I live in the UK).  When the root first germinated (2-3 months ago) I accidentally snapped it off while refilling the water. The root never grew back, however several stems since germinated and it has continued to grow leaves rapidly!!   I am at the point now where I am wanting to plant it into a pot of (ericaceous) compost however there is no root system. There is a bulbous growth, which I assume is acting as a root. I don't think it would survive in soil. Is there any method I could use to force the growth of roots? Would planting it out do this? Or fertilizer (I have only used boiled tap-water up to this point)?  See attached pictures - my plan was to wait for another root to grow but I have been waiting for months!!  Problem #2  I have another mango seedling with the opposite problem. All root and no stem growth!! It germinated in water at a similar time (2-3 months ago) and I have it kept in the same position with maximum sunlight.  The root has grown extensively and seems healthy as far as I can tell (see pictures). There is one small stem which seemed to have leaves sprouting however it hasn't grown in a long time.   Should I keep this seedling in water until the stem and leaves grow? Or hope another stem pops up soon? Or should I plant it out into (ericaceous) compost?   See attached pictures - my plan was to keep it in water until a sturdy stem and leaves were produced before I planted it out.  Any advice much appreciated!

2568,"Venus flytrap is yellow, growth stagnated","My fiancé got me a Venus flytrap from the store in February, and I’ve been troubleshooting to keep it alive for several months. It had yet to thrive in any of the conditions I’ve put it in.   While having some early changes, the flytrap is now outside in full sun probably 9 hours per day. It’s St. Louis so stays quite humid. Keeps well watered with distilled or rain water, and is in its original sphagnum moss. Formerly it was in a windowsill getting indirect light abt 9 hours per day, but I read it needed more direct light so finally put it outdoors. Even before I put it outside it began to grow many new stalks at its base, originally with a reddish healthy appearance, but soon after their appearance the growth effectively halts, they begin to turn yellow, and the latent trap remains in its shrunken form. So far I have seen no improvement putting it outdoors for abt 3 weeks. Please see attached pic below.  My main guesses now are that it is too wet (maybe need to add sand), or is unhappy because it has not been able to eat since I first got it, simply because it has not been healthy enough to produce traps. Or maybe there is a root pathogen?  That being said, has anyone had this problem, and is it still possible to resurrect the poor thing from this downward cycle?  "
2569,How long after last frost before lawns need mowing?,"A subset of the title question is: What temperature do lawns consider a frost? 32F? 30? 28? By ""consider a frost"" I mean get knocked back or prevented from growing. So if lawns frost at 32F, then how long do temperatures need to be >32F for the lawn to begin growing?

Is there a difference regarding composting time having in mind that the pure one is right the result of horses eating fresh stuff on the meadow and the bedding one is mixed up with straw? - Straw which, according to local people, will take ages to compost because it has been treated with fungicides (and other evil stuff) during its growth and this will inhibit the composting process.

But as I read more on espaliered fruit trees, there seems to be differences between apple type trees that bear fruit along the main branch on spurs, and stone fruit trees which fruit at the tips. So I'm unsure now how to care/prune for the tree I'm trying to train such that it will successfully bear fruit. Should I cut each of the leader graft branches down a third (?) and then train one new shoot along the wire? Or another method? What's the best way to care for this tree? THanks]1 "

I'm also aware that I may be a bit late with pruning if I had wanted a shorter bushier avocado.

2581,"What is this dead light brown patch on my lawn, and how do I get rid of it?","I have a speckled, dry brown patch on my lawn that won't go away:    I first noticed it a month or so ago while mowing the lawn, when it was isolated to a single area of several square feet. I figured that it might be due to something random like animal urine or a spilled chemical, so I dismissed it.  The next time I mowed (three weeks later), it had grown in size and had taken on a spotted/blotchy appearance. The brown areas are dry, dead, and crumbly - I can clear out the grass and expose the soil pretty easily with my hands.  Adjacent areas of the lawn are still mostly green, but appear to be taking on the same appearance at the base of grass near the soil. Areas farther out still seem to be healthy and unaffected.  Some other info that may help:   I live in central Texas, where it's very hot and humid. We've had drought (often severe) for the past few years, but this season has seen plenty of rain. It rained a lot before this patch appeared, and has rained a bit since it began to spread, though it's been about three weeks since the last rainfall. I haven't noticed the patch spread significantly since then. I have awful clay soil that doesn't retain moisture well. My ""lawn"" wasn't seeded or sodded; it's basically whatever will grow in this soil, which is about half grass and half weeds. The area of grass that seems to be most - if not entirely - affected by this is pretty lush St. Augustine, at the bottom of a downslope, adjacent to a small creek that keeps the soil moist. Kids play in the creek and do all kinds of destructive stuff - burning plastic, pouring out paint cans, and other stuff that bleeds over into my lawn and certainly isn't good for it. I didn't notice anything that would have obviously caused this, though.   More photos in this Flickr gallery.  Can anyone identify this, and recommend how to get rid of it? Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks!    UPDATE:  A few interesting things to report.  It looks like my memory failed me - the dead grass isn't white or ashy. It's a light straw color, and of a similar tone and appearance to some clippings I left on my driveway that have since dried out. In other words, at a distance, it just looks like normal dried-out grass clippings.  But, on close inspection, I did notice that the dead blades do have some dark speckling that I didn't find on the healthy grass clippings:    The speckles have a sort of faint graphite appearance - medium gray and slightly shiny. They're very small, and vary in density; some leaves have a few, and some leaves are completely covered.  Per @Bamboo's feedback, I looked around for insects, and I did discover numerous big-eyed bugs. I couldn't find any chinch bugs, but per the article that @Bamboo linked to, big-eyed bugs prey on chinch bugs. Maybe that explains why the patch seems to have slowed its growth? Maybe the chinch bugs came first and did their damage to the St. Augustine grass, and now the big-eyed bugs are clearing out the chinch bugs?  Per @ondoteam's feedback, I should also note that I don't have the best lawn care habits; I do mow on a pretty regular schedule, but not as frequently as I should (every 3 weeks during the growing season). I mow very high - about 3.5 to 4 inches, as I understand that improves root growth - but I'm reading now that that's about an inch too high.  I can't control the temperature or humidity, and I can probably only have a limited effect on the poor soil drainage, but it sounds like I need to:   mow more frequently (weekly, at least during the growth season) confirm the ideal grass height dethatch (I own a light-duty electric dethatcher, so I'll give that a shot) aerate (I can rent a power aerator at Home Depot) keep the mower blade sharp (I just sharpened it, but that was the first time in a couple of years)   Anything else I should do? Will the big-eyed bugs serve to limit further damage from the chinch bugs? Should I just let them roam uncontrolled? It seems likely now that the damage was due to chinch bugs, but since the damage has slowed/stopped, and I'm currently seeing only big-eyed bugs, is it safe to assume that I can bypass pesticide treatment for the chinch bugs?  Thanks for all the feedback! "
2582,What small pines and deciduous trees are suitable for terrarium culture?,"I am building a terrarium for some ex-Oregon family members. I really want to capture Oregon with its moss, ferns, trees and of course pine trees.   I don't know of really any small pine trees that would work in a terrarium. Does any one know of any varieties out there and/or maybe have some alternatives to use?  I'm interested in some small deciduous trees as well. Any thoughts out there?  I""m taking inspiration from a few photos I've found.     "
2583,How do I properly cut and cultivate my lemon trees to keep them smaller?,"I started growing these two lemon trees from (random storebought lemon) seeds a few years ago and they grew considerably over the last summer after putting them in larger pots.  Because I live in Nothern Germany where we sometimes get -10°C in the winter and I have no idea how much cold they can deal with, I take them inside in temperatures under 6°C (so basically the entire winter).  The problem is that they are getting too big to keep inside but I don't think I can keep them outside all year round. Should I cut them to keep their size within reasonable limits? Can I keep them outside all year round instead?  They are also suffering from soft scale insects (it seems coccus hesperidum is the exact name judging from images found online) that I managed to treat using an oily semi-natural pesticide. However, the insects come back after about a month. I think this is because of the adverse growing conditions inside (hot dry air from the heater and not enough sunlight in the winter).  I've bought a systemic pesticide but haven't gotten around to applying it as it needs to be applied not in direct sunlight and with no forecast of wind or rain.  As you can see in the pictures, the new leaves are unnaturally curled and pretty light compared to the older leaves. I fertilized using a long-term citrus fertilizer last spring and haven't done so again since.  I can try to provide more details where necessary. Thanks!  The smaller left one:    The larger right one:   "
2584,How do I save my chilli plant,"I was away for a couple of days and I guess the weather was hot here, so when I came back my chilli plant had dried up, picture below. I have watered it now, but the plant hasn't perked up. The branches and stem are still alive, I checked. Does anyone know what I should do to save my plant? Are the leaves dead, should I remove them? This is my first chilli plant. Any advice is welcome. Thanks for the answers in advance.  "
2585,Does anyone know what is growing in my sweet pea soil?,I am trying to grow my first deck garden (all in pots on my balcony). I am trying to grow sweet peas that I started from seeds that I left in a damp paper towel in a plastic bag for about a week before transferring them into the dirt. They have been planted in dirt for about two weeks and I just noticed this odd dark yellowish substance appearing on the dirt surface and around the plant roots.  Does anyone know what this is? Is it harmful?   
2586,Saving broken branch of begonia?,What can I do with this broken branch in my potted begonia?  Can I plant it in a small pot?   
2587,Which of these trees are good for growing as a Christmas tree in a pot?,"I'm going to buy a potted Christmas tree we can keep in a pot, and would like to buy a Nordmann fir (Picea nordmanniana) for its colourful male cones. I have read this species is fast growing and isn't typically pruned, but as we would like to keep it 5 foot high does anybody have words of wisdom for pruning a fir? Is it not a good idea or will it work fine?    Our other idea is to buy a Blue spruce (Abies pungens), as most people found the blue foliage very attractive. Might this be a better plan long term as the tree is a slow growing hardwood so won't require as much pruning, the roots won't spiral round the pot as fast. That said, perhaps frequent pruning of the Picea N. would lead to a dense foliage with a strong pyramidal form? What are your thoughts?   "
2588,Poison Sumac or something else?,"I saw this growing out of a yard and onto the sidewalk. Is it Poison Sumac or non-poisonous Sumac? 11 leaflets, It has a smooth stem and leaflets so it is not Staghorn Sumac. I did not see any berries or fruit. Is there any of the poisonous kind around hear that I can see? Does It only grows in wetlands.   "
2589,What are these rocks/gravel lookalikes in my front yard soil?,"We got this place recently and are planning to put sod in the front yard. We know that the previous owner had grass in the front yard and a big tree. They removed the tree about 5-6 months back as its roots were damaging the water pipe. Since then the front yard was all mulched up. After removing the mulch, you can see the dead grass root patches and on digging more into the soil, you will see lots of small tree roots and grey rock/gravel made of mud chunks. Are these gravels (not as hard as the stone, can be easily crushed with shovel) intentionally left for any certain reason, like curbing the tree root/weed? Do we need to remove them all before putting in sod? "
2590,Did the landscapers kill our redbud?,"We have a small redbud that we planted two years ago. It was barely a seedling when we planted it; this spring it was about 4-5 feet tall. No real buds this year, but leafing out nicely.  Then a few days ago the landscaping/lawnmowing company that our housing development uses came by and pruned it, although they are not supposed to. They cut it back pretty severely, maybe taking off a foot or two from every branch, including the main branches.  Did they likely kill it? Is there anything we can/should do to help save it?  Edit: Added photo. I should also note that I did call the landscaper to complain; we'll see what happens.   "
2591,Why my capsicum leaves are looking like this?,"  So I live in India and now its summer time with a usual climate of 40-45 degree celsius daily. I planted the seeds of my capsicum back in March and now they were growing fine until I saw these pale leaves yesterday.   I am watering it with an interval of 12 hrs and looking at leaves, it seems that I'm watering them too much?   What should I do?  "
2592,What F1 in name of seeds/varieties means?,"Quick question: what 'F1' (for example 'Oceano F1' tomato seed) in name of seed exactly means? Are there other designations/markings in use, what is their meaning? Are there other naming conventions (for vegetable, fruit, flowers etc) and how important they are when choosing varieties? "
2593,Is testing the pH of soil with cabbage juice accurate?,"I was looking into testing the soil in my yard so I knew how much I needed to prepare it for blueberry plants. I came across a method I hadn't heard of before, that I thought was interesting.  It involved boiling cabbage leaves in distilled water, then placing the soil in the juice. Then supposedly the juice will change colors based on the soil's pH level.  It sounds pretty easy, but I was wondering if that's an accurate method for testing the pH of soil? Is it accurate enough for a general idea of where the pH is at, or should I not use that method at all? "
2594,Why is rice farming more difficult?,"In the link below, it is mentionned that the agriculture of rice needs more qualifications than agriculture in other civilisations, I imagine like the wheat or corn.  [website]Do you have any explanation on that? I never tried to grow wheat or rice so any basic explanation is interested. "
2595,What is the difference between shredded mulch from free vs garden center sources?,"Many municipalities use brush collection materials to create mulch, which they supply for free to their taxpaying citizens.  On some gardening sites, users have chimed in that these free mulch sources are not safe (safe for your desired landscaping or garden results, not a human danger) for home lawn and garden use, since the wood that winds up there are often from diseased sources that get mixed in with the rest of the mulch.  Is this a legitimate risk?  It seems very much like the kind of warning that might originate from a garden center store that sells much more expensive mulch.  If that is the danger of free brush-collection-sourced shredded mulch, where do commercial mulch sources get their materials, and what precautions are used to insure their comparative safety?  Some possibilities I thought of -    No difference at all.  They get their source material from pruned trees, removed trees and stuff that falls into yards from trees.  Maybe they even buy the brush collected by cities that don't shred and supply mulch. They get all the limbs, branches and odd bits, either pre- or post-shredding from lumber mills, that trim from the main trunk of threes they are milling for lumber. They grow the most pristine, perfect and healthy trees themselves, just to cut them down and shred them into ""pure"" mulch (/sarcasm)   If anyone actually knows, generally, how that works, I'd be interested. It's entirely possible my skepticism is influenced on my preference for ""free.""  EDIT - I made some assumptions in language and not everyone is probably familiar with ""brush collection.""  Here is a municipality's site on what qualifies and how it is done -   Madison, Wisconsin yard waste brush collection info "
2596,Beginner Starting from Scratch: Weedlot to Enjoyable Garden,"I live in the Pacific Northwest (Portland), and I have a small urban back yard (20'x30').  In the decade I have owned the house, I have never really done much with it, and it has ranged from boring but reasonably maintained grass lawn to complete weedlot, and everything in between.  Its current state is weedlot.  I would like to transform it into a beautiful garden...but one that's as low maintenance as possible (I am returning to grad school while working full-time: time is the scarcest resource).  Earlier this year, I planted two trees I like (a Stewartia and a Ash Cimmaron), but I am at a loss as to what to do with the rest of the yard, and I don't know where to start.  I am not in love with grass, and I like the idea of lusher, wilder-looking gardens.  I also love moss gardens, and there are parts of the yard that are mostly in shade all day long.  Various people have offered to help and, as well-intentioned as they have been, no one has really been able to see anything through, and I've realized that this is on me to do right.  So, here are my questions:   What book(s) should I read?  Katie Elzer-Peters' intro book on gardening seems like a safe bet for fundamentals, but the TOC doesn't indicate there's much there about planning a garden, or starting from scratch.  Any recommendations would be welcome. Given that I want to essentially start from scratch, what is the most effective way to start from ground zero?  I understand that an effective way to kill everything and start from scratch is to cover the entire lawn with something that blocks the sun for an extended period of time.  Is there a book or article that describes this technique, and is that my best bet? Is there a book, article, or website that covers budgeting for this kind of project?  While time is more critical than money, grad school isn't cheap, so I do have to budget: money is not not unlimited.  It would also be helpful to know in advance when I can expect large expenses so I can plan my budget accordingly. I am not adverse to seeking professional help, but I don't even know the right questions to ask, or whether I should be looking for a landscaper or gardener.  And, as I mentioned, money is not unlimited, so if I were to hire someone to do all or part of this project, I would have to be mindful of that expense.  Should I consider a professional and, if so, what should I look for and what questions should I ask?   It is currently mid-summer, and it would be nice if this project were well underway within a year.  What should I be doing now to start seeing results next year? "
2597,How to completely overhaul a weedy flower bed,"So I recently moved into my home, and the front flower gardens are overrun with weeds and honestly I don't know the difference between the flowers, plants and weeds. I want to gut it entirely (with the exception of two small bushes) and start over planting.    (I can't add pictures.) There is a dark green thorny looking brush/bush with some red on it, looks kind of like ivy but pointy and sharp. It pricks my fingers to touch the edges of it. From what I can gather from my neighbors, the other one over growing is a ""wild grape"" bush. They grow up all the fences for 3 of my neighbors and myself on top of taking over my front garden. The rest are small thick grass looking ones that are white at the bottom.   I haven't even the slightest idea of where to start on this project. I have seen many posts saying spray herbicide. Will this work on the larger weeds/plants (like 2 foot high)? Will this affect the small animals in my area (we have lots of feral cats and squirrels) and how will it affect the couple of bushes that I would like to save?    Once I put this down how long do I wait to start pulling them up? Should I cut the top parts of these maybe with shears or a chain saw? I'm sorry for all the questions I just have no clue where to start, I just know that it looks awful and I want to start it all over.     I cant seam to figure out how to add pictures. the main one is a dark green thorny looking brush/bush with some red on it. it pricks my fingers to touch the edges of it.(it looks kind of like ivy but pointy and sharp)  And from what I can gather from my neighbors the other one over growing is a ""wild grape"" bush. They seam to be growing up all the fences for 3 of my neighbors and myself on top of taking over my front garden as well.  the rest as small thick grass looking ones that are white at the bottom.  "
2598,Growing Veggies from Seeds,"I currently have beefsteak tomatoes, zucchini and peppers that I've started from seeds on May 8th in a seed starting tray indoors.  They seem to be growing well under the light system I have setup.  At what point do I thin the plants? I have 2-3 plants per little hexagonal cell.  When do I move them to bigger containers? Thank you "
2599,Tree not getting leaves in one section,"I live in Illinois, and have a new construction home (I moved in April 2016). This tree was left and original to the land. Not sure what kind it is. The first year I moved in it was fine through fall.   Winter, I hung some Christmas lights, and large shaped Christmas light bulb ornaments. It gets windy, so I'm not sure if this area was damaged from stringing lights and possibly cracking branches while blowing in the wind.. but it seems to be limited to one area, like a damaged root.  Should I cut off this dead area? If so how far back?   I will say, last year was first i noticed this, and it seemed the leaves were not as full last year, as the year before, and also last year had this area of no leaves. But this year, the leaves seem fuller. Like the first season i moved in. But just this area of no leaves.   What could be happening with this tree?     Update Here are some additional images: Picture of first summer after home construction.   Picture of trunk area.   Picture of (possibly) dead branch coming from lower trunk going to top.  "
2600,"Bonsai Ficus, recently repotted now roots growing from surface","I repotted a Golden gate Ficus bonsai about a month ago and just noticed something today I'm not sure about.   It appears 5-6 root tips have hit the sides of the pot, growing on the surface and some are trying to climb over the side!  I hadent seen this happen the last two times I repotted so I wanted to ask if I should be concerned.   Something different this time I repotted is I used an unglazed clay pot. Could that be bad? I also used a slightly different soil mixture due to running out of bonsai soil, about 35% bonsai soil, 35% cactus soil, 15% sand, 15% vermiculite.  Maybe the soil isn't right? It was in 100% bonsai dirt before.  Maybe it's not a problem and will make some beautiful looking surface roots?  I'm uploading some pictures. The far shot shows the tree in it's current pot on the left, the Jade on the right is in the pot this tree was in before I repotted this spring.  Thank you!!   "
2601,What are the benefits of greenhouses and how do they work?,What are the pros and cons of greenhouses and how do they work? What are their limitations? How does one plan and build one? What is necessary to maintain the plants inside optimally? I am in Central Florida.  
2602,Stratifying Trees,"I'm stratifying some maple trees, and others to grow for my future tree nursery, and I'm new to it. I stratified some maples by placing them in the fridge for six weeks, then they have been out for two.  My maple seeds look to be crumbling now. Should I start them without refrigeration? What should I do now, wait for the seeds another two weeks? Should I refrigerate them longer, or do a winter outdoors in a prepped spot?  I also have pecans, peaches, and fruit trees like apples, oranges, lemons, and others. "
2603,How to support heavy old alo vera?,"So I have managed to grow alo vera. Its fine but we cut its ‘leaf’ at times for various purposes. Now the plant has grown but its base is no longer supportive. This has caused the plant to lean towards one direction, and I am afraid one day it will fall with its own weight.  The question: should/can I put any support for the plant so it gets support and does not fall? Or I am overthinking it and should not worry about that? "
2604,"Help me identify this plant, possibly jade?","What is this plant? I've had it since September, it was given to me by a teacher as a project. I think it might be jade, but shouldn't it have woody stems?  Thanks in advance.   "
2605,Edging lawn with soil running over paver for years,"My lawn soil has overflown to the paver for many years so some areas have 2-4 in of soil going over and at least 1-2 in thick on top. I am planning to rent a lawn edger to start the edging process. I never used one before so I got some questions:   Should I use the shovel to push the soil on top away first to at least find the ""edge""? Because I am afraid if I run the edger, it might not line up. How do I clean the paver edge? It will look dirty and have different color. If I pressure wash, it will be a mud mess. Any idea?  "
2606,leggy basil with small leaves,"My recently lush windowsill sweet basil has gotten very leggy after having been stressed by underwatering for at least several days (might have been as many as 10). While it was not dead when I got home, it was quite wilted and subsequently most of the old growth leaves were lost. It had begun flowering but never reached the ""bolting"" stage. Many of the stems are now woody near the base.   By careful but aggressive pinching, pruning and frequent watering, I was able to restore some life to the plant, but it is still a skeletal shadow of its former self. There has been substantial branching and new growth, but it has been producing only small leaves. Am I over- or under- fertilizing? Any chance it will come back or has it reached the end of its life cycle?   The plants have been in this 18""L x 9""W x 9""D container about 8 months, transplanted from a grocery store purchased pot late last summer. Over the first 6 months, I pinched off top leaves regularly for light culinary use and harvested larger amounts from the top every few weeks for pesto.  The container sits in a south facing ""greenhouse window"" and gets 6-10 hours of good sunlight, depending on the season. The drying out/die-off happened in late January (it is now March). The room has good air circulation and is a pretty steady 70F.  The soil is Miracle Gro general purpose potting soil. After the plants dried out, I added a few pellets of Miracle Gro Shake and Feed fertilizer and watered heavily. About a month later (a week ago), I added a small amount (a cup or less) of doubly diluted liquid organic fertilizer.  The container has always been very thirsty and needed to be watered at least twice a week. I recently started using Hydrospike type automatic waterers with seeming great success to maintain a steady moisture level. "
2607,Discouraging Strawberry Runners,"OK, how to encourage strawberries to runner is a common question, but I am having the opposite issue, too many runners.  I planted a new bed last year, and with first year plants I would generally prefer to allow no runners.  As these seemed especially health and nice plants, I though I would allow 1 or 2 from the lager plants and do the normal pinch/cut for the rest.  I was trying to do so an a weekly basis, but these plants were out of control.  I have plants that last year I cut 50+ runners from and still ended up with 20+ children from.  Some even did crown splits into 3-5 plants on top of send out scores of runners.  This is something some would consider a nice problem, but I live with very harsh winters so really want solid plants.  I likely lost about 1/3 of my plants to winter kill, I assume in part because too much energy went to reproduction and dividing.  I had put in 25 plants each of 3 varieties, and now, even with the losses, I had to transplant about 250 plants to new beds, and have at least that many in the bed where I planted 75.  This is after I cut runners all year last year.  Now, this year, they are barely leafed out, maybe 10% have started to put on blooms, and I am already cutting new runners.  So, my question, is there a way to discourage runners before I need to pinch/cut?  Is this possibly a sign of nutrient imbalance that I need to correct?  The issue was most extreme with one of the three varieties, so it seems to be just an especially proficient variety.  For good, fresh quality fruit the constant snipping is something that can be lived with, but I have tones of other plants to care for, so I am very open for ideas, so if someone can say, hey give them a does of dandelion pollen extract (just to make something up) and they will back off, I would love to hear such ideas. "
2608,U Post Espalier?,"I bought some dwarf apple trees which will arrive this spring (Red Rome and Honeycrisp). I intend to espalier both, side by side on the south side of my garage.  I am reading up on methods for espalier but everything I've found talks about wall mounting. I would prefer not to drill a bunch of holes in my garage if I can avoid it.  I expect to use three posts spaced 8' apart and showing 4' above ground.   I've looked at 4x4 and U posts as potential options. I would likely get 6 foot posts and bury them 2 feet. What I'm trying to understand is:   How much pressure are the trees going to exert on the posts?   Are U posts still going to need some form of external support like an L bracket attached to the garage? Would I need concrete footers for a 4x4?   "
2609,What kind of seed is most suitable for my lawn?,"I am trying to figure out what seed is best for my lawn.  I need to over seed -  really, really bad.  And I am unsure what the majority type of grass I have I believe it is Fescue and Centipede (A lot of weeds ton include white clover, dandelion, henbit, and crab grass type weeds).  I live just North of Charlotte, NC in Mooresville, NC.  I am in Zone 8 of this map - [website]I have attached some pictures to help explain my situation.  Not to mention I have the NHOA on my back - 'Nazi Home Owners Association' on my back.  I love fescue, but it dies in the heat and the majority is becoming centipede, so how to rid my yard of fescue and just let the centipede take over?  Pictures coming soon.  (If I am wrong about the type of grass please let me know)  Fescue  Fescue with dormat centipede  More centipede  Centipede  "
2610,"How can I remove locust eggs from the soil, and prevent future infestations?","A few days ago I saw a locust standing still in my little vegetable garden. I was really surprised that even though I went close it wouldn't jump away.  After looking closer I figured that it was actually ""pumping"" eggs into the soil (check this link for more details).  This morning just before watering I found find this pattern of holes, of similar size of the one that the locust left the previous time.    I have a few questions:   Since they are 1 day recent and I guess not really visible, how deep should I dig to make sure all eggs are removed? How can I make sure that all eggs die, if in the process of digging I miss some? Should I spray the ground with something? And if yes what do you suggest (considering I also grow edible vegetables)? How can I stop this locust from coming back and laying eggs in my garden? Is there any natural product that will keep it away? If not natural what should I use (again considering I grow edible vegetables)?  "
2611,how different manures perform in a garden,"I was just thinking, how do different manures from animals perform in a garden? Since each animal has different digestive systems and different meals I would think the manure is very different, say comparing a chicken to a cow.   So the question, how do different animal's manure perform in a garden? What is better and what shouldn't be used? "
2612,"The ""phosphorus"" question","Somebody just asked me a question that I had a hard time answering, so this is more or less their question which I am repeating.  When it comes to gardening, plants need phosphorus (P). And they asked if it was bad since there are products (say toilet bowl cleaner) that are P free. They figured that the cleaner does not have P because it harms the environment. For me that shouldn't be true since plants need P to reproduce and grow. Maybe it something else?  How should I answer this? "
2613,What is this ground cover that looks like tiny cactus,I found this in my front yard probably grew by previous owner. I am in Pacific Northwest.    What is this plant? Do they grow larger or stay small like that? How fast do they grow to cover more ground?  They look very nice. 
2614,What are the variables I need to consider when planting my Eidelweiss?,"I've done a fair bit of research to avoid people doing work for me but I'm still a bit confused. I have purchased three Eidelweiss that have arrived a week ahead of schedule and I'm woefully unprepared.   I do know that mulch is used during the winter to simulate its native condition but.. I live in Florida and it's pretty warm this time of the year. I know this flower is hardy but I have questions in regard to planting them.  Since they are well past germination, I'm under the impression these should be planted in the ground and I need to manage conditions such as acidity of ph and drainage. What are the best ways to achieve this if they are to be planted in the ground ?  I've included an image of each plant.  One: Leontopodium Alpinium   Two: Leontopodium Alpinum Matterhorn (Rep too low to post 3 links)   I've also discovered a few bits of conflicting information such as allowing this plant to take in sun through a window versus don't you dare window sun soak!  How long can this plant grow in this pot? Should it be planted immediately? And how do I prepare my soil for these beautiful flowers?  You'll have to forgive my ignorance as I'm aware I've picked a pretty peculiar flower to start with.  By the way, are these flowers in decent shape?  Any help at all would be much appreciated! "
2615,Is this burnt from fertilizer?,"I plant this about two months ago and now it is showing yellow leaves      I think it is due to some powder-like fertilizer I put around the root (5 inches away) and bury in the compost when I planted it.  Is this some burnt effect? If not, what is it? "
2616,Laurel leaves turning gray and black,I bought a tiny laurel tree in a pot from the shop 3 months ago. It looked happy but after repotting it's starting to wither and the leaves are turning grey.  I tried changing the amount of sunlight and/or water it gets but that doesn't seem to help.  It's on the balcony of a flat facing south in London. I don't think there has been any temperature less than 0 degrees since I got it.  What's going on with it? Is it some disease?  I'm adding some pictures of the damage.     
2617,"Would it be better for me to set up my garden in the fall, or wait until spring?","I recently moved into a house with a yard, and am eager to start getting a garden started. The ground here isn't really clay, but it's not really dirt that I would want to use for gardening. It's really heavy and compact, and there are gravel-like rocks everywhere that I'm going to want to pick out.  I was thinking about tilling the ground, then spending a few weekends picking out the rocks, then mixing in some compost and topsoil to turn it into some nice garden soil. I might also add a border around it, possibly raising it a bit. Then in the spring I could maybe add more soil then plant everything as early as possible for early vegetables.  So I looked up advice on tilling gardens, and I read advice saying two different things.   That it's not a good idea to till the garden in the fall, because the snow would compact the soil.  (I do live in southern Illinois, where we don't really get much for snow, maybe a couple inches through January. So maybe that isn't something I have to worry about?) That it is a good idea to till the garden in the fall, because it gives the soil time to prepare the nutrients from the added compost.   Is there a significant benefit over doing it one way or the other? Should I do it now so the compost has time to spread nutrients into the soil? Or is it better to leave it as it is until spring, so the soil isn't exposed over the winter? "
2618,What vegetables should I grow in my raised beds in winter in Zone 9b?,"I am in Zone 9b and have 3 raised beds that I want to use during the winter season to produce something rather than leaving them idle (let me know if that is a good thing).  Should I grow vegetables and if so which one's would be best? Would root vegetables like carrots, beet, ginger germinate and grow in this weather?  How about vegetables like kale, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage?  If none of these are an option, should I just put fava beans so that I can harvest and use those to enrich my compost? "
2619,Is there an accurate way to test a mixture of multiple soils?,"Last night I started putting together a mixture of soil for blueberry plants. This mixture includes:     top-soil       garden soil       organic mushroom compost      sphagnum moss   (I also have pine bark mulch to help keep the acidity of the soil)  I have some soil acidifier that I can add. So I want to test the mixture to have an idea of how much I would need to add.  So what I'm wondering, is if I test this soil mixture, how accurate would the results be? I can't imagine that I would be able to get an equal parts of each soil when I test it. Is the only answer to test the mixture several times and average the results out? "
2620,Should I water new sod in the winter?,"Part of my yard was dug up for utility work. They filled it in and put sod down. I'm in US Midwest and winter is upon us. The low temperatures have just recently begun dipping below freezing, highs are still above though. Should I water the new sod? If so how much water and for how long? "
2621,What are these lines on tomato leaves?,"I have planted some tomatoes in my garden.  The plants have started showing white lines as shown in the picture. Is this some disease? If yes, What kind of disease is this? Is it safe to eat tomatoes from this plant?     "
2622,How long does mulch last?,"Our house is in need of mulch around bushes, trees etc. We are finally getting around to address this, and have calculated we need two yards to get around 2 inches of mulch onto everything. We live in the northeast and get a lot of snow.   Is it best to wait until next spring? If we choose black mulch, will it degrade too much where we just need more next spring?  Or does it last a couple of seasons and only requires ""sprucing"" up.   We accept the previous owners did not do much and the landscape requires a lot of work and maintenance, but we also do not want to put in all the work of covering everything in mulch only to have to do it again in 6 months.   Can anyone enlighten me to how long mulch roughly lasts?  Also is 2 inches a good amount, too much? too little?  "
2623,Making an outdoors wick-watering system for tropical plants,"I'm considering a wick-watering system for few plants which need more water than the plants I have in the same area. The location is shaded, and the plants are on shelves.  Types of pants - Begonias; Don't own any yet, I'm considering adding them to my collection.  Climate - Mediterranean, zone 11. Summer is dry (no rain) but the air is humid.  Potting mix - Mostly peat. Other ingredients (perlite, vermiculite, pumice, etc) may be added if you recommend it.  Watering system - A water tray sits under the planter. The planter is above the water line, so that the drainage holes never touch the water. An overflow outlet will not allow the drainage holes to submerge even after a heavy rain. The only way the water reaches the planter is via a wick that comes out through the drainage holes down to the bottom of the tray.  Water quality - I have access to ample source of A/C water runoff, so that water does not contain any salts which may accumulate. Liquid fertilizers are added to the water that fills the trays.  Quality - All components are standard, i.e. I will use planters, not old buckets. Wicks will be made out of ropes, not old rags, A tray will be flat at the top, so that the planter will fit right on top of it, leaving no gaps. An overflow outlet will be the only outlet for water drainage, mostly for rain water    How well, or how bad, will my watering system perform given the following:   Rope material: I'm intending to use a non-degradable material. Which material, and which filament size I should use for a good capilary action? Is rock-wool a good choice, and if so, are there rock-wool ropes on the market? How wet will the potting mix become, assuming the water in the tray has not yet been used-up? Will I have soggy conditions, moist and aerated soil, or water barely reaching the bottom of the planter? Is a standard potting mix suitable for such use? Should I amend the mix with other ingredients, like Perlite, pumice or Vermiculite?  "
2624,Is it normal for a newly grown fig foliage to hang down like this?,"This particular foilage just grew out pretty fast. But it's hanging down. It's soft; as they all are when they first start growing, but I don't remember if I've ever seen them hanging down. The stalk at the bottom is very strong and where the hanging foiliage is; is soft. I'm assuming that it's still growing. Also, how can I add another fig to the pot? Can I cut off any part of the fig and pot it inside the pot? Can this plant handle a humidifier? I keep it under a humidifier from time to time. Any help?  UPDATE I've changed the pot to a ceramic pot and also changed the dirt. Now for some reason, my fig is dropping. I've had it in the sun; when the sun comes out. Hoping my plant isn't in the process of dying. I've attached a picture of how it currently looks now.   UPDATE #2Starting from the 5th picture, this is now how it is looking. Seems to me like its dying.                        "
2625,Weak Tomato Seedlings 3 weeks in,I planted tomato seeds into a seed starting tray (one of those 72 pro hex ones) on May 8th and they germinated after only about 4-6 days. They've been growing well under led shop lights and I've been watering daily but recently have started flopping over and being weak. Why is this happening and how do I fix it? Is it possible they need to be put into a larger container at this point? The leaves look healthy enough and they've been growing under an led light for 16 hours a day. 
2626,What kind of stone/surface can I grow moss on?,"If I'm trying to grow moss on a stone sculpture, is there anything I should be on the look out for?   I'm thinking of certain chemicals or other toxins that might be in some sculptures. Does the statue have to be rough?  Would moss be able to attach to a glazed statue? Would a concrete statue be OK?   I might just be being paranoid and moss might grow in anything. "
2627,Rosemary turning yellow,"  I've moved the rosemary to this pot a month ago, and where I live, the temperature is around 28-30 degrees celsius these days and usually i water them on a daily basis.

2628,What's flying around my basil?,"I have a large pot of basil growing in my yard. The other day, I was cutting leaves for pesto, the first few minutes were ok, then a small black and silver (grey?) bee-like insect accompanied me (like it was overseeing my work). Within a few minutes there must have been about 20 of them flying around, landing on stems I had cut, as if inspecting the damage I caused. I finally left when two wasps joined them (unrelated To the ""bees,"" but I'm deathly afraid of them). The ""bees"" didn't seem to be bothered by me, rather the work I was doing. Any ideas on what they might be? "

2632,How do you transition a guava from a yard in Florida to a pot in Boston?,"My father, who lives in Florida, recently gave me a guava that was growing in his back yard.  He potted it with soil from the ground and tossed in into the back of my van to bring home to Boston.  This little stick with leaves looks pretty sad.  The leaves have wilted and dried in spite of having been watered; even the tip is dry and brittle.  The internet tells me that guavas can grow happily in containers but I'm afraid this one hasn't transitioned well from yard to pot.  Questions include: Has it past from this life? Is there no hope? What can I expect if it's not dead? How long should I wait to see if anything comes back? What can I do to encourage the little guy to pull through? In general what should I do? I have no guava experience. "
2633,Topping (ungrafting?) an ornamental weeping cherry,"We have an ornamental weeping cherry tree that we'd like to remove -- we wanted a bigger tree.   But first, we were wondering if we were to just top it (cut the tree below the graft), if we could end up with a viable (and bigger) cherry tree.  Maybe even fruiting.  The tree is about 13 years old.  The height is about 6 feet, trunk is 5 inches in diameter.  It might be a dwarf? (I'll add a picture soon.)  What is our best path for success, and what kind of tree could we expect from the rootstock?  Should I wait for Washington's Birthday before taking an axe to it?  We're in California Bay Area .. it is just starting to drop its leaves.  Edit: The graft is at the very top of the trunk. "
2634,What causes purple spots in basil?,"I have grown a lot of green basil in my life. I've had less luck with purple basil until last summer, when I was able to grow several basil species, including green (genovese) and purple (amethyst I think).  This year one of my plants is green with purple spots, similar to this:   I guessed it was a mutation from cross-pollination, but a biologist friend told me that it's more likely caused by a virus, like the tulip breaking virus.  Is this common?  Is the cause known? "

(What is this white crust forming on my cactus during the growing months? , What is this white growth on my cactus?, Cactus with a growth). If it is a duplicate let me know and I will delete the question.)  I bought this cactus ""gimmick"" plant from Trader Joe's last October. I thought it was cute and I didn't expect the cactus to last. Here is it almost April and it is still alive – but it has these white growths as shown in the photo.  The growths are fuzzy and soft to the touch. I'm assuming they are not a ""good thing"" but should I just pull and scrap them off? Is it a fungus?  While I am here: the ""medium"" the cactus is planted in is some sort of hard sand-like material (like sand mixed with glue). This makes it hard to know if the plant needs water. I usually end up pouring water in and then turning the pot over to drain out any excess. Is there some better way to care for this sort of ""gimmick"" plant?   "

2641,What to do about carrots that don't seem to be growing?,"It's my first time growing carrots and the leaves don't seem to have grown in the last fortnight.  I'm worried that there's something wrong but there're no obvious problems as the leaves are still green and there's no wilting.  The soil is mostly loose and sandy with no stones so the only potential issue there may be nutrients but I read that adding some would cause forking if I wasn't careful.  The plants are about 9cm apart from each other, which I'm told is enough (and I've read that transplanting them can cause some problems at this point anyway).  Is it possible that all the energy is going into the roots? Can I check for pests attacking the carrot itself without digging it up?  Edit: It has indeed been hot for quite a while here. "
2642,ID pine by cones and seeds,"Can anyone ID a pine by its cones and seeds only? I collected some cones for seeds (starting material for bonsai). I know of a little field in the outer regions of Amsterdam, where there are some pine trees. According to the tree map (published by the municipality) the field contains as well Pinus sylvestris as Pinus nigra trees. However, I couldn't see any difference between the trees, for me they all seemed the same species.  Is there anyone here with a trained eye that can distinguish both species based on the cones and seeds?     "

2645,How much soil do I need on top of my hugelkultur beds?,"I'm building a bunch of hugelkultur beds from the blowdowns, branches, trimmings, and sticks we have scattered around the property. This weekend I built a 20' long, 5' wide, 2-3' high pile of (mostly old / half rotted) wood of various sizes (0.5"" - 8"" dia). It's a mix of species: pine, hemlock, maple, beech, birch (possibly small amounts of others). Other beds will be roughly the same dimensions and wood mix. This bed is not (and none of the others will be) trenched -- digging in this location is too much work because of rocky soil and/or ledge outcroppings. This bed is on a slope -- perhaps 5-8% -- some of the others will be steeper and a couple will be nearly flat. It's built across the slope, but not perfectly on contour so that water can flow (slowly) around it and downhill beds can get some water.  A selection of these plants will end up in these beds.  I plan to cover the beds with composted horse manure and soil. (Probably more the latter than the former, since horse manure is easier to come by than soil.)  The compost is mostly horse manure with wood-based bedding. The soil is loamy/silty with gravel mixed in. I won't have time/resources to screen the quantity of soil required, so all but the largest rocks will end up in the beds.   How deep does the soil/compost layer need to be? Is there a mix/ratio of soil to compost that I should aim for? Is it better to layer soil and compost or to blend them? (If layering, in which order?)  "
2646,How do I know when to harvest my potatoes?,"I'm sure I've heard before that the time to harvest potatoes is when the flowers fall off. Is that right or is it more complicated than that? For example, does it differ based on climate or variety, etc.? "

I moved home and planned to buy new plants. I don't want the new plants to get infected with the disease, so I got the Baby Bio house plant insecticide spray - but the instructions are not clear about how to use it, and I'm not finding any instructions online, so hopefully I can find help here. My question is how to safely use Baby Gio house plant insecticide spray? I'm sure this is toxic and should use outdoors, but it's 2C ~ 8C at the time I wrote this post, and surely the plant is going to die if I leave it outside. So, what to do?

It is the first time that I have used such a product and I have a rather novice question as a result. Which way up should I be placing the capillary matting on my surface?  The matting in question has a white fence fluffy side and a blue-green mesh like membrane side.     The instructions go over the basic setup but do not suggests which way up I should place the matting.    This question extends to the tail which is placed in the water reservoir. Should it be placed with the sides matching that of the main matt or should it be placed with a certain side up?  I have put a waterproof layer of plastic under the mat. If I find it drying out rapidly or my greenhouse becomes too humid, I'll put a layer of gravel or plastic ontop of the watering mat too. "

2657,What if the seeds sown outdoors are covered by a transparent cover in the initial stage?,"I recently started Echinacea angustifolia from seeds indoors, and I noticed an incredible speed and reliability of germination achieved just by covering the seed tray with transparent plastic sheet (the seedlings appeared in just 5 days, germination rate 70%-80%). The cover was removed after 5 days, when seedlings appeared en masse.  Can a similar method be applied if the seeds are sown outdoors, directly in the garden? I mean, covering the area where the seeds are sown with some transparent cover for few days, or until germination? Or perhaps I don't see some bad side effects of doing that? "

2659,Ficus lost 80% of leaves over the course of November,"I've had a 3-foot variegated indoor Ficus tree (F. Benjamina to be exact) for two months now. The first month was uneventful, but over the course of the last month (November) it has lost most of it's leaves (about 80%). Is this normal? Is it dead? I understand that Ficus is very sensitive to change and it's normal to lose a few leaves, but this seems extreme.  Here are the conditions:   I water it once every two weeks, until water flows through the bottom--about two cups. The indoor temperature has been somewhat stable, dropping from 23C to 21C over the course of November. The plant is not near any radiator or drafts, except for the balcony door that is only ever opened momentarily and quite infrequently (0C outside) The plant gets some partial direct sunlight, but only during a short period: about 4 hours in October, closer to 2 in November. That being said we've only had maybe 5 sunny days all November. There are no signs of yellow leaves. About half that fell off still looked green and healthy. Furthermore, I didn't find any signs of disease or pests. The leaves are fully intact. Some where a bit dried out, but these were mostly leaves that got caught in branches and hadn't been cleaned up.   Has anyone else had a similar experience? "
2660,Should rain water be allowed to flow directly into greenhouse?,"I see a lot of talk about storing rain for later use in a greenhouse... But what about letting the rain flow into the greenhouse instead of storing it?  If a small 6'x9' greenhouse has gutters, would there be more harm than good if the gutters somehow diverted water inside?  I'm thinking of a pipe or hose that directs water from the gutters and brings it inside and then uses a soak/drip irrigation hose to administer it to the plants.   "
2661,How many flowers can a single muscari plant grow?,"My muscari(s) are flowering, with one stalk each, but I found a new bud coming out from the base of each muscari.

I've had it for about four months and seen some pretty substantial growth - 4-6 inches of overall height and many many new shoots (including that random one that points down for no reason).  I'm sort of dumb at plants, but I'm determined to make this one thrive. How will I know when it's outgrown its little pot? What size pot should I move it into? What sort of soil should I move it into? Can I get rid of that moss around the base, or is it functional somehow?  "
2664,"Any problems (plant health, structural longevity, etc?) with planting bamboo in a steel planter?","--- UPDATEs per feedback (from both StackExchange and Reddit) ---  a. Bamboo species is ""clumping growth,"" not ""running"" flavor. We don't have concerns about it ""escaping."" Does this change any perspectives about the rhizomes warping the steel planters?  b. Bottom of all the planters is open, not closed.  c. The pictured planter is NOT the one where we're placing the bamboo.  d. Low-VOC paint, if any, will only be applied to the INSIDE walls of the planter.  --- Original post format, with above modifications ---   Will large clumping-growth bamboo such as Graceful Bamboo (Bambusa textilis gracilis) warp or disfigure steel planters (see below) over a long period of time (think 10 or more years)? NOTE: the bamboo species will NOT be any of the ""running"" patterns. Do steel planters negatively impact the health of bamboo over time, especially when compared to cedar wood planters? Planter specifications: the bottom of these planters is open, not closed. The planters will be 3' (3 feet) tall, 2' wide and about 35' long. There will be significant internal bracing for said steel planters, similar or same to the planters shown in the photos below.  The ""Graceful"" species has canes about 1"" wide and can reach 30'+ tall, though I am not expecting this given the restrictions of the planters.  They are currently 17' tall with more than a dozen canes in their containers (before being planted). Is low-VOC paint or similar treatments (see below) helpful to protect the INSIDE WALLS ONLY (we love the look of the rusted-steel exterior and will not paint over it) of the steel planter from contact with soil and plant roots?  Will this paint prolong the life of a steel planter? Reiterating, the low-VOC paint/root block liner/polyiso foam is only for the interior of the planter. So the question is whether any liner/sprayed product would extend the life of the planter itself and thus be worth the added time/expense. Note: to match the other steel accents throughout the back yard, the planter walls will be vertical. The pictured planter below is NOT the one that will house the bamboo.  The photos shown are simply to provide an example of what the planters will look like (although they will be in the same backyard as the photo-ed planters). The planters that will hold the clumping bamboo have not yet been built. And the bamboo planters will not be adjacent to the pool. Any other considerations to make in addition to the points above with regards to both long-term a) bamboo health and b) steel-planter structural integrity?   Geographic location: south-central Texas, USA.  Low-VOC paint:   [website][website]Again, the following planters are EXAMPLE photos, and NOT the planters that will house the bamboo.    "

Starting mid-last summer our tree began yellowing.   We've called an arborist out to the house but the advice has been pretty useless.  (Advice was to turn off all yard sprinklers near the tree and nothing else to recommend. We did this and if anything the tree seemed to be getting sicker.)  Here are the symptoms:   Most leaves are turning yellow and very few leaves at top of tree. The fruit is smallish relative to past season. The bark is peeling starting from the base of the trunk and going up.   We have supplemented with Iron/Magnesium solution per directions on package (1% by volume) two times over two months, total volume of 2.5L poured around base tree and roots. This has not seemed to help the color.  I measured the soil pH and best as I can tell from the kit it seemed normal within range for citrus trees. Also, there seems to be a green mossy color on the branches.  We're not sure if this has always been there or if it's getting worse.  Questions for StackExchange include.   What is wrong with our tree? What is causing the bark to peel?  Is this ""collar rot""?  Something else? Are the yellow leaves related to the peeling bark at base of tree? How can we fix the bark, the leaves. Basically, how do we save the tree?   We're not gardeners but we love this tree... please help if you can! Any advice, questions or treatment options?

2675,What is the ideal onion spacing/layout?,"I purchased some onions to plant in a small planter on my apartment balcony. The planter also contains some lettuces/greens, parsley, basil, and sage. The onions came in a little box as nursery plants do, sprouted with long green stems, with perhaps 15 onion plants packed in very tightly, one next to the other. So far, I have transferred the onions from the little box directly into my planter as-is, but I feel this might not be right and wanted to get some advice.  My hope is to continuously harvest the greens of the onions, for use in salad, eggs, whatever, and occasionally harvest young onions when I want a bit more kick. If a few make it all the way through to mature onions, great.   What would be the best way to lay out these onions? Should I leave them in a clump, separate them out a little, spread them through the planter as singletons? "
2676,How far back should you prune rambling roses with lots of old/diseased wood?,"I have a rambling rose (or maybe climbing, I'm not too sure) that has a lot of old or possibly diseased wood. I've read that it's good to remove old wood, but since both main stems have old wood at the base this would mean cutting it back right down to the base.  So, for a rose in this condition should you cut back close to the base? If not, then how much?     "
2677,Can I plant Morning Glory at any time (in USDA Zone 10)?,"It's late Jan now. I want to plant a climbing vine on my second-floor, east-facing, balcony railing to give a little shade in the morning. Come Spring and all through to the Fall, that morning sun shines through the balcony windows and turns my apartment into an oven. I'm cooked well-done before noontime. I live just a few miles South of Los Angeles, Zone 10? I'm wondering if I can get a jump on growing this thing in Feb before I start sweating it out in the Spring? I thought that I should ask before I start stringing wire to the rafters or buying/making planters. I'm quite ignorant of gardening stuff. My mom and dad would be kinda disappointed.  "

2679,What is the fastest way to multiply snowdrops?,"I would like to multiply my snowdrops as fast as possible. I have about five plants right now. They normally double in size every year. Is there a faster way to do it? They are a little small for twin-scaling. What would the best method be? Would different conditions make them multiply faster? The bulbs are a bit small to propagate the way I do daffodils, but are a similar shape.   Edit: The plants now have green grape like fruits. Is it practical to save seeds, and if so, how?    "
2680,How long should a garden tractor battery last?,It seems like every year I'm needing to buy a new battery for my lawn tractor. A battery that worked perfectly well never seems to make it through the off-season in-tact.   Is this normal? Is there something I could do to make them last more than one season? 
2681,Can I trim my canary palm trunk or is it a lost cause?,"Below is a canary palm in my front yard:   I had a tree trimming service some out and trim away the branches. They didn't do anything to the trunk though - I asked them to come back out, and the guy said that the trunk couldn't be trimmed because it's gotten into such a bad condition, which seemed plausible I guess. The trunk is very ""sheddy"", as in, I can put on gloves and grab a handful of the trunk and it just tears away. He said he could put his hand about a foot into the shedding, and if we tried to trim it, there'd be nothing but softness on the inside (and I guess not safe?).   I was probably expecting something more like this - clean and trimmed to the core:   So my question is this: Is my canary trunk a lost cause? Or was he giving me the run around? He also said to trim the green bush on the trunk, I'd have to call a landscaper not a tree trimming service. Does this all sound right? "
2682,Has anybody had any success using 5 gallon buckets as planters?,"I've recently became interested in starting some outdoor planters this coming spring.  After searching around, I found an interesting idea off of Popular Mechanics using 5 gallon drywall buckets as planters.  What appealed to me was the low cost to setup and more space (depth-wise) for plants to grow.    My questions is: Has anybody has success with using a 5 gallon buckets as planters?  If so, what setup would you recommend as far as soil type/composition, fertilizers, placement, other tips, etc?   For what its worth, I am think of growing green-leafy herbs like mint or basil and tomato plants.  I live in Grand Forks, ND (USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 4, more climate info here).  Any help or reference would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks in advance!  EDIT: Also, I forgot to mention that I live in an apartment/townhouse building (front and back door but no porch/yard) with not a lot of room out back.  I may be able to fit in a self watering system with the kiddie pool, but would prefer individual buckets lined against the apartment wall.  Sorry for any confusion! "
2683,Can urine return moisture-holding capacity to the soil?,"I've been urinating on dead lawns for a while. I consider myself an expert. In my home town we've been having a drought for some time; yet I had great success there, turning dried out, dying areas of lawn into veritable blue-green jungles. But in Cape Town, where I now am, the drought is very severe indeed, and the soils appear for all intents and purposes to be dead.  Grass is a hardy thing though, and clings to life in corners and behind walls and between bricks. Those roots systems can be encouraged if you concentrate your efforts in one area, and I've done exactly that to some (smaller degree of) success. These can then sprout a whole new lawn, in time.  I've noticed an interesting thing in these wasted-away soils. If I urinate, after a litre or two, I've observed this dark patch which does not seem to recede. It is as if the soil begins to STAY moist. Oddly, this applies even if I then leave that patch for weeks afterward. What could be causing this?  A lot of soil health relies on fungi and bacteria. Could it be that spores / dormant bacteria in the soil are awakening and creating a new web of life, using the nutrients (proteins), minerals (salts, ammonia) and water in the urine? "
2684,How do I control fire ants in the mulch around my tree?,"I live in Houston, TX, USA and fire ants are a nearly year long concern.  I have had success treating mounds with Orthene as they appear.    However, I had a Siberian Elm in my backyard that was infested with fire ants and I never managed to kill the colony.  I could suppress it for a bit, but I would see a new mound within days.  Not long after I started treating the tree and mulch around it regularly, it died (I've removed it since).  It was near the end of it's lifespan (likely 30 years old).  Now I have a colony just starting up on a tree in my front yard (likely an elm as well, though it's much bigger than the other).  In addition, my two year old loves this tree and plays around it constantly.    Here are my questions:   Can Orthene harm my tree?  Even over repeated dosages (a few tablespoons a month)?   Is there a better pesticide that is less likely to harm the tree and my child?  The Orthene is effective, but it is quite nasty.  "
2685,"Can I plant peas, green beans and lettuce this early?","The weather this year has been exceptionally mild here in northern Illinois, and I am thinking of planting my peas, green beans and lettuce in the next couple weeks. This is probably a full four weeks earlier than normal, but honestly, I don't think the ground is even frozen anymore. I am willing to accept that a serious event could kill back the plants, but would it be worthwhile to get so much extra growing season? What else might I be able to get in early this year? (I don't do tomatoes or peppers from seed usually...I buy flats of seedlings) "

2692,Best practices on pruning and winter protection for climbing roses,"We have two climbing roses.We inherited this from the previous owner of our house.  Last year we pruned them quite short in the fall and banked them, just like we did with the rest of the roses (grandifloras, ramblers, etc)  The rest of the roses flowered in springtime and summer, the climbing roses just grew taller and taller.   I have learnt now that one should train the climbing roses by bending the main stalks horizontally to promote side stalks, which is where the flowers will appear. I am looking forward to try this.  My questions are:   Should I get rid of most of the woody stiff stalks and keep only the new bendy ones? Please notice all these stalks grew this year, but some grew right at the beginning of spring so they are quite thick and tall and some grew later in the season, so they are thinner and shorter. Should I do this pruning now (end of fall, November) or should I wait for springtime? Should I bank the bottom of the climbing roses so they are protected during winter, just like we bank the other ones? Any other winter protection measure I should consider?   I live in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  Thanks in advance! "
2693,Does aspirin really help tomatoes grow?,"Something that I've heard quite regularly† is that when you plant your tomatoes, you should put an aspirin under each plant. Apparently salicylic acid both increases the number of blooms and strengthens the plant's immune system.  I've been unable to find any references for studies done on this. Nor have I found it discussed on some of the sites or in books that I find more trustworthy.  So, does anyone know of any good references for this? Does anyone have an explanation of why aspirin in particular helps tomatoes?   † Some website references: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc...  "

2696,Is there a snake repellent plant that can prevent snakes from entering a backyard or house?,"I have read about the Sansevieria trifasciata, commonly called ""snake plant"", in Wikipedia (which doesn't suggest any specific snake repellent property).   However, this link suggests that the snakes don't like the appearance of S. trifasciata and they will start avoiding it the moment you plant it in your garden.  How can this plant be helpful, and to what point can we can rely on a plant to keep snakes away? Are there other plants that repel snakes? "
2697,What is wrong with this Norway spruce?,"This Spruce tree is very odd. I have a few questions about it. First of all, how did the branch segment pictured below grow there? It grows right out of the smaller trunk into the larger one, without branching. This segment increases in diameter each year, like a normal branch. My second question is, how did this tree get its branching habit? It is very unusual for a norway spruce to grow that way. The lower branches are extremely strongly developed, and curve upward until they are growing parallel to the trunk. The lowest branches grow to within ten feet of the top. The tree is very vigorous and spreading. Why does it grow this way?         "
2698,Is this sunburn or something else?,"I've put my cacti for wintering into an unheated attic, by a window where the sun falls after 2 P.M and till dusk. Since it's negative temperature outside (so it's already winter in a sense) I didn't expect the sun to be strong enough for a burn (especially considering the windows are dusty). But there you go, a couple of days ago I noticed these yellow spots on my Mammillaria sp.   Is this sunburn or something else? Is it treatable?   "
2699,Is it safe to use vegetables which have experienced several frosts?,"Most people are aware that once you've had foods out of the freezer and allowed them to thaw, you shouldn't put them back in your freezer.  But what about frost hardy plants like leeks?  I've just harvested some old onions, leeks and carrots and who knows how many times they've been frozen in the ground, then thawed out.  Is this OK? "
2700,How can I keep ants off of my hummingbird feeder?,"I have a hummingbird feeder hanging from the side of my carport, and I noticed today that ants had discovered it. Since it's right next to my house, I don't really want the ants learning that there's food around, and they keep drowning in the nectar which seems to be driving the hummingbirds away as I've seen less of them around since the ants discovered it.  I placed some tape around the hook that the feeder is hanging from, thinking that maybe they would stick to it then stop coming, but it's not sticky enough for them I guess because they walked right over it.  I do have another hook a couple feet away that's holding a bird feeder, so would it work if I just switched them every few weeks you think? How can I keep the ants away?   "
2701,Are lichens healthy for trees?,"I've always thought lichens were neutral to tree health, and I think they are attractive, but someone recently told me to get rid of them, because they will cause rot and harbor disease. Do they really do that? Is that why so many trees have hollow centers? "
2702,"What do globe amaranth seeds look like, and can I harvest them from dried flowers?","During this past summer I grew a plant with beautiful small, round, bright purple flowers that looked like puffballs. I was told it's called Globe Amaranth. Its height was about six inches, and much of what I read said they're generally much taller. That probably depends on the variety, so I'm comfortable with the identification. I believe it's a perennial in some areas, but is considered an annual here in Massachusetts, zone 6a.  Three weeks ago I picked the last two flowers and brought them in for the purpose of harvesting seeds. I ignored them and they dried without losing their color, so I put them in a container on a shelf in my living room.  Even after an internet search, I don't actually know what the seeds look like or where they're located, so that's my first question. My second is, now that the flowers are dry, are there still viable seeds? Finally, if so, can I leave them alone for six months until it's time for germination?  If there's a general rule of thumb for whether or not a dried flower can store seeds, I'll gladly ask that as a separate question!  "
2703,Edible Plants for Rockery,"So in my new allotment, I have a large mound (approx 2.5m diameter, 1m high) of turf sods which has over time become a solid hill of dry, reasonably fine soil with grass and weeds covering it. It's taking up good space on the allotment, so I wanted to see if I can make it worthwhile otherwise I will just level it.  It's oval shaped, with oval aligned East/West facing so there is good slope exposed to sun. As it is so raised, it's quite dry from sun and wind. Since it's sunny and dry, I was thinking perhaps I could create a rockery (that and the allotment has more flint than soil) but I'm not sure what edible plants I could grow on it.  What kind of edible, and worth eating, plants (veg, fruit or herbs) would grow well in these conditions, or is any suggestion going to be a compromise and leveling it out always the better option? I'm guessing herbs like rosemary, lavender?  Thoughts?  EDIT: There is another hidden benefit in that the mound is also partially hollow (people stealing the good, sifted soil). The hollow section could be a great place to grow mushrooms. "
2704,How should I cut an Aloe vera plant for extracting juice?,I am about to buy an Aloe vera plant for extracting its juice. I have heard that a leaf needs to be cut so that juice can be extracted from it.  My questions are:   How should I cut the leaf without too much damage to the plant? How much leaf is needed for 1 tablespoon of juice? How frequently can I cut the leaves?  How long will the plant be able to survive if I go on like this?   I wish to keep this Aloe vera plant alive permanently (for a long time) in my house so that I can extract juice as needed.

2706,How are Frangipani (Plumeria) cuttings taken successfully?,"I have a Frangipani which has been hacked to bits (thanks previous owner) and now the flowers are around 2 metres (7 feet) above the ground. Below that it is just a single leafless, flowerless stalk.  I would like to take cuttings and turn it into several smaller plants.  Here's where the questions start:   What is the best size for a cutting? ie. What will be most likely to survive.  Should the cuts be straight or at an angle?  Should I treat the cuttings in some way or can I just stick them in a pot?  How long should I wait before planting the potted cuttings?   Are there any other tips or advice that will help them thrive? "

2709,Potential cause for wilting plum tomatoes in hydroponics system? (see picture),"You'll find two photos below.  The first photo is of a plant that isn't doing too well, and is clearly wilting (though still hanging in there) despite being in a similar state for almost two weeks now.   The second photo is of a more recently ""moved"" from soil sapling to the hydroponics system that although it isn't doing too well, at least is showing signs of some new leaves appearing. Though it is leaning quite a bit (looks like it's towards a secondary source of indirect light coming through the windows; though it isn't particularly strong).  Now, it is very possible that the cause of this is nutrient imbalance, I don't have a good grasp on nutrient balance, but in the past, I've managed to grow some fairly large plum tomato plants on the same nutrient mix, so I'm hesitant with just assuming that this is the issue.  The thing that is very different from that point is the fact that I'm using indoor growing lights right now, and it's possible that it's simply not enough light exposure? I'm not sure if there are any particular signs I should look out for that would indicate this? It's a 40W led lamp situated roughly 0.5m (20 inches) above the actual hydroponics ""rig"".   What do you guys think? I'm obviously doing something wrong. "
2710,Should I seal the wounds where limbs were removed on a crape myrtle?,"I have a crape myrtle that I attempted to transplant last spring. Unfortunately, it didn't do so well (I damaged more of the roots than I intended), and while it did leaf out last year, after a long cold winter I thought for sure it was dead.  But, to my surprise, around June of this year, it started to leaf out just a little, and we even got some flowers! I've trimmed off all the dead wood (which, unfortunately, was most of the plant), and I'm hoping and praying for the best.  It occurred to me that every pruning wound, or place that I cut off deadwood, is a potential avenue for bugs or pathogens to invade the plant, which would be bad news in its already weakened state. Is it a good idea to seal off the ends somehow? If so, with what? I have a wax sealant intended for use on hardwood decking. Is that, or another product, a good idea? "

2713,Is my cactus being under watered?,"  I’ve had my cactus for over a year now. I bought it late winter/early spring (February/March?) and from the time I bought it to around a month ago it had very stunted growth and didn’t grow any new spines. I used to water it roughly every 3 weeks, because I I knew that cacti don’t need watering as much as other houseplants. However, in the past 2 months I’ve increased this to every 2 weeks and it has grown new spines and significantly increased in height. I was happy to see this of course, but the new stem looks really thin compared to the lower half. Do I need to increase its water intake even more?  Also if anyone can tell me what species or family my cactus belongs to I’d be really grateful! "
2714,Yellowing Zucchini Sadness,"First time gardener, I planted Zucchini seeds into seed starting trays May 8th, and they've been growing quite nicely ever since. Past few days the leaves have started turning like a dry yellow with the leaves also feeling dry. I think I water it enough but suspect that they are too small for the little 72 cell tray.  My question is: are my suspicions correct? Are they too big for their current growing location and if yes, I have been trying to harden them off a bit every day, so I transplant them outside or do I start into a bigger container first?  "
2715,Redwood planter - Should I treat it and how?,"I just built a nice planter in my garden,    and would like to plant some flowers and edible vegetables (i.e. corn, tomatoes and more). Should I treat the wood and how?  Let me add a few details:   It's made of heart redwood I live in San Gabriel, CA. Not very rainy or cold all year through.   I've been talking to different people and finding info on the internet but none seem to converge to a standard and recognized practice.   Some say that redwood does not rot and the only reason to treat it is to prevent it from freezing and cracking once it absorbs water. Others say that you should treat it otherwise it will rot and stain. Another option I was suggested was to use a plastic liner, especially if I want to plant edibles I shouldn't treat it and the plastic liner will prevent it from rot and stain. (But I feel that putting a liner inside would defeat purpose...)   Can anybody please help me figure out which, between all these options (or others if you have any), is the most reasonable thing to do? Considering I would like it to last at least 2/3 yrs and have vegetables growing in it.  Thanks for your assistance!  "

2717,Methods for saving amaryllis bulb infected with narcissus bulb fly,"One of my amaryllis bulbs is infected with the narcissus bulb fly : ( It was planted and it started seeing white mould forming around the bulb. I took the bulb out and sure enough it was starting to rot on its side. By pressing on the decayed area I found a maggot.  I know most people recommend discarding the bulb, but I rather try to save it. The damage seems to be mostly on the outside layers, since it is a big bulb. I know most likely the mother planted two eggs on the bulb, though, so there might be another maggot eating away the bulb where I can't see it. So my questions are:   Has anyone actually saved an infected bulb? What method was used? If I use the method of soaking the bulb in hot water (43c - 44c) for 40 minutes, do I need to keep the water constantly at that temperature?  Can I cut the decayed part of the bulb (mostly on its outside) and plant it again? Wouldn't it rot (like it was doing before) not having its protective layers? I have seen some people slice the bulb completely to get the worm out but I could not find a description of the whole method. How does this method work? Can I plant the halves afterwards?   Thanks in advance. "
2718,Pepper Seedlings,"Planting regular ole' bell peppers from seeds and have them growing in a seed starting tray.  I sowed the seeds a month ago and the plants haven't gotten big, especially when compared with the tomatoes I planted at the same time.  Wondering when do I transplant them outside?

2719,Rex begonia dropping young leaves,"I have a rex begonia (escargot variety) that was just moved to a new location in the house (from a sunny window to under a lit shelf).  I've noticed that it has started to drop very young leaves after the leaf and ~1/2 of the stem turn brown and shrivel.  Is this anything to be concerned about? I would like it to continue growing -- is there a way to encourage the leaves to stay?    It is watered once every 3-4 days (when beginning to wilt), lives in light soil, under medium artificial light, in 70-80F temperatures and medium humidity.    A couple of photos as requested: [website]"
2720,What are the pros/cons of different mulches?,"I know there will be differing opinions on this subject, from different people. I, for one, have always used bark mulch, and can attest to the fact that when used properly, it will build soil and grow healthier plants (ime).I have also heard that a layer of plastic, covered by gravel, is the best mulch. To me, it seems that this can only depreciate, and doesn't build soil at all, and may even leach chemicals out of the plastic into the ground. And then there are those who think that undecomposed mulches are bad, and you should go with compost. imo, compost is one of the best things you can add to soil, but doesn't take the place of mulch.  So, why are there differing opinions from experts? Shouldn't people with experience come to a similar conclusion? Or do different ways work comparatively well enough that it's pretty much whatever you like better?  Please don't answer if you feel like arguing with someone, just lay out what your reasons are for why you use the mulch you use, and your experience with that mulch. "
2721,How can i find what my soil pH is and how does it affect the plants?,"I am pretty new to gardening(~6 months); I have a small terrace space with lots of potted plants (lemon, hibiscus, some herbs etc.).  I get soil(along with vermicompost) from various nursery suppliers depending on the feasibility/availability.  To a few questions I had asked in this forum, I was asked about what pH level my soil has, I understand pH level defines that where the soil lies on scale of acid to a base.  How can I know pH level of my soil, since I have got it from different sources its quite possible that different pots have different pH values? How does it affect the plant growth?  Do I need to take any caution on preparing the soil before a plant anything?  Lot of questions I have put together, let me know if I need an edit.  Thanks for your help. "
2722,What creepers can be grown to cover an entire wall in a southern Californian climate?,"I'm planning on covering the stucco (which has a texture like this) on the back facing walls (faces west) of my house with a creeper. I'd rather the plant not grow any roots on the walls and adhere to the substrate by disks or any other similar mechanism. An obvious choice for this is the Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia), which is native to eastern and central USA. However, I'm not sure if the plant grows well in southern California (hardiness zone 10) and I'm looking for alternatives to choose from.  Some traits that I'd like are:   Flowers year-round (or as much of the year as possible). Winters are mild (8–13 ºC or 46–55 ºF) and there is no frost. Fragrant flowers are preferable, but is not a must. As mentioned earlier, the creepers must not produce root structures on the substrate or in any way damage it. Getting rid of it (if I need to, in the future) should be as simple as clipping the stems at the bottom to cut off all supply and pulling it down. Should stay flat against the wall instead of growing outwards like a hanging bush. Should be easy to maintain and not ooze sap or any other icky stuff. Should grow reasonably fast. The wall is roughly (off the top of my head) 35'x10' (a lot less if you discount for the windows &amp; patio door), and I'd like it covered within 12–18 months (24 months at most).   The general look that I'm aiming for is:    What are some possible choices that I can look into? Will my initial suggestion of Virigina creeper be a good fit for my climate? "
2723,Are clear or opaque tarps better for solarization?,"I have always used black tarps for this purpose, because weeds grow under the clear stuff for me. I may not have pinned it down close enough though. Others say clear is faster. Does this have anything to do with climate variation? Does one method work better in hot, sunny climates, and the other in a cooler, shadier place?  Here are some opinions from users on this site:   In comments to user923's answer to the question 'Is it possible to kill a large area of weeds organically/naturally?', user923, as well as Joe, recommend using black. In chris's answer to that question, he recommends using black.  In trip0d199's answer to the question 'What are some natural ways of killing ground ivy (creeping charlie)?', he/she recommends using a dark tarp. In OrganicLawnDIY's comment to that answer, he recommends using clear. In Randy's answer to the question 'How do I get rid of Crab grass in an over grown garden that will be a veggie garden next season?', he recommends using a 'covering to hide the sunlight' In stormy's answer to the question 'What is a long-term solution to a goathead infestation?', she recommends using clear. In Robert Cartaino ♦'s answer to the question 'How do I kill a butterfly bush so it stays dead?' he recommends using black. In my comment on that answer, I (J. Musser) recommended using black. In a comment to the question 'How do I kill this salt cedar?', TeresaMcgH says both will work (sounds very reasonable to me).    This is somewhat confusing. Have there been any 'scientific', unbiased studies showing that one is better than the other? I'm not really looking for personal opinions, although they may be helpful. I am looking for evidence from an authoritative source. "
2724,What plants are best for attracting butterflies to a small garden?,"How can I attract butterflies to my small garden? What flower plants are ideal for attracting them?  Details:    Garden is in a fenced backyard, faces North-East.  Not shaded, gets sunlight from about 10 am to 2 pm. Roughly a 200 square foot place. Region: Pune, Maharashtra, India.  Normal weather: 32-34o C, humidity around 55-60%.  "
2725,Compost with newspaper cuttings and orange peels,"I have started composting since last week and there are some questions which I want to ask. I have a small pot may be of 6 litres. I guess it's Bokashi composting.   I read that for composting, wet garbage and carbon sources are essential, of which carbon sources include newspaper, dry leaves, etc.  I have small potted plants so I could not get much dry leaves.  So I cut newspaper in approximate 2*2 cm squares and put that the compost.  Now after a week's time, when I was turning the compost, I saw that the newspaper had not broken down at all. What could be causing this? What do I do?  Here it is orange season so I am putting lots of orange peels in the compost.  Should I dry them before putting in or should I put them as they come?  How much time will it take for the compost to complete? How much water should I put?  "
2726,Can these non-food items be composted?,"I've seen discussions here and elsewhere, about composting news paper, cardboard, etc.  But I'm wondering what considerations to consider when composting some specific non-food items. Some of the recommendations in The Rodale Book of Composting seem a bit questionable to me.  For instance, it recommends composting newspaper, but this answer suggests the inks may be harmful.  Some items I'm specifically wondering about:   Facial tissue  I can imagine that the lotion-treated ones may not be good.  For untreated ones, are spent facial tissues safe to compost, or will they carry contagions (from blowing one's nose), or other manufacturing chemicals that would be harmful? Human hair  This is a recommendation from The Rodale Book of Composting. But is it a good idea, considering the various types of hair product many people use?  If all I use is shampoo, will my hair be safe to compost? Will it depend on which shampoo I use? Coffee filters, tea bags, paper towels, etc  With the exception of some paper towels, none of these items typically are printed (and I usually buy plain white paper towels anyway).  Are these items safe to compost? Corks  Although cork is obviously wood, it's soft enough I imagine it would decompose quickly. Are corks (from wine bottles) treated in any way that would make them unsafe to compost?  Should I avoid the ones that have logos printed on them? 100% cotton cloth  Will socks or other clothing made from 100% cotton decompose reasonably well? Are there other reasons not to compost them? Perhaps fabric dyes?  "
2727,Can put two Kahili ginger in the same pot that is 12 inches wide and 11 inches hight?,"I have two ginger plants (Hedychium gardnerianum) -- ginger plant one and ginger plant 2 -- would it be a good idea to put them both in a 12 inch wide pot that is 11 inches in height? Or should I put them each separately in their own pot of the same height and width (12 inches wide and 11 inches high)?  If I do not have to, I'd like to not unnecessarily waste soil and extra pots. "
2728,"Why aren't my potted herbs healthy, and water runs dark out of the parsley container?","I am growing spearmint and flat-leaved parsley in two 10” round containers. I water the plants a couple of times a week, and every 2 weeks or so water them thoroughly until the water drains out the bottom. The plants are not super healthy but they are ok. I keep them outside in an area with a significant amount of sun, but don’t have many locations.  My primary question is: when I water the parsley, very dark water comes out the bottom. Yet the mint the water runs almost clear. Why the difference? Both have been treated similarly, were planted in the same mix, and were only planted around 4 months ago.  Secondary questions: why might the mint be very spindly, and why might neither plant be flourishing?  Photo (note that I’ve removed most of the damaged/unhealthy foliage):   The pots do have a small hole in the bottom, so they do drain. "
2729,Is there a way to recycle old potting soil?,"When I repot all of my potted plants each year, I end up with a rather large amount of used potting soil. It seems like a waste of good organic material to take it to the landfill. Is there a way of saving and recycling it to make it usable in some way? Can it be composted? "
2730,What is the average lifespan of most maple trees?,In general how long do maple trees live?  Does the lifespan vary a lot according to species?  I'm thinking of planting a few in my yard and I'm wondering how long they will be around. 
2731,Identify this plant please (western Europe),"   This plant has started to grow in my garden (in Northern France) last fall. I decided to let it live its life, and although I have neither protected nor watered nor taken care of it in any way, it has passed the winter and thrived.  Right now it is about one meter high.  More photos : photo2;photo1;photo3;photo4  What species is it?  "
2732,What is this succulent with spined leaves with a triangular cross-section?,"A few weeks ago I got this plant from someone:    Sadly it looks like it is dying. What kind of plant is this? I have been watering it twice a week, keeping the soil moist. What did I do wrong and how can I save it? "
2733,Tea leaves for fertilizers,"As I drink quite some tea, I often wondered what to do with the remaining leaves. Googling around, I found that I could use them to fertilize plants. But from different sources, one even suggesting to let the leaves ferment in water for a couple of weeks before using the water. That leave me to some related questions:   can I simply lay the used leaves at the bottom of plants? Or should it be dried, or fermented? is it good for both house plants and outside plants? does green or black tea makes a difference?   I think that those questions are related enough to be combined. "
2734,How do I water a desk plant at my office without making a mess?,"I have decided to get a few plants for my office desk. However, one thing still eludes me.  Plant pots usually have a drainage hole to allow excess water to escape. If I keep the plant on my desk, how do I water it without making a mess?  I thought of putting another container (like a saucer) under the pot with gravel or pebbles to raise it up. But then, excess water would just remain in the saucer and maybe cause fungal growth. There is very little moving air in the office so I doubt whether it will all evaporate.  Will I need to regularly move my plant to drain/clean the outer container? That may be impractical given our ""open"" office plan and messy desks.  Am I missing something? Is there a better way that I haven't thought of? "
2735,How to protect against my neighbour's trees,"My neighbor has planted a row of pine trees along our boundary. The trees (perhaps 10 of them) will grow to 14m tall, yet are barely 4m from my house (and 2.5m from his).  The ground is heavy with clay so I'm guessing the roots will spread a distance. Between the fence and my house is a concrete driveway. He has planted the trees so close to the fence that they already push against it and they are currently only 6m tall.  To make the situation worse, my neighbor has since sold the house so the new owner may simply say it is not their problems since they bought the house that way. I have not met them yet.  So my questions:  How bad is this for me? Will the roots affect my driveway or, worse, my house?  Is there any way to protect my house against these trees? "
2736,What are the optimal growing conditions for chives?,"I have a few questions about starting chives (Allium schoenoprasum) and keeping them happy.  I understand chives can survive and grow in many conditions, but what are the best conditions?  A few points I would love answered:   What are ideal conditions for germination? Should seeds be clumped together or individually spaced out? What is the optimal soil pH/temperature? Full sun, partial sun, shade (optimally)? How aggressive should stalks be harvested? Do they spread asexually (spores, clippings) or by seed only? Should they be replanted every year or do they overwinter well? What nutrient are they heavily dependent on (if any in particular)?   Please feel free to bring up any other aspects that may be pertinent! "
2737,Why is my basil doing poorly after I split it a month ago?,"About a month ago I split my basil plant in half since I wanted to give some basil to a friend. I had never split a plant before.  During the summer and fall months I kept my plants outside on my balcony, but since it has been getting colder I brought it inside about the same time that I split it. I have been noticing that both of my plants are losing lots of their leaves and wilting over and starting to lay down. I placed them in front of my window, but I am not sure how much sun they get since my window faces east and I am gone most of the day. I also am watering my plants about every other day. What am I doing wrong? Is there any hope in saving my poor plants?  "
2738,Should dead-looking sections be removed from bulbs before planting?,"For Christmas, my daughter gave me some tulip, hyacinth and daffodil bulbs. Since they've been sitting around for quite some time in the local department store, they're in varying states and conditions. All show root growth and most have started to sprout, on the top or sides. Most still look fresh, and they're all firm to the touch, with no visible mold. Some, however, look what I would consider to be old and far beyond their prime!  It's been unseasonably warm in Massachusetts, zone 6a, and it's very exciting to have ground that's still soft enough to plant bulbs at the necessary depth on Christmas! I'd like to know how to prepare those that look really bad, to give me the best chance for success. My question is about bulbs in general, but in this case they're daffodils.    The outer layers are thick, dry and dark brown. Should I peel them away, or is  there reason to believe they may be protecting the healthy part of the bulb?  The tops are shriveled, but I can see some green down inside. Should I pinch off the dead parts, or would that risk damaging the healthy section? The roots are brown, cracked and dry, with no evidence of green. Should I cut those off, or hope that the water I give them during planting will either re-hydrate them or encourage new ones?   In the interest of full disclosure, I must say that I planted the bulbs before having time to finish this post! I tried a variety of methods with those daffodils, and will just have to wait and see. An answer to the question will still help me though, and hopefully others.  "
2739,Please..Whats wrong with my umbrella tree?,Umbrella tree plant!  The leaves grow out large and healthy looking then droop and curl...but new leaves continue to grow.! What could be the problem??enter image description here 
2740,Floppy Swedish Aspen,"All four of our 50' high Swedish Columnar Aspens have, for the 2nd year, lots of ""floppy"" branches that are, well, flopping over.  In a couple of sections near the tops, there's a long patch with no leaves or branches and then a bunch of leaves creating a puff of leaves effect.  There's no borer disease, thank God.  But why the floppy branches?  Growing too fast?   "
2741,Using grass clippings for clearing the area of existing plants,"I did first mowing this year, and have extra grass clippings. I would like to use the clippings to cover some areas, currently dominated by grass and weed, where I want to plant and sow some other plants this year, hoping that the clippings will ""choke"" existing plants and a sort of free the soil for new plants. I gather one feet high layer of clippings would be sufficient for this purpose.  For how long I have to keep the clippings layer until the plants (grass and weed) under that layer are killed, and will not appear again? A month? Three months? A year?  (to clarify more, my intention is not to keep the clippings indefinitely in that area, they will be eventually moved to a compost bin, but not until the plants below the clippings disappear, if that is possible) "
2742,What's this seed? Maple? Sycamore?,The seeds pictured below fall around my neighbourhood every Autumn (Southern Hemisphere - New Zealand). The seeds are blown over quite a vast area and I haven't been able to identify the tree(s) they're coming from (possibly on private property where I can't get near).  I suspect they're either sycamore or maple seeds but Google Images show them to both look very similar. I was hoping someone might be able to give me a more definitive suggestion.

2743,Why are the leaves on my kiwiberry curling?,"I've had this kiwiberry for about 1 year now, it's been potted the whole time.    I used regular compost potting mix, along with a handful of Osmocote fertiliser when I potted it. I water in the mornings and evenings, about 1-2 litres each time.  I also apply some Seasol once every month  I'm in Melbourne, Australia, could the dryness and heat be causing this? Am I not fertilising enough?  Thanks "
2744,What soil problem would cause fruit and vegetable to grow very small?,"One that is lawn clipping compost with a pH 6.0 where everything grows pretty well. The other garden is 40cm deep of supposedly Rich Organic Garden Soil but has a pH of 7.0. The only things that grow well in this one is Shallots, Parsnip and Carrot. What is not growing well are Tomatoes, Bell Pepper, Chili and Coriander.  Here is an image of what my Chili looks like:    What's wrong with my soil? Here is a photo of what it looks like:    I think it looks pretty rich. Could it be the pH is too high? How could I lower it if it's the case?  EDIT1:  Here is what the Parsnip looks like:    EDIT2:  Parsley:    Chili:     Bell Pepper:     16/09/2014 EDIT:  I tested the soil and it gave me some very interesting results:  N: Depleted  P: Adequate  K: Surplus  Looks like the main issue would be the lack of Nitrogen in my soil. Second issue could be a drainage problem. "
2745,What is this tall potted plant with narrow leaves and braided bark at the base?,"We recently inherited a new plant with no information about the species or location where it naturally grows.  It looks like it has been regularly trimmed by the previous owner, and I'm not sure if the braided trunk at the bottom is naturally occurring or if that was shaped by the owner.  Also, it has a height of about 1.4 meters (55 inches).  On average, there are about 6 leaflets per leaf.  Any ideas on what this plant species is?  Or any general ideas about the family or order?  Also, I'm living in the Netherlands.    "
2746,What are the best conditions for Peperomia caperata?,"This is the plant, Peperomia caperata that I like for my bedroom and living room.  Rooms have windows but receive only some daylight and no sunlight. We have to use tubelight for these rooms, all the time.  The country is India, and region is Delhi. There is 2.6 years old active toddler in the house. At night in summers we may use air conditioners.   What is the life expectancy of this plant?   Will it be better if I get the seeds and start from scratch or should I buy a grown up plant? What do I need to know and do to ensure the long life of that plant?  "
2747,What is this tan-coloured cup-shaped mushroom found in northwestern UK?,I found this tan-coloured cup-shaped mushroom growing in my back garden on the concrete behind the bin. I'm in the northwestern UK and it's been very wet here recently.     What is this mushroom? Is it dangerous? 
2748,How important is seed orientation/direction?,"What are the effects of different seed orientations on germination and further development? Could it make a significant difference in germination rate, survival, or even growth rate?  I wonder how useful it could be to point all seeds so that they emerge ""up"" in the soil, vs randomly placing them.  This question isn't tied to any specific type of plant. I imagine some species may not care, and perhaps for others it may even be critical. "
2749,How can I grow tomatoes in a pot?,"Is it possible to grow tomatoes as a pot plant? In the limited space I have I can afford pot of maximum depth = 12 cm and diameter = 12 cm. what size pot will be ideal to start with?  In India what would be the best time to plant them and how can I take care of it at later stages?  Sun is not that harsh is winters here - temperature ranges 5-35 degree centigrade, average day temperature would about 24 degree centigrade.  Plant will be placed outdoors and will get all sunlight all through the day. "
2750,What are the benefits of solarization?,I am trying to cull crabgrass from my desert yard.  I live in central Arizona.  The crabgrass will grow in intense heat and seems very robust.  It tends to grow more rapidly in shaded areas of the yard during summer but will also grow to some extent in seemingly detrimental environment conditions.  I want to get rid of any remaining crab grass as the landscaping is desert style with only indigenous plants.    I prefer to not use any chemicals.  I've done very good over the last 20 years but this one is beating me down.  I just can't seem to win.  I recently heard of solarization. What is this?  I'm not a gardener so I'm always running into terminology that is new to me.  From what I understand this is a possible solution but have no experience.   Can someone explain the benefits of solarization? Will solarization have any negative possibilities associated with it?  
2751,"If I plant strawberry plants in the fall, would I still need to pinch the flowers for the first year?","For strawberry plants, I know you're supposed to take the flowers off of them for the first year (pinch them) so that they focus on developing the plants rather than the fruits. Then the fruits following will be better because of it.  If I plant strawberries in the fall, would that be enough time for them to get established, and then they would be able to produce fruit in the following summer? Or would it still be better to pinch the flowers for that first year? They're june-bearing strawberries if that matters. "
2752,Removing the sod and seeding new for an area 24'x48' (8mx16m) - advice needed,"I have an area of 24'x48' (8mx16m) at the back at my garden which is uneven, has spots with no grass and also spots with bad looking grass.    I would like to remove it using a sod cutter and seed new grass and wait for the spring shower to soak the soil (if it does not happen I will water the area as well).  I need to understand a couple of things:   Is this a good idea - is this a good time to do it?    What steps should I go through for this (removing the old sod, dig the area to aerate and refresh the soil, even it, seed it, water it)   For tools: other than a sod cutter which I intend to rent for the day from HomeDepot and gardening rake, shovel and hoe (which I have), what else should I cosider?    Is there any way to reuse the sod (composting ?) or reduce the volume before disposing it?  "
2753,How may I quell the fungus among-us?,"Sorry for the pun, couldn't resist.  Recently with all the rain (wish I could send some to Cali, they need it more than we do) I've had a mushroom issue in the back yard. There's a big discolored circle in the middle of the yard, with mushroom caps that grow and sprout on the perimeter of this circle after a heavy rain. The grass in the circle is a few shades darker than the surrounding grass, and the circle seems to be growing slightly larger month by month.  Some quick searches online didn't give me much hope. So far I've just been pulling the mushrooms that sprout to not give more spores any chance, but I realizing I'm only ""treating"" one very small symptom.  Spiked shoes to aerate? Antifungal application? "
2754,Which soil works for Dracaena sanderiana (lucky bamboo)?,"I got this Dracaena sanderiana (lucky bamboo) recently, and would like to replant it in a different pot and change the soil:    I've done some googling and got wildly different and often times opposing answers on which type of soil to use. I have some leftover peat moss, perlite, cactus soil and regular flower soil and am unsure if any of those are a good option. I found some answers where people said that a peat moss and perlite combination is a good option but no note about the ratio how much of which to use. Also, because of all of the different answers online, I'm unsure if that is a good option at all.  In short, my question is: Is a peat moss and perlite combination a good type of soil for an indoor Dracaena sanderiana or is there something better? And if it is, what ratio of the two to use?    P.S.  I've also found some tips on growing the plant without soil, however this is not an option I would like to take. "
2755,Plucking fruit off young fruit trees?,"I planted some apples and other fruit trees (plum, peaches, apricot, pears, cherries), and they are grafted on dwarf or semi-dwarf rootstock (or else are naturally semidwarf?).  I'm getting close to the time for actually getting fruit. This year I strongly suspect an almond tree, apple tree, and maybe a pear and peach might produce fruit this year.  After reading this answer, I was wondering:   Should I pluck the fruit off to help it get established? Do I pluck off the blossoms, or wait until the blossoms turn into fruit before plucking? Should I pluck off ALL the fruit, or just pluck off, e.g, 25% of the fruit?  "
2756,Moving asparagus to a pot then back in the ground a few months later,"There are three mature asparagus plants in our backyard, which we've been enjoying so far since we moved in a few months ago. Unfortunately, they are located in the exact spot where we'll soon be building a garage, and due to some other work we're doing in the yard, their new home won't be ready until September at the earliest.  What I'd like to do is dig them up and house them temporarily in large pots. Then in September we'll plant them in their new permanent home.  How likely are they to survive this process? What can I do to help ensure their survival? Am I better off just starting new asparagus plants?  I am in Madison, WI (USDA plant hardiness zone 5a), and all locations (current, temporary, and future) are in full sun. "
2757,"Yellow spots on cactus, brown spines","I have a cactus in which some yellow spots are appearing, some are starting to turn brown even.  Then the spines seem to be dark brown on the top and white on the sides. Not sure if that's normal.  I notice the yellow spots are more noticeable in the front side of the cactus (facing the sun). I wonder if that means there's too much sun, or maybe not related. The cactus is placed outside of a window in Madrid (Spain) where it gets direct sunlight in the morning (facing East).  The pot has wholes below, but the recipient in which it is does not (it's a robot). BUT the pot doesn't get to the bottom, so, there's water in the recipient, but the pot is not touching that water. Is that a problem? I'd expect it isn't since water is not in contact with the pot. The soil is actually quite dry... maybe too much?  Also, I don't know what species it is, I think it's a Echinocactus platyacanthus but may very well be wrong.  Any help appreciated, thanks.  Front:   Back:  "
2758,Elimination Weed in gravel,"What is the best and permanent way to get rid of weed in a gravel path? I have tried, vinegar and boiling water but i have to use so much of it it's insane. Has anyone have any other suggestion? "
2759,Remove a large sandbox from my yard?,"In my backyard there is a 20' x 20' sandbox on a slight incline (0' to 1.5') with an approximate volume of 300 cubic feet (11 cubic yards).    The sandbox served as a foundation for an above-ground salt water swimming pool for years (perhaps decades).  I want to remove the sandbox from my yard.  I have put together 100 sandbags, but I have no use for them and no one in the area seems interested in them. As well, for all that work, the sand that went into these sandbags hardly made a dent in the sandbox.  When digging down, it's just the top level that is sand. Beneath the sand is a fine gravel. I don't know the specific type of sand; it is similar to the sand found at the beach.  Is spreading the sand in the yard an option? Would covering in soil and grass (sod or seed) work?  Location: Pacific Northwest, USDA zone 9a "
2760,"I repotted my dracaena marginata in an oversized pot. Now that I know this is incorrect, should I repot it again to a smaller pot?","I have a dracaena that was seriously rootbound in a 10-12 inch container. (That's the approximate size; I can't remember it exactly now). In March of this year, I untangled its roots and repotted it into a container that's 17 in high and 18 in in diameter. It seemed too big so I only planted it about 1/2 - 3/4 of the way up; there isn't a huge amount of soil on the bottom. It had transplant shock and lost some lower leaves on the bottom of its different ""trunks,"" but it has bounced back after a few weeks and and looks good now!  However I now realize the risk of root rot in repotting it in an oversized container. Also, a secondary worry is that it might now grow/expand to its potential because so much energy is going toward its roots. Should I be proactive and repot it? Even if it's doing fine for now? Or is it okay because it's sitting lower in the pot? I really don't want root rot.   Thanks!     "
2761,What are the advantages of hydroponics?,"From my understanding, hydroponics is essentially growing plants without soil. Instead of soil, the plant is placed in water.  Are there any advantages to growing plants hydroponically?   Are there instances where plants can grow faster if they are grown hydroponically? "
2762,Proper growth of pear cactus,I have two cacti growing in two separate apartments. Both get about the same amount of water and sun. I think they are the same species. One grows nice oval features but the other grows long cylindrical spikes (see pictures)  Are they healthy?  How to get this pear cactus to not have the pointy growth? 
2763,How do I landscape a sloping and flood-susceptible yard?,"My wife and I just moved into a house in Arkansas a few months ago and have noticed a few drainage issues with the back yard, it has roughly a 5 to 10 degree slope (east to west) and is fenced in. The soil is fairly hard and seems clay like at the surface. There is also a lack of grass at the moment.  The rain water will pool against the fence on the low side (West) of the yard and takes quite a while to soak into the soil in numerous places. The slope also causes loose silt and dirt to migrate towards the west side of the yard (down sloped side) during heavy rains.    I would like to fix this issue. The first thought is to till the land, fill in the low spots with some top soil, level the land slightly, and plant seed. I'm thinking that will help absorb the water faster.  I would like to stray from such ideas as dry wells and re grading the land as I think they would be too costly.  My problems arises from the underground sprinkling system in the yard and some stray wires I found running underneath the cement slab patio to some point in the yard (I presume it is a wire for the underground sprinkler system).  I have not followed the wires yet but they are only a few inches below the ground (if that) and are rather small in diameter.    I have read the sprinkler system should be around a foot underground, should I be concerned with that if hand till the lawn with one of those cultivating tools from Lowe's? Possibly using a rototiller? Is there a company or anything out there that can give me an idea where the sprinkler system runs (short of marking the heads and guessing/trial and error) and where these stray wires go to (something like a digger hotline, Arkansas one call only does utility type lines)?   Lastly, how do I prevent the rain from washing the new seed and soil towards the down hill side of the yard? "
2764,What's causing discoloration and spots on my Tomato and Bell Pepper plants?,"I had an issue with tomato hornworms. I sprayed my plants with a BT Dipel  solution. A few days after I sprayed them, I noticed a change in the plants. I did some research and found that it could be early blight. I purchased a copper spray solution and sprayed the plants with it. However, it did not make a difference. I am not sure what's going on any more. Can I save these plants? Should I keep or burn them?   Click on pictures for full size.       "
2765,How come my majestic palm has patchy dried out spots?,"    This is an indoor pot plant.  We have quite a bit of natural light thanks to a skylight, but not much direct sunlight unfortunately.  The dry patches have been there for a while and I’ve tried various things to get rid of them. I have misted the plant daily.  Have checked the leaves for spider mites or aphids and I’ve wiped all the leaves down in soapy water just in case.  I put a tray beneath the pot with water and stones. I have recently repotted the plant into a self watering pot, during which I noticed some tiny white bugs in the soil - which hopefully I’ve gotten rid of... not quite sure what they were but the internet says possibly soil mites which doesn’t seem dangerous to the plant anyways.   However the plant still does not seem happy.  I’m at a loss for what else I can try? Any ideas? "
2766,Peach leaves drying up and falling off,"I just bought a peach tree about a little over a week ago. It's still in the container as I haven't had a chance to plant it. It seemed fine when I got it, but in the time I've had it the leaves have started drying up and the edges flaking of or leaves completely falling off.  The spot where I have it is currently on a raised deck where it is pretty windy. It doesn't get terribly cold though. Could the wind cause this?  I got the tree from Costco so it probably had been indoors for a bit. Could it be that it's not acclimated to the sun?  I'm in the San Francisco bay area, in the hills. It is a bit cool here, but not extreme. Days lately have been in the 80s and evenings in the 60s maybe.  There was some pest damage to the leaves (holes in the leaves) when I bought it.  Here are some photos of the leaves.    "
2767,What is happening to my Areca Palm?,What is happening to my Areca Palm? Here are two pictures. The right one is of my Areca Palm before I bought it from the shop and the left image is how it looks now.  After I brought it to my home it started to wither and the leaves turned brown and then black. Then I removed the dead leaves   Did I overwater it? Does it want more light?   Can I save it?      maybe the poor light in my room  
2768,Do my zucchini have a chance?,I think my zucchini got too big for the seed starting containers they were in and have started to die unfortunately. I've attached pictures for reference but as can be seen they've turned yellow and are suffering. I've transplanted the healthiest ones outdoors into my raised garden bed and threw away the rest. Is there any hope for them? Anything I should do to give them the best chance they can have?         
2769,Basic lawn profiling,"I live in Germany (near Frankfurt so about 50 degrees latitude) and have a rather tiny lawn. It doesn't get a lot of light, especially in the winter,  and frankly it rains a lot here and the patch is often wet. We have rolled out grass twice, but in both cases it turned to mostly clover and moss within about 3-4 years. I am not sure what the drainage is, nor do I really know how much light it gets.  I would like to have nice grass, and it is really very small, maybe 5x20 meters so I can afford to give it a fair amount of care. But I am not really sure what, and am not really sure what I have to deal with.  So my question is: how should I start to profile my lawn, maybe measure the sunlight and moisture (and anything else?) over a year or so to decide what kind of grass will grow best, and if installing a drainage system of some sort is necessary.  Should I get some Arduino soil moisture measuring devices? Maybe some light sensing ones too? Or are there simpler methods I don't know about?  "
2770,"What is this white web-like, mold-like thing on the plant","what is this web-like, mold-like thing on the base of the watch chain succulent plant?    I searched in google for plant ""molds"" --> I saw powdery mildew. I think this is not that. It's more similar to a food mold. The plant has no insects, im sure of it, so i think it's not a web.  A little bit of a background... I don't exactly know how and when it started to form. It sat in the office before, maybe around less than or a month.   Office env:   temperature is ~21°C i think it might not be having enough sunlight as it is not near to a window    And then, one day, as I noticed the plant is starting to brown from the bottom, I checked the plant and saw these little white mold-like thing from the stem or the base of the plant.   For 2 days, in hope to save it from browning and to eliminate the mold, I placed it near a window to get sunlight and watered it in the morning. But the plant's condition did not improve. I didn't know what to do, there's water and sunlight, what else would it need?  I thought maybe it wants fresh air from an open space, so i brought it home and placed it in the balcony. I changed the watering schedule to once a week. I think it can get enough sunlight at home. I live in a tropical country, so the temperature is warm.  Current Condition: No improvement. It is deteriorating. Almost all parts have browned except for the tips of the plant. The mold is still there. "
2771,What are these tiny black things on the tips of my chive seedlings?,"I just purchased and transplanted these chive seedlings. They came from the store with these tiny hard black ovoids on about a third of the tips, although I didn't notice until I got home. What are they? Seed husks maybe? "
2772,How do I prune blackberries that fruit twice?,"So I purchased a few ""Prime Ark Freedom"" blackberries. They are a primocane fruiting variety BUT they fruit twice (once early on then once in the fall if temps/weather is right)  Right now I have about 4-5 plants in a corner (they are going a bit crazy but are still fruiting) but are VERY tall. Most of them seem to have 3 canes that go very high up and then droop over. I honestly have never pruned plants much in general but these seem like they need it.  I've heard it's a good idea to ""top"" them at maybe 4 feet? Does it matter where I cut?  Also when do I prune the cane back down to the ground? During winter I guess? Is there any point in letting the cane stay around another year.  Some of the canes look sorta dead but halfway up the cane (starting from the top back) I guess I should just cut these off to the ground I assume?)  Thanks!  (Also do I need to worry about staking or tying these off? if they were trimmed down to 4 foot or so they would stand up on their own)  edit: Apologies, apparently these plants ALSO fruit on the floricanes too.

2773,How Can I Get More Flowers on My Trees?,"I understand that once a tree/shrub has reached maturity, flower buds are apical buds that have morphed from vegetative ones. Yet, not every apical bud morphs into being a flower bud and that fraction that do seems to vary – why?  I’d like to know how I can maximize the flower buds on my flowering trees, rhododendrons, and the like. Conversely, I’d like to know how to suppress flower buds forming. In bonsai practice, for example, it is believed that flower buds ‘waste energy’ that could otherwise go into vegetative growth. Once the bonsai is developed, however, flowers are highly prized.  What are the factors that anyone might control to turn on/off formation of flower buds? "
2774,Avocado pruning and repotting advice,"Firsty I'm new to the site so hope I'm posting in the correct place!  I grew my avocado tree/bush from scratch as an experiment with my nephew and a few months ago I cut it in half (see last picture below) on advice that it would branch out into a bush. Since then, 3 sturdy branches have appeared at the top (chuffed). However I'm not sure what to do now.    Should I chop back the new branches, and if so where? Would it be beneficial to chop off the original drooping leaves at the bottom.  Should I repot? - I only repotted it a few months ago but I've just noticed a stem sticking out of the bottom!    Thanks so much in advance for any and all tips!   Cheers,   Sam    ([website]([website]([website]"

2781,Ideal way to fill in a large hole (from a goldfish pond),"The house we just bought had a goldfish pond in the back yard, which has been removed, leaving a hole roughly 1.5 meters squared, by 1 meter deep.  I wish to fill in the hole, and plant a flower/vegetable garden over the current spot.  What is the ideal way to fill in this hole, to avoid sinkage, allow proper drainage, etc?  I see this question, which is related, but somewhat narrower (focusing simply on whether filling with bricks is appropriate).  What's the proper way to fill in a large hole?  What types of materials should I use at which depths, and how, if at all, should these layers be treated (should I tamp each layer as I add it? Add dirt and water to fill in the gaps, etc)?  I have already at my disposal some medium-sized rocks/bricks, as well as a large quantity of dirty landscaping gravel, which I can use as filling.  I expect I'll need to buy some topsoil for the top layer.  Should I also buy sand, or any other materials, for part of this project? "
2782,Getting Ready to Move my Tomato Plants Outside,Planted Beefsteak tomato seeds into seed starting trays on May 8th.  They've since been growing well under grow lights indoors and have been transplanted to larger containers.  I think it's almost time to transplant them to my raised bed outdoors. I plan on hardening them off for 10 days before doing so.  I'm purchasing 15 32'' galvanized metal tomato cages from someone and plan on using 12 and having 3 extras just in case.

2784,Problems with new cherry trees (UK),"About three weeks ago I had a pair of sweet cherry trees planted -- they are 3-4 years old, about a meter high, and were planted where I'd previously had a seriously overgrown cotoneaster and a cotinus. Lots of organic matter in the planting hole, and a shed-load of organic mulch. Looked really healthy when they went in.  The trees are in a east-facing garden and shaded from the south and west, but they get a good amount of morning sun. One is near a low wall close to the road; the other (which is healthier) is near the house.  Shortly after planting, the new growth start curling so I immediately thought: aphids, and have been using soap spray -- without success, unfortunately. I'm reluctant to use a systemic pesticide but do I have an alternative?  It's been very wet since they were planted, and (especially the one closest to the road) they're going severely downhill. Not just the aphid problem, but discoloured leaves, with signs of insect damage (not just aphids). And I suspect the local pigeons have been chewing on the leaves...  At this point I'm dithering about causes. Fungus? Lack of fertilizer? Bees? Weevils? The local pigeons?  I can't see obvious insect pests now although the curled new growth makes it harder now.  What steps can I take to sort this out? Last resort: ring the guys who provided them and go: sick trees -- replace them! But even if they go: OK! I don't want the same problems to recur.  Let me know what else you need to know. Photos of problems follow.  [1       "
2785,How can I grow moss on our fireplace?,"We have a large fireplace made of rocks from the Craters of the Moon park in Southern Idaho.  The rocks are very rough and already have some dry moss on them, but really, the whole thing's a kind of eye sore, to me; I prefer river rock.  So I started thinking maybe I could get moss and other small plants to grow on the moon rocks. Then it would be quite beautiful!  Our climate is dry and there is no direct light on the rocks.  Would I need lighting and some way of misting the moss daily?  Any ideas on how best to do this? "
2786,Looking for plants to out-compete poison parsnip,"This is my garden.  It is nice.    However, as you can see along the road I have a lot of tall weeds growing and one of them is poison parsnip.  I'm trying to come up with a good thing that I could plant that would:    outcompete these road-side weeds (passively - mowing isn't a good option for me)  be cheap enough to affordably cover this ~10x100' stretch of our lawn (optionally) be beautiful and dense and maybe 6-15' tall   Any ideas?  I know I can try to fight the parsnip by pulling by hand and such, but the previous owners did that for 7 years and it didn't really get them anywhere.  I suspect the town mowers tend to respread seeds up and down the roads, so that seems like a losing battle.  I'm in northern Vermont (zone 3-4).  You can see across the road is mostly marsh - this part of my lawn is moist, but not wet.  We have some kind of willow bush, black locust and day lilies growing natively nearby.  Transplanting individual plants sounds like a lot of work to cover that much area, but that might be reasonable if they could be spaced far enough apart.    In my head, the ideal scenario is some kind of cheap, self seeding/propagating plant that I could scatter seed by hand.  Maybe after cutting the spring growth back to the ground, or helped along by a nurse crop? "

2793,Why is my Adenium obesum wilting?,"This desert rose, Adenium obesum, was put on a window sill on top of a radiator, and did well for approximately 10 days.   Then I left for the Holydays. I left the plant with extra water and no heating. The temperature must have gone under 10ºC, (50°F), but it wasn't watered any more during my absence of 15 days.   On my return, as you can see in the pictures, I found it wilting.   I thought it might be a watering problem, as the soil was completely dry, so I watered it, making sure all the water drained. I also moved it to a window sill where there is no radiator. Now the roots are moist, if I touch them from the bottom holes of the pot.   The soil is clearly peat based, and it looks like the bottom is moist, but the top quite dry. What should I do? Water it more? Leave it without water for a while? I really have no idea!  My house has a temperature of approximately 15-16ºC during the day, sometimes 17-19ºC when I turn on the heat at night.

Is there an organic/natural way to kill off all the weeds so we can start from scratch? With kids and dogs and a swimming pool right beside the area, I'd really rather not spray a ton of roundup (or something comparable).  I had one guy suggest Iron X but I've read mixed reviews.  I've always read about people putting newspaper or black tarp over areas of weed to kill them, but with this square footage I'm just not sure that's feasible.

However, there is a large currant bush I don't want to leave behind. I could try digging it up and replanting it in one of the containers, but worried I will kill it and maybe even take the weeds with it's soil.   Or maybe there's a way to block the weed around it?

2797,Identifying possible causes of struggling peppers,"  I'm a little worried about a few of my pepper plants, but I'm not certain what's wrong (or what to do about it).  I got these pretty late in the season this year and they were almost this size when I planted them (about 2 weeks ago now). When I first planted them, a few of them lost some of their lower leaves (Jalepeno - front center, Bananas - back center, and anaheim - back right). The leaves have stopped falling off and you can see that the jalepenos and banana peppers have perked up - I even have a banana pepper growing. However, the anaheim in the back right still looks really droopy.  We've been getting a fair amount of rain, so I haven't been watering with a hose. I check the soil moisture by hand twice a day and if an inch down feels dry I run the soaker hose. Any chance I'm still under/over watering? Anything else I could be non thinking of? "

2801,Spring lawn revival in SE Pennsylvania,"I have a relatively small area of lawn that surrounds my property and I'd like to take some steps to try to revive it this spring. I don't know the exact size, but generally machinery like gas-powered aerators feels like it might be overkill. I've included a photo below of one of the worse spots which gets some sun in the morning, but is mostly in shade.  The amount of maintenance performed on the lawn is relatively small, mostly just cuttings with a couple of feedings.  I've watched some of the videos from This Old House and read a few of the top hits on Google. It seems like the basic strategy is:   Trim grass uniformly and ensure all clippings are bagged. Remove the thatch from the lawn with a rake, or powered dethatcher.  Aerate the lawn, ideally with a mechanized core aerator. Spread compost. Spread fertilizer. Spread grass seed.   We moved some flower beds around so steps 4-6 are something I have some familiarity with. I used a fall seed mix, but didn't really consider the type of grass. At that time we had rented a tiller so the ground was well broken up and we had compost on hand.  Given the current state of the lawn with the grass not very long, I feel like I should be doing some additional work like targeting weeds, such as crabgrass. Is applying a lot of chemicals really going to do much for me? Would it be much of an improvement to just perform 3-6 using a spike aerator?  I feel like this is a manageable project for me, but wonder if I'll be better off in the long term hiring someone to get the grass in order.   "

2807,How much fertilizer do I need for my vegetable garden?,"Today I received the results for my garden soil test, which show that I have only 5 ppm of nitrogen.  So my research (here, and elsewhere) has suggested that the best way to (organically) raise the nitrogen level is to add some blood meal.  But how much blood meal do I need?  The ""Fertilizer recommendations"" that came with my test results says:     You should apply your nitrogen at a rate of ¼ lb N per 100 sq. ft. You can divide this amount in half and apply half at planting and half a month later during the summer.   Then later it says:     To Calculate the Amount of Fertilizer to Use:   ( % of nutrient in fertilizer ÷ 100) = Pounds fertilizer per 100 sq. ft.   But using that formula, if I had a theoretical fertilizer with 100% nitrogen, I would apply 1 lb per 100 sq. ft., or 4x the recommended amount above.  What is an accurate formula to use to determine how much (organic) nitrogen fertilizer I need to apply?  EDIT I live in Central Kansas, and will be growing a variety of vegetables. "
2808,What should not be put in compost tea?,"Over the years I have seen examples of people making a type of compost tea which is made by using a large barrel filled with about 70 - 80% water and then adding all sorts of stuff.  Some examples I have seen:   Dead cane toads -> Just found video here Grass clippings Seaweed Chicken manure Meat scraps   Note, these examples I have seen both on television and in practice.  The mixture is left to decompose until it is mostly liquid (there is no separation of ingredients and the liquid) then it is further diluted and applied to the soil.  From the results I've seen in the real world I want to start making the same stuff but I want to know what I should avoid putting in the mix; what should I not put in this tea if I want to avoid making my family sick?

2809,Why would the trunk of a tree start to flop over?,"Several trees in my neighborhood seem to have an issue of not growing the lead branch straight up. It's as if the tree grew too fast and can't hold itself upright, so the top just flopped over.  I took a picture of one such tree. One of my neighbors actually put in a stake and ran a line up 8 ft in an attempt to ""straighten"" out the flop. It doesn't look like it's working.  Was wondering what could cause this problem?    Update. Adding more photos. In response to all questions:   Different species of trees are doing it and only about 20% of the neighborhood trees. There is no high wind in my area. In southern Texas. High heat, low rain. Each tree flops over at different angles. These trees were probably transplanted 5-7 years ago. The trees doing this are generally 8-12 ft tall. However there are plenty of other trees as big or bigger that aren't doing this.   Including more photos below. I could not see any consistency or pattern in regards to the trees doing this. I did get to thinking though. I do know our soil is pretty bad and I also know about half of the neighborhood has trees that are/were staked for 2 or more years. By default, the builder staked every tree and I gather most people don't realize they need to remove those stakes. Good 20% of the trees have died or on their way out from the stake rope/wire choking the trunk.  Could this flopping be a result of keeping a tree staked for too long?      "
2810,How do I recover an avocado plant that shriveled while I was away for a week?,"We have an avocado plant grown from the seed and it was doing very well until we went on a 1 week holiday. Although we watered it before we left, we came back to a plant with shriveled up and drooping leaves. Watering it managed to get the leaves all horizontal again but they remain very shriveled even after 1 week. They feel like dry, dead leaves.   What should I do know? If I cut the leaves off, how far down the stem should I cut?  The stem still looks pretty green and healthy so should I leave them or should I cut all the way down to the stalk?    "
2811,Why are the leaves of my young chilies turning yellow and dying?,"Here are my Capsicum chilies. There are a month and a half/two months old. For some reason, some are growing faster than others. The ones not growing much have leaves which turn yellow. After a few days, these leaves die, as you can see on the second picture.  They are under a window and I'm spraying them with water usually every morning and night.  What is happening? Is there anything I can do?  I am living in London, UK.     "
2812,Why does this forsythia have such sparse leaves?,"I recently moved into a flat in south Germany with large, south-east-facing balcony boxes.  In one of them is a very straggly-looking forsythia.  It flowered in the spring, but since the leaves have come out it only has leaves at the very ends of the branches, and nowhere else (see photos).  How can I encourage it to grow leaves along the full length of its branches?  Does it need fertilising?  Or severe pruning later in the year?         "
2813,"Can Nicotiana alata be used as an aphid ""honeypot""?","I have a problem with aphids.  Some of my plants are too weakened to be sprayed with a high-velocity hose to knock them off, and I really don't have the time to keep spraying with various insecticides, Neem, soaps etc.  The ladybugs in my region seem to be particularly lazy, and the predator wasps just can't keep up.  In Victorian times they used to make up sprays with tobacco plants, and apparently some novels mention that smokers were encouraged to smoke near the roses so that the cigarette smoke would deter the aphids.  I've also read that Nicotiana alata can be useful in an organic garden as the scent attracts aphids and spider mites which settle on the sticky glands.  So, are these stories apocryphal or can they be used to draw aphids and mites from your prized plants?  And if so, how many plants do you need per m2 of garden?   "
2814,Should I cut off some banana leaves before flowering?,"I am growing a banana plant in my house. Some of my neighbors say that trimming or cutting fresh banana leaves from the tree before it has borne a fruit, would result in the banana tree not producing a banana at all. I need to know whether it is true, or if it's just a myth?   Also, if it's true, what is the reason behind it and how can I make the tree bear fruit? "
2815,Is there a way to avoid the recurring cost of microbes when composting at home?,"I am planning to start a terrace garden and to generate compost for it. I found two sellers Seller1 and Seller2 in my city. Seller1 has ""patented microbes"" and Seller2 has microbes, saw dust, dry leaves and treated coconut husk to help in composting. The problem is that I'll have to purchase these microbes and extra composting material every month, and the cost seems much higher than what I'll be saving from the vegetables I cultivate.  Problem specifics:   Seller1 says that if I don't want to purchase the microbes every month, I could take half of the old compost and re-use the microbes, but I wouldn't be able to do that more than two cycles, and would need fresh microbes. Each handful of ""patented"" microbes costs Rs.300. (To compare that to your currency, a loaf of bread here costs Rs.30) Seller2 has cheaper microbes at Rs.60, but also requires us to purchase sacks of dry leaves + saw dust + treated coconut husk for Rs.140.      Questions:    Is there a simple, safe way for us to culture and grow these microbes ourselves (and not have to spend so much money for other raw materials needed for composting), instead of depending on what looks like a clear business strategy by these sellers? Is it really so necessary to purchase these microbes? If I take the top soil from some land which has flourishing plants and use it in my flower pots, won't it already have the necessary microbes? If I water the soil regularly and provide sufficient shade, wont the microbes continue thriving such that I won't need to do any composting in the first place? If I ever need more microbes, couldn't I just get some fresh soil from that land again? The empty plot of land full of wild plants and weeds is just next to my house. If I throw organic kitchen waste there, won't the composting happen automatically, so that I won't have to buy any composting equipment or spend time on composting?      The cost kills the enthusiasm of doing composting for the sake of gardening. "

2817,Help! Fighting builders re: new build garden,"I bought a new build in October 2016. When I moved in I noticed there were cracks between rows of turf.    With rain/bad weather it has just turned into a mud mess.  It has been regularly maintained by factors.    I listed it as a ""snag"" as did all of my neighbours who are experiencing the same problem.    Having complained on several occasions I've now been told a ""Clerk of Works"" is coming to have a look on Thursday.    I'd appreciate any professional help/advice on this. Has it simply been laid badly?  Should there be drainage given the considerable angle of the slope?      "
2818,Using upside-down plastic cups as outdoor seed/seedling protection?,"I have a little problem - somebody is eating my Echinacea's seed that I sow outdoors. As recommended, they are just placed on the ground, they germinate way easier if they have light. Their length is 2-3mm, fairly large seeds that I gather are too heavy for ants. I guess it might be birds that are having a healthy meal of Echinacea's seeds.  Does it make any sense to protect each seed by covering it with an upside-down positioned transparent plastic cup (used for human parties, etc.)? If yes, should I poke a hole for ventilation, so that I don't cook the seeds?  Some similar ideas can be found here, but this is for indoor seed starting. "
2819,Garden in Desert Soil,"We are in a position to move onto a large city lot of about 0.75 acre.  I like the idea of having a large lot for economic and quality of life reasons but I see an opportunity to set up a sizable garden that can yield fresh food (further enhancing QOL?).  We live on a tiny lot now and have a small garden that has had limited success despite being in the shadow of a wall and trees during the winter months.  We have coaxed cherry tomatos and a few jalapenos out of the garden but hardly enough (or of high enough quality) to call ourselves competent gardners.  We are in the southwest US where temperatures range from just barely sub-freezing on extremely cold winter nights to 120°f/49°c at the peak of summer (elev ~1500ft/450m).  The soil supports traditional desert plants but I don't know what, if anything, should be done to prepare soil for non-native plants.  I grew up in this environment and have seen non-native trees (pine, orange, sissoo, pomegranate, etc) grow without problems but I've never had much luck with plants.  What should be done, at a very high level, to lay the groundwork for a productive garden and avoid a time consuming, frustrating, and expensive excercise in futility? "
2820,How do I ripen tomatoes?,"I am in zone 9b and growing tomatoes since summer in a vegetable garden.  I have a few tomatoe plants that have small tomatoes.

2822,My cactus is turning brown on top. Is this usual?,  I've just bought this cactus and it's turning brown. I'm wondering if it's because I watered it too much or because of the changing weather? (We rarely have cold days here and it's started to get cold this week) or because of other thing??? 
2823,Is it 'too late' for our christmas tree (picea abies I think) when the needles start falling off?,"So we got a christmas tree in a pot this year. As far as I can work out it is a [website]I know it won't have been grown in the pot, and the roots are probably not in very good shape and all and chances are generally not so good for this tree. ;)  Anyway, my question is specifically about what it means when the needles start falling off for this kind of tree.  I understand they don't like it in dry indoor conditions, you're ideally supposed to spray them and water the pot, and they will be happier outside.  If you let them dry out, the needles start falling off (or fall off more quickly), and it gets so the needles are kind of hanging on by a thread, and whenever you disturb a branch you get a shower of needles.  My question is then, when it gets to that point, is it already 'too late' for these needles? Or, if it is put outside, and misted with a bit of water, is it possible for these same needles to 'firm up' again and the branches survive?  By implication, then, is it worth while treating it very delicately, and trying to avoid knocking the branches when the needles are all ready to fall off? "
2824,Can a wooden fence support raising/levelling a garden?,"I have a garden that is not completely flat that I am planing to level and could use some advice please.  The image below shows the layout of the garden currently. If I look out from the house at the garden, the first section is flat, but then between the end of the garage and the fence, is a drop of about 12-18 inches. This slope is just a bit too steep to be enjoyed. The brown lines are the fence.    My plan is to sink an additional 2 fence posts (75x75mm) between each pair of exiting fence posts (at least 4ft deep) and then use some fence boards to act as a brace to support the additional topsoil needed to raise the garden to be all level.  The image below shows a top down view of the current fence structure (in brown), where the boards are facing out of my property (so I have the 'ugly' side facing into the garden). The blue posts/boards are what I intend to do. The horizontal boards would be sunk about 4 inches below the current ground level, and would go to about 4 inches above the desired ground level.    My question is;  Will the additional posts and wooden fence boards be strong enough to support the weight of the additional topsoil required raise the garden 12-18 inches?  Are there any other requirements that I need to consider? I assume that I will need to use some treated wood to ensure that the buried wood doesn't simply rot in the wet soil.  Any other general advice/tips are also welcome.  Thank You  Additional Information   At the end of the slope, on the other side of the fence is a side path and then our neighbors property. To the left of the sloped grass is another neighbor, where our garden slopes down towards our northern neighbor, our left neighbors garden has a gentle slope down towards my garden. The red box on the right of the garden image is the legal boundary of our property. To the right of that is the pavement. For some reason, the builders did not put the fence on the boundary line, but rather chose to put some lovely plants on my land (that I have to maintain). There is a slight slope down to the pavement (under 6 inches). Once I have permission to move the fence out to the boundary, there will need to be some further leveling that I would do using the same principal.   Final Comments  Thanks to the commenters below. I have taken the advice on board and concluded that Wood will not be sufficient. I will instead build a proper retaining wall with concrete foundations.   Thanks again "
2825,Is a fungus causing my butter lettuce stems to rot right through?,I'm growing some butter lettuce in a grow bag full of Happy Frog potting soil.  It's been particularly rainy the last few days.  Today I inspected the plants and a few of them popped right off of their stems.  They had rotted all the way through at close to soil level.  It looks like a fungus got them.

2827,Should I cut off cactus pads to help the main branch to grow?,"I have some small cactus (one year old) and they are have been producing a lot of new pads.

2837,How to differentiate between Albizia and Delonix Regia?,"How can I differentiate between Albizia (Mimosa, Silk Tree) and Delonix regia (Flamboyant) when the plant is young?  I live in Maui, where Albizia is an invasive species responsible for monocultures, loss of habitat, build and road damage, and even falling and killing people. I want to be aggressive about removing it from my property. It's also much easier to kill when it's young.  However, I also have a Delonix regia (Flamboyant) growing in my backyard which looks similar except for its flowers.      How can I differentiate between the two when they're young so I can kill the Albizia but not the Delonix regia?    Update: I've recently learned that there are two different species (genuses, actually!) called Albizia here in Maui: Albizia julibrissin and Falcataria moluccana. I also don't know how to differentiate these, but they're both invasive, so I want to weed out both. It seems Falcataria moluccana is more common. "

2842,Carolina Chili fruit not turning red,"I recently planted several types of chilli including the insanely hot Carolina reaper. Now the plants are doing well and one is producing a lot  chilli fruits.  However the fruits have not even started turning red and some have been around for more than a month. I am worried if I leave it longer they might become mushy and unusable. The chillies are also getting quite huge and even though I use them in cooking I only need a small amount at a time, these chilli's are low grade tear gas.   Note that I planted some Ghost chili with this(pale white variety) and they are also fruiting and turning paler.  Some background about the growing conditions.   Chilli plants are housed in a grow cage with a shade netting(lets 90% light through), I live in Sydney west where we are seeing temperatures of 40 degree centigrade and the sun can be deadly scorching at times. UV index is normally between High and extreme during summer. More information here moist not wet I feed them PowerFeed fertiliser every 1-2 weeks. This fertiliser works wonders on my other plants but since I am still a light green thumb I am worried about being over eager in my care of my plants. The fertiliser product can be viewed on this product page.  Here is the Typical Analysis:   Nitrogen (N) 14.0%. Phosphorus (P) 1.4% Potassium (K) 9.0%    Questions:   Are Carolina Reaper always suppose to turn red? Could it be I have a green variety? Have not seen anything on the net about this. Generally speaking how long does it take for chili to mature. Could the fertiliser be providing an problem by providing a unbalance in nutrients? Maybe I should move them into direct sunlight as they are not established and not going to scorch to death.  "

My plan is to make a sort of trellis-fence to partly break up the view of the road from my yard, and of course help the grape plants vine out.  What's the ratio for post that's buried in the ground vs post that's showing above ground?  I live in Zone 6, so we have some pretty mild winters (rarely gets below 0, never below -10 I think). I was thinking of using just 4x4 posts with about 8 feet above the ground. I was thinking maybe I would put 3 feet in the ground and have 8 feet above. Would that be enough?

I lifted the pot(Dracaena Reflexa [Song of India]) and couldn't find a bug or anything. So I thought maybe it's the sand falling from the pot holes, but they are too perfect and makes me wonder if it's really sand falling from the holes or a work of art.

2854,Do I have to bring my potted plants inside during the winter?,"I live in zone six. The coldest it gets in the winter here is something like -10 degrees.  I have a couple plants in pots that will need to make it through the winter. They're all cold hardy plants, so they should be fine outside. But I was thinking that since they're in pots, their roots will be more exposed to cold, as opposed to if they were in the ground.  Is this something I should worry about? Do I need to bring potted plants inside during the winter to keep their roots from getting cold? Or is there something I can do to protect them outside? "
2855,Are these tiny tomato seedlings going to be too crowded?,"My first effort at growing tomatoes was last year when I was given plants ~20cm tall and it went well. This year I'm having another go, but starting from seed. On the grounds that I have no seed trays, etc and don't really know what I'm doing, I bought a lazy kit type of thing, which provided me a small degradable tray, soil and seeds.  The instructions provided had be filling the pots to ~2cm down adding the seeds and then topping off with ~1cm more soil. I assumed you added lots of seeds because there was an expected failure rate, so used them all (this may have been wrong).  This was only a week ago and I already have over five seedlings growing in the two 4cm pots that took tomato seeds. I suspect if I leave them there they will get entangled and so on?   Should I endeavour to separate the plants? Or maybe remove the weakest? I don't want over 10 tomato plants, two will be plenty, so I'm not adverse to just plucking out those I don't need!

My current sprinkler system doesn't do a great job of covering the area where I have placed the garden, so I would like to tap off of my existing system to add a head dedicated for the garden.  How tall should I make the head for this garden? Should I place it several feet above the ground so that it is able to get over some of the taller plants, like tomatoes? Also, is it better to place one single head for the whole thing or a few heads with less pressure around the garden? Or is there some better method for automated watering of this garden? I would like to have most everything underground while having to perform minimal amounts of digging to get it underground. "
2857,Why should we cover rose plants in the winter?,"We live in Minnesota, where it gets quite cold in the winter and the ground freezes well below the depth of the roses.

For the first two winters we have followed the instructions given us by the previous owner:  prune back to about 18"", mound up dirt on each plant, encircle with chicken wire, fill chicken wire with straw (or with leaves and top with straw). We have not lost a bush yet.  My questions are:  Why does this work, and what parts are necessary?  It's not preventing them from freezing, since the ground freezes down pretty deep. And it's not protecting them from wind chill, since they are roses and not warm-blooded animals who would perceive wind chill.  (If the air temperature is -5, and the wind chill is -20, anything exposed to the air will tend toward -5 and not get any colder.)  The portion of the plant that is beneath the ground or the mounded up dirt will certainly be below freezing, and well below freezing as the winter goes on. It will, however, be marginally warmer than the air temperature. If the ground is frozen down to about 3 ft, and the average air temperature is, say, 15 degrees, then the ground between the surface (15 degrees) and 36"" down (32 degrees) will be on a continuum between those two temperatures.  So does mounding up the dirt help to keep the plants slightly warmer than they would be without it (e.g. 20 degrees instead of 15)? If that is the case, I don't think the straw on top would contribute anything to this, or at least would be no better than snow piled on top.  It is to reduce the temperature swings?  If so, are any temperature swings hard on the plants or only crossing the freeze/thaw line?  Why does covering the roses work, and what parts are necessary? "
2858,What are the main benefits and cons of using manure?,"Manure is often part of a prescription for hot composting, and soil enrichment.  But why? Is it just for nitrogen? Is that why people go and get the excrement of vegetarian mammals to add to their gardens?  If it's nitrogen, why not use locally produced nitrogen instead rather then using energy to transport from outside to ones garden? "
2859,Is High-Intensity Discharge (HID) lighting better overall than Compact Fluoresent Lighting (CFL)?,"For hydroponic horticulture are Metal Halide (MH) and High-Pressure Sodium (HPS) lights still the staple/better choice for growing indoors or do Compact Fluoresent lights (CFL) offer enough light output/spectrum to give the HID lights a run for their money?  Can CFLs provide enough power to support indoor plants alone (specifically concerning a setup where there is very little sunlight available)?  Also: Perhaps this would be better suited as its own question but, where do LED lights fit in to the plant lighting world? "
2860,Is there way to encourage a jade plant to grow new branches from the woody trunk?,"This tangled, twisted but still beautiful jade plant is not the result of a bonsai experiment gone wrong but the product of years of neglect. It was often underwatered, never fertilized and positioned in a corner with almost no turning. The plant was gifted to me about ten years ago, long before my recently developed interest in container gardening.  You can see that it has been reaching for light for years. It's quite leggy, grows only toward one direction and has developed an unusual trailing habit- really just droopy, top heavy branches. To my newbie amazement, most of the many leaves and branches that fell into the pot developed scraggly roots and survived.  After some drastic pruning and pinching, repositioning near a south facing window and application of liquid organic fertilizer (I used Dr. Earth 3-2-2, doubly diluted, which is what I keep on hand for my herbs) I hope it is almost ready to thrive again. There's also a grow light in the window to supplement the sunlight as needed. I think the plant is odd but beautiful after the haircut, but needs some more balance.  My question is: Is there any way to encourage new branches to grow out from the trunk in a direction that would add balance to the plant? I'm thinking in terms of what very little I know of bonsai techniques.  For now I've removed and repotted several of the new plants from the base, but left a few with the idea that or one or two of the best will grow to balance the aesthetic of the pot. (I've also potted many of the cuttings that resulted from pruning, 16 potential plants in all. Guess what my friends are getting for Christmas next year)?   Thanks in advance for your advice. Hope I didn't ramble too much. "
2861,Why are my tomato seedlings dying after applying ammonium sulfate?,Why are my tomato seedlings dying? They just germinated then after a week some are dying? I added compost and a little bit of ammonium sulphate in each plastic bags. They are not yet transplanted. I want to know why because I do not see any pest. 
2862,I want to start a bonsai. I'm not sure where to begin,"Background  I have all the tools to do a bonsai from my family in Japan and my mother.  I want to start my first real bonsai.  Part of growing up was helping my mother with her Japanese Rock and Moss garden in Berkeley, CA which had a perfect climate for such things.  The weather seemed exactly the same in southern Tokyo where we would visit.  I'm now in the desert southwest of the US in Arizona with a very harsh environment.  My Question  Is there a recommended tree or plant to start with?  Taking into consideration the environment and a desire to have the plant outside during most of the year, pulling it in during the summer, is it possible to select an indigenous plant for this purpose?  I'm pretty much a neophyte at these things but managed well with knowledge I have and seem to have a good track record of keeping children, dogs and plants alive for an extended period of time.    That being said, does that effect any recommendations?  I'm not a cherry but I'm far from a journeyman.  TIA  Did my best to look for dupes. "
2863,What is solarization?,I asked a solarization question earlier.  BUT  I'm not 100% on exactly how to do it.  It's the first time I've heard the term and seemed to me that it mapped my frame of mind and didn't use chemicals.  Can someone explain to me how to do it?  Do I just spread out some black plastic sheets on the ground I want to 'solarize' and get on with it?  Do I seal the edges of the plastic to prevent heat from escaping?  I hope this question isn't too fundamental. 
2864,What is a suitable slope for a lawn to drain water away from a house?,"We're about to level our front yard. It will be partly sown with grass, and partly planted with trees &amp; shrubs, though it may not be completely relevant to this question. What is a suitable slope to gently drain water away from the house? I think one of the tradespeople I spoke to suggested a 1 in 65 slope would be adequate, which by my calculations would be a drop of roughly 15mm for every horizontal metre. Is this about right, not enough, or too much?  Also, I had a go at pulling a string taught from one side of the yard to the other. Holding my spirit level against the string didn't really work very well for working out what was level. What is the best equipment for determining what's level?   I think I have a small spirit level that can attach to a string (from a picture framing kit) which might be better, though I don't know how accurate it will be (I can calibrate it against my big spirit level probably).  Background info: we have high rainfall sometimes in the winter, though the soil should have reasonably good drainage qualities (no clay). The size of the yard isn't very big. The max distance from the house to the edge of the yard is probably about 7 metres. "
2865,What kind of infestation and/or fungus do I have in my vegetable garden?,"I have a raised vegetable garden and planted a number of vegetables about a month ago (they were in 3 or 4-inch pots, ready to be transplanted - i.e. not from seeds).  In the past week or two, I've noticed a weird substance on some of them - black kale and brussel sprouts in particular.  I've attached a photo, but the best I can describe it is that they look like small greyish/white sesame seeds.  Maybe eggs of some insect?  But they're very soft - if you touch them at all, it's almost like touching ashes from a fire or something.  My questions are probably pretty typical:   What are they?   I'm not touching anything with them, but is it ok to wash and eat the leaves that look fine (only a few leaves per plant have them, and they are kind of sitting in the middle of the plant (where new leaves come up from) as well).   How can I get rid of them?   I'm a very amateur gardener - if there's any other information I can provide, just let me know.  Thank you!   "
2866,What is a saprotrophic mushroom?,I was reading a post about a Yucca having one these mushrooms grow on it.

2868,Mixing existing soil,"Over the weekend I dug up my Purple Potato Bush (PPB) that was infected by a canker, really sad.  Now time to plant the new PPB, but wondering if I should mix the existing soil or add something to help the new PPB take hold.   Should I mix the existing soil with something and if so what?  Should I add some nutrients supplements and if so what?  My old PPB latest about 40 years and would love to see the new one last that long. Thanks.  "
2869,Kentia palm leaves turn brown,"I have bought a 7 foot Kenia Palm about 6 weeks ago and keep it indoors in spot with indirect light.   The palm gets 1/2 gallon of water once a week and I added half a tablespoon of 20-20-20 all purpose fertilizer for the first time last week to the water. I also live in a warm and humid environment, which should beneficial for the plant. However some of the leaves are turning brown and it slowly seems to spread (this has been going on for several weeks already).   Any suggestions on what I can to help my palm to recover from this? Is this a disease or does it have to with my treatment habits?        Many thanks,  Pete "

2871,Starting over pepper plants,"This is my first year growing chili peppers in my hydroponic setup and I didn't have very good luck in terms of fruit. Most of my super-hots only dropped flowers, though I did get one singular ghost pepper, which I named Gary.  One of my major problems was not understanding pruning, so I ended up with these really leggy plants. Now I have a much better idea of what I should have done, so I decided to cut my losses and cut back the plants, most of them to below the Y, but I'm wondering if starting them over will be effective.   They have great roots, and they seem to be growing a lot of new shoots, but seeing as I don't really know what I'm doing, I was hoping to get some confirmation that I'm not wasting my time here. Some of the less hot ones did produce some fruit - does that make a difference? Should I just take the time to start from seed again? "
2872,Japanese Maple Seedlings Dying For No Apparent Reason,"I'm trying to grow Japanese Maples from Seeds. I had over 100 germinate this year and now I think they're all dead. One the seedling reaches an inch plus, it puts out true Japanese maple leaves. After a few days to a week, they all shrivel up. The stem of the seedlings have remained erect after the death of the leaves, could they come back? What am I doing wrong. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Also my Sugar Maple seedlings and oak seedling with 8+ leaves on them also slowly dry out and eventually fall off. What could be going on? I've been moving them to much larger pots once their roots begin to develop, before they get overcrowded.  "
2873,Does anyone have experience with AeroGarden?,"I got a new AeroGarden Bounty today. I am trying to figure out what these two thingies are. They came rattling around inside the bowl, now lying on the bottom. Did they fall loose from somewhere? Where should I put them before starting putting in the seed pods?  Edit:  A big thanks to both Graham Chiu and stormy. Graham Chiu's answer is right on the mark. I posted this question last evening, because by the time I took this monstrosity out of the box, customer service had already closed. I have just called today after following Graham Chiu's suggestion. The translucent object indeed is a float with a magnet sensor that indicates water level. I almost got it upside down. It's really annoying that they do not include these objects in their list of components or instructions.    "
2874,Can I use a 3-in-1 mix with an overseed machine?,"This lawncare product is a 3-in-1 solution containing seed, fertilizer, and soil improver.  Can I use an overseed machine with the fertilizer and soil improver mixed in or will that harm the machine since those additions are not shaped like a grass seed? "
2875,Possibly the worst weed ever? A bad type of thistle?,"Do you know what kind of weed this is, and how to eradicate it? It's not possible to pull it out from the root, and they are sharp and thorny. They grow quickly and spread rapidly.  I've avoided spraying herbicides since I don't want to impact the soil and future plantings; but I also haven't planted anything new because I'm scared it will be a waste if it's just taken over by these weeds.  I live in DC suburbs in Maryland.  Would it be OK to just spray Roundup on the entire bed, let them wither and die, and then start from scratch? I've heard varying information on how Roundup affects the soil.     "
2876,When is the earliest I should put out roses in Illinois?,"I'd like to surprise my partner and buy some flowers for our patio in Chicago. I've read online that roses are relatively allergen friendly and do well in our zone (5b). After checking around I also read that Oso Easy roses are relatively easy to grow.  Assuming all of that is the case, and I buy two small rose bushes and put them in bucket planters, do I have to wait until summer before putting them outside? If so, when is best? (And is there anything else I should know?) "
2877,Is it too late to add sulfur to my vegetable garden soil?,"My soil test from my local county extension office says:     Your pH is 7.4 ... You should incorporate sulfur to a depth of 6"" at a rate of ½ lb per 100 sq. feet at least 6 weeks before planting in the spring.   I'm about 2-3 weeks from the historical last freeze in my area (Wichita, KS, Zone 6A), and I'd rather not wait ""at least 6 weeks"" from now before transplanting anything.  So is it too late to add sulfur now?  Or should I take any special precautions when applying it now? "
2878,Planting vegetables in ground vs pots in greenhouse,"What makes the most sense for growing vegetables (tomatoes/peppers/squash/etc) in a new, small 6ftx9ft greenhouse in a hardiness zone of 6?  Removing the grass inside and then...   Planting plants at ground level, simply replacing the first 8 inches or so of soil.  Filling the greenhouse base with 8 inches or so of raised soil (not a problem for wood base). Replacing the soil with something like rocks/bricks/mulch and keeping plants in pots. Some hybrid thereof?   What the the pros/cons of each?   It would seem to me that most people go with #3 for some reason. I don't see many people choosing #1, I wonder why... it seems easy and provides lots of surface area to grow in. #2 is a good as #1 but provides extra drainage.     "
2879,Using own hair and nail clippings as fertilizer?,"There is a lot to hear about using horn shavings as ecological alternative to conventional fertilizer.

2880,Best approach to take on half dead string of pearls,"Long story short, I placed something light on top of my basket of string of pearls and then forgot to take it off. I believe that is what killed the top ends of each string, as you can see in the picture. I’m stumped on the best way to move forward - is the plant still salvageable or will it slowly die? Can I cut each string and propagate it?   "
2881,How to amend clay soil to propagate trees for bare root distribution?,"I intend to propagate trees and distribute them in bare root form after they grow for 1-3 years. Lots of good info on that process is available at [website]The location I have for this project is generally clay soil. I've yet to do a thorough soil analysis so that will help inform what amendments are needed, but I already know from observation that the soil is generally heavy clay. It does not become inundated except in heavy rains, but it is heavy soil and can flood in storms. I know I'll want looser, better-drained soil for rows of trees growing for eventual bare-root transplanting.  How can I amend this clay soil to make it better suited for bare root tree propagation? I imagine I need to make it looser and better-drained.   I envision tilling the existing soil a few feet down, then adding plenty of organic matter year-after-year on top of that to build up better soil. However, I generally think of no-till as being good so I wonder if that can be avoided (minimal till seems necessary in this case), and I wonder if I should refine my idea about adding organic matter. For example, should I add fiberous structural material like coconut husk fluff piled on top of existing clay? What role does mulch or fresher wood chips have in this if any? "

2883,Improving Maple growth?,"I have grown maples 4 times. Every time it was 1 or more seeds from a sugar maple and the seeds were viable(I could feel the seed inside).  First attempt:  Planting time: March 21st 2010  Number of seeds in pot: 4 of them equally spaced  Result: Nice growth during spring and summer but no bark formation  Hypothesis: Too much competition and root entanglement which broke the roots and thus none of the trees got enough nutrients to form bark  Second attempt:  Planting time: March 21st 2011  Number of seeds: 2  Result: 3 years of growth but none of them had leaf buds even in May of the fourth year. During the 3rd year 1 tree got wounded a lot in the bark. I would put tape on the wound, leave it there, and then gradually take it off until it was completely healed. I had a second pot which held the groundwater. This helped during dry spells to keep the soil moist for the trees. Some of these wounds were during mid-winter.  Hypothesis: Wounds leading to nutrient drainage + standing water  Third attempt:  Planting time: Don't know exactly but it was in May 2014  Number of seeds: 3  Result: Only 1 of them grew and during the fall the bark formed from top to bottom instead of from bottom to top which was unusual. The very bottom never grew bark(I don't think it was a very small creature eating the bark like my momma did, otherwise I would have seen an irregular pattern of bark and no bark and I did not see an irregular pattern).  Fourth attempt:  Planting time: May 20 2015  Number of seeds: 1  Result: This was my worst attempt. I planted it in shade  and then watered a small radius. Then it rained for several days straight during the morning. I thought ""Hmm, maybe it needs more sunlight to sprout."" since it wasn't sprouting the day after I planted it like all my other attempts have. So during the sunny afternoon I put it in a sunny spot and 2 days later it sprouted. However things got worse from then on. It started growing and the leaves were growing too(I can tell my maples from weeds by the size of the baby leaves(maples have larger baby leaves than weeds) and always pull out weeds when I see them) It then started to yellow like it was overwatered but I did not water it for several days because of rain and moist soil. Then 1 baby leaf fell off. The second one fell off. I was hoping it would grow back because I knew that the roots of trees, both old and young can give rise to new trees if the older one dies but isn't uprooted. However it never grew back.  Hypothesis: Viral disease of the plant maybe? I don't know.  Now I never stratified these seeds, just found a viable seed in the spring and planted it right away. I think that the increased annual temperature helped during 2011-2013 since it got up to 104 degrees fahrenheit in Columbus, Ohio during 2012 and the older sugar maple that I got all these seeds from has survived that increase in temperature.  But from 2014 to this year it has been cooler summer and warmer fall and winter weather only staying in mid-winter. There have also been quite a few cold snaps during the spring these past few years which is why the planting time was delayed to May instead of March in the 2 most recent attempts. There have also been green leaves on trees during December(which I think is due to the warmer fall which feels like a longer summer to the deciduous trees).  Since the second attempt did very well without stratification for 3 years, I was hoping that I could get similar and in fact longer results by planting a single tree instead of 2.  So how could I improve the growth of my maples other than no standing water, growing them in sunny areas, reducing competition for nutrients, vermicomposting(that is making compost with the help of worms), and adding a worm or 2 to the pot I am growing the maples in to constantly fertilize the soil?  Would putting a heat mat underneath the pot during the spring and summer and taking it off during the fall and winter(since they seemed to do better when it was hotter spring and summer and colder fall) help at all when it gets to just low 80s during the summer and there are cold snaps in the spring? I would have to water it more often but that isn't a big deal.  Are there any plants that would help the maples grow? The ravine a few feet away from where I live has a lot of maples, elms, and oaks so maybe trying to grow elms and oaks along with maples will help?  There is also a fungus called Chicken of The Woods that grows there on old logs. It isn't poisonous and I have actually had it once and it was good(I usually don't like mushrooms so it was kind of a surprise when I tasted it). Moss and Ivy also grow a lot there, I am not sure how a parasitic plant like Ivy would help(Ivy most often grows on Oaks in the ravine and leaves maples alone) or how a fungus like Chicken of the Woods or moss would help but I will try just about anything to improve the growth of my maples.

2889,Plastic container within wooden frame-raised bed over concrete slabs,I need to create a raised bed garden mostly to propagate plants. I have an area covered in sun for most of the day. I need to propagate some bushes and decorative grasses and this will also be an area where I keep the plants till I decide on their position and use in my backyard garden (long term project) The area adjacent to the garage is paved with large and cheap rectangular slabs. The raised bed will look like below and I don't know if I can use plastic containers like below for my project. I need to do that because I will get all the soil for the two raised beds later. For now I need to move some grasses and small plants so I can build the layout of my garden. In time I will build the wooden frame for the raised bed and add more containers and soil so I can propagate the grasses  Is the below o good idea? Do you foresee any problems with this?   
2890,"sequoia seeds germination, and first ""planting"" of sprouts method, in which container?","I received Giant and Red sequoia seeds a few weeks ago (never used those before) and the producer indicates on package to leave those soak 24 hours in water, drain and leave seeds 20 days in the fridge. is this process correct ?

Or was such longer germination about seeds already in soil ?  also, what kind of container size and height should be used, small ones, each seed in an individual hole ? ( like as using an egg plastic package as ""holes"")  would it be useful to disperse all seeds f.i. in a flat 40 x 40 x 4 cm container, and once the plants are coming out, and each produce a set of leaves, transplant those fragile stuff each in a black plastic bag, and if so, in a relatively high one ( 20 cm height ?) as the other local pines sprouts I used here are extremely fragile and don't like frequent container change. thanks for any answer.

2893,"Young peach limb bent under load and splintered, can I mend it with a graft?","Pictures first, some discussion follows.  Context shot..    Close up of the splintered limb..    The limb is probably about a half-inch in diameter. You can see that I attempted to prop it up, which was about a week ago. But it apparently bowed enough to snap. I only discovered it this morning. I suspect it happened last night but it's possible it happened as many as two days ago. One of my concerns is time, I don't know how much I have to spare.  This limb has a lot of fruit on it. I'm guessing I two and a half options. 1) Leave it as-is, possibly saving the fruit but losing the limb. 2a) Remove the fruit immediately and attempt to graft and support the limb, saving it. 2b) Same as 2a, only I fail to save the branch..  This tree has only been in the ground two years and this was the first year any fruit approached maturity. This is the thickest, most woody limb on the tree, and also the most productive. So I really hate to lose it. Also, losing it will destroy the shape of the tree.  I'm not simply going to prune it away without trying something. Would a bridge graft like this gentleman demonstrates give it a fighting chance? A major difference between my situation and his video, though, is in my case, assuming I remove all the fruit first, I expect the limb will still be unable to support its own weight. I'm hopeful I can sturdy it up with a couple or three in-line braces made from about 12-18 inch cuts from a strong wire coat hanger. As the bridge graft would leave at least some of the original bark/woody tissue connected, I'm assuming this is my best hope, but I'm concerned about the splintered wood fibers—should I cut those away so there is a smooth ""mating surface""?  Alternatively, would it be better to cut the branch cleanly, and attempt a wedge graft? I expect not but maybe someone will argue that it's better.  When I go about the grafting, is there some kind of ""adhesive paste"" I can apply to the inner portion of the graft to help encourage adhesion, healing, and nutrient flow? If so, since time is of the essence, something I can make at home with common household stuff (honey?) would be ideal.  Finally am I over-thinking this...like, is it possible to let the fruits ripen as-is, then after harvesting it (about two weeks), clean up the wound and graft it back together?  What is my best play, here?  "
2894,Save my blueberry bush from weeds?,"My ""raised"" beds are infested with weeds and way too high maintenance, so I am planning on completely obliterating the garden, putting down weed block fabric, topping it with sand and rocks and pavers, and then getting some aluminum feed containers with fresh soil to plant in.  However, there is a large blueberry bush I don't want to leave behind. I could try digging it up and replanting it in one of the containers, but worried I will kill it and maybe even take the weeds with it's soil.   Or maybe there's a way to block the weed around it? Maybe tape up the stems and seal the ground with weed block fabric and rocks? Anything like that exist? I tried a rubber tree ring, but the weeds climb up through the gaps anyways.

I'm not sure what they are or how to treat them. they're not doing real well, I don't want to lose them. I'm afraid they possibly can infect my other house plants and cause more issues. When I brought all my house plants in last fall I treated all for spider mites. Evidently the soapy water and showers didn't take care of the bugs on the palms. I've yet to check the other house plants. What are these little brown bugs on the trunk of my majestic palm, is it domed? I also have little white fuzzies on the leaves. HELP!! Do I need to worry about other plants? How do I treat them too?    "
2898,Will this propagated mulberry straighten out?,"I've successfully propagated a mulberry through a hardwood cutting.  Now that my worries of it surviving winter have passed (I can see green buds slowly opening), my next challenge is to eventually prune it in to a half standard tree. However the tree thus far kind of zigzags. The leader looks more like a side branch.   My question: Will this be allright, will it kind of straighten (it does not have to be completely straight)? Or do I have to be on the lookout or even encourage a new leader?      "

2900,Will using reflective aluminum foil start a fire?,"I have a balcony garden where I get a ton of sunlight on my wall, but not much on my plants beneath this wall. I planned on using a reflective panel made from cardboard and aluminum foil to reflect some light down.  Will be effective? Will it be safe? I don't want to start a fire on my balcony! "
2901,Why is my Gunnera walking down the hill?,"I've had this Gunnera for a long time and I haven't really paid much attention to it.  However, it seems to be walking down the slope and now its leaves are draping into my bath of non-areated compost tea.  On the left of the image you can see another smaller plant and I think that's where it started a few years ago. And there's a ground cover of the noxious weed tradescantia that I need to remove one day.   What seems to happen is that each year the plant dies back and then remerges further down the slope as though it's walking.  What's causing this?  Can I get it to walk backwards so that it doesn't climb over my paths, and stays instead under the canopy of my ponga grove?   "
2902,How to prevent heirloom varieties from weakening?,I was told that heirloom varieties will start to 'weaken' after 3 or 4 seasons.  I interpreted this as the plants will be weaker and produce less fruit season after season.  What can be done to prevent such weakening?  How do we have healthy generations older than 3-4 seasons?  Is the answer simply to have a large number of the plants and allow natural mutation and pollination to occur? 
2903,Can I put Hens and Chicks in the soil for cactus?,"I have some soil for cactus and I was wandering if it is ok to plant Hens and Chicks in this type of soil?  I have read aboout pH for the Hens and Chicks and it says it should be more than 7pH, and soil for Cactus has about 6, can it be a problem? "
2904,Dracaena Massangeana: Leaf spots on new growth,"Over the course of the past week I noticed spots developing on some of the new leaves. These start as faint yellow halos and seem to develop a brown core quickly over the course of a few days. The brown part is ~5 mm in diameter, while the halo can reach 2 or 3 cm.  The plant gets watered every 5 to 7 days (I have to admit I usually follow a schedule rather than checking moisture). The pot has no outflow, so there might be some standing watered at the bottom after each watering.  This condition has never been present on this plant before, and even now it has only developed on three or four leaves, all fairly recent.   In the last 3 years I have not given the plant anything other than water. I worry that this condition may be caused by a lack of nutrients.   My questions:   What is this condition? (My research points to ""Leaf spot disease"", apparently due to fungus) Will flushing the plant help it recover? Do I need to cut off and dispose of the affected leaves? Can the fungus spread to healthy parts of the plant if I touch them after touching infected parts? How can I heal the plant and prevent its recurrence? Should I give the plant any supplements?   EDIT: I took the plant out of its outer pot and noticed there is a fair amount of roots sticking out of the bottom. Pictures added at the bottom.  - Is this plant excessively root-bound?  - Is this a potential cause of the disease?  - Should I change anything about its current potting situation?  EDIT 2: I flushed the plant by spraying room-temperature water from the shower into the soil for about 5 minutes. I let the runoff water flow away and then put it back in its pot.    Pictures of the affected leaves (click to enlarge):         Root pictures:    "
2905,"What is this dark leafy vegetable plant? What's causing holes in the leaves, and how can I help it?",  I got a variety of seeds from a friend. Most were swiss chard and butter lettuce but this one is different. Also it's the only one that's getting riddled with little holes. What's eating it? What should I do to stop them? I haven't used any pesticides.   More photos.           
2906,How can I strengthen a part of lawn that is sometimes driven over by cars?,"Our front lawn runs right to the street, with no kerb.  The edge of it sometimes gets driven/parked on and (for reasons I'll go into below) we can't simply prevent this.  So it tends to get churned up into mud along the edge at this time of year, which then becomes slippery, so now there's a big wheelspin mark.  Is there something I can do to make it tougher? The soil is fairly heavy, with lots of clay, and we're in southern England, so winters are mild and wet.  Could I:   Sow tougher grass? It wouldn't have to be a perfect match, there are already several types of grass visible. Add something to the soil (grit, fibrous organic matter,...)?   I can probably keep it clear for a few weeks for seed to establish in spring, by putting a row of canes up if necessary.  This means I could dig something in and then resow, if I was confident it would work.  Constraints:   The road is rather narrow, meaning that sometimes crossing the corner of the grass is the only way to get in/out (but doing this slowly with the non-drive wheels doesn't really damage it).  I dismissed a potted tree on the worst patch for this reason.  The width of the road is also the main reason for parking on it. The last 50cm (2') strip (so the bit that gets driven on) is our responsibility but not technically our property so there are limits on what we can do to it.  In particular we can't plant trees/shrubs on it (it has to be kept clear for visibility) and it can be dug up with no more warning than the pavement outside any other house, to access the utilities running underneath.  "
2907,How do I start tree seeds?,"I've got some thornless honeylocust seeds (about 20). They've been stratified, and I'm ready to plant, but I'm not sure what the best approach is. I haven't started trees from seed before.   Will they work in soil blocks? 2"" or 4"" to start? Is a 2x11x22"" flat too shallow? I'm not sure how quickly the roots will go down deep. I've got plenty of milk cartons, some window box planters, various other containers that might work.   It will be 8-10 weeks before I can transplant them outside. I'm assuming that I should grow them for a year in a protected space, so I'm planning on putting them about 1-2' apart in a nursery bed. What makes a good tree nursery bed (soil, location, etc)? Is this plan a reasonable approach? "

2911,how do I cut and stack brush for chipping?,"I am cutting a lot of brush (stalks 1-2"" diameter, never larger than 3"")). And a few young trees up to 5"" which  I am denuding and disposing of the logs separately, so what remains is branches.    I want to have someone take the brush away, and I gather they would chip it first.   How do I cut it for easy chipping?   How do I stack it? "
2912,Do dead bamboo limbs run the risk of seeding a garden bed?,"  I have these three bags, along with two more waiting for curbside pickup of yard waste to start back up. I am also about to dig a garden bed for a bunch of pepper plants. Although I don't anticipate that the varieties will bear too many rodent pests, I would like to have it be raised by about a foot or two to make it easier on the eyes and to maintain.  I was wondering if the bamboo stocks would make a suitable fill material. They are just cut down stalks from a rampant overgrowth in a corner of my yard, no pesticides or herbicides or anything on them. However, I don't want them to take root and start sprouting up halfway through the growing season. I also don't want them to compress too much, or decay too rapidly.     My hypothetical plan would be to build a frame, carve out the inset for it, lay out the bamboo as a base, then cover with leaf mulch, and a compost/manure/top soil mix. I intend to wholly smother the bamboo beneath a good amount of topical materials.    Is there a real risk to using these stalks as fill for a raised garden bed? If it did sprout, would it cause any more work than regular weeding? Are there any good ways to divert those risks? (Perhaps a good shake of lime or something to that effect?)  "
2913,"Orange seedling leaf browning, curling, slowed growth? Please help!","I am a 1st time citrus planter. I planted an orange seedling in some potting mix after it germinated. Within the 1st few wks there was pretty impressive growth of leaves and height. it is now about 9wks old and i realized the growth has been stunted--haven't seen significant new leaves and the current ones has issues.   Main concern is the bottom leaf tip is browning for the past few days and I'm not sure what it is and if salvageable? I'm not sure if it's a cotyledon that's supposed to fall off but seems like it's a true leaf....  Other concern is the leaf on top is droopy and not as green as the others.  My watering regimen had been pretty consistent for the 1st 5-6 wks of growth..I would water it with tap water every few days when the top of soil looks dried. At about week 4 or 5 after 2sets of leaves had sprouted I did put some indoor plant fertilizer spritz in the soil.  I live in southern california..this tree is kept on a south facing windowsill.  Over the past few wks, we have started to keep our orchids by the same windowsill and it is next to my tree...I'm hoping it is not a fungus or pest from the orchid that is attacking my tree (I dont see any issues with my orchid leaves though)  What can I do to save my tree??? I'm tempted to cut off the unhealthy part of the bottom leaf if it's a true leaf and not cotyledon "

2915,Important features in an automated grow system,"Hello fellow enthusiasts.  Lately, I have been working on building out my own open source/open hardware grow room automation kit as I was really frustrated at the high price tag on anything in the market that had decent features.  Right now the system is setup to monitor temp and humidity.  I am currently adding in fire/smoke sensors and alerts that will email me if the room lights on fire.  I am also adding the ability to control lights(this should be quick and easy the backend is setup to support it I just need to hook another extension cord into a relay and run it into my room.  It will also have the ability to email you if the light does not kick on when it should.  The point I was trying to get to here is I would like to know what you guys think are the most important feature of systems like this?  What types of things is it most important to you that it can control?  I am also working on building a client for the system that will show the current status of sensors/appliances, will have graphs with live data showing environmental stats of the grow room and all sort of other things.  I'm working to make this as user-friendly and cheap as possible so that any home user who doesn't want to drop $2000 on a system that just monitors humidity and temp can afford to automated much of their tasks in the grow room.  I would also like to give the system the ability to change out the water in my hydroponics system and handle ph balancing and nutrient dosages but that is a very long-term goal. Let me know what you guys think and thanks in advanced for any feedback! "
2916,How much additional fertilizer should I add to a vegetable garden?,"I'm beginning to prepare the soil for my vegetable garden.  Overall, it's clay-type soil, and I've added some of the leaves from last fall and the grass clippings from last year into the soil and tilled it in.  Should I add any kind of fertilizer or manure?  How can I tell what the soil needs for prime growing conditions? "
2917,Do homemade paper pots for seedlings really work well?,"This question talks about making paper pots for seedlings, and links to what appears to be the standard pot maker for sale at various online outlets. There are also some entirely home made solutions (using an aerosol can, a jam jar, etc to shape the paper) discussed online.  I can see the definite advantage of being able to transplant without root disturbance. But you don't see much online discussion of their usage by serious gardeners, just a lot of craft/novelty/gimmicky ""hey, here's a simple idea"" pages.  Has anyone had any problem with these pots? Don't they disintegrate easily, especially with any kind of sustained watering?  I'd like the no-hassle transplanting but if I've got to rescue soggy, disintegrating pots half way through doing their job then that's no time/hassle saving at all. "
2918,"What are the steps to prepare an overgrown, grassy area for gardening?","We have an area that we attempt to use for gardening every year.  It makes a nice garden area of about 10 feet wide by 20 feet deep. It will probably end up being the subject of several questions.  But the first is how to clean it out and prepare it for spring?  We are in northern California, USA (Zone 9) so it is hard to do anything with the area through the rainy winter.  So the area is poorly cared for and horribly overgrown each year.  What is the best way to eliminate the weeds and prepare the soil for spring planting? "
2919,Should I fertilize young mango and avocado trees which have stopped growing?,"I have a few mango and avocado trees. They are between 5 and 6 months old. They appear to have stopped growing. Should I fertilize them, or is it too early?  If it is too early for fertilization, what can I use to feed them in the mean time? When I seeded them, I added them to the soil with no other ingredients.       "
2920,"Can grafting increase fruit size, productivity, and ease of growth?","I've been considering the possibility of grafting a giant watermelon variety (such as Carolina Cross) onto a giant pumpkin/squash/gourd rootstock (such as Atlantic Giant pumpkin, Weeks NC Giant, Zucca gourd, or Kikinda Competition Strain Edible Gourd). Would that affect the size of the fruit, ease of growth, and productivity, at all? I understand grafting onto squash and gourds can affect some aspects of fruit, such as firmness, at least.  Anyway, I'm hoping this might result in unusually large fruit, or at least easier to grow fruit in less than ideal conditions.  'Ease of growth' probably needs further explanation. Basically, I mean, Might it make it easier to grow large fruits (not giant, per se) without special treatment? For instance, Zucca gourds don't require special treatment to grow large, but people who grow giant watermelons and pumpkins usually report all kinds of tricks employed to get them huge (not that Zucca gourds are that big, though).  From what I read, it sounds like a gourd might be better for a rootstock than C. maxima x C. moschata, if I want good quality fruit. I'm not sure about plain old C. maxima. "
2921,What would be the most shallow hydroponic-type method (with respect to height of the pot / medium)?,"I have been researching hydroponic systems as I would like to perform some research on plant additives and/or colorants and wish to have a medium-less type growth system so that A) I do not have to account for nutrient content of the soil, etc, and B) hopefully I can achieve faster growth / more experiments with respect to time.  I intend to build this myself as its mainly a curiosity at this stage. I need the system to be very compact with respect to height as I wish to have multiple systems in pods / trays, running different mixes of additives. The majority of information online is geared to a 'specific market', where space or the height of the pot does not seem to be a concern. Regardless I performed quite a bit of reading anyway to avoid asking but seem to find that most of those allude to 10"", 5 or 10 gallon containers etc, which are a bit tall for what I am after. In my case footprint is less of an issue than height.  There are soo many types of hydroponics now available, (i.e. DWC, RDWC, continuous flow, flood and drain, etc) and other techniques (i.e. aeroponics, aquaponics etc), that I am unsure what would be easiest to produce on a small scale, DIY.  So my questions are;  A) what would you suggest would be the easiest method to produce and run reliably?  B) what would be the shallowest pot/vessel/container/tank that would work well? - I do have the option for a separate reservoir if that was required, as I would like to avoid daily maintenance if possible.  Any other tips or assistance you can give will be most appreciated, thank you. "
2922,How can I love a Silver Maple?,"I'm reading this question What is the average lifespan of most maple trees? and the answer mentions:     Silver maple 100 years (I cannot imagine why you would want to plant this species)   followed by a comment:     Silver Maples in urban areas are trouble. Their roots seek water and infiltrate water pipes. They have a poor branch structure that unusual weather can cause broken branches or splits in branches.   With such bad press about this tree, I looked it up and googled the images and lo and behold, that's my tree!  It saddened me a bit since my brother-in-law gave me this seedling from his yard (as mine was barren of any trees) and I've been really happy with how fast it's been growing.  The leaves are full and pretty and it's about 15 feet high.  I really don't want to take down this tree, so what can I do to improve the branch structure?  How realistic a concern is infiltrates water pipes? (the main water pipe to the house is not that far away from the tree)  Are the roots drilling through metal? "
2923,Is just adding a new soil layer on top of existing soil good for creating a new plant bed?,"I want to create a small area (2 square meters) for new plants and/or seedlings. I need to raise a level in that area a little (for overall garden design purposes), and I plan just to put 30cm / 1ft high layer of mixture of soil and compost to that area.  In pictures:    (the existing grass would be mowed prior to adding the new layer)  Is this plan good or bad? Do I miss something? Will the existing grass, and its roots, negatively impact new plants? "
2924,How can mushrooms be used to enhance a vegetable garden?,"I have read in various places that mushrooms in lawns are an indication of woody compostable material that is being eaten by the mushrooms and that the by-product of this process will be additional nutrients for the lawn.  Can this same process be used in a vegetable garden?  @bstpierre mentioned that mushrooms would compete well against the vegetable plants for the nitrogen in the soil in this question.  But if there is a lot of uncomposted material from the previous season (stems, roots, leaves, etc) lying on top of the garden (left there as mulch/soil amendment) can a balance be struck with mushrooms mostly feeding on the mulch and the plants eating the nitrogen in the soil?  What species of mushrooms would be good for this?  It would be nice if the mushrooms were edible. "
2925,Jade: Can I repot and/or take cuttings?,"I've read other questions on this and other forums on Jade plants, and haven't quite found an answer.  My Jade plant is 20 years old and about 3"" in diameter at the base and 4' high. It seems to never have been sick, except for a sunburn 10 years ago. A few months ago, leaves down the branches from the tips started to wrinkle and brown - more than the normal old age shedding. Now most leaves have wrinkled and are dying. The plant's trying hard to survive - it has grown new leaves that I thought would ""save"" it, but now they are wrinkling and turning brown too.  All I've read on over-watering has led me to reduce watering, then increase some after a month of low water didn't help.  An 18"" tall tree next to this one is doing great. Sunshine in Colorado isn't a problem. I'm wondering if a house sitter over watered and cause the roots to rot, but I don't know what to do now.  Can I repot a tree this large? (maybe there is no choice).  How large a branch can I start in a separate pot? How would I start a fairly large branch? "
2926,How do I prune Verbena bonariensis?,"In my region, Verbena bonariensis is a perennial rather than an annual.  It's getting quite tall, with some close to 8 feet even though it's not supposed to top 6 feet, and in the wind has taken a battering so that I've had to stake some of the bushes which were blown over.  I've read that it should be cut back after it's flowered, and some of mine are getting like that now, though I'm unsure if that applies to regions only where it grows as a perennial.  I've got flowers looking like this in their second year:    And others looking like they're forming seeds:    and close up:    This is one example of the effect of wind:    This is the base of this same leaning plant:    So, now it's going to seed, should I chop it back to the ground and wait for others to come up from self propagated seed?  Or, cut it back some inches off the ground, and at what stage?  Oh, and I've given up trying to manage the powdery mildew that affects these plants in only one half of the garden.  I'm at 150 m above sea level, and in mid summer right now though today it's wet and windy. Winter rarely gets below freezing here. "

2928,Can I save broad bean seeds before they're dry?,"My broad bean plants are near end of their life. I planted them in autumn, and now we are half way through our first summer month. Many have been blown over by strong spring winds. The bean pods are hard but most are still green, and still a ways from being black.    Now, the advice online seems to be that we must let the beans fully mature in the pod on the plant, and we can't save seed from opening these pods and letting them dry indoors.    What exactly is the issue? Do they go mouldy or are they just not mature enough? I'd really like to remove them now, and plant something else!  Update: a month later, I've decided to start harvesting some of the beans for seed. The pods are mostly black though not all are dry.   "
2929,Should I fertilize a cactus showing etiolation?,"I purchased a cactus from IKEA. It appears to be Euphorbia Pentagona or Euphorbia Enopla. The date on its pot makes me think it was repotted on December 14 2016, 4 days before I purchased it. On the day of purchase, the soil was moist.  Since purchase, the cactus has been sitting close to a south-facing window, however the weather conditions in the Netherlands rarely lead to full-sun exposure in the winter months. Indoor temperatures have fluctuated between 14°C (57°F) and 18°C (64°F), while outdoor temperatures have ranged between -1°C (30°F) and 7°C (45°F).  One month after purchase, the top of the plant's stems show signs of bright green growth. My untrained eye is unable to distinguish whether this is etiolation.  The guides I read say that most cacti need a period of dormancy between November and March where they need water only once every one or two months, and no fertiliser.  Somewhat contradictory, guides also say that cacti prefer to be fed during spurs of active growth, such as the one I think my cactus is experiencing.  My questions:   Is this cactus etiolating (maybe due to the change in conditions), or growing? Depending on the answer to the previous question, and keeping in mind that it's still winter, should I fertilise my cactus? If I need to fertilise, is this 4-4-6 NPK cactus fertiliser solution that I purchased appropriate?   Pictures:  I've added before and after pictures for comparison below. You can notice the growth I'm referring to especially at the top of the bigger stem on the left:  December 18 2016:    January 14 2017:   "
2930,Broccoli and cabbage leaves are curling (seedlings),"This is my first year for growing anything and I am having some issues with my broccoli and cabbage seedlings. For the longest time (2 weeks) they have been doing fine but recently the leaves are curling and shriving. Looking almost like they were shoved in a dehydrator. But the rest of the plant is just as good as ever. I don't know if this is lack of water since I give them water whenever the soil gets dry. So every two days? Is it something I am doing or is this natural?     Above is the picture and I edited the picture to point the bad ones, which are obvious anyway. These seedlings are in these cell trays in the basement. The soil mix is potting soil (50%) and coco coir (50%). I didn't get a good picture of the cabbage, I have a very cheap camera. Also wanted to mention, the leaves looked dried up but are not actually dried up. "
2931,Zucchini leaves yellowing - but not powdery mildew,"I have about 8 zucchini plants, about 6- 8 weeks along, which are starting to show signs of disease on the leaves.  It's definitely not powdery mildew, but the end result is quite similar. Leaves are getting yellowish patches which then develops brown spots and eventually the whole leaf turns yellow.  So far only some of the first leaves have turned yellow, but I can see it has spread to some of the larger leaves.  We've had unseasonal excessive rain over the past few months, which I assume is the cause of disease and helping to keep it spreading.  Does this sound like it can be treated and how? or Should I just remove the plants and plant something more suitable to the current weather? "
2932,Are these tomato plants ready to be replanted in to my bigger pots?,"My Tomato plants seem to be coming along quite well:    The tallest (shown) is ~10cm tall above the soil and most of them are in square 6×6×6cm cardboardish pots (there are others off-camera, in varying numbers per pot). The 'target' pots (and only other pots available) I wish to have them finally grow in are circular, 21cm in diameter and 19cm tall.  Are these tomato plants ready to move in to my larger pots, if not when? And how many should I put in each pot?  Oh, and in case that matters, the box tells me they are of the Gardeners Delight variety. "
2933,How do I get rid of ducks from my backyard?,"There are a couple of ducks in my yard (male and female).  I think they have come to my backyard to make a nest.  I fear that if this happens half my backyard will become off-limits due to an angry duck-mom.  I also worry that they will munch on my seedlings in the spring.  How do I get rid of them?  I have read that hanging CDs on trees could deter them.  Does this work?  I know a dog would do the trick, but I don't want a pet.  Also, both of my neighbours have dogs and the ducks do not mind them so far.  I want to stay away from pesticides, but if that is my only option I will use it. "
2934,Can I accelerate the ripening of strawberries?,"It's Xmas Eve and the only strawberries in the shops were not quite ripe.  I've got guests tomorrow at lunch and I've got to ripen these overnight!  Strawberries are classically considered non-climacteric fruits so are not supposed to ripen once removed from the plant.  But clearly the white parts of the berries do get redder after picking (1).  And apparently ethylene is released by the fruit, and is involved in signalling pathways (2) so the situation is not as clear as was once thought.  So, am I wasting my time placing a banana and some kiwi fruit next to my nearly ripe strawberries, and covering them with paper to trap any ethylene, to see if I can at least hasten some parts of the ripening process overnight?     That's a Berry Good Question – Strawberry Ripening after Harvest? Ethylene is involved in strawberry fruit ripening in an organ-specific manner.  "

2937,What's wrong with this Photinia fraseri tree?,"I've got three Photinia fraseri trees in my yard in Tucson, Arizona.  They were planted last May (2013) and now in September (2014), one of them is turning entirely brown and losing all its leaves (over the course of the past month or two).  The branches are still soft, so I don't think it's dead (yet). Is this a disease?   The other two trees seem to be doing much better and they're all on the same irrigation schedule, etc.  (The black marks on the bark are from Spectracide pruning sealer applied after planting because the support post had damaged some of the trunk/branches prior to planting.)  Whatever happened to that first tree looks like it's starting to slowly happen to the tree next to it.  I used a cheap soil test-kit -- and it appeared as if the pH was slightly high -- so I've been trying to flush the soil with some long, deep waterings (although it doesn't seem to be helping).    Um, what is up with moderators coming in and changing the content of our posts?  That change mis-characterized the time frame I was describing -- not 4 months, but 16 months.   Please refrain from the gratuitous grammar corrections (""3"" vs ""three"", really?).  There's already an exchange for that: [website]"
2938,How can I turn my gravel driveway into a green driveway?,"   Possible Duplicate:   What ground cover would be best for my old stone driveway?       Any ideas for what I could either seed directly onto gravel or plant for reasonable quick growth (ground cover).  This is an area which gets a little bit of car passage but mostly people.  I'm in southwest france (reasonably mild).  We are tired of adding hundreds of euros of gravel each year, and the weeds just get through anyways, so why not turn the whole thing green? "
2939,How should flowers be used as a companion in a vegetable plot?,"I noticed our neighbours have a row of flowers / flowering shrubs going through their vegetable plot. I think they are carnations.  I know I could just ask my neighbours, but I would like to get a wider opinion: Is it a good idea to plant some flowers amongst a veggie patch? I assume the aim is to increase pollination and thus improve yields.  What type of flowers make good companions? "
2940,Should I use Roundup in irrigation ditches?,"If I use Roundup to keep weeds and grass out of the irrigation ditches that bring water to my vegetable garden, will it end up washing downstream and killing my vegetables?  Also, will it harm my vegetables if I use Roundup on weeds growing in the garden if I'm careful not to get any on the vegetables themselves? "
2941,Why shouldn't I water a Blue Spruce tree during and after transplanting it?,"I live in Massachusetts, Northeastern United States, in Hardiness Zone 6, where the temperatures get down to −10°F (−23.3°C). We're getting to the coldest time right now, although so far this year has been a bit warmer than usual, so the ground isn't fully frozen.   On Friday, December 16th, we purchased a 4 feet tall living Blue Spruce (Picea pungens), to use as a Christmas tree. It was dug up on that day. (The tree was referred to in my previous question).   Since the whole point is to keep the tree alive, we've been careful to follow the instructions of the arborist from whom we purchased it.  While inside:    Keep the rootball intact in its original burlap Put it in a tub with a diameter just a few inches larger than the rootball Water it every few days from the top, keeping the rootball moist but not soggy or sitting in a lot of stagnant water Keep it in a cool room if possible. (Our 3-season room stays in the 50s or so during the day and 30s at night. We've only heated it to room temperature for a few of the total number of days.) Don't use hot Christmas lights, and only leave them on for short periods of time   For planting:   Before purchase, dig a hole at least 36 inches wide and 24 inches deep Plant the tree outside within 10 to 12 days Set it into the hole with the rootball level with the ground Backfill the hole with its own dirt and some light mulch or shredded leaves Don't water the hole, the dirt, the rootball, or the tree during planting Don't water the tree at all until about 3 months from now, at the end of March   We're planning on putting it out in a few days, and I have a question about the watering instruction. Is it true that we shouldn't water it? (Out of curiosity, if it shouldn't be watered, is that true of all trees or just evergreens?)  If in fact we should water it, what would the regimen be?    I've never planted or transplanted a tree. However, in my experience with bushes and other plants, the hole and surrounding area should be wet, and once planted, a good soaking is required. Also, the area should be kept consistently moist during the initial settling-in period.  Obviously we don't water our other trees during the winter, so it makes sense that, once established, it would rely on the elements. What I don't understand is why we shouldn't add water after planting. How will the roots spread in the cold dry ground without an initial burst of assistance?   The pictures are of the tree inside; a close-up of the root ball in the pot; the entire planting hole; and a close-up of the bottom of the hole. The soil in the bottom of the hole seems clay-like. It's thick and slimy. It almost feels like mud, just not quite as wet.  Click on all pictures for bigger, closer views.          Update: The tree is fine!   My husband planted it on the 11th day after it had been dug up. He did it by combining the advice from the arborist from whom we purchased it, the generous people who answered me here, and this excellent question/answer. He unfolded the burlap gently. It had no nails and no mesh bottom. Since the rootball was moist and holding together nicely, he removed the entire burlap. Without watering the hole, he gently laid in the tree at the proper depth, and backfilled it with the dirt from the hole, together with some other loose dirt and crushed leaves. No needles dropped and no branches fell. We're glad we didn't water it, as it rained the next day. We had our first deep frost that night, so the timing was perfect! It was a wonderful experience all around. I encourage people to use this method for their Christmas trees. The tree costs much less than it would from a regular nursery; adds to the landscape; provides a great place for birds and squirrels; and doesn't become a side-of-the-road casualty.   I didn't get any great pictures, but for reference as to location, we put it exactly where last year's pre-cut (not planted) Christmas tree was just sitting dead on top of the ground!  More pictures of the area can be found in my previous question.  Click on the pictures for bigger, closer, views.    "
2942,What tulips are best for perenniallizing in a clay-base soil?,"I have tried several times to plant tulips and have mixed results. They all do well the first year, but after that some varieties consistently die and others thrive and spread. After a little research, I found that this is common among Holland-grown tulips. Some varieties are perennial and some aren't. I have two questions. The first is, how do people in Holland maintain and multiply the non-perennial tulips? More importantly, is there a listing of tulip varieties, showing which are perennial? "

2944,How can I propagate Phoenix canariensis with vegetative offshoots?,"My neighbour has some Phoenix canariensis in his garden. And, despite reading many times that this plant does not do that, some of them have produced vegetative offshoots from basal portions of their stems.  Now I want to know, how can I make them root to develop new saplings? Is this possible? Or could these palms be, not Phoenix canariensis, but another similar palm tree, because they really never ever produce vegetative offshoots?  I can take some photos if that helps. "
2945,How often should I harvest herbs?,"I have a few herbs growing hydroponically (basil, chives, cilantro) that are about 4 weeks old.  Right now they are about 4-5"" tall and have a health glow and smell to them.  The herbs are being held at a continuous temperature, light, and nutrient level indoors, so essentially the ""season"" never changes for them.   Assuming that I always have a need for fresh herbs and therefore want to keep my plants alive as long as possible for continuous harvesting, when is it OK to start harvesting them and how often should I?  Is there a certain height/number of leaves recommendation (harvest a quarter of the leaves at a time, half the leaves at a time, etc.)?  Is there a general rule for most leafy herbs that apply for harvesting?  "
2946,Pest identification: white worm/larva?,"I’m at my wit’s end. I have a cyclamen that I’ve had about two years now. I keep it next to a spider plant and some succulents—all containered, all indoors. About six months ago I discovered these incredibly tiny white worms/larvae on the stems of the leaves. There’s no visible damage to the plants, but I live in a studio and don’t want bugs in my one room of living space.  I already leave it to get really dry in between watering (I had a fungus gnat problem once so this habit has stuck). I tried a houseplant inspect killer (imidacloprid) with no effect. I’ve tried a spray bottle with soap in it 4-5 times, and it seems like they’re gone for about two weeks but they come back! They don’t seem to be on the other plants and the soapy solution hasn’t been well tolerated by my succulents so I think I’m giving up on that.   Is it possible they’re fungus gnat larvae? I am skeptical because they are on the stems, not on the soil, and they don’t seem to match the pics I see online. I also once had a spider mite problem with some herbs that I dealt with by throwing all those plants and soil away, but these don’t have legs...  I wish I had a better photo but as you can see they are incredibly small!  Any help is appreciated as I may just toss the plants if I can’t figure out how to get rid of them! "
2947,What are the best soil amendments for container grown blueberries?,"What are the best soil amendments for blueberries grown in containers?  What's the best mulch?  Last year I used chopped leaves from a friend's landscaping job that is no longer around.  I also remember hearing about adding coffee grounds to the soil to help with acidity.  I haven't tested the soil yet, but have a bunch of coffee grounds from a local coffee shop. Do they raise the ph so much that I shouldn't add them if I haven't tested the soil? "
2948,Why is it bad to till wet soil?,I read that tilling wet soil can destroy soil structure and make it more difficult for seeds to grow roots through the soil.  How exactly do roots find their way through the soil? Can artificial soil structure be created for roots to grow more easily? 
2949,Do chemicals leach from the sides of raised beds?,Around a year ago I went to a local hardware store to buy some treated pine logs to make a raised garden bed. The guy at the store asked if I was using it for a vegetable bed and he explained that chemicals from the treated pine would leach into the soil and I should use a special type of wood specifically designed for use in garden beds.  I have since abandoned the idea of purchasing from the hardware store and currently I only have one raised bed which I am using for potatoes which I have built up using an old bookshelf I picked up for free and knocked the back out. This is made out of what I assume is melamine coated particle board.  Is there research around where leaching of wood materials has been properly researched and documented?  What healthy as well as sustainable / recycled / reusable solution should a person use when building a raised bed? Note: This doesn't necessarily need to be wood it could be something like recycled brick.

2951,What is a good alternative to pressure treated wood for raised beds?,"I've had my pressure treated wood raised beds for my vegetable garden since 2005 and was recently made aware of the potential risks of using this kind of wood.  I have seen conflicting articles saying that it may be OK to use pressure treated wood after 2003 such as this one:  Using Pressure Treated Wood For Raised Gardens...Is It Safe For Growing Food?? However, I am trying to replace my chemical habits with good non-toxic ones.  What type of wood will be good for a few raised veggie beds?  About how long do you think it will last before needing to be replaced?  I'm in zone 7B if that makes a rotting difference. "
2952,Will wisteria clippings take root in a compost pile?,"I just did a major pruning of a wisteria. I don't look forward to bagging all the clippings and hauling them to the town site for yard waste. Could I simply gather them up and dump them in the compost pile in the woods behind my house or is there any danger that the wisteria clippings will take root? I don't want to risk the woods being taken over by wisteria. If there is risk, I wonder if it decreases if I leave the clippings drying in the sun for a few days to make sure they're dead? "
2953,Can I make my own seed raising mix?,From what I understand there is something in seed raising mix that increases the chance of germination and I guess the rest is stuff that helps feed a seedling. What is there in seed raising mix that improves chances of germination?  Is there a way I can make my own seed raising mix? I would like something that is as natural / organic / chemical free as possible. 
2954,What kind of insect is this on my green chilli?,"I have a green chilli plant that I bought a couple of weeks back. It seems to have some sort of insect over several of its leaves (see pics below). I am wondering if this is  scale or spider or mite? If so, should I treat it by rubbing alcohol?

2956,"T5 AgroLED, Hortilux PowerVEG FS + UV, UV and Mold","I am growing microgreens and wheatgrass and sometimes run into trouble with mold. I have read that mold can be controlled by using LED lights but I cannot seem to find anything more specific.  I assuming that the mold control comes from the UV.  Now my question(s) What band of UV is controlling the Mold ?  Not all, in fact most household LED's will not be producing UV at all. I assume they must be referring to the grow specific LED's in the arket.  Do my ArgoLED's provide the required UV Spectrum ?

2960,The plant stems start to split (crack) vertically in a hydroponic system,"I have planted several bell pepper plants in my hydroponic system (DWC). I have used coconut peat as the growing medium and used the following nutrient solution:     The problem is, all my plants have cracks in their stems.

So, the question is, how can I solve this issue?     "
2961,How can I prevent my Nepenthes pitchers from drying out?,"I received what I guess is a Nepenthes last month, but the pitchers have all dried out by now. It starts with the lid drying up and once that happens it takes 10 days until the entire pitcher is all dried up. I cut it off before this happens.  I read that its soil may never dry out and that it needs much light but not direct sunlight.  What am I doing wrong?   I wait until the soil is almost dry and then give it lots of water. This is around each fifth day. I placed it in a hanging pot in a window over the kitchen sink, where there is never any direct sunlight but occasionally are lots of non direct sunlight. (Sweden, so sun is not strong.) I replanted it and gave it a bio-fertilizer that actually had a way expired date. ?    "
2962,Deer ate my lily buds last year. Will the bulbs survive this year?,"My mother has been raising an ever-growing family of lilies of various colors for the past 15 years. In the previous house, they would grow to almost 6-foot tall while in the new house (which gets a lot more sun), they stay around 3'-4'. She is sure that the stunted growth is due to their not needing to “reach” for the sun, so she is not concerned about that. She was a little worried for a while about them going into shock from being transplanted, but then they grew, so they have survived fairly well for quite a few years now.  What she is worried about is the fact that there are deer near the new place. Last summer, she was horrified one morning to find that a lot of her lilies were slashed. She thought it was a neighbor, but when she found clear deer-prints in the dirt (both adult and fawn), she stopped feeling so bad. She doesn’t mind deer eating the flowers, but unfortunately they are “greedy”; that is, they eat almost all the buds before they have even bloomed at all. We tried wrapping the garden in plastic chicken wire, but that didn’t work. I tried looking up a way to spray some sort of repellent but could not find anything reliable.  Her concern now is whether the lilies will survive if the flowers are prevented from blooming and being fertilized by bees (there are plenty of bulbs safely under the ground).  Are the bulbs enough? What role then do the flowers play? "
2963,Should I plant my garden early this year?,"Due to the unusual weather in the Midwestern USA this year with record highs being set almost on a daily basis, should I plant my summer garden earlier?

2965,Which organic fertilizer should I use to encourage flower growth?,"I heard that some plants need fertilizing every two weeks in order to encourage flowering. I prefer organic fertilizers because I feel they provide better nutrients, however they are in granules and are slow releasing.   What is the best way for me to provide a clean, fast, organic way to fertilize the soil to encourage flowering? Should I use the inorganic fertilizer? "
2966,How should I care for a new Mimosa tree growing out of an old Mimosa stump?,We lost an old Mimosa to borers and it fell over in a wind storm. This spring it started a new growth out of the cut stump.It looks healthy but is growing RAPIDLY and it does not have much space. We put a wire fence around it to hold it in place and tied some of the branches together to keep it steady. It is a parkway tree and butts into the sidewalk now.   Is this a losing battle? How can I prune this tree to survive in this space and when do I trim?  I'm located in Southern California. 
2967,How big a lemon tree can I grow indoors?,"I recently (yesterday) received a lemon tree as a gift. It's a little more than two meters tall, and comes with a giant pot, maybe around 50 cm in diameter and height. I'm planning on growing it indoors, but I have two questions about the viability of doing this.   Is this the right sized pot for a tree of this size? The tree will be facing a very large window, but the top branches, right now, will still be above the height of the start of the window - which means they'll get light, but no direct sunlight. Is this OK? Lower down, this window gets a few hours of direct sunlight every day.  "
2968,How can I keep my flamingo plants small for a terrarium?,"I have some flamingo plants, Anthurium sp., growing in my 60x100x60 cm rainforest terrarium. My problem is about this big one here   It's about 60cm in height, and I want it to keep it a bit smaller and growing more, but smaller leaves (both the green leaves and the spadices).  The plant is growing on a mixture of orchid and plain clay granules. Lightning is a very natural (and powerful) sun spectrum, and the plant is fully exposed to the lights. The permanent daylight schedule is 13/11 (on/off), which I've chosen mainly for my pets (madagascar daylight geckos) living there. The actual lighting setup is a 50W HID lamp (directly above this plant), and a 150W HQI lamp, that produces most of the required sunlight spectrum. Also watering is almost completely automated, I've got a rainfall (misting) simulator, that runs 5 times a day (the atmospheric humidity is pretty high ~75-80%). I have other, smaller flamingo plants growing in this terrarium, and they are more appropriate within my conceptions. Though the plant I'm talking of, already was big from the beginning (~35cm).  My question is: What can I do (how to cut down) to give this plant a more smaller (ca. 40cm height), and more bushy shape?  To elaborate on my concerns: I'm afraid of just clipping all of the big leaf and spadix sprouts, could I actually kill the plant?  Any hints appreciated! "

2970,Does aerating water to raise the pH in nutrient solutions work well?,"As anyone who has ever had to tend to a pool painfully discovered, aerating water causes the oxygen to react with something and raise the pH. From what I have read it converts contents of the water that are considered micro nutrients for some plants, like manganese and iron. Now when watering plants, it may be necessary to raise the pH of the nutrient solution. Can aeration be a tool for this or will it deprive the water of some nutrients?  On the other hand, in good soil the water will be in contact with air anyway, so aerating the water could more accurately reflect the final pH of the solution in the soil. Is that an accurate assumption? "
2971,Should I just trim the leaves when I harvest my herbs?,"In the past, I grew some herbs which I harvest them when I see them grow out of space. Then I just cut the whole stem, then the plant will split in 2 ways growing in a Y shape. The next time it grew out of space, I cut the whole stem again, and produce another Y shape branch. Eventually its leaves become smaller and are too small to harvest.  Is this a bad way of harvest? Should I just take the leaves? "

2973,Why did the samaras on my maple suddenly turn pink?,"I don't know a thing about Landscaping but have been getting more interested lately as I shop for houses. Just last week I realized that a maple tree in my front yard had pink ""helicopters"" (now I know they are called ""samaras"").  I am nearly 100% certain that this tree has never had anything but green samaras before this year and it definitely has green leaves.  The tree is only around 20 feet tall, and I have lived in this house for over 20 years and never seen this. Is it normal for the samaras to change color?    At the same time, there is a ""red bud"" tree that suddenly bloomed this year, when I am (again) nearly positive it has never been anything but green and brown.    Do trees often bloom and/or change seed colors like this?    With the Lilac bush in that same spot in the yard it's suddenly quite beautiful. "

What equipment to use(UK based),"I am expecting 10K Saffron corms in June this year and I have been all over the internet attempting to find       1) what equipment to use to plant the corms. As they are corms I thought a potato planter will do the job because of the similarity in shapes but I do  not know.      Second is I live in Biggin Hill  and there is a dearth of equipment hires locally.     There is a company called burdens.com but no matter how many calls, emails sms I send, I am ignored because my land is only 1.2 acres and I am tiny in my requirements. Others are not any better. HSS never have the equipment.     Is there anybody that knows a good equipment (cheap) that is mechanised like  a ride on mower that can be used for the purpose. Since I will doing this regularly, I do not mind buying the equipment.    Please help as I am coming up fast to D-day and I have no idea except I am not planting these by hand.   The reason I need the equipment is that I have given the local labour a chance and shall I say they do not come up to my standards.    I may not be able to do the whole work but I can do a bit and that bit will be done properly. However the local help are not capable of that and hiring them will mean I eventually try and do the work myself which will be a double loss bcos once I agree to paying, I will find it difficult to ""carp"" and being forced to do the work myself will result in paying twice.      Can anyone recommend a piece of equipment, either hand driven or towed by a tractor or motorised cycle (forgot its name now - something x) that can at least dig the furrows to the right depth and spacing?   I can then plant the bulb manually. I am using clay beads to improve drainage. so topping up the holes will be the easiest part of it.    I need a suggestion of the equipment name that can dig the holes properly at least depth and spacing. Anybody?...    As I said, manually doing it -- My back will not stand the workload.

2975,Is there any reason not to mix warm and cool season native grasses?,"I'm looking to plant a no-maintenance prairie in my desert southwest yard (Northern New Mexico, zone 7B, sand and heavy clay soil, 7 inches of annual rainfall). Two years ago I planted a bunch of Blue Grama and it does well with no irrigation. One year ago I planted Streambank Wheatgrass elsewhere and that does well too, also with no irrigation. Streambank wheatgrass retains a bit more color in the winter, so I'd like to add it to my grass mix when I plant more to fill even more of my large and very sad-looking dirt yard. So my question is: can I plant these two grasses together? Blue Grama is a warm season grass and Streambank Wheatgrass is a cool season grass. Is there any problem with such an arrangement? Will they grow together? Will one dominate and crowd out the other, wasting the money spent on the loser? Will it look stupid in the winter with big weird clumps of green Streambank Wheatgrass amidst the dormant yellow-gray Blue Grama? "

2978,How to encourage new raspberry stalks to grow away from the main stalk?,Here's a photo of my Canby raspberry plant. The new stalks are only growing near the original stalk. My Fall Gold raspberry plant is also doing the same thing. Is this caused by my mulching? I would actually prefer the new stalks to grow away from the main stalk so that there's better airflow. A row of plants would be more aesthetically appealing also.    As a side question: are red raspberry's supposed to be yellow before they're ripe? My Fall Gold (yellow) is nearby and maybe the cross pollination caused my Canby to become yellow too. Can cross pollination even do that? 
2979,Soft Fruit - Canes or Large Potted Plants?,"I'm looking at setting up some soft fruit beds in my allotment, and looking around it seems like I can either buy canes or large potted plants (~3L pots). The only difference I can appreciate so far is the cost.  In particular, I will be growing Rasberries, Blueberries and Blackcurrants. They will be planted in the ground, in a line and supported as required. Soil will be prepared as required (Blueberries, acidic etc).   What are the main differences between the two?  Would you expect a better yield from the large potted plant in year 1?

2980,Is Poke Milkweed nice or nasty?,"I am growing this from seed:  Asclepias exaltata  which is not the poisonous pokeweed  Poke Milkweed   Height .5-1.5m  Zone: 4  The grower, Gardens North, claims it is:     Found in the wild in rich woods and forest edges, with elegant sprays   of long-lasting white flowers overlaid with a subtle lavender to green   tint. Poke milkweed is a species of the Carolinian forest, at the   northern limit of its range in southern Ontario.   Some milkweeds can be invasive. Has anyone grown this? "
2981,Houseplant seems to be dying,"I recently moved out and got gifted a fairly big houseplant by my aunt. I quite like the look of it and aim to keep it alive, in part because it is my first ever own plant.  She didn't remember what kind of plant it was, only that I should water it once a week.  However, it seems to be dying... The leaves are turning yellow or simply seem to die, the shade of green appears to be slightly darker than when I got it and the tips of the leaves have started hanging/curling up.  So I would very much like to know:     What species is this? How do I keep it alive?   I'll post pictures below. The window in the latter picture is facing West-southwest. Across the street is a large tree blocking some, but far from all, sunlight.   These pictures were taken around 08:30 local time, during overcast.      "
2982,What can I grow in a sealed office environment with no natural light or airflow?,"Can ANY plant with green foliage survive in a sealed office environment with fluorescent lighting from 8am to 5:30pm and air conditioning set at 20 C (for the remaining time, there is basically zero light and limited air flow)?  We have a very sterile office which has been designed to effectively be a Faraday cage and we'd love to introduce some real, living greenery to make it less bleak.  In case it is not already clear, there are no windows and there is definitely no natural light.  My question is a bit similar to the three following but more inclusive. In our case we're really not fussed at the absence of flowers or fruit, but it must be able to survive on fluoroescent light alone.   What are some low maintenance plant choices for apartment (indoor) living? Is there a fruiting plant that can grow in an office environment? What flowering bulbs grow well in an air conditioned office environment?    If there are any suitable candidates, please rank in order of indoor-toughness. "
2983,How do I get rid of pill bugs in my vegetable garden (or is it even the problem)?,"I have had multiple plants in my vegetable garden that have seemed to just vanish from the garden over the period of about a week. I have notice pill bugs eating the remains of the plants. They seem to be focused on my lettuce. How can I determine if the pill bugs are the ones at fault or if they are just feasting on the fatal lettuce remains? If they aren't the pill bugs, how do I determine what would cause it?  A little bit of detail: This is a new garden in which I pulled up grass and placed a thick layer of Miracle-Gro's Garden Soil for Flowers and Vegetables on-top of the clay soil that we have here. We have had a very large amount of rain over the last couple weeks that has caused everything to stay saturated for days along with some high winds that took out some of my tulips. I am in hardiness zone 6b.  Here is a picture of what the damage looks like on plant that was in good shape yesterday.    And the little guys under the damage (sorry for the blurry photo, I tried multiplies and this is the best focus I could get)    And a new discovery today. The bottom of my bell pepper plant appears to have been chewed on.   "
2984,How do I get rid of wild grape vines?,I have what seems to be Wild Grape Vines killing off my hedges.  Is there any other recourse besides uprooting them all?  Would clipping them down and spraying stump rot be another possibility? 
2985,How can I organically make the soil potassium rich?,"I believed that my tomato plants suffer from potassium deficiency, and by searching it on google it states that I can easily fix it by putting potassium fertilizer in my soil.  I am now thinking on how can I organically put potassium on my soil? Is there anything that I can easily found on the kitchen to make my soil potassium rich? Something like this, it states that by putting egg shells on my tomato plants can make the soil calcium rich.     Place egg shells in the soil near tomatoes. Calcium is very useful to tomatoes because the extra calcium will help prevent blossom end rot.   I am just a beginner when it comes to planting so please guide me. "

2989,What should I do before applying organic fertilizer to ensure no bugs or smell?,"Does all organic fertilizer require decomposing? I would like to focus on fertilizer available in gardening shops instead of unprocessed urine or manure from mammals.  As far as I know, decomposing of organic fertilizer require microbes in the soil and the action itself may have some undesired smell or it may attracts bugs.  If I want to avoid bugs and stinking smell, what should do before applying the fertilizer to the soil? Should I compost the fertilizer?  The reason of asking this is that I have an experience of using organic fertilizer in granule form bought from gardening shop. I put the granules on the surface of soil as instructed by the manual ( it said it is okay to put it on the soil or in the soil ). After some months ( I didn't look into the soil when I watered them ), I found there were quite a lot of ants moving in and out of my pot. Then as I checked the plant, I found the organic fertilizer granules covered with white fungus. I wonder if the fungus attracted the ants. "

Can I get the leaves small enough for a bonsai? Any experiences? "
2992,"Hydroponics Nutrients and Fertilizers, are they same?","Let me start of by saying that I am a person with very little experience of gardening. I have just been growing some plants in my balcony and in the process fell in love with this hobby and stumbled upon Hydroponic gardening. Since then I have been reading a lot about hydroponics but one thing has been confusing me and I would like someone to clear confusion revolving around nutrients.   I understand that all the nutrients that plants need in hydroponics are provided through water. I am not clear about the following things:   Should I use normal hydroponic nutrient (sold in two parts A &amp; B) or should I use so called hydroponic fertilizers. If I start with A &amp; B Nutrients, should I replace them with fertilizer at the later stage when plant starts producing flower, should I mix them both or will simple nutrient formula be enough for the plant? Can I use ordinary soil fertilizer, for hydroponics and save some money or will it not be enough?   I know the question of nutrient will depend heavily on the plant under discussion so I am taking chilli peppers and tomatoes for reference. "
2993,Should I replace this arborvitae or will it grow back?,"I’ve got a row of arborvitae and one is looking a bit half-dead. Does this guy have a chance? Or should I dig him out and replace him?  I’ve only been in this house one growing season, so I have only just fertilized it, kept it watered and stabilized the plants by tying them to the fence for support. This is in Minnesota, they get full sun during the day, and the soil is rather clay-like. (And yea, they had a bit of snow damage due to the last heavy snowfall so their shape is still coming back)    "

2997,Is it a good idea to add sugar or other things to the water for cut flowers?,"Mostly for future reference, is it helpful to add sugar or other things to the water meant for cut flowers?  There seems to be conflicting data from different sources. See How can I preserve a bouquet of flowers for two days before gifting them?  I've heard that the sugar:   feeds beneficial bacteria feeds the plant (which I know to be wrong, plants don't metabolize sucrose)  helps prevent air bubbles   But none of this has been satisfactorily been shown true for me. My experience says 'use plain water', and then masteragardeners.org tells you to add all kinds of things to the water. Some people even say a copper penny helps.  Let's get this straight once and for all. "
2998,What is the right time to water my lawn?,"I finally own my home and this is my first spring. I have a decent front lawn that I want to keep as green as possible. I've always been told not to water in the day as it can burn the grass (as a result of the sun). Is this true? Is it true all the time? It's a nice 75 degress out right now, will this hurt my grass if I water it now? What about when it's a hot 95?  Any insight or recommendations? "
2999,How can I permanently get rid of honeysuckle vines?,"I just moved into a new home where the yard was not kept well.  Most of the wire fence in the backyard is overgrown with honeysuckle vines (such that you can no longer see the fence).  In corners of the yard, there is no grass - just vine roots.  What makes the problem worse is that the backyard is very close to a creek, so the soil appears very rich - I'm digging up dozens of bulbs that have sprouted among the roots of these vines.  What are some tips on getting rid of the vines for good?  How can I ensure they don't come back? "
3000,Lilly pilly hedges growing unevenly,"I have 12 lilly pilly (acmena smithii) hedges (2 out of picture) facing south in the Victoria, Australia which get some sun all year round. It seems though that the ones on the left are growing much better and they degrade off in size going right. Would the tree on the other side of the fence be playing a part in that? They were planted late march 2017 and have bushed out quite a bit, I've been trimming regularly up until about 2 months ago.  I've put some seaweed fertiliser on them last month to give them a feed before we hit winter in june.  So my questions are:   Is the size difference just a thing that happens or should I be doing something to the smaller ones to encourage growth? How often should I trim the tops of these, 1-2 year? Or way more often? My end goal is for them to be just under 2m in height.    "
3001,Multi-Trunk Muscadine Grapes,"I have a multi-trunk muscadine vine where instead of maintaining/pruning root shooters, the previous owner let them grow out of the ground from the root system.  Now I have 20 trunks at the single location, where it grows up a fence trellis to a tabletop arbor.   How should I prune this to get good sweet fruit?  Should I cut all but one trunk? cut half this year, half next year, etc? ... Leave them all and manage them via small sections on top of the arbor?  There are actually 4 groups of multi-trunk grapes, but I didnt want to complicate it too much.  Willing to experiment some but just looking for some guidance on whether it matters much which path I choose. "

3003,Practical identification of suckers on a cumquat tree,"I have a small cumquat tree, and sometimes it grows new, low branches, which I suspect are suckers. But how can I be sure, how can I decide whether to prune them or not?  Here is a picture of the latest suspect on my tree:    It seems to me that the graft was made very low - you can see (what I think it is) here:    So the question is, do I cut the lowest branch?

So this time around, I did it one last time and un-wantingly I have sprayed glyphosate to kill the weeds. I have a weed mat ready and now I am trying to know how I can prevent weeds from growing. To cover the weed mat, I thought I'd get some mulch and spread it around. But I live in a very humid place and mulch will attract cockroaches. Gravel is too expensive. Hay will attract rodents/rats.Any ideas on what can be put on the weed mat ?  How can I prevent weeds and (gamba?)grass from growing in my yard ?  "
3005,Requirements for successful Blueberry bush planting,"We tried planting Blueberries last year, and went 0 for 3.  We tried to follow the instructions:   Planted in a mix of 50/50 mulch and organic gardening soil Watered infrequently but heavily (1/week, skipping if heavy rain) Planted three bushes/trees about 10 feet apart (20 feet total, 3 different varieties) Made sure the soil was somewhat acidic (though we didn't know about Magnesium, which we now do) Planted them where they're in 3/4 or so sun - they should have direct sun at least 4-6 hours a day, more in the summer, and when they grow to their full 4-5 feet (the varieties I'm getting grow that high) will have closer to full sun.   Two of the three were smaller (probably about a year old when bought, maybe 12"" tall) and didn't ever really do anything, and this year didn't produce leaves (so are presumed dead).  The third was more like 2-3 years old (2' tall or so) and did make some baby berries that year, but never really made it back this year - it had some leaves, but it was very weak, to the point that a relative removed it by accident while weeding (but it clearly was too spindly and dry to make it anyway).  This year, we bought two more, hoping to plant them with more success.  What should we do differently?  The general soil in our yard is fairly dense and lower quality (just grass for years and years), so one consideration is removing a much larger amount - but how much?  And replace it with gardening soil, or a sandier soil, or mulch/compost?  And what else can we do to encourage root growth so the bushes can make it through winter - if that's realistic at this point in the year (or should we try wintering them indoors and plant them in spring).  We live in  zone 5a/5b, which is supposed to be a good area for blueberries. "
3006,"Nepenthes ""Lady Luck"" Help","I was wondering if someone could help me with my Nepenthes 'Lady Luck' plant.   I ordered it from a dealer off of Amazon a few months ago. I bought it because it was supposed to do well enough inside a house, without a terrarium.   When it arrived, it looked like it was properly packed. It had a peat moss/dirt around its roots and came with a very small pot and some sphagnum moss to pot it with. I had a 4"" pot on hand, so I upgraded the pot size. There were traps that looked healthy when I unboxed it, but I expected to lose them from shock and shipping. I did lose all of them. I currently have it planted in straight sphagnum moss, in a 4"" pot. I keep it near a window and under a lamp that I leave on from 6.45am-10.30pm. I keep the sphagnum moss damp. It has dried out on me twice, though. I thought it was still damp, but I felt it, and it was dry.   The plant seems to have done okay, and that's really what I expected. I figured it'd just hang and maybe drop some leaves from shock, then recover and start growing again. It's now been a few months and the plant maintained for a long time. I expect it to start growing again, but now it's loosing more leaves.  I'm watering it with well water and letting the sphagnum moss get damp before watering again. It's currently inside, as I said, under the lamp and by the window, so it should be getting enough light. I live in the upper part of SC, USA, so this summer, I plan to move it outside, slowly, where it can enjoy the hot and super humid climate. Can anyone help me prevent this plant from dying?  I read that with venus flytraps, you can take a weak solution of miracle grow on a q-tip and brush the undersides of the leaves to give it a small fertilizer boost without harming it, can you do that with these, as well? Thanks for the help. I will post answers if you have more questions about my setup.  Here are the pictures I promised:    I've been referring to it as one plant for simplicity, but there were two shipped to me, and I didn't want to split them when they were already stressed. The leaves you see dying have been healthy for a few months. "

3011,Which grass is best suited as an indoor perennial?,"I would like to decorate our living room with a strip of grass. Which type should I grow? The requirements are as following:   should be a perennial or at least grow for a year or so slow growing, consequently pruning required only occasionally (once a month or less) grows well indoors with no direct sunlight (although bright room with lots of windows) little attention required straight, green leaves BONUS: health benefits when consumed (I assume this could contradict with the first requirement, since you usually plant new seeds for each portion?)   Wheatgrass is tempting, but it grows too fast.   "
3012,Does an injured succulent require amputation?,"Two or three days ago, while moving some plants, I dropped a cork cup holder onto one of my succulents (Euphorbia Enopla, pictured below). The fall caused some of the spines to come off, and the plant exuded a thick white sap, which has now dried up.   The part of the plant that got hit is not starting to look bruised, and while the bruise hasn't evolved much in the past 24 hours, a very similar bruise is what I saw in a succulent of the same type (albeit without damaging it myself) before it ultimately rotted and died.   The bruise is at the tip of one of the branches, which it would be possible be cut off.   I don't know if the bruise will get worse or not. Could the bruise become callused (unless this is a property only cactuses, and not Euphorbia have) and heal? Will it spread to the whole plant and cause it to rot? What is the right course of action to save the plant?  This is the plant previous to the injury. The injury happened on the arm:    This is a photo I took yesterday. You can see the brown spot, about 2mm long, on the tip of the arm:   The last picture shows the injury as it is today, roughly 24 hours later. It hasn't grown significantly, however it looks like it might be getting worse:  "
3013,"Can I use greens, such as grass, as a fertilizer for tomatoes?","In my country I don't have fertilizer products, but I know that I can get nitrogen from any greens.

Is there a better method to get use of the greens as a fertilizer?  UPDATE: I live in Egypt. I want to grow cherry tomatoes in containers. The green is kind of grass.  I don't have space to make compost. "
3014,Is my cactus dying?,"I bought my cactus about one year ago. I was surprised that it grew very fast and I thought it's fine. But it looked too skinny and after some search on the internet I found out it didn't get enough light. I changed its place, now it's near the window, but unfortunately there's not much sunlight on the street where I live.  In the last month the color of the top changed a bit and some parts look burned. Also the texture doesn't seem right. Is my cactus dying? If yes, can I save it?   "
3015,Why does my cactus have a weird white coating? What type of disease is it?,"My cactus used to have white little rod like insects on it, and when I put some insecticide (added by liquid to the soil around it), the insects disappeared and it grew this weird coating, as shown in the picture. In addition, the other cactus (from the same type) next to it also grew this coating, but the other cacti and succulents next to it were not influenced by it.  What is it? What can I do to heal it?   "
3016,"How and when should I prune my 5 in one dwarf apple tree, including the suckers?","We have one of those 5 in one apple trees and actually got a couple of apples off of it last year. It seems like we have more trees growing off of it.   There are some branch like things sprouting from the bottom of the tree or out of the dirt. From reading another question here, I think those might be non-fruiting suckers. Are they just where the tree is growing new trees off of it, because I'm told this type of tree does that?   If they are suckers what season should I clip them? Some places say wait until summer and some say cut as soon as possible. It's been rainy here and with El Niño no one knows whats going on. I'm in zone 8. "
3017,When to plant pole beans after corn?,"My corn is now about a foot high, and heavily mulched with dried bindweed. They say you can use corn to support pole beans, though others say it pulls down the corn.    So, at what height of corn should I plant beans to use the corn for support, and is there a point when it's too late? And can I just plant the seed into soil under the mulch, or do I need to pull the mulch apart?  Edit: the corn is being grown in an area just recently cleared of native bush, and under a large pine tree.  The soil has 6 - 12 inches of topsoil full of organic matter, is not compacted, and the plants have not been fertilised. "

3019,Why does my Goji Berry produce many flowers but never bear fruit?,"I have a 4 foot tall Goji Berry plant that has been prolifically producing flowers all year long. None of the flowers ever become fruit. I've witnessed hummingbirds poke into each flower because they love purple flowers more than any other color. That means they should be pollinated, right? The dozen other fruit trees in my garden have no problem pollinating naturally - I have many wasps and bumble bees.   It might be diseased. Most of the time, it has what appears like talcum powder on its leaves. I sprayed it down with neem oil once and it went away, but came back within a week. Maybe the powderiness is natural to its leaves???    "

These trees are wierd!,"I inherited 3 trees when I bought my house and all three have thorns on the branches with two trees having what appear to be lemons with orange highlights.  When opened they have a very thick skin, are easy to peel and have a light orange and lemon smell.  They are not sweet and not as tart as a lemon but edible nonetheless.  The third tree has what I think are lemons and limes but they are all small and mostly I think to be limes.  I cant seem to find any grafting on the trees, however they are over 5 years old.  What the heck is going on here? Does anyone have any idea what they might be?    "
3025,Is this Christmas tree?,"We just moved into this house and there is a tree right next to the side.       It is way too big and too close to the house for me to like it. I have big problem in the past with any pine trees near the house in Pacific Northwest.  Questions:   Is it what they call ""Christmas"" tree?

3026,Is a self-watering pot viable for indoor gardening in the long term?,"I got a big self watering pot with 3 different plants. After some weeks it got some mold (something like this, but I got it earlier) in it and after trying some stuff in the internet I ended up changing the soil to stop the mold from growing.   In this pot there is a fern, a fittonia and succulent and I'm starting to think the fern is getting too much water.  I also got 3 other self-watering pots. One of them has an oregano, another has a small pepper and the last one has a cherry tomato. The oregano has some leaves with brown tips (I learned here that it might be overwatering), the pepper is not very good as well (some pictures here), and the cherry tomato is not the best either.  I keep all those plants indoors, there is no direct sunlight but there is clarity.  Are those pots viable for this situation? I feel that my plants are getting too much water and the mold seems to be a problem too, but I'm an absolute beginner on this.  Here is a to the pots that I got big one (there is a stack in the video but i only have the bottom one), and the small ones.  As per request, following are some pictures:     "
3027,Do seeds from fresh tomatoes need to completely dry before they will sprout?,I have been growing cherry tomatoes for about four years now. My method is hardly scientific. I throw the bad fruit on the ground and let them germinate the next year.  Last year I got some different varieties which I thought I would add to my veggie patch. I don't know the names of the different varieties. I took four tomato fruits and directly planted them in soil in December. It is now February and I've only had a good level of success with one of them. I have about 30 seedlings which I have since separated. One of the other tomatoes has only grown two seedlings so far and it is nearly the end of summer.  I also had four seeds from a tomato that I ate that dried out on my cutting board. I sowed them and each of them sprouted within about a week into a healthy seedling.  I partially dug up one of the non-sprouting tomatoes and noticed that a lot of the flesh was still around the seeds and quite moist after over a month. I know it's a bit late in the year with autumn starting in March but if I can get any of them to sprout I am considering keeping them indoors over winter to stop the few cold days we get from killing them.  Should I have cut the tomatoes open to let the seeds dry out before sowing them? Do tomato seeds need to completely dry before they will sprout? Do some varieties not grow from seed? 
3028,Can apple scab be treated with comfrey or other biodynamic accumulators?,"In this video from Advancing Eco Agriculture it is claimed that apple scab is totally arginine-dependent for energy, and historically sprays for apple scab suppressed arginine production. In some trees prone to apple scab, their cobalt levels are lower in sap than those relatively resistant to scab.  They treated affected trees with cobalt (sulphate I presume) to try and speed up the metabolism of arginine to other peptides and proteins to deprive the fungus of an arginine source curing the scab.  This article talks about herbal leys to improve apple production.  A herbal ley is a leafy green ground cover including amongst others Apiaceae, yarrow, chamomile, borage, clover, chicory, cornflower, clover, lupin and comfrey.  Comfrey (Symphytum Officinale) is a well known biodynamic accumulator that many have recommended growing in the garden (confined so that it doesn't take over the garden) for using its leaves to add nutrients to the compost pile.       comfrey’s thick and tuberous roots create an expansive root system, allowing the plant to “mine” compacted soils for minerals and other nutrients which are often difficult for other plants to obtain. It is this ability to help cycle nutrients through the soil that has given comfrey its designation as a dynamic accumulator plant.    I wonder whether therefore it's worthwhile to try growing comfrey alone under my apple tree to see if it can bring up cobalt to help the tree fight the scab.  I'm hoping a ground cover might also stop the spores from being blown back up into the canopy.    [website]"
3029,Why it is bad to add sand to soil?,"Motivation: this comment from stormy:     And DO NOT ADD SAND to garden soil!!! ARRRGGHH. Again, when one takes clay soil, gravel, lime, gypsum, water and then ROTATE what does one get? Concrete. Sand is right in there. Does NOTHING for the soil. The ONLY WAY to improve ANY soil is the addition of DECOMPOSED ORGANIC MATTER. Period. Allow me to elucidate!! I love this question and it is so vital to understand.   I usually add some sand to my soil. I did a few granulometric analysises, which show that my soil has high percentages both of clay and of silt (so very low in sand). On a figure (which now I can't find anymore), I saw that more sand will help to keep more water in soil (there is, IIRC, a sweet point of around 30% of sand; much more sand will make water flow away).  Really I add sand only when planting trees, on sub-soil, and a little sand on seedlings, not to have mould.  So, is it bad to add sand? Why? "
3030,Can I recover my lawn from fertilizer burn?,"I was hoping to improve my lawn.  I used Scott's Weed &amp; Feed with a little GrubX in hopes of killing weeds and  improving the look of my lawn.  (Fig A)   I didn't think I over did it, but obviously I burnt my lawn in these long strips.  (Fig B)   Can I recover from this (this season)?  If so, how? "
3031,"Lawn problem - seasonal grass, thatch, or something else?","I've owned my home for about 3 years now and every winter large patches of my lawn appears to die, but in the summer it comes back to life.... which makes me believe its some sort of seasonal grass. I'm not 100% sure of this though, and if there's an easier solution to killing the grass and replanting seeds that'd be awesome.  I live in eastern Pennsylvania.  Here are some pictures:  Notice how the grass is greener near my neighbors mulch... which then makes me believe that its getting nutrients from it and perhaps needs something else?    When the grass actually grows in its REALLY thick    Based on this, do you think maybe I just need to dethatch, buy something to spray on it, or kill and replant? I put down scotts turf builder plus weed control like 3 days ago... no results so far (it worked in killing weeds in my front yard though) "
3032,Why have the leaves of my Dracaena marginata completely fallen off?,"This might be a duplicate, but as it is not set as answered, I have decided to ask the question again and try to provide some more information.  My Dracaena marginata leaves started to brown, break and then fall off for about three weeks.     I went to a local store, and they gave me some anti-bacterial chemicals. They also suggested that the pot might be too small, so I transplanted it. After one week, no leaves was left:    Is there any chance to save it? Unfortunately, I have been watering it once every three to four weeks. Is this too much?  P.S. I live in Germany, and the window is facing the west. The Dracaena is around one meter (three feet) away from the window.    Update: Following the advices, I have tried to get some cuttings and stick them in some soil. However, after four days, I have noticed some tiny white areason the cuts (see figure). Are these mold?  "
3033,Which Goji Berry species is for food?,"Which species of Goji is edible for food purposes (not just medicinal purposes), or are they both for food? I'd like to get the one wherein the berries are used for food for our garden, but there seems to be little information on the subject available.  Is it Lycium chinense or Lycium barbarum? I heard Lycium chinense was used for food and Lycium barbarum for medicine, but I'm not convinced, since Lycium barbarum is so much more common, and I didn't find other sources to verify that.  I know they're both used for tea, and I'm pretty sure you can eat the leaves of both species (but I'm looking for something I can use for things besides tea, too). "
3034,Shall I remove broken or partly dead leaves of a Kalanchoe?,"I have two Kalanchoes.   The first one of them did not bloom, and some leaves I think are starting to die. Is there anything I can do to help it bloom? Shall I remove the dying leaves?    The second one has broken leaves, but has more flowers. Shall I only remove the broken leaves?   "
3035,Correlation between hotter peppers and further ripening,"I have read that the more red a hot pepper is, the hotter the pepper. Drying also increases the heat. However my momma says that the more red a hot pepper is, the fruiter it is which suggests that since I like very few kinds of hot peppers(only a lot or a few banana peppers and only a few jalapenos) that if I do grow hot peppers, I should let them completely ripen.  But is this correlation between the color of the pepper and the heat of the pepper true that the redder the pepper, the hotter the pepper? Or is my momma right on that the redder peppers are fruitier regardless of whether they are sweet peppers or hot peppers? "
3036,Why are my snack peppers wilting?,"Snack Peppers; I love these things, the kids eat them right in the garden while we work there. The seeds are harder to find than most peppers in local stores, and I refuse to pay $3.50 for a single growing plant at Lowes, etc and I want to grow my own. I forgot to get them last summer but this spring I went around and picked up many seeds from peppers left on plants last winter (from last year - when I did buy from a store 2 plants).  I planted them and out of 12 peat pots, I got 3 plants - great! I also bought seeds from ebay and planted them and nothing came out after 10 days or so. I replanted with a second batch of snack peppers seeds from a different supplier, one was US, one was a foreign country, but none of either batch has germinated so I held hope for the 3 plants from last year's peppers.  Then.... wham - they started wilting, now 2 are done for, one is wilted but the stem looks ok. I read up on them and have no moss, mold, flies, etc., but I suspect overwatering. I have plants in peat pots (discs that expand) so they are sterile, in a tray with water on a heating mat under a full spectrum grown light (led) also with another led Blue/red light.  Tomatoes, basil, squash, lettuce are all doing great but these snack peppers are dying. They sit in the same water as the other plants which are doing fine and I don't let them dry out, I keep them all moist. Do pepper plants have less resistance to overwatering? Everything else is fine. Do they require a dry out then water scenario? I admit, my bell, jalapeno, banana, chili peppers aren't thriving or doing well either.  Some of my seeds are 3 &amp; 4 years old , some are those American no name type from dollar store for 20 cents (some of those work great) but in this post I want to concentrate on snack peppers though I'm sure solutions/causes probably apply to other peppers as well. Those red, yellow and orange walnut sized peppers are so sweet and I don't want to buy store grown plants.    update after reading several replies: Thanks for the feedback. To the fella mentioned what are 'snack' peppers, if you check EBAY for them/seeds, you'll see a bunch of sellers. I am getting a common theme here - I over watered. A bunch of other seedlings didn't do well suddenly as well, my lettuce all dropped and pretty much dies. Tomato's survived, cilantro did one of those long skinny stem thing, don't look good, thought about repotting// deeper in soil. My heat mat is a generic one, nothing fancy, I cant turn up the temp but I have a dome that I took off because I wanted the grow light to be closer to the seedlings, it's a 6"" high clear dome, maybe put it back on to help trap the moisture/heat and reduce  or eliminate standing water in tray.   Does the condensation on the inside of a dome affect the ability for the grow lamp to get light to the seedlings?  My wilting plants were put outside, dried out a little and within a day came back, even the surviving lettuce seedlings, however, the pepper (3) did not. Trying again with other seeds though its getting late to start from seed.  One last comment - to the question of what nutrients am I giving them, I had this organic plant food that ended up really stinking, like worm juice or something, rotting vegetation. I think I'll go back to a miracle grow type unless there is a better suggestion? I am using a miracle grow potting soil which I believe has some nutrients in it. Thanks. "
3037,What should a new lawn look like after one week?,"  My yard was covered with a number of overgrown raised beds. Exactly one week ago, I:   Pulled out the more noxious weeds (grapevine, milkweed, creeping charlie) Chopped down the remaining weeds and raked them away (mostly overgrown grass) Roto-tilled the soil, in two steps: once, a few hours after it had rained, then again the next morning once the top layer dried out. The beds had been filled with topsoil and mulch so I didn't add either of these. Raked away the sticks and clumps of old sod Raked out a gentle grade Put down seed (Scotts sun and shade mix) with a fertilizer coating Watered lightly Used a roller half-filled with water once the soil drained.   Since then, I've been consistent about watering morning and evening just until I see puddles starting to form. We've also had about 2"" of rain over the same time period, so the ground has been damp or wet the whole time. Highs have been in the low 90s F, and it has been very humid.  Having never planted a lawn before, I don't know what I should be looking for. The grass is coming up (yay!), but do I have too much? not enough?  Does the week-old lawn in my picture look about like it should? And if not, is there anything I can do at this point to fix it?   I am in Madison, WI (USDA plant hardiness zone 5a) Highs have been in the 80s F this past week The lawn has morning and evening shade, with direct sun for several hours each day   Most of the new lawn looks like the picture above -- a few dense spots, a few thin spots.

Click for full size    Here are close-ups of the most infected leaf:  Click for full size     What can I do to prevent this from happening to the rest of the plant?  Edit I may have found the culprit.  I found the what looks like a fruit fly right beside a new white patch.  I am not sure if it was snacking or had just finished laying eggs.  I am actually not sure if it was a fruit fly at all.  Here are some pictures:  The first two are the bugs in action.   Here is a close up of a bug I caught while cleaning the leaves with soapy water.   Can anyone confirm this is a fruit fly and that it is the bug responsible for the white mess?

Zelkovas(Zelkova Carpinifolia) are native in the region where I live and there are huge zelkovas. I have planted some of them with 2 meter distance; is it enough or should I increase it?    I live in the southern coast of the Caspian Sea, it's a temperate rainforest and it receives about 1200mm of rainfall/year. "
3040,Spots on climbing rose canes,"Last season my climbing rose had a very strong fungal infection, black-spot or something similar. It affected most of the leafs. This spring I have noticed black rings on most of the canes (see pictures). The canes with the rings have none to almost none new growth. Only one cane looks free of these spots and seems to have new growth.   My questions are:   Does it look to you like these canes are affected by a fungal infection or are those marks cold damage or something else? Should I trim down all those canes with marks?       "

3042,"Avocado seeds/stems, do I place in pot with soil, should I put them in a window?","I do not have a green thumb and have had zero success growing an avocado tree from a seed. That being said, while at work I placed some avocado seeds in water and they started to grow.     The one on the left has been growing a little over 4 months the one on the right has only been growing for a couple months. Both of these plants (if you can call them that), have been growing in my office with zero sunlight. Should I place them in a window sill now that get a bit of sunlight? Also, should I put them in a 4"" clay pot with good drainage and potting soil? I know growing an avocado plant in a pot doesn't work out but I figure now that I have something actually growing I would like to see how far I can take them.  Thank you for your advice, in advance!

3043,Is All this blackberry plant or is there more then 1 plant?,"Just started gardening with my kids. We bought some dieing plants from H.D. for $3 each and figured we would see if we could save them. So far so good, we have some new growth.  One of the plants, however, has a different set of stalks, leaves, and buds(?) Along with the stalks that look like the other plant. It looks like it is growing out of the center of the growth in old stalks that look to of been cut back.  Is this part of the blackberry plant or something we need to eliminate?  1 in picture of where plant in question is growing out of, 2 is next to the stalk that looks like the other blackberry plant.  We are in the U.S. zone 10.  (1) EDIT FOR ADDITIONAL INFO. Thanks for the replies. We have about 12 other plants we are growing from seeds, they just spouted so the kids are excited.   We brought them back to pretty good health compared to when we bought them. We just recently repotted out of the store pot into these knee high pots I had. (Future build of raised beds so don't have a layout to ground plant them yet.    The are in a mixture of potting soil, our local sandy ""dirt"", pine needles compost, and maybe some other leftover bags I had. I didn't notice the green beads before.  I assume that was in the plant potting mix. Yes I did put rocks in bottom, it has drainage.  The soil had dried out to at least a deep as my index finger so we had just watered it before I took pictures. I was going to pull the growth in question but then I noticed it was growing out of a thick stalk right next to the blackberry.  I just wanted to verify before I ripped plants out. Then I found this nice site.   Thank you all for answers, and input.    (2) MY RESULTS  Thanks for the suggestions and answers. I figured it was not a blackberry, but wanted to make sure I didn't  miss something in my googling.  I removed the plant in question. See how it goes. It was in the middle of two B.Berry stalks. Had to separate the potting clump to pull it out of the middle of the two. Hopefully I didn't damage it. We shall see. Fun project for the kids.  Including updated pictures.                "
3044,What causes flowers to fall off of a blueberry bush?,"My blueberry bush's flower bells are falling off, leaving only the center stalk (stamen? pistil? whatever it is, its part of the sex organs)  Is this what happens when a blueberry flower is properly pollinated or is some type of disease/blight affecting the plants?

3045,Fungus on bottom of Dracaena Lemon Surprise,"I'm taking care of a Dracaena Lemon Surprise potted plant that I've had for roughly a year. Overall it seems to be doing really well; its top, newer leaves are vibrant and dark green with no discoloration (the bottom leaves have some discoloration - burnt brown tips and some light colored spots on the leaves).  I keep it in a mason jar as pictured below, mainly to catch the water as it drains. I don't throw out that drainage water, I just let it sit there. I only water it when it becomes fairly dry on top.  I took it out of the mason jar today because it wasn't draining at all after watering like it normally does, and noticed this root growing down and resting in the drainage water. I also noticed some bad looking white fungi growing around the drainage holes. Is this bad? What should I do about this?  Thanks!     "
3046,Neem oil and pollination,"I'm planing to use neem oil as insect repellent on my plants (mostly vegetables) but there is one thing that is puzzling me: If neem oil is efficient insect repellent does it have negative effect on pollinating insects? If so, when is the best time to apply it during flowering period? "
3047,Should I be concerned about the wind and my spinach seedlings?,"I have a small planter box with spinach seedlings. I can see the wind really knocks them around. Sometimes they are lopsided to one side, almost lying on the dirt. When this happens, I firm up the soil around them to stick them up a bit more.  I wanted to attach them to a planter box off the deck railing to save some space (as shown in picture), but it seems like the wind would be even worse up there.  Is there a way to protect them from the wind, or should I not be concerned about this? And is putting them on the deck railing a bad idea?   "

3049,Will chrysanthemums help with my mosquito problems?,"I just purchased a home with a great big bag yard with a connecting courtyard, which is so rare in a city like Houston, TX. I've consulted most mosquito control websites which usually recommend prevention in the form of getting rid of standing water and keeping the grass and weeds under control.  I'm still identifying my plants to see which ones encourage mosquito habitat and such.   Now to the meat of my question.   I have one water feature which is directly across my porch. Its a small fountain with a pump to pull water from the lower basin to the smaller top basin to make the water flow down. The birds love it, so I'm hoping that will contribute to keeping the pests down. I'm also thinking about planting chrysanthemum around the fountain to help with the mosquito issue.  I thought of the idea when I saw an add for mosquito spraying which contained Pyrethrum. Research showed that it came from chrysanthemums. So why not just plant chrysanthemums? The thing is I don't understand how just planting the chrysanthemums will help at all? Its not like mosquitoes eat them.  "
3050,How can I prevent stones from rising to the soil surface each year?,"My allotment has a lot of flint stone (UK, Bucks area). I am preparing the beds for the first time, and have been reducing the amount of stone as much as possible by raking and removing stones as I can. I have been told that there is a virtually limitless amount of stone further down that rises up over winter (I guess when the soil is wet enough, the larger stone rises to the surface?).  How much truth is there in the rumour that they keep resurfacing?   Is there any where to reduce or stop them rising up? If I were to dig down a good way and put a weed membrane would it stop the stones, or is it likely to cause issues with the soil structure/roots etc?  Or do I need to just keep pulling stones out, and expect to repeat the exercise every year? "
3051,How do I shape a Cryptomeria bonsai into the chokkan style?,"How do you prune/pinch/wire a Cryptomeria japonica to shape it into the formal upright ""chokkan"" style, like this or this? Whenever I've tried this with other evergreen species, I've never been able to get the foliage to separate into those distinctive ""clumps"".    Edit: Added picture. It's actually a ""Birodo"" dwarf variety that I bought at a local nursery. It's only about 6"" tall and not much to look at. I have it in a small planter with a couple of other dwarf species (a maple and holly) that will be wintering together. Come spring, I'll relocate it to its own planter and let it get bigger before I start any work on it. "
3052,Is the moisture sensor reading correct in my self-watering vase?,"I have an hydrangea in a «self watering» vase (a Lechuza Cube) and I use a Parrot Flower Power to monitor soil moisture.  The soil moisture level sensor stays constant (17%-18%), watering the vase generates a peak for a very short time, but then the moisture level drops to the usual value (17%-18%)    A similar sensor  works as expected in a «normal» vase.  The Parrot Flower Power application is continuously telling me to add water, as the action has no effect on the measured moisture level.   Are similar values normal in a self watering vase? Is the soil too dry for an hydrangea?  "
3053,What is wrong with my Mango plant?,"I planted a mango seed this spring. And it went good. But growth stagnated after a while and totally stopped. Then I noticed some bulgy excrescence on the top, with a very dark almost black color. I did nothing there, just left it on my balcony. Recently I noticed that its leafs started to get brown. Two already fell to the ground.   I took it into the living room, onto the window bank. I thought maybe it was too could outside. So now there are 3 new shoots. Two at the very bottom of the stem. And one a little bit under the first leafs.   I include two photos to show these. But how do I proceed? I definitely don't want separate stems growing, so should I cut those new ones? And what about the shoot at the top? should I keep it, cut the rest of the plant off?  By the way, you can still see the mango seed looking out of the soil.      "
3054,How to acclimate a store bought plant to a home-outdoors?,"I recently bought chives from a fruit and vegetables store that had them imported from somewhere in Europe. It wasn't exposed to sunlight at the place. I brought it home, cleaned it up, repotted into a bigger pot with healthy soil. 5 days in, almost all the chives are limp and fallen down. Today, I bought rosemary and I was wondering if I should directly put it outside as I did with the chives or if I should keep it indoors for a while. Also, what can I do to my chives to help it; should I cut the ones falling down?   I also later intend to bring them indoors during winter, is there a specific process for that as well? "

3056,"Should I aerate, or aerate and seed, my lawn? Can I do it myself?","I live in North Carolina, USA and I never did aeration before. The size of the lawn is 0.37 acre. Recently I got a letter from a lawn-care company offering the following services about aeration:        Aeration only: [tex]243.66 if paid before 9/15/2014   Aeration &amp; Seeding: [tex]429.66 if paid before 9/15/2014   Organic Soil Enhancement: [tex]186.00 if paid before 9/15/2014         The significantly higher charge for aeration and seed is due to the cost of the seed plus the time spent preparing the seed bed. Problem areas are gone over to the point of ""roto-tilling"". Seed is applied in multiple applications to layer or to mix it into the top layer of soil.   I didn't call the company because I am not a rich man and I want to do it by myself. Perhaps it can save me some lovely US dollars.   Questions?   What tools will I have to buy? I saw there is one which is very cheap and small. Not sure if it is suitable? After aeration, how do I seed the lawn? What are the steps? Do I need to cover the seeds with something? Is it a good time to begin with? The lawn-care company is still in the cycle of the services. It has done 5 services, there are two remaining for this year.  "

3058,How can I tell if white comfrey seeds have been fertilised?,I have white comfrey in the front garden with hundreds of flowers.  I want to grow it in the back garden.  My method has been to transfer many fallen flowers to the back garden and plant them there.   Do the flowers need to be fertilised?  How can I tell if a flower is fertilised? 
3059,What's the best way to transplant Malva sylvestris Zebrina?,"This is a follow-up question concerning Malva sylvestris 'Zebrina'. The plant has grown from seeds to more than 50 cm in height. I did not expect such a large specimen and would like to keep it around but in a different place in the garden.  What is the best way for moving this very plant (or its descendents) given that freezing will start in approx. a month? Should I just dig it up (1) this autumn or (2) next spring and transplant it, or can I (3) somehow obtain seeds from it that could be reused for next season? "
3060,How should I prepare a containerized tomato-plant for overwintering?,"I would like to try to overwinter some tomato plants which I planted in a container and have worked well. I will have a hard winter and thus I need to stock them inside the house.   What do I need to consider before, during and after the winter?  Do I need to cut now or do I need to wait for the spring?  Where do I have to expect the new growth to happen? What about light and temperature? Is it worth the efforts knowing how easy it is to have them prospering from seeds?  "
3061,New lawn renovation,"I've just bought a house and am trying to renovate the garden lawn. The issue is that the soil is a mix of rocks, bricks, plastic, dead grass, weeds and very dry soil. It seems to be just packed full of builders scrap fill.   Id like to lay a new turf but of course it'd be pointless laying it onto this kind of soil. What do I do to prepare it for a turf?  I've considered trying to remove it all and starting from scratch but dont have the time or funds to do so.   At the moment I can only think of digging down, using a rotavator, enough to then fill it with a cheap filler that is better for topsoil and then lay turf onto that?  "
3062,Boiling before germinating Chinese Juniper Seeds,"4 weeks ago I purchased Chinese Juniper Seeds. The intructions which came with the seeds said to keep the seeds in boiling hot water for 48 hours.  Therefore everytime the water cooled I would boil more water and move the seeds into the hot water.  I then planted the seeds in soil, which is where they've remained since.  However the seeds are not germinating.  Should I have boiled the seeds prior to planting? Would this have potentially ruined them? "

3064,May have planted my tree wrong... is it too late to dig it up and replant it?,"I live in climate zone 7a in New Mexico, and I planted a pear tree in my backyard three days ago. Following the directions on the tag, I dug a hole twice the diameter and depth of the root ball and filled it with potting soil, topping it off with purchased topsoil with fertilizer in it and cedar mulch, figuring this was sensible advice because we have really bad soil here that very little grows in without heavy amendment.  Now I'm reading online that you should fill the hole mostly with native soil, to train the roots to grow beyond the hole you dug. Did I do the wrong thing? And if so, is it too late to dig out the potting soil and replace it with native soil? "
3065,Does fish emulsion (or another foliar feed) work as a foliar fertilizer on needle leaved evergreens?,"I know how fish emulsion works as a foliar spray on deciduous shrubs, but will it work on needle leaved evergreens such as mugho pines and junipers? If not, what should be used for comparable result?  "
3066,Can you grow (and keep) a large maple tree in a container?,"I just found (what I think is) a young maple tree growing aside our fence. If I'm right, this is what's called here a 'gewone esdoorn' or 'regular maple tree', which can get 30 meters (100 feet) in height.  Since I was planning to plant several japanese maple trees in our garden, and this wild plant seems just to beautifull to kill, I want to try to keep this tree in a container, and limit the size to 2-3 meters (if it ever gets that far).  However, I've just watched a video which says it's possible to grow a tree in a container, but if the container gets too small for the size of the tree, it will eventually die.  So my question is if that is indeed correct? Because in my understanding, as long as you can give your plant enough water, nutrients etc, it will keep living, but in a small container your plant will always keep small too. Obviously you can't grow a 100 feet tree in 100 liter container...  In other words, is it possible to grow and keep this tree in a (say 100 liter) container and limit it's size, or will it eventually die and is this just time and effort wasted?       "
3067,What's wrong with my mint?,"I bought some sort of a mint in March and it is in a half-shaded spot on my patio. It has been growing really well and still is. However, just today, I noticed that many of its leaves have weird yellowish/brownish spots on it. Is that some sort of fungus? Is it dangerous to consume mint leaves with those spots on them? How do I take care of this problem, whatever it is?   "
3068,"""sterilizing"" a flower bed","We recently moved into a new house that has a flower bed that is completely infested with weeds. It's basically solid weeds. We spent the day hand-weeding and getting rid of most of what we can see.  What else can/should we do to prevent the weeds from returning? Have we done enough?   We plan on planting annual wildflowers, which I guess are sort of weeds themselves. Also, we plan on planting strawberries.  "
3069,Gap between patio and fence,"I will be removing all of the leaves and debris from the gap between the cement patio and the wire fence in my garden and was wondering what I could fill the gap with? I plan on erecting a shad in the patio area and would like to fill the gap with something that is sturdy, any ideas?  [website]"
3070,"What kind of plant is this growing in my friend's shower, and how can I grow one?","I came upon this plant growing in a friend's shower the other day (don't ask me why I had my camera in her shower!):    I thought it added a unique and interesting touch to the shower.  What kind of plant is this?  And what do I need to take into consideration to grow one of my own?  I notice hers is sitting on a sponge; presumably to provide moisture, as well as to prevent it from falling through the wire mesh.  Do I need to feed it anything (on the sponge)?  Will such a plant grow in an air-conditioned home?  (This one was growing in an un-airconditioned home in central Mexico).  She also had a skylight above her shower.  None of my showers have any natural light.  How can I compensate for this? "
3071,What is a soil spreader called in the U.S? Are they available here?,"I just watched a YouTube video on how to top dress your lawn.   [website]The guy who does the video is in Australia. He has a handy tool that he calls a soil leveler. I found a link to one:  [website]But I can't find one for sale here. Do we have these in the U.S.? And if so, what are they called and where can I get one?  Thanks! "
3072,What unclean water can I give to my plants?,"Since water is scarce here, I would like to water my pots with used water. I guess that it is not a good idea to use water with soap, but what about water with food remnants? For example, I washed the trays of my food dehydrator with water only. The water is now full of vegetable remnants and no soap. Is it safe to give this water to my plants? "
3073,Why are my blackberry leaves tasting like sulfur?,"People don't always realise but you can eat a certain amount of blackberry leaves (and use them as herbs to make tea for diarrhea and stuff). The tea usually tastes and smells pretty good (kind of like blackberries do, but much milder).  In the past, I had made tea from lots of our thornless blackberry plants' leaves, and it tasted great. However, the last times I tried it, it smelled and tasted like sulfur and was not pleasant. It was the leaves (not the water). I think the plants may have been transplanted, and this affected the taste.  What could be causing the sulfur smell/taste? What is it about the soil or environment that could be doing it? Is it actually a high sulfur content in the soil or something else? How could this be remedied (without transplanting)? Do you supposed it will go away over time?  The fruit seems to taste fine. There might be a stronger sulfur taste in the fruit than before, but it's not very noticeable, if so. "
3074,How should I care for my Dutch Iris plants?,"With the help of this question I identified that I have Dutch Iris (Iris X hollandica) in my garden.  As described there the plants came out last autumn (we had a quite warm and dry autumn, following a super-dry spring in the same year). Over the winter the long thin leaves which came out survived (coldest day was -15 C) then some weeks ago some of the plants (6 of ~25) produced a stem where now the flower can be admired.   I have a couple of questions regarding the handling of these:  1) Is it normal that they already come out in autumn? Can I cut those ugly/partially dead leaves in early spring/late winter? (see picture below (taken in autumn))  2) What can I do to encourage more flowering?   3) When is the right time to multiply the plants (dig out the bulbs, stocking them, splitting them)? When do I need to put them back into the soil?   "
3075,Shaina Japanese Maple hit by a falling fence-two branches cut off-can I use them to propagate the tree,"We had strong winds here in Toronto and a fence segment fell over my tree. You can see in the picture the damage. The poor tree is like cursed, over the winter we covered the tree in burlap and exactly in the week when we were south for a break we had lots of snow and the tree could not take the load and we found it bent to the ground when we came back. Somehow it survived partially because the root ball had some mobility since I planted the tree last year by the end on May, The tree was OK with that and I hoped the roots will go deep this year and the problem will fix by itself. I guess that was its luck becuae otherwise the fence would have broken the tree completely.   Here is a picture   What can I do with those two cuttings? Can I use them to propagate the tree? "
3076,Are eastern prickly pear cacti pads edible?,"Are eastern prickly pear (Opuntia humifusa) cacti pads as edible as the kind you find in the grocery store (Opuntia ficus-indica)? I know the fruit is edible, if everything across the Internet I've read is correct, but I'm not so sure about the pads.  Anyway, it looks like we can grow them in our zone (I don't believe the regular ones that are largely known to be edible grow in my zone). I would like to grow them for food (not just the fruit, but the pads). I don't want to grow them if they're toxic, though.  I've seen one source that says all members of the opuntia genus have both edible pads and edible fruit. However, it was only one source, and I'm kind of suspicious, because I've heard of one species that might cause issues.  Does anyone here eat eastern prickly pear pads?  Anyway, if you can tell me a productive and definitely edible opuntia that will grow in zone 4 (even if it's not the eastern prickly pear), that would be great, too.  "
3077,What are the basics to collect seed from the vegetable garden?,"Since I was able to purchase NON-GMO seed, I'd like to harvest seed from my vegetable garden this year.  How do you tell when the seed is ready for harvest?  Lettuce, cauliflower, cabbage, celery, beets, squash?   "
3078,Why are seeds of summer chrysanthemum different between suppliers?,"I bought some seed of Chrysanthemum carinatum from two different producers, as seen on photos. How come they are different? The left hand side is 1gr, the right hand one 0.5gr. The price was about the same. Which one is better?         "
3079,Should my plant be shedding leaves when it's flowering?,"   I have this plant at my new place which I assume is a Cissus of some type from googling. I noticed some of the leaves started yellowing and falling off when the flower buds started appearing. Is this normal, or is there something I can/should be doing (trimming the flower buds?)? I'm just worried it might be dying.  I'm located in Western Australia, so it gets plenty of sunshine, and has been receiving winter rain for the past couple of months.  Edit: Sorry about the formatting, I'm trying to post the pictures from my tablet. "
3080,What are these white insects on Areca palm? What should I do about them?,   My first thought was mealybugs. But aren’t these too tiny to be mealybugs. I don’t see any big ones.   I see them quite a lot on different leaves. What should I do about it? Is it best to throw the plant out to prevent it spreading to other plants? 
3081,Mountain laurel or rhododendron?,Is this mountain laurel or rhododendron?  Seems no one is sure. Grows in USDA hardiness zone 7b. Lower shrub limbs laying on ground typically take root and extend growth area. Plants easily make it to 6 ft (2m) height if not pruned. Blooms in April/May each spring in our area. Plants are located in partially shaded area under trees and require little to no care other than pruning from time to time.  Why am I asking now? Thinking about giving some to my son and he has very rocky infertile ground. From what I have read that sounds great for mountain laurel and not so much for rhododendron.    
3082,How does a bow-knife weed cutter compare with a string trimmer?,"In hard-to-mow areas, I use a string trimmer to occasionally cut back the weeds. I recently found a tool for sale which could potentially be used in a similar fashion, but without any gas. It's called a Bow-Knife Weed Cutter. I found it here, but other people sell similar tools. It looks like this:     The spring blade can be released for storage, and sits straight. I realize it may take more energy (which I don't mind) but it is also considerably lighter in weight than a commercial grade string trimmer.    How long (hours) can it be used before needing to be sharpened?  How does it compare to a gas powered string trimmer in regards to the cutting speed?  How well does it handle small woody plants (ie, roses or blackberries) that I may run across?   The customer reviews I've read seemed fairly contented, but there weren't many. "
3083,Can you grow raspberries in a pot/growbag?,"Unfortunately we don't have a proper garden, but we do have an area that we can use for pots and/or grow bags. We've been offered some raspberry canes by a friend - but will they grow ok in pots or growbags, or do they need to be in the ground?  I can't seem to find any information online - what would people suggest? "
3084,What to do when cucumbers are turning yellow and dying but leaves are ok,"I'm learning to garden and have successfully grown bottle gourd and zucchini. I also planted cucumbers but they are turning yellow and I cannot figure out what is wrong. I have looked at a variety of information on the Internet and some of it is conflicting.  For example, in this video yellow is because of rain, while in this video yellow is because of sun. The place where I have planted this gets sunlight directly three hours a day. And then the rest of time it is in shade. The weather here is 90-100°F (32-38°C). There have been showers every evening for about 30 minutes for the past three days but the cucumbers started turning yellow even before that.  There are links which say that there may be problems with magnesium deficiency and also nitrogen. So I have sprayed it with epsom salt and also provided the NPK mixture. It does not make any difference. I'm attaching a photograph of one of the cucumbers that is turning yellow.  The other vegetables like bottle gourd and zucchini are planted in different beds a few feet away and they are growing nicely. Both have the same kind of soil.  So it is pretty perplexing.   "

3086,What are the green shoots coming out from under my tree?,"I just moved into my first house, :) and I have two big bushy trees in the front yard. (I'm unsure of the identification for them. Anyone know?)  At one time it looks like they were lanscaped, but since have started growing sturdy green shoots from the base.  See below pictures.  Am I safe to hack that weed like thing out of there?  It's pretty tough.  Any recommendations how to do this if that is so?  (Ax?)     "
3087,What is the best way to keep deer away?,"I've been contemplating putting up a fence, but I'm not exactly sure how high it should be.  Can anyone point me to some instructions on what specs a good deer fence should have as well as how to build it?    I have also seen motion sensor sprinklers that claim to scare deer away when they get too close.  Has anyone had any luck with these?  If it would work I would rather go this route. "
3088,Avocado from seed - to prune or not to prune?,"I trid to get an avocado tree started from a seed a couple of years ago. The advice from this website was to wait until it was around 6-7 inches tall, then cut it down to about three inches to encourage growth of other branches. I tried it, but I either did it wrong or it was bad advice, because that avocado struggled ever after and eventually died.  I've started over this year with four seeds, and two of them are at about this point (actually, they're around 7-8 inches tall) with some really nice-looking leaves growing out the top. I can post pictures if this will help answer the question, but should I prune them back? If so, what is the best method of doing so and how should I select the height at which to do so? I thought that I would just prune it back to the lowest level of big leaves, but all of the big leaves are clustered at the top.  Edit: I just saw this question; perhaps this is the correct answer? "
3089,How can I replace zoysia grass when it's also in my neighbor's yard?,"The previous owner of my house planted a zoysia lawn, which is awful as I live in a cool climate. It's brown for most of the year. After digging up the entire yard for foundation repairs I tried to reseed with bluegrass but the existing zoysia sprouts have grown in and more has invaded from my neighbor's yard.  Is there a way to get rid of the zoysia and prevent it from coming back in from the yard next to mine? I've read about doing a non-selective herbicide spray a few times in August and then seeding with something new but I'm afraid I'll just end up with it creeping back in.  Is there a way to out-compete it with some other cool weather grass specie? Or another way to crowd it out reliably? "
3090,What should I do with some volunteer potatoes growing in my compost pile?,"I have two or three potato plants growing in my compost pile. I'm pretty sure they are some red potatoes I tossed after they got too old. I bought them from a local organic produce store.    The plants look pretty healthy (to my untrained eye).  What should I do with them, considering I want to grow some potatoes this year.   Kill them.  I'd generally prefer to grow potatoes from known good potato stock intended for such a purpose, but considering they're grown from organic potatoes, is there much risk? Protect them in the compost pile so I can harvest them there later.  This could be a bit of a hassle, considering I continue to add to the compost pile.  I also wonder if growing in the compost pile directly might not be best for the potatoes--would they be happier in regular soil? Transplant them to my main garden area for a real potato harvest later.  I'm not sure how realistic this is... I suspect this would basically amount to harvesting the (likely small/immature?) potatoes, and planting them anew in my garden.  At this point, I may as well buy some actual seed potatoes, right? Something else?  "
3091,Could I have prevented an Emerald Ash Borer infestation?,Our city sent us a letter informing us that the ash tree in our parkway was infested with the Emerald Ash Borer insect.  The city removed the tree a few weeks ago.  Is there anything I could have done to have saved the tree?  Or prevent the infestation? 
3092,"can you use blight spray on all edible and ornamental trees, shrubs and bushes","At first, it was just my pear trees, then it seems everything has it.  It looks like brown spots that turn the leaves yellow.  But there are holes and half eaten leaves also.  Some leaves such as my hibiscus look like the chlorofil has been sucked out of part of the leaf..  Some look like leafrollers but no worms inside.  It is confusing.  What can I do about it?  I have tried Diematious Earth, neem oil and dishwashing soap, and am about to try fire blight spray for pears.  Any sugesstions? "
3093,"What is eating my cabbage, and how can I protect it?","I transplanted some cabbage about a month ago (after starting it from seed in a flat).  Now I see that something is eating the cabbage leaves:    I also see that one pair of seedlings is doing very poorly:    What is eating these leaves?  the lettuce growing next to the cabbage appears unmolested. I have seen a rabbit or two in the neighborhood, but I don't think a rabbit would cause this kind of damage, would it?  And what (organic) options do I have to protect my cabbage?  EDIT: Found this critter on one of the leaves:   "
3094,What is this fungus or weed growing in my flower bed?,I came home today and noticed two patches of this stuff in my flower bed.  I recently put down new mulch and I just started watering my lawn again. I live in Texas.  1) Is this a fungus? 2) Is it harmful? 3) How do I get rid of it?   
3095,"Can Thuja trees live in a ""square foot garden"" style container?","I have a number of young Thuja trees that I would like to grow outside my porch.  However, I live in student housing and we're forbidden from altering the outside area, so I don't like the idea of putting them into the ground - I fear that an overzealous gardener / inspector / whatever might have them removed.  I got myself some wooden boxes that I'd have to isolate in some way (that's a different issue) but my basic question is - are these boxes large enough to house one of the plants, or even two?    Will there come the time when they need an even bigger box? If yes, is there a way to tell before it's too late?    The plants are currently about 3 feet tall (from where the stem enters the soil); the boxes are 1 foot wide, 2 feet long, and 1 foot tall. "
3096,Using electricity to improve plants,"I've read that you can send electric currents through plants and seeds with (low currents using DC power) and that this can increase yields and all-in-all improve the plants (provided you use the right kinds and levels of electricity). It is supposed to be ineffective on certain kinds of plants, however.  Has anyone here actually tried it? What have been the results?  I'm not looking to debunk this as a myth, because there's enough variation with electricity to make a general dismissal undesirable (voltage, frequency, offset, amps, etc.) I'm just looking for results (good or bad) and what they were.  I'm not asking about lightning bolts. Of course those would destroy plants, normally.  I'm talking about low currents (not high ones). "
3097,What is the quickest germinating leguminous cover crop?,"I would like to find a good leguminous cover crop that sprouts quickly, and grows fast, especially the roots. What are the best ones for this purpose (and the pros/cons of those you mention)? Disease/pest resistance is a major plus, but not strictly required. We've got a lot of aphids, whiteflies and stuff at the moment.  Also, I'm curious if some leguminous crops attract more of the good bacteria than others. Feel free to comment on that as an aside.  I'm new to cover crops. I've only tried pinto beans so far (they were the legumes I had on hand). They must have been old, because only a few of them sprouted, though. They took a long time to germinate, and they attracted aphids and white flies like crazy, as well as something that's been eating large portions of them.  I was thinking lentils would sprout a lot faster (they sprout well as sprouts you eat, anyway). Is clover a lot better than lentils, maybe? "
3098,How do I make a wooden container fit for growing stuff in it?,"I have bought a number of used wooden containers that I would like to grow Thuja trees and various vegetables in:    they are about 1 foot wide, 2 feet long, and 1 foot tall.  Being an amateur in these things, I naively assumed I'd just put the soil in there and the chinks between the planks would drain any excess water. However, I've since learned that you need some sort of isolation to keep the wood from rotting.   How do I create such an isolation while making sure that excess water can still find its way out of the container? I thought of just wrapping the inner area with plastic and putting holes in it for draining, but I guess that would damage the wood as well. Is there a ""canonical"" way of doing this? "
3099,What equipment to use for a large garden/lawn?,"I've got a battle raging with about 1.5ha (4 acres) of grass. So far, the grass is winning.  Scattered through the grounds there are a few old buildings, multiple fruit trees and many berry bushes. In days long past this used to be a part of a sprawling farm, but these days it's just me and my family who go there for summer weekends. Mostly every other weekend, really. For one day. Umm... yeah, this isn't looking too good. Our interest is to keep it from overgrowing entirely, but we're not going to be doing any actual gardening soon. The apples and gooseberries are nice though.  So I need to combat the grass which is growing faster than I can mow it down. I have a regular petrol powered lawnmower but that stops being effective in tall grass. We also have a schyte and a rudimentary skill in using it, but that stops being effective for such a large area. Or at least it gets pretty tiring.  So I'm thinking about a grass trimmer, but I'm not sure what to pick.  Electric trimmers seem pretty neat - cheap, simple, lightweight, no mess, low maintenance, nature friendly, etc. But how to get the power?  If it's a corded trimmer, I estimate I need an extension cord of about 100m. That in and of itself is tricky. But even if I could pull that off, how easy would it actually be to maneuver around with all that cord? Has anyone ever done this and can confirm whether this is feasible or not?  If it's a cordless trimmer, the engine power drops dramatically (about 1/3 of that of a corded one) and the estimated mowing time is only about 30-40 minutes. Now, they do say that they can charge in about 1.5 hours, so maybe if I got 4 batteries to exchange.... But still, the tiny engine power makes me weary. How good are cordless electrical trimmers in practice?  I could, of course, opt for a petrol type. My dad has one and he lent it to me once. It was a 2-stroke engine and required the oil mixing dance which was messy as hell. Not to mention the smoke of a thousand chimneys.  I read that 4-stroke engines are cleaner, but they seem to be getting pretty pricey already, and some that I found also used the oil-mixing trick rather than a separate lubricant.  If I choose a petrol-powered trimmer, how to pick one?  I'd also prefer a metal blade rather than the plastic string spool, I think, because I suspect it is easier in everyday use (don't need to extend the cord every 10 minutes), has an overall greater cutting power, and doesn't litter the garden with tiny pieces of plastic. But I'd like to hear other opinions on this.  My budget would be... well, not enough for a lawnmower tractor. Besides, a tractor wouldn't be able to maneuver between the bushes anyway. Up to 200€ would be nice, but I suppose I can stretch it to 400€, if it's for a good cause.  I'm also open for other ideas. (Except for selling the land. It's been in the family for generations; too much sentimental value there) "
3100,What is the best time to water a house plant?,"Is there an ideal time of day to water the average house plant? Does it depend purely on the plant, or are there times of the day (evening for example) when you should avoid watering them? "
3101,My six-week old tomato seedlings don't look great. Please help!,"[website]Hi,  I am growing tomatoes from seed this year for the first time.  My plants are under LED lights and are about 6 weeks old.  The underside of the leaves is purple and some of the leaves are turning yellow.  The leaves are kind of shriveling and just generally not looking great.  Does anyone know what I might be doing wrong?  Am I watering too much or too little?  The temp inside is in the 60s or 70s now.  They're getting about 16 hours of light per day.  I'm going to move them out in a few weeks (live in Central MA) but am worried some might not make it.  Thanks! "
3102,Strawberries only half red,"Why do my strawberries only grow half red, so the top half is nice and red and the bottom half is white?  If I pick my strawberries like this can I leave them a couple of days near a window so the other half goes red?  How do commercial growers deal with this issue?  If I leave them there until fully ripened I am worried the top half will get spoiled before the back end has time to go red.  My second issue with leaving them to ripen is that they get consumed quickly by other creatures (bird/mice/insect) before I can eat them. "
3103,Can I graft elderberries (Sambucus)?,"I have some Sambucus Peruviana, which gives a beautiful white flower that I boil to make a soothing drink for sore throats.  It also gives a nice berry that can be snacked on.  I see online that there are many species of Sambucus worldwide with different flowers and fruit, could I graft other interesting varieties onto my native sambucus?  I live in the Andean Tropics at 1800m above sea level, could I just plant cuttings of other species? "
3104,"How do sweet peas compare with morning glories in terms of growth, coverage, etc.?","I plant morning glories every year in containers to climb up the walls of my terrace, but this year am having a lot of trouble with them.  When buying the seeds, I saw sweet peas as well, and decided to give them a shot, and unlike the morning glories, they're doing great so far - I planted them later than the morning glories (less than 2 weeks ago), and every seed has sprouted and they look very healthy.  I'm wondering if I should be planting more sweet peas, and how they compare with morning glories in a number of areas:   How fast do they grow, compared to morning glories?  The number one priority is height/volume. How does their coverage compare?  Will they ""branch out"" as much as morning glories?  ~6 morning glories in a rectangular 36"" planter fully covered a 6' x 10' section of wall - would the vines from the sweet peas do the same? Do I need to care for them any differently?  I have read that they like colder temperatures.  Is a New York summer too hot for them? When (as in time of day) do they bloom?  One frustration with morning glories is that the flowers are only out in the mornings, and at night when I'm actually there they are gone or shriveled up.  I've never had any luck with moonflowers.  Will the sweet pea flowers be open at night?   Thanks - I have had a hard time finding answers to these by googling, and the photos seem to be focused on the flowers and not the vines. "

3107,Can a single young bulb of cymbidium mini survive?,"I had a beautiful yellow cymbidium mini. Once I forgot it in heavy rain and in time it rotted badly. I dried it out, cut the rotten parts and left one old, slightly decayed bulb with the flower, but the decay spread through all remaining healthy parts. Now there is just one healthy little young bulb left, but with 3 starting (1cm) roots.  Does it have any chance to survive? I keep it in very small cup with airy fine substrate, fertilized very little, I spray it with water little twice a day. Can I do more? It is my most beloved one. "
3108,Does it matter if I use water that previously boiled for watering plants?,"A lot of time I have water that was left in the kettle from the previous boiling, and I want to replace them - so a good use would be to water my plants - does it matter to the plants if the water were pre-boiled?  What I can think of, is that it can matter since boiled water has less dissolved oxygen - but I have no idea if for good or bad (or none at all).  Also, if it does matter in someway - is it general for plants, or for specific families? "

3111,Dormant Spray and Whitewash,"I have a couple young cherry trees in pots that seem to have a shothole fungus problem, which I'm told I can clear up by treating with a dormant spray after all the leaves fall off. I would also like to paint the trunks white to help protect them from sunburn, as I need to move them to a new location that will give them a lot more direct sun.  My question is can I apply both in the same winter season? Should I spray the dormant oil before or after painting them white? If I spray the dormant oil first, will that cause any issues with the paint job adhering? Or, can the dormant spray solution be mixed into the white latex paint mix to apply both at once? "
3112,Tree saplings in my lawn?,Parts of my lawn are full of these. I thought they were weeds when they were smaller and now they are looking like tree saplings. Is that what they are? Maple saplings? How do I get rid of them from the lawn?   
3113,Letting basil loose. Will it die?,"I let my basil grow from seed, and I very seldom trimmed it. My aim is to understand the plant life cycle, so I did it on purpose.  The plants are so arranged: Three vases sitting in a larger, long vase which I keep constantly with 1cm of water with an upside down bottle. Water gets to the plants through the drain holes of the internal vases.  The first vase has two plants. Both are in good health. Large leaves but no flowers. Thick main branches, almost wooden at the base. They seem resistant enough to stand without the glass of the window they normally rest on.  The second vase is really crowded, having 5 major plants plus 5 minor ones. They are also rather close to each other (I did not trim the seedlings). This vase has the greenest leaves (dark green) but not at the base, where they are pale green, almost yellowish. It's also badly wilted, but it's also the one where the flower seems to be extremely well developed.  The third vase contains five robust plants as well. It's the one in the best shape of all the batch. A couple of flowers are emerging, and the leaves are green (not a strong one, but decent) and perfect consistency.  The plant receive sunlight for a part of the day, they are indoors, at the window.  My main questions, arising from the second vase situation, is the following: is letting basil loose without trimming a bad move for the plant health? I am of course aware of bolting (which I am trying to achieve to experiment and hopefully get seeds) but provided you cut the flowers and nothing else, can the plant stay alive without trimming or is there a limit where the plant can't sustain itself anymore and wilts ? It may be just overcrowding, but I want to know first.  Second question is: will this strategy give me seeds ? "
3114,Should I plant a Common Hackberry tree in my front yard for shade?,"My front yard (in Northern New Mexico, zone 7a) is in desperate need of a shade tree. The soil is relatively poor and there's not a lot of water. I'm making a list of trees that I think would work in these conditions and one that's bubbled to the top is the Common Hackberry (Celtis occidentalis). There are a ton of big ones in my neighborhood, so I know they grow well around here. And they provide good shade. I like they they grow fast, too.  I've seen sources conflict about their lifespan; some say 150-200 years, others say 20-30 years. Which is right? Is this a tree that could make sense for my situation?  FWIW, other ""finalists"" in my list of potentials are Velvet Mesquite and Desert Willow. But feel free to suggest others that could work. "
3115,Can I use cedar hog fuel instead of clean fill to bring up my soil line?,"I have a really uneven property, but I'm not a big fan of clean fill. Can I use cedar hog fuel instead of the fill? My plan is put around 12""- 24"" of cedar hog fuel and put on the top about 6""-12"" of topsoil, and just plant grass on it. Is this a good idea? "
3116,Help me determine what to plant here,"I have a small pathway made of natural sandstone pavers and I'm looking for the best ""fillers"" to plant in the spaces between them. I was thinking of using polymeric sand but my wife has suggested using grass to keep it looking softer. We live in zone 5 (Denver area) but the pathway is on the south side of the house and gets very hot and is in bright sun most of the day. What kind of grass would be best here? Any other suggestions or comments?  Thanks!  edits: Our soil is dense clay. Here is a picture I meant to add earlier:   "

3118,How can I fill in a hole where a pond was that is attached to our patio?,"It's a long one but I'm hoping someone can help, please.   We had a  semi raised pond. We've dismantled it and are left with a hole about 4ft deep. We've broken up all the rubble from the sides of the pond to put in and the plan is to pave over it.  I have several questions..  1. Do I need to use a compactor to make it level before I pave it? I don't want to get subsidence, I plan to out the play house over the top.    Do I need to put anything in with the rubble such as sand or small hardcore?  I'm guessing I need to use a soft concrete for the slabs to enable drainage? Why did I start this?!!   Any helpful advice will be greatly received, thanks.  "
3119,Do sterile plants still produce pollen or nectar?,"While reading on certain plants, I often read that some of their hybrid varieties are sterile.  While it seems clear that the plant will not produce offspring I'm not sure if it still produces pollen which is one of the main component of plant reproduction.  Does a sterile plant still produce pollen and nectar? Is it serviceable in any way for pollinators? "
3120,How can I verify the total extraction of dandelion roots?,"I've started unearthing those dandelions (why do I bother? What exactly do they do to my lawn). The root is notoriously long and brittle.  How do I know if I got the whole thing out? It always looks broken to me on the bottom. Even if I dig further, I can't tell if I got it or not. "
3121,My olive tree's leaves have dried out but bottom of trunk is sprouting. What should I do?,"I bought an olive tree a few weeks ago. It had new growth and it looked healthy, although I think it was not held in direct sunlight, and when I bought it, it was standing outside - Northern temperatures (Denmark, Europe - similar to zone 7 in the States).  I primarily bought it because I thought it would be a nice plant for my orangery, so I placed it there, where it would get sunlight and warmth.  After few days, I re-potted it in a larger pot and used mediterranean soil, added some fertilizer as well.  Temperatures continued to increase, where there was a period with 25-27 degrees Celsius (77-80 F) outside, and the plant was inside, in almost direct sunlight (only shaded by the ceiling of the building, which is some sort of translucent plastic and permits light to pass). I watered regularly, though not every day for the fear of overwatering.  About 1 week later, the leaves (especially new growth) were starting to dry out. In 1 week more, most leaves dried out and some turned brown.      Today I noticed it has sprouted from the buds at the bottom of the trunk, so I was relieved it isn't dead.    However, all leaves at the top seem dead and dried. I didn't notice any sprouting in the crown. Is there any way to save the branches? Should I remove the sprouts at the bottom, or is that going to kill the tree completely? "
3122,Gathering worms for vermicomposting,In my area it is very hard to buy a worm that is a good fit for vermicomposting.  There is a vacant lot in my area and I am thinking if gathering worms there might be a good idea?  Questions:   Is it sufficient if I gather worms there? Will the worms that I gathered survive? Is it ideal to gather worms instead of buying?   I'm from the Philippines. 
3123,Hugely different results storing apples from different trees?,"So, I took a look at my apple store over this weekend. It being February, the apples have been in there a number of months.  In previous years I haven't had a massive amount of success storing apples but I've learnt some lessons (secure the store against rodents, don't store windfalls) and I'm getting better results.  This autumn, for the first time, I decided to store apples from different trees in separate trays, instead of mixing them up.  Huge difference in success rates! We have four trees. The trays from three of them (two eaters and a cooker) are pretty clean and the apples have lasted well. The trays from the fourth tree (a cooker) are 100% brown and unusable.  Maybe this was my problem all along in previous years! Mixing them up, I just didn't realise that one variety was rotting out the whole store.  Is it normal for one variety to completely fail to store? Is store-ability widely variable depending on variety? "
3124,How to retrofit seed starting trays to prevent root circling,"I grow plum trees from pits using seed starting trays:      Unfortunately, I have a problem where the roots of the seedlings grow in circles around the bottom of the cavities of the trays. The circling roots cause problems when the trees grow to maturity (they strangle each other out).   Instead of the roots growing in circles, I need to train them downwards towards the hole (where they will be air-pruned).      The problem is normally solved by using seed starting trays that have specialized vertical fins that prevent the root from growing in circles:    Question:  I would like to retrofit my existing trays (I have several dozen) so that they function like the anti-root circling trays. I think this might be achieved by adding some sort of vertical fin in each cavity that would act as a physical barrier/re-router to the roots (but I'm not sure how to do this).  How can I retrofit my existing trays to prevent root circling? "

3126,Why are my aloe leaves turning white and brown?,"I have had this plant of aloe for years, and it has always given me great satisfaction. Easy to take care of, I had separated it into different pots but now decided to keep it all together into a large one - and it has been a great idea.   It withstood changes in the position too: from a south-facing window sill, when I put it all together it was placed outside on the western porch, receiving a lot of light and it sprouted even more. I brought it in for the winter, and placed it in a well-lit area and it was fine.  However, one day I had the terrible idea of putting it outside in the winter for some sunlight (we had an unusually warm winter) and obviously I forgot to taking it back in at night and obviously it turned out to be the coldest night of the year.   The leaves turned white almost immediately, but the damage was very limited. I thought it was just the cold, so I kept it inside, placed it where it gets a lot of light but no direct sunlight and waited to see if it could get some color back.  It turned worse, as you can see in the pictures.    Some even started to brown    I found this article where they say it could be sunburnt. However I don't know how that's possible, it's been in almost direct sunlight in August and it didn't turn out like this. And I know from this question that the damaged brown leaves will have to be cut.   So finally my question(s):  Is it a sunburnt aloe as the article states? Is the damage recoverable? "

3128,Questions about soil block usage,"I got a catalog from Johnny's seeds the other day and saw their soil block makers. I've been looking into them and I'm thinking about trying them to start my garden plants this year as an experiment. I'll make my own soil block maker to test and may buy the nicer ones if I continue using them. I do have a few questions about their use I was hoping you could help me answer.  One question is about the compacted soil. It's my understanding that with plants, especially young seedlings, you want to make the soil light and airy to allow it to spread it's roots easily. However, if you're compacting the soil enough to hold a block shape, does this not prevent easy spreading of the roots.  Another is about potting up. I've seen with ones from Johnny's Seeds, that they make an indentation the correct size to drop a 3/4"" cube into the top of a 2"" cube. Would it be preferable to just start the seed in the bigger cube if you knew it was going to need the extra room before transplant or would you start it in the smaller cube and transfer it up. Maybe you just put it in the bigger cube if you needed more time than you thought.  What signs are you looking for to indicate that it's time to pot up?  How durable are these? I know you water them with a wicking action, but how long do they last? It seems to me that they'd tend to want to come apart. Are they just meant for the short time period (~2months max) that you'd start a garden plant before transplanting it into the ground?  Lastly, for this Q&amp;A, has anyone used these for cuttings with success. It seems like they might be good for that purpose. Thanks for the help.  Here are some links and pictures of the soil block makers for sale at Johnny's Seeds at Sue's request.  [website][website]"
3129,Managing Cover Crops,"I put some fava beans in my vegetable raised bed during the winter months to add nutrients to the soil.  The seeds have sprouted and I have some healthy plants growing.  Question I have is what next?  As I understand it, the roots will provide nitrogen to the soil so I can remove the leaves and leave the roots in place but not sure what is the best time to do that.  Also, what do I do with the leaves? Is there any use for the leaves?   "

3131,Repairing a young apple tree with a snapped branch,"This year I purchased a young ""family"" apple tree, with three varieties of apple grafted onto a single plant. It was planted in March and has flowered happily and is producing fruit. I staked it when it was planted and the main branch is loosely attached to the stake to minimise movement due to wind (which is low anyway due to a narrow garden with fences on both sides and the predominant wind direction being across the narrow dimension of the garden).    I came out this morning to find that one of the branches bearing apples had snapped and was hanging down to the floor. The branch is bearing the most fruit of any on the tree - 9 fruits in total - and is approximately 8mm in diameter.      My questions:   Can I save this branch, and if so how?  What should I do to avoid this in future? Do I need to brace the individual branches, thin the fruit (if so, how do I judge how many to keep) or something else?  "

3135,Discoloration on bottom of limes,"We have some lime trees that generally give a good amount of fruit, most of it coming off the tree in good shape.   About 10℅ of the fruit has discolored areas usually on the bottom of the fruit (""bottom"" here being relative to the orientation it hangs in). It's not just color either - there is a ridge around the area, as if the peel was thinner there.   Are these still safe to eat?  What causes it?!

3142,Growing hot peppers indoors on the West Coast,"Is it practical or possible to grow hot peppers on the West Coast in North America? It seems they require a ton of sunshine, and that's not exactly something we get in abundance. I'm a rookie with gardening, and all I've ever had to manage is some spider plants and cacti.  I'd like to try growing ghost peppers and scotch bonnets, but I'm not quite sure where to begin.

3148,Thin Pachysandra = Volutella Blight? How can I fix these areas?,"I live in zone 6a (Ohio) and just purchased my first house April 2017.  We have had problems with the Pachysandra in the landscaping around the home.  It seems to be thinned out and weak in some of the property.  I believe it's Volutella Blight.  Front Yard:    This area is going to be enclosed a lot closer to the thicker areas of Pachysandra and grass will be planted in the bare areas. You can see the thinness around the Maple tree. Last year I supplemented the front with a few inches of organic compost and fertilizer. We also transplanted a few stray Pachysandra plants from the back to the front. The transplants didn't do great and the area really hasn't improved overall.  Back Yard:    Aside from some tulips going stray, you can see the thin areas again.  Theory:  Here's my theory as to why it's Volutella Blight. I read an article called Pachysandra in Peril about summer droughts in 2015/2016 causing strain on landscaping. I bought this house in 2017 from an elderly woman going to a nursing home, where her husband died 2 years prior.  He was the one who meticulously took care of the yard according to my neighbors. It was apparent that the yard wasn't taken care of for a couple years because it was overgrown and we cleaned out about 70 yard bags of leaves when we moved in.  Yard from Google Maps (July 2013):    You can even see him working in the yard as the Google car goes by. I'm going to make the front yard look more like this photo.  I believe the Pachysandra wasn't watered during the 2 years of drought after he passed (2015/2016) and the maple soaked up all of the water and caused strain on the Pachysandra.  Area away from tree:    Here's a spot that's not around a tree.  You can see that the Pachysandra is thick and looks great! I believe this is because it didn't have to compete with a tree for water.  More Photos:            My plan so far:  I'm having Sweet Peet delivered today, where I plan to add a couple inches for better moisture retention. Additionally, I plan on watering the areas regularly with a soaker. Other than that, I'm not entirely sure what to do.  So do you think this is Volutella Blight? What can I do to restore these areas to their former glory? "

3153,Japanese Maple Care after years of neglect,"Location is Portland, OR area.  My new (to me; built 1972) house came with a 10 ft tall Japanese Maple in the front yard.  I don't know when the tree was planted but it has suffered through the years from neglect and rather heavy-handed butchery (ahem) ""pruning"". The lack of skill is evident even to my inexperienced eye.    The tree is on the North side of the house. During the summer it gets several hours of sun but in the winter only the very top ever sees the sun, and only for an hour or two on sunny days.  I just spent a couple of meditative hours getting familiar with the tree's shape and structure, removing dead wood, and manually picking off a large amount of moss of varying species.  I have two concerns (photos after the text).   Probably over a decade ago, someone hacked off a large main branch close to the trunk, leaving a stump of about 6 inches.  It was hidden by the moss, but now that it's visible it's clearly rotting. Also hidden under moss in several different areas I found patches of white ""stuff"".  It doesn't come off when rubbed with a gloved hand.   Questions   Should I cut off the stump closer to the trunk to remove as much of the rotting wood as possible? If so, is there anything I need to apply to the new wound that will help the tree recover? What is the white on the bark and do I need to treat it?   A couple of overall shots      Two perspectives of the rotting branch stump  You can see some of the white film that was under the moss in these images      Another image of the white film  The white patch on the branch at right was completely covered in the green moss visible on the branch in the middle.  Not all of the green moss had white underneath.   "

3155,Cutting down trees with squirrel nests,"We've got a line of Siberian elms in our backyard that we want to get rid of. They're not the most attractive tree, they're an invasive species, and they aggressively colonize the lawn. They also have a short lifespan and whether they've reached that or the harsh storms we've had here in the last few years were too much for them, about half seem to be dead or dying.  But the squirrels seem to love them — most of the ones we want to cut down have squirrel nests.  Will the squirrels eventually leave the dead trees? Should we encourage them to leave somehow? Or should we just wait for a day they're not there and cut away, knowing they can restart? "

3158,Why does my tomato plant have tightly shrivelled green leaves?,"I have a Tomato Grafted Stargold F1 (Yellow Cherry) growing in my greenhouse.  It has been in there for several weeks and it seems to have grown taller but all the leaves are very tightly curled in.      What could have caused this tomato plant leaves to wither so, and get not discolour?   What could I do to improve the tomato plant's health?     The neighbouring tomato and pepper plant seems healthy.  The plants are in the greenhouse soil which is fresh garden soil and well-rotted horse manure.  I have not started feeing the tomatoes yet, as they do have any flower or fruit started yet.    I had not pruned any of the plants yet.  This morning I pinched out the extra shoots.  I would estimate it like the other tomato plants are twice the height they were.    "
3159,How do I diagnose patches of dead grass?,"I have small, miscellaneous patches of dead grass, even though we have had a very wet spring, and I want to figure out why the grass is dying in random locations.  The dead patches are sometimes in streaks that are mixed in with healthy green lawn, and other times they are circular and about 3-6 inches in diameter. In general, the lawn looks good and is very healthy.  I understand that one possible cause is insects eating the roots. To investigate this do I just dig a square of turf, say 10"" x 10"", then lift it up and see what bugs are there or is there more to it than that? What is the basic diagonostic procedure for my problem? "
3160,What is causing this damage on my apple tree?,"UPDATE On inspecting all the other branches, I found one of the branches in the following state. It shows the bark beginning to fall off the tip, explaining how the other branches have developed.I cut it off, sealed it in a box and put it in the fridge whilst I wait for an identification of the problem. It is still unclear what has started it - i suspect some sort of parasite?   This has happened to one of my apple trees over the past few years, I'm now concerned because it is happening to other branches and there is very little one year growth on the tree.  This is the shape of the tree, and ringed in red are the branches that are affected.  Does anybody have any ideas what might be causing this?    Here's another picture from a different angle, clearly showing the cambium layers and the profile of the edge on them. Nobody else has pruned the tree to our knowledge, could an animal have caused this type of damage?   Here's a shot of the same damage having occured to another branch  "

After coming to the school, I began watering them by soaking them upside-down in plastic containers, just like I used to do back at home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I dried them up by placing them upside-down on paper towels. When I performed this process back in Pittsburgh, they grew quite well (the only difference was that I used rainwater then). I've watered them twice after coming here, but they only turned black on their bottom leaves and didn't look healthy at all.   So I have refrained from watering them for an incredible three months now, and I know you will blame me for doing this, but I was quite sure they would all turn black and die if I kept watering them. Now, all of them have dried up considerably, but they all still have healthy leaves in the middle and their leaves have stopped turning black. I really want to resume watering them, but I don't know how.   I have several varieties of tillandsias, but they all seemed to exhibit the same symptoms.  I would like to know why their bottom leaves turned black and shriveled after watering, and how I can change my practices to better care for them.   I have not been able to find answers online about tillandsias' leaves turning black after watering, so I hope this site will be able to help.   Edit  I read somewhere that spring water is good for Tillandsias. Do you recommend using it? If so, what counts as spring water and where can I obtain it?  Also, does Brita water filter work for removing chlorine as well as softening the water? (If that's the case, I will just buy a Brita jug to fix the water problems.)     "
3162,Taking care of thuja emerald green,"I was planning to prune the emerald green hedges on my driveway. I don’t know what they are exactly but looking on the internet, I think these are Emerald green (thuja). Although on the outside they look green, on the inside it has dead leaves. The green leaves are on the tip of the branches and are about 2-3 inches. What are some of the things I should do to take care of these? Can I prune them now about an inch? Should I clear all the dry leaves?    "
3163,How to water a potless Tillandsia Cyanea?,"I have a Tillandsia Cyanea that I have to do something with. It's by Living Trends and they put it in a small drainless pot with a magnet on the back. It's technically in a small pot within that pot, but it's still not healthy. Recently, while perusing youtube.com, specifically the Brad's Greenhouse channel, I saw that he had unpotted a Tillandsia Cyanea completely and made it into a hanging air plant.   He said that many people want to pot them in dirt, but that it really doesn't need it anymore than any other air plant because it's an epiphyte. I'd like to do something similar. It's obviously working for him, because he did an update video showing where he'd gotten a good bit of growth and two flow spikes off of it. He did say that he's roots had died, but that it wasn't a problem.  The only thing lacking in the video is how to water it. His plants are in a greenhouse, so you have high humidity. I'm also sure he probably mists it. However, I wanted more information, because the leaves on this plant are very grassy. It's not like my other Tillandsia that turns silver when dry and green when wet. That plant obviously absorbs moisture through it's leaves. It's not obvious to me that the Tillandsia Cyanea absorbs water this way. I don't want to dehydrate it.   Can anyone tell me how these absorb water? It's not through the roots, or at least no solely, because he said his roots pretty much died off. His is also growing in multiple directions, so I don't think the water is sitting in the base of the leaves like a regular bromeliad. Can anyone tell me how I'd water and fertilize this plant if I completely removed the pot and simply suspended it from wire? Thanks.  "
3164,Chance for a tree to grow from common seed,"There is a message being shared around on Facebook in Romania that basically asks the readers to keep the seeds and pits from fruit that they ate (fruit bought from supermarkets or local farmers) until they go to the countryside, for example, and find a place with no trees, where they could throw the seeds. The hope is that it would help in fighting the heavy deforestation going on here.  My question is: How likely is it that a tree would actually grow from such a seed? Is this worth doing? "
3165,Capsicum leaves are curling and deforming,"I hope you can help me out. I bought this gorgeous capsicum plant (together with other plants) from local garden shop 10 days ago and planted it into my SFG. We are in Western Australia (Perth).  After couple of days from planting the leaves in the capsicum started to curl, initially I thought that to be from the shock of replanting but today I took the below pictures and it does not look good. It affected only capsicum plants so far and one of them in particular.       The plants are being watered 2 times a day and are in full sun. I fertilised with blood and bone 5 days ago...   It looks like the leaves are curling and deforming. The new levels at the top are wilting and very deformed. Same goes for the new flower buds.  Can someone please help.  Is that calcium deficiency? Or do I water to often, it is hot here at the moment. Or is this a virus and I better pul the plug on them? Help!! "
3166,Do I need to / How can I separate vegetables grown closely together?,"I bought some young vegetables (maybe 5 inches tall), and some of them were grown in tight bunches of four; mainly the okra and beans. They came in small containers with a diameter of about 3 inches. While transplanting them to larger containers, I thought they should probably be separated... but they were so close together, I was sure I would destroy all the roots. Thus I left them in bunches for now.  Should they be separated? How important is that? If so, why would they be grown so darn close together, and how can I separate them without destroying the entire root system?   "
3167,Fungus on my peppers? Are they struggling?,"What are these little green things in the soil of my peppers. Should I be worried? They were planted 7 weeks ago. I've since moved them into larger containers, and put more soil in as I think they were getting cramped in the Styrofoam cups. Are they turning purple because of some sort of nutrient deficiency? Should I put some sort of fertilizer in them? Any recommendations?   Pics:   "
3168,How to overseed new sod on clay?,"I have a new place on a quarter-acre lot. The sod has been out for a few months and still doesn't look like it has taken--even with regular watering.  After reading a bunch of stuff online, I went out and bought grass seed, topsoil, and Milorganite fertilizer. I also have a grass seed spreader.   I picked a roughly 100 sq. ft. section of lawn to experiment on and did the following steps:   Mowed to the lowest setting Raked the grass with one of these kinds of rakes (Note: this pulled up a little sod, but mainly just showed me how much dead grass was just sitting there) Spread seed Used a whole bag (25 lb I think) of Scott's topsoil, and tried to spread it as evenly as I could (this was a surprisingly grueling task--the rake may not have been the best). This seemed to barely give me any coverage though... Drizzled the Milorganite fertilizer on top, and raked over everything again to spread it Watered   Did I do this right? The initial result is pretty uneven looking currently (it's been a couple hours--nothing should be growing yet). There are spots that seem to have much more topsoil or more fertilizer, etc. How does one do this properly (and efficiently)? Do I need a lot more topsoil and fertilizer? "
3169,Amending clay soil on a large scale,"What would be the best way to amend clay soil on half an acre? We want to grow our usual garden plants like tomatoes, cucumbers and such but the soil on the land we just bought is small rocks and clay. Short of bringing in 4' of topsoil, is there anything else I can do? We have a whole year until we will be growing on it if that matters. Property is in Northern KY and hardiness zone is 7a-b. "
3170,How to make curly parsley produce seeds?,"I want to grow and harvest curly parsley, and also have them produce seeds for the next harvest. I found plenty of information on growing curly parsley but nothing on flowering, pollinating, or harvesting seeds. So I have some questions about that:   How should parsley be grown to produce seeds?  What is the timeline from seed to seed? Eg time from planting to germination to flowering to seed harvest? How many seeds can a single seed/plant be expected to produce? Can a single plant be harvested for both garnish and seeds, or is it mutually exclusive?   Edit: I am also considering growing them indoors with hydroponics to produce year-round, maximise yield and perhaps speed up cycles - how could the natural cycle (eg seasons) be simulated? Ie how does parsley determine when to move to the next stage? Type of light? Strength of light? Number of hours of light per day? "
3171,Garden tool handle shapes: the DTs,"  In this image (source: Spade (Wikipedia), creative commons), the spades have a T handle. On most modern spades there is a D handle. There is of course a third alternative of no cross piece at all, just as with long-handled spades. Forks and other tools also use the two designs. So the questions arise: why would the different styles have arisen? Is one style better for a particular purpose and would we benefit from one of each in the garden shed? What about the ergonomics of the two designs? Which is most appropriate for a historic garden in say the 1800s? The other end of the tool (the blade?) is clearly a different issue; my question here is about the handle and its connection to the shaft. "
3172,Is this green headed beetle with brown and black wings a pest?,"Can anyone identify this beetle? It has a green head and thorax, and its wings are tan or brown with a blotchy black stripe between them. Underside is also an iridescent green. It's about an inch long. It's fairly active and was trying to fly through the window glass of the outdoor structure where I work. Initially was seeking the escape/light more than the leftover bit of orange I put in the bottom of the glass over top it right now, but settling down a bit now that it's found some water to drink.    We do a lot of gardening, berry bushes, fruit trees etc. and are in a region with a lot of commercial orchards as well so I like to identify unknown insects like this before I ""encourage"" them.  What is this insect? Are there any pest/invasiveness concerns with it in Eastern Washington state? "
3173,Is using Miracle Grow potting mix good for starting seeds?,"So, over a week ago, I started to grow tomatoes from seeds using topsoil, specifically Scott's premium topsoil. After realizing it's full of crap, bark, sticks, etc., I restarted today using Miracle Grow potting mix. Is this mix efficient at starting seeds, or should I invest in the starting seed mix? It's only been a day, but I hate looking at the plants, thinking that nothing is going to emerge.  And, additionally, do newly planted seeds require light to germinate?    Thanks.  "

3177,What's wrong with my pilea?,"  We're having a tough time with our Pilea. We were afraid that it had spider mites so my friend sprayed it with some kind of organic pesticide. Since then, it's been in shock. No progress on growth at all.  It lost quite a few leaves and it appears to be quite droopy. It had a baby growing for awhile but it shriveled at the stem. The leaves never browned or fell off before, but it was only a matter of time. Now, I'm afraid the same thing is happening to the main stem.  What should I do? Is there any chance of survival if I propagate the main plant? Is that crazy? Please help!   "
3178,Can I put scratch paper on my vermicompost?,"I have lots of scratch paper here and am wondering if I should put it in my vermicompost or just throw it away.   Would it be dangerous for worms?

3180,Drooping leaves on orange tree,"I have had an orange tree (Valencia Orange) for roughly a year now, and it is currently a 30-something inches sapling.  It so far was looking healthy, but in the past couple days, some new leaves it had been making appear to be drooping (is wilting the right term? See picture below)  Is it because it needs more water? (I have it indoors, in my office, and winter in New York can be quite dry. The temperature itself is never too cold, as it's indoors; and for the past week or so I have started misting the leaves 2-3 times a day with a spray filled with plain water.) Or could it be a lack of nutrients, or something else?  Thank you!    "

3183,Can I grow a fall-winter flowering witch hazel bush in Zone 6?,"I live in Massachusetts, Northeast United States, Zone 6.  The lowest temperature in our coldest months can go down to -10°F (-23°C), although it's usually a bit warmer.  While reading an article about local shrubs, I found mention of a witch hazel bush. Apparently it thrives well under the same soil and weather conditions as lilacs, pussy willows, and forsythias, all of which I have. What intrigued me most was that these bloom in the fall and winter, long after everything else has gone by.   Having never heard of one, I searched and found that the witch hazel genus, Hamamelis, includes a number of varieties, four of which are common in North America.    Out of those, Hamamelis virginiana seems to be my best option.  According to the Arbor Day Foundation, and Missouri Botanical Garden, it's native to Eastern United States, and hardy in Zones 3-8. It has yellow blooms from October through December.   I'd really love to have a flowering bush that late in the year. However, before getting one, I just want to make sure that it's likely to grow here, and that it actually does bloom in those months.   Also, what is the proper way to spell that plant? I've seen it as witch hazel, witchhazel, and witch-hazel.     Source of pictures. "

3186,Planting Celosia and Hypoestes in the same pot,"I am growing Celosia and Hypoestes plants in separate pots, indoors, next to brightly lit windows and both plants are thriving. I wanted to repot them into a bigger pot together. Will this be okay? Can both plants survive on the same type of soil/water?   I'm mainly planning on potting them together for aesthetic purposes.   Also as a side note, I have some succulents and mint plants growing in the same location. Can any of these plants also coexist with the celosia/hypoestes? "
3187,Cherry tree pruning problems,"I have a cherry fruit tree that I left alone for 5 years. It's growing ""weird"" now that I need to seriously pay attention and prune.  The first photo shows that the top two branches reaching up to like 10 feet high. They are both similar height and very thin on top.    The second photo shows some problematic spots.    My questions:   Should I prune this branch 1 entirely? It's a bit smaller than the main branch? The bottom 2 has several branches pointing at different angles. What are the rules to prune here? Should I prune the ones that are pointing up sharply and leave the horizontal ones alone? For all long branches like 3, should I cut off the tips / terminals a bit so they are shorter? Right now they are like 3-4 feet long and thin like pencil size.   UPDATE 1  Summary actions based on suggestions below:   Prune smaller competing leader to the collar Prune sucker Prune dead branch    "
3188,Acidifying water for acid-loving seedlings: Calculating the best bang-for-the-buck,"I have water that is at a pH of 8.0. I want to acidify the water to a pH of 4.0 (for the purpose of watering acid-loving seedlings).     I have two products that I can use to acidify the water:   Lemon Juice:    [tex]14.09 per container The volume of the container is 3.8 L It takes 15 ml to acidify 1 L of water to 4.0 pH  Citric Acid:    [tex]25.98 per bag The weight of the bag is 2.27 kg. Note: according to my measurements, the dry granules equal a volume of 2.3 L (I did not add water to form a solution for this measurement). It takes 1.25 ml of dry granules to acidify 1 L of water to 4.0 pH      Which product is more cost effective at acidifying water? "
3189,"Pot size - small & repot, or start large?","I have a few different houseplants. I'm also currently starting a few different vegetables, from seedlings and from seeds. I've been trying to research the best way to grow all of these in containers, but there's a lot of conflicting information.   The consensus is that pots being too big is a problem - root rot, only repot a few cm larger at a time, etc. I've also had this problem with a lot of my houseplants, and needed to size them down. At the same time, every time I look up information on starting vegetables in containers, the pot sizes they recommend seem to be gigantic. For example, I have some jalapeno seedlings - the recommended pot sizes I've seen are at least 8""-10"". Am I supposed to immediately plant in that size? How would a huge pot for the plant work out in this situation, but be advised against otherwise? Are you supposed to only water them shallowly, or something else that mitigates the whole pot being soaked constantly?  I feel like I'm missing something that bridges the gap between all of this advice.   Edit: To clarify, this is not specifically about vegetables/annuals - just an example.  "

3191,Stalk on healthy aloe plant getting too long,I have a healthy aloe plant whose stalk is getting so long that it’s beginning to bend over. What’s the best solution here? To repot in a larger pot so I can plant it lower? Or should I just stake it? Should I cut the stalk down a bit (knowing that it will take some time for the roots to return)?  
3192,Centering Opuntia Cactus,"I originally cut some Opuntia pads I got from a seller into half and planted them in the centre of pots. Unfortunately, they seem to be growing on one side only and I fear they will get too heavy and tilt as time goes.  Please see image. Would it be better to cut at the base of the off-shoot and re-plant in the centre? I will wait till the two new pads on top grow to some extent, of course.  Or would it be better to just leave it as-is?   "
3193,do plants in pots dislike being moved from place to place for better light?,"Question: Does my plant get moved around a lot? Yes, I got it a week ago in fine condition and I've been moving it around and put it in the best locations for light, which changes during each day, so I move it. However, the tips of half of the big leaves are starting to shrivel up. Someone told me that potted plants don't like to get moved around. Is that true? "
3194,How do I stop woodpeckers from killing my beloved apple tree?,"I have a really old Apple tree in the yard that seems to only produce every other year. (Anybody know what's up with that?)  The woodpeckers have done such a number on the trunk's bark, that it looks like a sieve.   Questions:    How do I keep the woodpeckers away? Should I treat the bark with something like tar to fill in the holes?  I'm assuming there are some sort of bugs or something under the bark that the woodpeckers like. Is there some sort of pesticide or something I should spray on the trunk?  "
3195,How to prepare soil for seeding?,I have lots of weed in my backyard and I think I will seed for a green lawn! I was planning on installing sod but I think I will go with the seed.

3196,How to prepare beds for trees if the goal is propagating and eventually transplanting many trees from those beds over time?,"Related to my question How to amend clay soil to propagate trees for bare root distribution? I want to zoom out and ask a broader question, phrased in the title.  I'm in Zone 5/4 and get about 1 meter of precip a year. I want to be able to propagate a large variety of trees and share or sell them with people from homeowners to farmers. If picking specific types of trees, I'd focus this question on smaller trees (max height &lt;40') and shrubs, especially edible varieties like pear, apple, apricot, elderberry, black currant, hazelnut, mulberry, raspberry, etc.  My soil is silty clay in a suburban area. Thankfully its past land use is mostly known and safe (ie. no industrial activities or gas station on site). Deer pressure is high. Sun is plentiful with a few shady spots here and there.  I know there are different types of beds like air pruning beds for seedlings of trees that have deep tap roots, and different beds for trees destined for transplanting as bare root vs. ball &amp; burlap trees. I don't know much more than that differences exist though, so I'm looking for info pointing me in the direction of which kind of bed is useful in which cases and more details about each kind of bed for tree propagation.  To start I have 100-200 square feet to work with, that I envision having a few rows of trees growing in along with some in containers. I already have a bunch of trees in containers and can always get or make more. How should I approach prepping the rows / beds? "
3197,How should I treat Frangipani rust?,"My frangipani experiences rust. How should I best treat/protect my plant from rust (all year round)?  My plant experienced severe rust during December/January (Australian Summer). It was a very wet and a very cool summer for Australia (record rain days).  It is two years old and last year I cut the stems to encourage shape. I don't plant to cut the stems this winter as I am looking forward to my first flowers.  During summer and in particular during the bad January, I used a copper spray with pest oil. It did not seem to help. I also sprayed the ground around the plant.  When leaves are very rusty, I removed them. I also remove fallen leaves and place them in the bin.  My plant is in a well drained full sun position (Sydney climate). The soil has sand mixed through, coal ash (from my Weber BBQ) and is in a raised bed. It cannot flood in its position.  Oddly, (April), the remaining leaves show no more severe rust. You can see some signs on close inspection. So it appears healthy now. We are moving into winter and the plant will drop its leaves soon.  I have seen comments on the interweb stating that rust is a result of the plant missing some essential elements.  Here is a comment i found: From - [website]Rust is a sign that the trees are lacking trace elements. Add a twice annual drink of seaweed  extract tea to the soil. If the infestation is severe also spray them with chamomile tea  (you can make it up using tea bags).    I have also seen this product: [website]"
3198,How to make Grow Light with LED?,I made a LED setup with blue and red LED that is supposed to help me with indoor planting. I used total 4 LEDs (2 Red and 2 Blue) for one pot of Portolaca flowers. But I think it is not simulating the sunlight properly. How many LEDs am I supposed to use? How should I make the connection? 
3199,What's wrong with my tomatoes?,We've had tomatoes inside started for a while now. It's been almost a month since our last problem and now we're seeing this on some of the tomatoes:    I know tomatoes look scraggly often but this seems really concerning. We've been using a fan on them recently.  Is this leaf roll? Do we just need to water them less? Is it possible our pots haven't been draining enough (we drilled holes in bottom of the yogurt container they are in)? 
3200,Why do my cherries die in winter? =(,"I've planted multiple cherry trees of different species, during different years. All of them don't make it through winter. Why? They should survive my zone (6A).  They seemingly do well throughout the hot summer, and during fall, but never break dormancy in spring.  My other trees don't have this issue (apples, mostly, but some plums and nuts, and pears).  What might be the reason? I plant them in decent soil, water them with automatic timers, and they seem to thrive the first year I plant them.  They have no missing bark (i.e. from deer or sun scald). No bug issues, that I've noticed.  On two of the """"dead"""" ones, they have sprouts now coming up from the rootstock (just now in spring), but they weren't there in fall, so I don't think that's the issue.  That's six or more dead cherries (across multiple years). I want some cherries!  Are they dying from the cold, or is there a different reason? Is it from the summer heat?  I live in Midwestern USA, zone 6A. My trees come from StarkBros and are shipped bareroot. "
3201,"Found some grubs in my sunflower pot, fight them or let them stay?","Simple one. I removed my sunflowers from the pot today as they were showing a rust leaf problem and not doing great. They did flower and got pretty tall but then just went sick and I tried the nutrition etc. I am in the Sydney region Australia.  So when removing them from the pot I found some of the grubs in the pictures below, sorry a little out of focus but they are about 0.75cm long and getting a shot on a cell phone with macro mode is like finding a honest politician.        There were several of them in the pot. Now I know not all insects and other critters are nasty to my plants but should I ready the flame throwers or just ignore them?  From my research this afternoon they appear to be curl grubs according to this page  Since I am concerned that they have spread to other pots(Veggies, herbs etc) what type of pesticide could I use to rid myself of them while keeping the safe for consumption?

3202,Cucumber plants wilting and dying outside during a rainy summer,"I have several cucumber plants planted outside (I'm in Zone 4). They are planted in large containers or raised garden beds.   hey were doing okay until about a week ago when we started having rain every day. The plants are wilting and dying and I don't know what to do. They are obviously well-watered because of the rain, at night the temperature is around 10C.  Is this something that can be caused by rain? We also had some small hail but it didn't damage the leaves, although I am curious if it chilled the plants too much. The soil is wet, but not soggy/swampy.  Is there anything I can do to help the ones that are struggling but still alive? My watermelon plant is dying too now (leaves curling and wilting) and I'm getting a bit more desperate as I see more and more plants being affected. "
3203,Uses of the scythe in a modern garden,"Recently on a Basque TV channel from Northern Spain I saw a competition between two women scything a meadow against the clock. They were going almost as fast as a modern ride on mower, but were clearly exhausted by the end of the allotted patch.  Is use of the scythe a part of your local tradition in gardening? Do you keep a scythe in your garden shed? What use would it have in a modern garden context? Would you know how to use it? Is it one of those skills that we should make an effort to preserve? "
3204,Potato plants have tiny leaves and grow really tall,"Potato plants are less than 4 weeks old and they are growing as if on steroids. The leaves are really small and look rather miserable. I read potatoes don't get taller than 60cm, mine are already 95cm and beyond. Now they are starting to fall over, one by one. I don't know what to do.  The plant completely fell over, it's the 5th plant already:    This one is about to fall over:    At current growth speed this one will reach 100cm by tomorrow morning. I had to stabilise it with a piece of wood because all of the stems were bent to the floor:    I thought this was supposed to be easy? Do my plants need an exorcist?  Earth specs:   Ph 7.2 200mg/l Nitrogen 170mg/l Phosphate 950mg/l Potassium   I water them thoroughly as soon as the top 5cm dried up which is around once ever 4-5 days. "

(it is the main root and its ramifications)  What should I do with it? My target is to regrade the yard, and this root will stick out so I will need to remove it. The soil composition seems to me closer to clay than to sand, if this detail is of any help. The real question is: Should I just chop it to small pieces and leave it there (mix it with the soil) or should I remove it as much as possible? "
3207,Raising the height of soil around established rose bushes,"We have a strip of (sloping) dirt next to our driveway, sloping from the fence down towards the driveway. We have 4 rose bushes planted this year about the middle point of the strip - lower then the dirt at the fence, somewhat higher then the dirt at the driveway. I hope that all makes sense.  We are tired of dirt continually washing onto the driveway so we are going to build a small retaining wall -- approx. 10 inches above the driveway. My concern is our new roses. Once the retaining wall is in place, we would be filling it such that it is even with soil the entire length - like a raised bed.   Can we raise the soil around the roses with out doing them harm? If so, is there a theoretical maximum height?  If it matters, these are the roses.    as an aside, that strip of dirt used to be the home of 4 large sweet gum trees. 2 of the bushes straddles one remaining trunk and there is a lot of  tree roots left there. Also, we have new concrete.  :( "
3208,why is this laurel hedge still dying,"This laurel was dying, leaves going brown. Soil a bit dry, watered it loads, a week and a half later still dying. Googled it, some results said probably drought and some said waterlogged roots!   So I would continue to water it lots as that's what it looks like it needs, but am I at risk of ""drowning"" it???

3209,Can the castor oil plant (Ricinus communis) build up toxicity in my soils?,"I am doing some experimentation with Ricinus communis, which I know contains the toxin Ricin. Through my own experience and research I am not concerned with interacting with the plant or touching it. Do I need to worry about a build-up of toxicity in my soil?  I have tried to research the topic, but my knowledge of chemistry isn't enough to be able to understand the information I am getting back. This chemical formulation should just decompose back into available non-toxic organic matter, right? "
3210,Should I be concerned about twisted galls on my lombardy poplar trees?,"We have lots of large twisted galls on our lombardy poplar trees' leaf stems. I've heard that twisted galls on poplar trees are not a threat to the tree. So, I'm not worried about them killing the trees or anything.  Do the galls in the fallen leaves contain insects or their eggs that will promote more galls in future generations? Will picking up the leaves help to reduce the problem the next year?  I looked inside a gall, and found that it appeared to be full of some powdery fungus or something. Is that normal? Was it really fungus? Could the insects causing the galls be attracting other pests or diseases to my yard? I hear the things that cause twisted galls are related to aphids, and we have a big aphid problem. It could be a coincidence, but I thought I'd ask, just in case.  Last year, our poplar trees were covered in what looked like house flies (and this was rather disturbing), but after some research, I think they were a certain kind of fly that eats whatever causes the galls. There aren't as many flies this year, but there are even more galls (and there were a lot last year). I've heard that they are supposed to be less frequent after a severe year. This does not seem to have been the case, so far. I'm kind of concerned that the contents of the galls could be bad for the yard, or my health. I've heard about tree fungi causing issues in the past.

3212,"One part of Blueberry bush blooming, rest of plant appears dormant or dead","I recently purchased what is now my first dwarf blueberry plant.  On this plant, at the end of a large, thick vertical cane, are a few green branches that have some small seeds and the 'early green tip' stage of leaf development.  On one of these green branches, a seed swelled, turned into a flower, expanded out into a corolla tube and opened up, in about the course of a week.  The rest of the bush appears dead or dormant.  There are many such buds that aren't doing anything, and a few that have been at the swelled stage since I received the plant, but are quite dark, and haven't changed since I received the plant.  Some of the parts of these dormant/dead canes' leaves or buds have what appears to be small parts of blue leaves on them, which I don't understand. On some parts of the plant, such as the very thick vertical branch that the other green branches are stemming from, have some kind of winter-looking blue/grey 'bark' on them, looking neither green nor brown. Is this normal?   How can I tell whether the other parts of the plant are just dormant or whether they've died off?   I'm keeping the plant indoors, under a 300w LED light, with a large aqua-globe-like system that keeps the soil saturated with enough water as it dries out.enter image description here     "
3213,Is this a good organic soil/fertilizer setup for container carrots?,"I am growing 36 carrots in a 18"" square container that is 14"" deep. I know I have enough room for them but am more worried about whether there will be enough nutrition in the soil to carry them through until harvest.  Is there a certain soil blend or configuration (amendments) that would allow me to set it and forget it?  Some sources say to do a light liquid fertilization every 2 weeks or so about halfway through the grow cycle (35-40 days) of FoxFarm Big Bloom. Is there a more apt liquid fertilizer for carrots?  Update:  I've since moved to a ~20 carrot per container setup and thus far a single grow does not need any added fertilizer but if I keep growing carrots in the same containers, after how many harvests would I need to start fertilizing. Do I need to let the soil settle on it's own at some point? "

3215,Where can I find a large shrub to replace one that died in a hedge? (See details),"With the drought last year I lost two fairly large (~ 5 foot tall) Photonia/Redtip shrubs that were part of a hedge. I've been to several nurseries, but the biggest one I've seen for sale anywhere is about 2' tall. It seems like it will take years for something that size to catch up to its siblings in the hedge row and look bad.   I assume there is some resource that landscapers have to find shrubs to address this problem, but I'd like to try this as a DIY project if possible. Can anyone provide guidance for what I should be looking for in the phonebook/google to find larger shrubs/plants?  Also, judging by the root system on the dead ones I pulled up, there might be some challenge planting a shrub that big. Any advice/tips to ensure survival of a large shrub when planting to protect my investment? I'm sure they won't be cheap, if I can even find them. "

3217,How long can a bell pepper plant thrive while maintained indoors?,"I haven't found anything stating that the plant dies off after producing fruit and it is my understanding that if I keep the environmental conditions correct, continue manual pollination, and add fertilizer to the soil every few weeks/month that the pepper plant should continue to produce fruit on an ongoing basis.  Has anyone done this in practice? If it is possible, is it in fact good/okay? It most likely isn't a natural phenomenon but I wouldn't expect degradation of the fruit provided the plant still had good soil health.  Would it die off if I stopped pollinating it?  Is there a difference in this regard across the various types of pepper plants?  Edit: I may not have made this clear enough but the pepper plant I'm growing is indoors 24/7/365 in a regulated environment. ie overwintering doesn't apply at least in my situation. "

3223,How to revive a bonsai that was repotted after it was dying of overwatering?,"I have a 15 year old Chinese Elm which I bought last year in April and keep indoors. It is placed next to a window, but due to british weather it doesn’t get very strong light.  The bonsai survived very well for a few months until the end of the summer, when it then started losing its leaves out of season. That time, the problem was spider mites, and the bonsai only recovered from them after a few months. It only started growing new leaves at the top of the tree, and very few of them.   A few months later, those leaves fell off with no signs of drying up or yellowing, and soon later even the branches were dying, and I realised the problem now was overwatering. I didn’t know that the soil the bonsai came with retained so much water, and since it is my first bonsai, I didn’t know how to check the soil properly before watering, so I just arbitrarily watered it once a week (but always drained it as much as I could).  Now I got the tree repotted with new soil which drains the water much better, and I am very careful to only water it when the soil is slightly moist. I am not feeding it with bonsai feed since the tree is struggling. It’s been over 6 weeks since the repotting, and the bonsai is still not growing new leaves. The branches that were dying that I had pruned to the point where they were still green underneath, are now still continuing to slowly die closer and closer to the trunk.   Am I still doing something wrong? Is there anything else I can do to try and revive my bonsai properly? Do I actually still have to wait even longer for the new leaves to grow? The tree was even getting more sun than usual in the past week, but it didn’t seem to make a difference.  NOTE: the tree is actually still alive since if I scratch the bark it is bright green underneath, however it is simply not growing new shoots or new leaves.  This is the state of the bonsai before being repotted and pruned, when it had only very few leaves at the top which did not change colour before they fell out.

3226,What are some good combinations of plants & practices for raised beds to maximize efficiency/output?,"As an example of what I am asking I provided one answer:     Lettuce/spinach grow well in the empty spaces around the base of   pepper plants. Pepper plants don't grow too tall and aren't   particularly dense so light does pass though. In addition, the pepper   roots like to go deep while lettuce/spinach typically do not (until   they start to flower anyways). The height of the pepper plant also serves to shield the   lettuce from heat, which is often desirable (to avoid early flowering).   Are there other combinations that make the most use of available soil and act as good 'partners'?  Are there other dynamics at play that might be useful in making the most of a raised bed? "
3227,Is there any kind of plant or vine that can grow so thick as to replace the need for sheetrock?,I've been looking at the sheet rock and I've decided it's kind of boring. I want to rip it out exposing the rafters behind it. I was thinking it'd be kind of cool to layer the framing and the sheet rock behind it with a strong white epoxy (for protection) and to see if I could get pothos to fill up the void. I could build a bamboo lattice where the sheetrock used to be for the pothos.  I find it hard to believe indoor vines covering a wall is that unique. Have you ever heard of this being done? Are there any concerns to growing vines indoors on a larger-than-pot scale? 
3228,Do any plants add nutrients back into the soil as they grow?,"It seems reasonable that there ought to be at least a few symbiotic plant varieties that benefit from improving soil condition for other plants.  If not that, are there plants that essentially improve soil conditions if not by improving land fertility?  Improve may be relative as certain plants do have different requirements so I am imagining a sort of 'balancing' plant.  Maybe the answer is something like 'most non-fruiting plants' but I'd think most of those still are about getting what they need and not improving it for others.  For the sake of argument, say you have a near-barren lawn that only has little bits of scattered grasses. Aside from manually adding the fertile soil, can plant-life improve it? "

3232,"Spider plant leaves becoming discolored, thin and droopy","I purchased a Chlorophytum Comosum in October 2016. It's 3 or 4 separate plants. I moved it from its 10cm diameter plastic pot into one that's roughly 15 cm and about 20 cm deep, without drainage. When moving it, I just took all of the soil and the plant from the original pot and placed it into a hole that I dug in the new one.   I usually water this plant once every 10 days. The dirt is usually dry on the surface but still damp underneath. At the bottom of the pot I used 3 small plastic pots to act as a platform for the plant and let water fall through to the bottom, so that it wouldn't gather around the roots.   The healthiest of the plants has started putting out spiderettes that are growing fairly large, and it has increased in size since I purchased it.   All of the plants are growing fast, and recently some of the leaves have grown thin and droopy, and I just noticed that they're very discolored, and pale. A few of the leaves have become unable to support themselves and are bending.   The same issue is affecting a small spiderette that I just repotted from a completely different plant, and I have been watering a few times a week to keep the soil damp.   What's wrong with this plant? How can I help the plant recover its original robustness and grow thicker, non-pale leaves?  This is how the plant looks today. It was watered about 5 days ago. It looks very droopy and out of shape:    Detail on the discoloration I mentioned:    This is what the plant looked like about a month ago. The plant had grown noticeably during this time.      Here's another picture showing what the plant looks like when it's in best shape:    Here is a picture of the other spiderette taken from a separate plant, right after it was potted:    This is how it looked today (visibly more pale than before):   "

3234,Saving a blueberry bush that lost all leaves,"Earlier this year I bought a small blueberry bush at a local garden store. Since it was written on the attached note that it can grow in a pot on the balcony without a problem, I bought bigger pot, some recommended soil (I used 'rhododendron soil' with a pH value of 4.6) for it and planted it there.  At the time that I bought it in late spring/early summer, it had a surprising amount of branches and berries on it, considering it's size.    Things went well for two months or so, I kept it in a half-sunny spot on my balcony (I live in southern Germany) and watered it carefully with tap water, since I was worried about drowning it. Every two weeks or so I fertilized it with a bit of the general purpose fertilizer I use for all my balcony plants (7% nitrate,3% phosphate,6% potassium oxide, smaller concentrations of other stuff).  At some point after these two months I noticed that its leaves had started to get brown, dry spots. I assumed the heatwave at the time to be the cause, so I moved it to a more shady place and watched it's moisture level more carefully. Nonetheless, more and more leaves turned brown and eventually were thrown off.   Since I assumed that lack of water could not be the cause, I was worried about having overwatered it after all, so I took it out of the pot and had a look at the soil and it's roots. While the soil was moist, it didn't seem an alarming extend to me and the roots were alive and firm, large enough in number and with still some space left in the pot for them to expand.   A friend of mine that I often talk about gardening stuff with suggested that the bush simply had too many berries to maintain them all, leading to this situation. Over the course of the last week all the berries and leaves dried up, I removed them since these seemed a hopeless cause to me.  The stem of the bush still looks green and lively, and cutting one of the outlying branches showed that despite a dry outside, the inside is still firmly green and juicy.  Is there hope for this bush to survive and eventually grow new leaves? What can I do to help it?    Additional information: Water pH-value: 7.73 Water hardness: 15.6 dH, 2.79 mmol/l     "
3235,Pumpkins survive and continue to produce but fruit went rotten after some development,"I seeded some ""atlantic giant"" pumpkins in april, in a big lawn at full sun for all day long.  They started to grow and to flower, and after some time they started to produce some pumpkins. They grew until they became as big as a football. Then the plants started to produce some more fruits. While the first fruits were continuing to grow, the second set become as big as football. Then their skin became wrinkled and they just ""collapsed"" due to rot.  I've been removing fruits as soon as they start to rot, and the plants remain alive. Their first fruits became bigger and continued to produce some more pumpkins after some time.  What could have been the cause of those fruits rotting? Is it possible to avoid it next time?  Notes: I've been supplying water every morning and every evening to the plants (about 2 liters per plant each time) until the first rotten fruits appeared, then I stopped. I didn't noticed any particular desease on the leaves. "
3236,Can I use water from the clothes dryer to water plants?,"My clothes dryer produces a few liters of water a week and rather than throwing it down the drain, I thought it might be put to better use by watering the plants with it.   I think it should almost equate to distilled water, however there might be some residues in it, such as soap or maybe mold.   Is water from a clothes dryer known to be safe for plants? Should I take any precautions with it, such as cleaning out the tank first to ensure there are no risks?  When it comes to storing the extra water that I won't be using directly, are there steps necessary to avoid contamination due to the water standing for long periods of time? "
3237,Compost bins: how deep is too deep?,"We have two compost bins, roughly 1m x 1m x 1m each. We fill the ""primary"" bin and then turn it into the ""secondary"" bin. We stopped catching our lawn clippings about a year ago so we're having to turn the bins less frequently with the reduced volume.  Last week, I topped off the primary bin with a load of weeds and then, yesterday, I turned it into the secondary bin. By the time I got to the bottom, I discovered the compost was ready to use but I wasn't surprised because of the longer timeframe. However, it meant I was dumping about half a cubic metre of ready compost on top of totally fresh material.  I'm wondering if having such a heap on top is going to inhibit the composting of the fresh material? We had bountiful tiger worms in the upper portion of the primary bin but these are now buried. We also had loads of other insects, including slaters, operating in that upper later which is now buried.  Should I remove some of that top layer? Or is it fine to leave it for now? "
3238,Quick experiment to replace pavers with grass lawn,"I am a total newbie here when it comes to gardening and lawn. I have a backyard made of paver tile which has gone bad over years, in the sense, too much weed is growing between tiles.  To fix this, last year, at one part of the back yard, I removed all tiles, put landscaping fabric underneath and put the tiles back, finally sealed the gaps with good polymeric sand. That part is still looking good this year, no weeds.   For the rest of the bad area of backyard (almost 700 square feet), I was planning to replace with grass lawn. As an experiment, I took out tiles from a 17 feet X 2.5 feet rectangular area, and looked under, what appeared was mostly gravel, mixed with crushed stone and dirt. I put no effort to take out the gravel or put any additional material (top soil, etc). I just used a manual hand shovel and hand tiller to dig up 3-4 inches of the compacted bed material repeatedly to loosen up the bed and then raked it. Then I put some fertilizer and spread seeds 2 days ago. Has been watering it since then 3 times a day (morning, afternoon, evening). No signs of germination yet. Do you guys think this will actually work? The concerns I have regarding why it may not work  1. Not enough depth (I put a screw driver in and without considerable effort I can go 5-6 inches deep), so is that enough or I should have loosened up more of compacted bed underneath 2. When I was digging up, beneath the gravel and dust layers, I stumbled upon a layer which felt like clay, reddish in color and sticky in nature, not sure what is that and is it a friend or foe 3. Not enough nutrients, I did put fertilizer but not sure if that will help 4. Birds are eating seeds...is that a big problem?  Please help me out folks! I am so looking forward to my cute experimental lawn :) Any help or advice appreciated.   I am attaching a couple of  picture of how it looks like     Thanks Souvik.  "

3240,Opuntia is slouching after repotting,"About 24 hours ago I repotted my Opuntia (Specie ID is Subulata but pictures look a bit different than my plant). The plant is now slouching in a way akin to how it slouches when I neglect watering it for a period of 1-2 months, but it has been roughly 20 days since the last time I watered it.   The repotting process went as follows: I extracted the plant from the pot and emptied it of the original soil. Using my fingers and a brush, I delicately broke the very solid blob of soil under the plant, which I suspected made it hard for it to get water, exposing as much of the root system as I could.   I mixed 2 parts cactus soil and one part perlite for the new potting mix. I filled the pot, made a hole in the new soil and inserted the succulent in it.   Two other succulents (all cacti) are potted in the same pot. After repotting, I moved the plants back to their spot near a south facing window. Today was a fairly sunny day.   Roughly 24 hours after being repotted, I found the plant slouching. I generally interpret this as lack of water, and it does recover after receiving some, but I'm worried this might be a consequence of the repotting itself.   I'm also not sure if I should water these plants now, as potentially damaged roots could rot if watered too soon.   What could be the cause of the slouching?  Pictures of the plant as seen today:        Here's how the plant looks normally (this photo is roughly 2 months old):     Bonus question: why does my opuntia look so much different than other Subulata specimens? Is it the wrong ID or is my plant suffering from stunted growth? (It hasn't grown at all for the last few months) "
3241,Why is my cactus so thin?,"About one year ago, I purchased three cacti in the same pot. They looked like this when I got them:      One of them got bigger over the months, but the tallest one kept thinning. As you can see from the following pictures, it doesn't look very healthy:        Besides, it became brown at the base:    I think there may be an issue with the roots of the tallest cactus. It's as if it wasn't able to feed anymore. It seems that the root system of the small healthy cactus takes all the water and nutrients for itself. What's going on here in your opinion, and what should I do? Maybe I should repot. I kept the original substrate, but it may not be very appropriate for cacti, as it is often the case when you buy cacti in shops.  And by the way, what species is it?  EDIT: I think it is a Pilosocereus Pachycladus.    Some new pictures             "

3248,"How to avoid ""importing"" insects when bringing plants into house at end of summer?","I had many of my plants out on my porch last summer (potted avocado trees, potted miniature roses, some herbs). Unfortunately, when I brought them into the house in the Fall, I also brought in some very small flying insects which lasted months indoors. Not swarms or anything –  but enough so that I want to try to avoid doing that again.  It there a way to prevent this occurring? I didn't vigorously shake the plants though they must have been shaken a bit while being moved. Is there anything more I can do? "
3249,What disease is affecting my Dypsis lutescens?,"I received this Dypsis lutescens (palm) plant as a gift last spring, it had only two leaves and it was potted in nursery soil with sand. Recently I have noticed that the outer leaf started to form a black ring at its insertion on the stem. After new leaves have emerged I removed the outer leaf, but I have noticed that the next one had a small black dot at the insertion point, too.  At the end of the summer the plant became rootbound, so I moved it to a larger pot using general soil from the store to which I added vermiculite. The black dot became a black ring. I have removed this leaf while its lower part remained attached to the stem, becoming the brown-black ringed stump that you see in the pictures.  Now I notice that one of the leaves has a long black area on its stem (as seen on the red rectangle in the pictures). It is clear that my plant has an infectious disease, but I don't know which one.  My questions are:   What is the name of the disease? Should I apply a fungicide like Topsin or Ridomil just in case I don't find out what disease is causing this?        "
3250,This asian squash leaves got black edges,This is a type of Asian squash (very common in Vietnam):    I am trying to grow in Pacific Northwest in the summer but I got unlucky      People have done this before so this plant definitely can survive here.  Why the leaves look so bad? It seems some kind of disease?  It happens few days after I poured some coffee ground around the area to prevent the slugs moving. But I doubt that is the cause?? 
3251,Proper care after repotting spider plant,"I just repotted my spider plant (chlorophytum comosum ocean) away from a deep pot without drainage holes.   Back when I planted it in this pot, I made a structure out of plastic pots placed at the bottom of the container, which would provide support and empty space for drainage.   The plant sat in this pot for 3 months and ended up growing many thin, long roots all the way to the bottom of the pot, where water was pooling.   While taking out the plant, I unavoidably tore all of those roots off. The big tuberous roots were still intact however.   My questions are:   Will the tearing of these deep roots affect the plant negatively? Is there a risk of root infection or rot if the plant is repotted right after some of the roots are torn? Is it safe to water the plant after repotting it in this case? Will it promote the creation of new roots?   In general, what's the best way to care for a spider plant in this situation?  Pictures:  The plant in its new pot:    The biggest torn root I found:   The plant in its old pot:  "
3252,Can I kill dandelions and bull thistle with darkness?,"Dandelions and bull thistle own my backyard. It's their turf now. (I'm a game developer, not a gardener.) I've tried a couple of things to kill them. I think I've decided to go with some uprooting tool.  Anyway, there are some particularly large plants (one of each at least), like a dandelion with maybe six or seven stems that are flowering. Would it be possible to kill them by depriving them of sunlight?  Some people recommend (as a last, extreme measure) blanketing your whole backyard with some sort of plastic or something that won't let light through, to kill everything. I'm just looking to take out the worst of the bunch, maybe with something heavy and light-proof like an upside-down pot.  Will this work? Do I need to cover all the leaves of the plant for it to work? How long will I have to wait, or how will I know that it worked or didn't work? "
3253,What should I do with buried garbage/construction debris I found in my new yard?,"I recently bought a new row home with what I thought was an adorable back yard. I started digging a shallow hole to plant a tree and noticed that about a half inch to about a foot down is where the previous owner buried some garbage (literal trash bags with styrofoam containers, soda cans, hair ties, etc.) and construction debris (so far it just looks like bricks, tile, glass, and plastic mini blinds).   The yard itself is 10' x 10' - I've started digging it all up myself, but I'm really not sure what my plan is. I found a brick patio on the bottom, so it seems as if they literally through the dirt on top of all of this junk. I keep finding empty bags of Miracle-Gro, so I'm assuming as much.   Has anyone ever dealt with anything like this before? I'm not sure what steps I should take - does it make sense to dig the whole thing up, rent a dumpster to throw the garbage and dirt away and start over? Do landscapers do this sort of work (and is it super expensive)? "

3255,Identify potted plant growing too tall (>8-9 ft),"My parents have had this plant probably around 15-20 years now, during which it has spent its time slowly growing upwards while the bottom leaves drop off and don't regrow. It's traditionally been kept indoors during winter and moved to an enclosed atrium during the summer, the latter of which may have encouraged the upwards growth.  Anyway, this past year they did not move it into the atrium as it has too unwieldy to move, and also to attempt to remove the suspected atrium's upwards encouragement.  So the basic questions are     What is this plant? Is there a way to encourage it to regrow lower leaves / stop only growing upwards? If not, can a cutting be taken to start fresh? And if so, what would discourage this type of growth pattern?   It does look like theres another issue here - new leaves being curled/withered - but I think that's a symptom of lack of direct sunlight due to its incessant need to grow upwards.   This image was taken from above the plant from the stairs. "

3257,Kentia Palm browning leaves and yellowing tips,I purchased this Kentia Palm about 3 weeks ago now. I was instructed by the owner of the store to water thoroughly (wait until water comes from the drainage holes and then empty the water to prevent plant sitting in water) when I felt the top of the soil is dry.  I have not watered the plant at all (out of fear of over-watering) but now am getting some brown fonds of the lower fronds and some yellowing tips on a larger frond.   I'm wondering if these are because of under-watering or something else? Also should I trim the smaller fronds that have turned crispy brown?

3259,Do indoor plants go dormant in winter?,"I read that many plants go dormant in winter. I live in the Netherlands, and while outside temperatures are between -3 °C and 10 °C in winter, the temperatures in my room are always between 15 °C and 20 °C.   I have aloes, cacti, and a Dracaena Massageana (Corn Cane). They are right next to a south-facing window, and I have noticed some of them (especially the Dracaena) putting out new growth during the winter.  My questions:     Would these plants actually go dormant during winter in my room's climate? If they've gone dormant, why are some of them still growing? Should I keep watering them with the same frequency during winter, assuming they didn't go dormant? Should I still only fertilise these plants in spring and summer?  "

3261,What vegetables/seeds/fruits at the grocery store can be viably replanted?,"I have a crude understanding that planted seeds should be non-hybrid non-gmo open-pollinated in order for their offspring to be as good as the parents.  If I try to use organic produce from the grocery store to start different varieties of plants which of them would create quality offspring?  Any root vegetables like potatoes, garlic, onions, carrots, beets?   Any vegetables that still have their roots intact like scallions or watercress?   Also what different seeds would work? Chia seeds? Flax seeds? Wheatgrass seeds? Other seeds?  For fruit, I assume that many fruits have sproutable seeds, but that few if any would grow a new generation as good as the parent? Is this correct?  Also my local market has tomatoes labels as ""heirloom tomatoes"". Are the seeds in these really ""heirloom"" and replantable or is this just a marketing gimmick?  By the way, I am not asking if it is a good idea. I am not planning on starting a garden this way, I am more interested from an educational perspective. "
3262,How to fertilize when planting veggies?,I got something called dr earth and I was going to drop a handfull in at the bottom of the hole before I planted. Would it be beneficial for me to throw some steer manure in there as well?  I had my soil tested and they told me there was almost no nitrogen. To try and fix that i sprinkled 6 bags of steer manure and 4 bags of compost over the planting area (about 25x20) and worked it in with a rake. Will dropping some extra in by the roots when planting give it an extra kick or would it be overkill?

3264,Will cutting away root(s) of a tree growing under my basement floor kill it?,"The tree looks like a Norway Maple to me, though that hasn't been verified. The small section of the root I found (there may be others close by) varies from 2-4 inches wide. While I'm not certain it's coming from the Norway Maple outside, it's the leading suspect given the sizes of the other trees. I'm attaching photos of the root, the Norway Maple and the other nearby trees (all in my neighbor's yard) along that side of my house.   The Norway Maple's trunk is about 3' in diameter and the root section under the basement floor is about 9' away, 5' under ground.       Am I right in assuming this root is from the Norway Maple? In this situation, would it be more prudent to cut down the tree before/after removing the offending roots?  Thank you. "
3265,Is my tree dead?,"I have a silver birch tree in my garden - two years ago we had it cut back by someone who possibly didn't know as much about managing trees as he thought. He cut quite a lot off in November of 2016 and last year (2017) almost no growth at all occurred - two ""sprays"" of very thin branches came out in two separate places and then died.  This year, at time of writing (May 2018) there is no live growth visible anywhere on the tree.  We don't know how old it is, as we moved into the house 4 years ago.  Is it dormant? Or is it dead? It's a lovely tree so I am reluctant to remove it if there's any chance that it might still be alive. Is there any way I can check that it is still alive or maybe even help it out a bit if there may still be life deep inside it?  We're in the UK, in the South if that helps.  Here is the photo:  "
3266,Starting garden over sod,"We just moved into a new rental and have permission from our landlord to start a garden. Our yard has a great southern exposure, is very flat, and we're in Seattle.   I've never started a garden before and I'm getting pretty frustrated by all the roadblocks I'm hitting. :/  I was thinking this year I'd try not to bite off more than I can chew and to put in one 4x10 ft. raised bed. Maybe do another in the fall and have it ready for spring 2018. I have no particular aversion to another type of garden, but these seemed popular and pretty simple.  I'm getting a lot of conflicting opinions on this; do I need to remove the existing sod? I started to remove some and went through about a 3x3 area when I realized there was no way it was going to fit in our city compost bins. I'm not sure if I'm pulling up too much but the grass roots seem to be about 4"" deep. If I have to I can rent a pickup and truck it to a yard waste disposal facility but I'd rather avoid that hassle if possible.  I've read about lasagna gardening, where you kill the grass with wet cardboard and pile things to compost on top. I wouldn't be able to plant until next year with this method and I was really hoping to have a garden this summer.  So I'm wondering... would I be able to put down wet cardboard over the desired area, build an 11"" fence around it, and fill the resultant box with compost/topsoil? I only worry that when the plants get through that first 11"" they'll hit the cardboard and the soil underneath will be so compacted they won't be able to grow into it. Could I lightly till the sod and then put cardboard on it?   I really don't need the world's best garden here, I'm just looking to get started without pulling out too much of my hair. Again if there is something totally different that I can try I'm totally open to it, seeing as I've done pretty minimal work so far.  Edit: Also I've been wondering about if it's reasonable to break up and aerate the sod, lay cardboard on top to ensure it's dead, and then add finished soil/compost on top. It's not a labor issue here I'm willing to work hard, I just don't want to spend days renting equipment and running all over town spending too much money. "

3269,Can the bacteria in compost bin be dangerous for kids?,"During the process of composting, is it dangerous for kids to play with? I mean to say is it okay if a child plays close to a compost heap or touches the material with their bare hands? I heard about bacteria living in the compost.  From the article Compost Pile Hazards by Nick Gromicko on nachi.org:     Compost can be a breeding ground for dangerous pathogens, some of which have killed or seriously harmed unsuspecting gardeners. Inspectors should familiarize themselves with these illnesses.  "
3270,Can I use an NPK compund fertilizer on herbs?,"I have some ""Low nutrient NPK compound fertilizer"" which is sold as Citrus Food left over from a Calamondin tree which has sadly passed away.   Can I use this fertilizer on my herbs? They are basil, oregano, thyme, parsley, coriander, chives.  It has nothing on the bottle which says you shouldn't use it on plants that aren't citrus fruit-baring, but will it benefit my herbs much even if I do go ahead and feed them with it? "
3271,What to do with uprooted grass & earth?,"Background: My husband and I bought a house last year with a couple of acres of land around it that haven't been maintained much recently, although there was obviously someone who did a lot of work on it at some point in the past.  Although we've gardened a bit in small urban gardens, we've mostly rented and moved frequently up until now, so we're novices when it comes to composting and other such long term tasks.  Location is the West of Ireland, but not right on the coast, in case that's relevant.  Scenario: One of our first tasks this spring as the weather started warming up was to clear the overgrowth (mostly grass and moss) out of the flowerbeds.  The earth is so soft that in a lot of cases just pulling it up by hand brought up a lot of earth on the roots, and we also had to dig up a lot of weeds, so we ended up with a debris pile that was probably almost half earth as well as grass, moss, weeds and other plant matter.  We separated out the obvious large stones and other unwanted items such as broken pots and bits of rubble.  Only one flowerbed is done so far so we'll have the same situation a fair few times more before we're done.  Question: I suspect that due to the large proportion of earth, this pile is not suitable for composting? In any case we're not quite set up for that yet.  What is our best use for it, given that we would like to improve the quality of the soil, which tends to be soggy, as well as avoiding unsightly heaps scattered around? "
3272,"tree id and brown spots on leaf edge, green berry-like fruits","What is this tree? I am worried about the brown edges of the leaves.   The tree is evergreen, and does not produce much litter at all, about 10 ft tall, 8 ft wide. It produces a lot of these fruits and have yet to see any ripe one yet (or is this a nut?). The fruit seems to be about 1/2"" diameter and somewhat hard at present. (This is a new home and have yet to go through an entire season..)  I don't see any remains of these fruits on the ground.   The leaves are turning brownish along the edge and about a 1/3 of the tree has these brown edges. I don't remember seeing the brown spots last year in this new house.     Tree: about 15 feet tall..  Location: San Francisco Bay area, California, USA Smell - has a familiar smell, but can't pinpoint it, like an unripe bittergourd melon.

3273,How to get rid of these small black bugs on gardenia,"My gardenia is more than 6 months old. it was in good health.  Suddenly I noticed that the gardenia leaves are turning yellow. I thought that it was because of natural causes. So, I ignored it initially.  Then I saw that even small leaves are turning yellow.  Then I check for the bugs and I saw these:    I sprayed insecticide and later also sprayed (strong force) it with water thought that I am safe now. But, unfortunately, they are keeping coming back in a couple of days. So, clearly, I could not kill the pest properly.  Any suggestion? My gardenia looks very tired :( . How can I revive it ? "
3274,Should I let brown snails in the garden?,"I have a small garden and it is full of cactus, wild aloe vera and beautiful pink roses.  I buy vegetables from a organic farmer and some of them have brown garden snails. Instead of throwing them away or kill them, I simply put them in a big pot that contains half a meter of soil and full of grass. I thought that they will die because in my country it does not rain a lot. Surprisingly, I found six in this pot that were alive and I sprayed some water for them.  Given that my garden in cacti-based, is it an issue to let the snails live in my garden? After all, is there a beneficial use of snails in the garden? Perhaps, do they eat some pests or only leaves? "
3275,What Should I Look For In An Electric Lawnmower?,"I searched through all the posts on lawnmowers and didn't find anything on electric mowers.  We have a very small front yard and only a slightly bigger backyard. Our elderly neighbor had mowed our lawn for years with his gas-powered mower, but is unable to anymore. We're now in the market for a lawnmower.   My husband and I are thinking of trying a small electric mower. The following isn't the greatest picture, as it doesn't show the full yard, but it does give an idea of how small it is. Note: the yard isn't much longer than it is wide. As you can see, our lawn is flat and there are no bumps or little hills. There is a maple tree off camera on the left side of the picture, but that's all.       Would you experts recommend an electric mower in general? We have two extension cords that are more than adequate in length to mow both the front and the back. I've been perusing mowers on Amazon, just to get an idea of price and options and basic electric mowers seem to start at around [tex]400.   Any thoughts or advice on purchasing an electric mower? What's the importance of volts and amps? Would a simple, inexpensive electric mower be appropriate for a yard like ours? "
3276,"Is a vertical, soil vegetable garden a bad idea?","So my mom has all this junk wood she's been collecting, and I think I found a good use for it:  as above-ground planters or as a vertical planter ""post""  (say 2 x 2 x 6 feet).   Basically, fill it with soil and have planters coming off the sides.  Would I some how need to compensate for gravity and more water accumulating on the lower plant roots?  Would this attract termites if I didn't use redwood (or cedar) but emptied it every year? "
3277,How to use banana peel as a fertilizer?,"I have heard several times that banana peel can be used as a fertilizer for garden plants (especially so for roses it appears) and verified it with a quick search on the Internet. As it happens, I sit on quite some banana peel right now (well, not literally) from producing jam. There seem to be various ways to use and prepare the peel beforehand:   cutting it in small pieces and mixing it with the soil surrounding the plants charring the banana peel in the oven and spread it afterwards in the garden soak the peel in water for a couple of days and water plants with it putting it in the compost and use the resulting mix of fruit and vegetable leftovers as usual   What is the advantage of using one form and not the other (if any)? Could you recommend a certain way based on your experience? Is banana peel and the way it is prepared appropriate for all plants equally? "
3278,What are the best materials to use to build raised garden beds on my roof?,"A part of my house (about 30ft x 15ft) has a flat roof and is south facing, perfect for building a little rooftop garden. Obviously, unlike other raised beds, the actual bottom of the bed will need to be elevated off the roof to prevent moisture from possibly destroying the roof.   I want to build 3 8x4 beds. Now, I know I can use cedar to reduce the chance of rotting, but I'm not rich enough to do that.  I can use Douglas Fir for the walls and some composite for the bottom if I can line the inside of the bed with some kind of plastic (I do plan to drill holes in the bottom for drainage).   Painter's plastic? That antiweed landscaping plastic? I'm open to other construction materials as well, provided I don't have to file bankruptcy after I buy them.    What's the best way to build a completely elevated bed on a budget? "

3282,Does seed spacing in aquaponic systems differ from soil systems?,"I am planning on starting a small, vertically-stacked aquaponic planter, with two beds and a small aquarium. Because my climate experiences periods of drought and near-freezing lows during winter, I am doing this indoors, which means I'm very space limited. As a result, I am planning a small system, with a ~12-gallon aquarium and two beds, one with ~3' of vertical clearance to the growing lights and the other with ~15"".  I'm currently limited to maximum planter dimensions of 16x8"", which I understand is quite small. If essential, I could expand to 16x12"", but no further.  My question is: Do plant spacing guidelines change for aquaponic systems?  If I find guidelines suggesting 5"" spacing (for basil, as an example), does that recommendation change for an aquaponic system, or does the fact that it's an aquaponic system not matter? "

I couldn't open it, so I don't know what they look like, but the box was about 6 inches tall and 3 inches front to back. Although I have a lot of experience with flowers, this would be my first vegetable. I've been told they're not easy to grow, but I'd like to try, especially because asparagus is so expensive to buy!  The box said both of the plants were male, as did all of the other boxes on the shelf. I assume that's important to know, or else it wouldn't have been made clear. What's the difference between the male and female? Does it matter when it comes to growing? Would I need some of each in order to produce a crop, perhaps for the purpose of pollination? If so, is there a certain way I should position them in the garden? "
3285,How long can celery grow from water alone?,I bought some celery and placed the small remaining stalk in a glass of water. It's been growing pretty decently but still has no roots. Still mostly green maybe a tiny bit a yellow on a couple leaves.

3286,How should I dethatch zoysia without harming it?,"Is there a method to dethatch zoysia best without harming the runners?  I went over a small portion of my lawn yesterday with a thatch rake, and came up with a ton of thatch, but felt like I was catching in the zoysia quite a bit.  I tried to exercise care and back off when I felt it catching, but it still felt like it was doing some harm.  Is this just a natural effect of detatching, or was I going at it too aggressively? "
3287,How much space can I leave between soaker hoses in my garden?,"I'm in the process of planting my garden, and I had planned 3 ft wide raised beds with a single soaker hose running down the center of each one. I am using a square foot layout, so there will be 3 rows across most of the beds. Will this hose layout be enough to reach plants that are in the outside 2 rows? Or do I need to run 2 hoses between the rows, so they're 18"" apart? I'm not sure if soil composition or density will greatly affect the moisture distribution or not. Is this just something I'm going to have to experiment with to determine?   "

3290,Is it beneficial to limit a Phalaenopsis orchid's bloom time?,"I have a Phalaenopsis orchid that appears to be doing very well. It has been in bloom for at least 4 months, and the flower spikes continue to put on new blooms. Based on the number of buds on the spikes, I suspect it will be in bloom for at least another month. During the time it has been in bloom, it has added a new leaf, and I can see new roots growing, as well.  Would there be any benefit in the long term for this plant to limit its bloom time? For example, if I were to cut the spike back now rather than letting it continue blooming for a month or more, would that mean a stronger, healthier plant in the future, or a plant that was more likely to rebloom?

3292,Hearty Flowering Perennial for curbside appeal,"I'm lost in a sea of articles with none of them actually answering my question so I turn here.  Currently I plant mums every year in my front yard (Midwest region: Kansas, Lots of sunlight on the area) and I'd like to stop the costly act especially since you can only really enjoy them in the fall.  So, can someone tell me of a similar or as equivalent as possible plant type as the mum that offers the same large compact rounded ball flowering look of a mum. That could be enjoyed at least through spring/summer/fall that will grow back after winter and flower again?   Preferably in a white color to keep my curbside appeal but allow me to forego the purchasing/planting of new plants every darn year? "
3293,Is my dwarf orange tree too young to bear fruit?,"I planted a dwarf orange this winter.  It came from the nursery with oranges already on it.  They are still green, and one split through the skin so I cut it off.  Should I leave the rest on?  Or would it be better to let the tree get established and take all the green fruit off? "
3294,Drainage in planter boxes,"I have to build some 6' x 2' planter boxes, I'm not sure what's going to be planted in them; probably ""garden-y"" stuff like oregano, basil, etc.  I know how to build things but I know nothing about plants except that every one I touch dies (I even killed my cactus).  I'm basing the boxes on instructions I found here:    My questions are:   How big should drainage holes be and how far apart should they be spaced? The screen at the bottom will be vinyl, nylon, or some other inert plastic. How fine should the screen be? Does it matter? How deep should the boxes be? I don't really care about minimizing volume, I just want to make sure the plants have a nice place to grow.   The box will be cedar (non-treated). Underneath the boxes will be a few inches of open air, then concrete.  I'm assuming the person I'm building them for will be filling them with a bit of gravel and some soil. "
3295,"If I just leave dandelions and clover in my lawn, what problems may happen?","There is a lot of advice on the internet about getting rid of dandelions and clover from a lawn: chemical herbicides, manual digging, organic weed remedies. I live in Denver, Colorado, USDA zone 5. I'm curious about the end-state of my strategy:   The lawn is mature and has a mix of grasses, but mostly it's kentucky blue grass. I don't use any herbicides on the lawn. I don't try to manually remove the dandelions or clover by digging them out. I mow the lawn once a week at about 3 inches, the tallest setting on my mower, and mulch the cut grass back onto the lawn (I don't bag it). I aerate the soil and top-dress with a well-screened compost once a year. I water using a Rachio, which I love.   I've been managing this way for about 2 years now and am curious what the end state will be?  Aside from getting the periodic side-glance from neighbors who prefer a world without dandelions, what will happen? Will the lawn remain a mix of grasses, clover and dandelions or will one weed become more dominant? Are there any weeds that are so bad that if they appear I should work hard to remove them? "
3296,Why are there yellow patches on yard?,I am in California where we have a drought. Both my front and back yard seem to be holding with watering twice a week but both have odd yellow dead areas while the rest is green.  The contrast with the green areas is striking. The green areas have tall grass but the dead areas look like someone tossed gas &amp; lit it. Its yellow &amp; barren in parts.  I checked the sprinklers &amp; the entire area is covered when they come on early in the morning. Today I walked around poking the soil to determine whether it was hard &amp; found it to be soft &amp; moist still.  I have recently moved into this house so I only know the drought though the grass was evenly green when I first moved in.  What else should I be looking for to account for the dead spots? I cant toss new seeds since I cannot water it often enough yet.  What are good resources to revive the lawns? 
3297,Composting Bin - Experiences,"I am very much in favor of getting a composting bin (like the one below).  Before I do that, I want to get your thoughts on the following:   Does it attract unwanted pests/rodents (bugs, mice, etc.)? Does it create an undesirable odor that can bother the neighbors?   Any suggestions on the questions above and the bin shown below would be great  "
3298,Amending a barren yard with compost: dedicated weed barrier or no?,"I've got a pretty typically barren New Mexico (zone 7a) yard, and I'm thinking of trying some intensive amendment to control weeds, improve the soil, and add some visual interest.  What I've read here as well as some other places has led me down the path of putting a zillion cubic yards of compost from the city water treatment plant over the existing totally barren desert ground. It's very cheap and made up of a great-looking mix of biosolids, yard trimmings, and animal stable bedding.  My next thought was that the weeds will love this stuff, and so I ought to cover all this compost with a cardboard weed barrier. But I'd need to anchor the cardboard down somehow, and it will look ugly. So I'd better put a top layer of maybe some nice-looking bark mulch over it.  But this all now sounds very complicated, and the engineer in me doesn't like the inefficiency of using two additional layers simply to facilitate weed control. And acquiring enough cardboard will be tough. Is there any way I can stop the weeds using just the compost?  After a few years of this, I'd like to plant a southwestern-friendly groundcover, but I'm not sure what yet (Current thoughts are Blue Grama grass or hardy Ice Plant). Should I maybe plant whatever groundcover plants I want right into the compost and use them to out-compete the weeds and block the sun? "
3299,What can I plant in dandelion graves?,"As part of my other question, I started uprooting dandelions. How successful, exactly, in removing the root, I'm not sure.  Assuming that I am not always extracting 100% of the root, what can I put in the dug-up ""grave"" to prevent or stunt future dandelion growth? For example, if I put salt, it's not likely the dandelion will grow back -- but neither will anything else! (I plan to eventually grow something.)  So, what can or should I be putting in here? Is grass seed ""okay"" or ""good enough?"" Is there something benign that will compete with dandelions?  Chemicals are a no-go -- I have young kids who play in the backyard, and in my area, they just banned a whole slew of lawn chemicals. "
3300,Is my lucky bamboo dying and what can I do about it?,Recently I've noticed my lucky bamboo houseplant had been withering from the top down. I've had it for over a year now and I'm wondering why it is dying.     The plant is in a glass bottle of water (changed once when it dried out last summer).   Here are some more recent photos.  What can I do about this? Has it aged too much?  
3301,Fruit Trees and Pollination,"I have a total of 7 fruit trees in my back yard.  3 are multi grafted varieties (Pear, Plum, Apple) which l was told that they will self pollinate each other to produce fruit.  I have added three additional apple trees and one cherry tree as well.    My questions are    Will the single trees get pollinated from the multi grafted trees? will the three different varieties of single apple trees pollinate each other as well? Is it possible for the cherry tree to be pollinated by these other 6 trees or do I need to plant another cherry tree?  "
3302,How can I deal with the beetles eating my grapevine?,"My mother is in a furor because the grapevine that she planted last spring and which flourished last year is now infested with little black bugs. From what I can tell, they seem to be flea beetles. (Are those thousands of tiny black spots they have left everywhere feces or eggs?)  I’ve read conflicting information about them being a problem, not being a problem, even being beneficial. She is sure that the level of damage they are doing is certainly harmful since they have already pretty much destroyed most of the few leaves that have managed to bloom so far this year.  The vine is not on the ground; it grows up around the porch (she intends it to be used as a sort of privacy hedge when it thickens), so some pest-management techniques like row-covers or growing repellent companion plants around it likely will not work (also, there are already lots of birds that frequent the area all day and they don’t seem to help).  Can anybody advise on how harmful they are and of a way to deal with them? (Preferably something not involving pesticides since they are poison, cost money, and would require searching town for a supply.)  Figure 1: Vine configuration   Figure 2: Leaf damage   Figure 3: Army of beetles  "
3303,What happens when a chainsaw chain meets a nail or piece of steel wire when cutting through wood?,Assuming any of the following:   there's an unnoticed steel nail in a log used in some structure or there's an unnoticed steel nail in a tree body (often happens when people attach illegal ads to trees)   And let's assume the nail is rather thick - 3 millimeters or thicker.  What happens if I cut such a tree or log with a chainsaw and the chainsaw meets the nail? Would it likely cut no problem or will any damage likely happen? 
3304,Damaged blueberry plants,I have two small blueberry bushes that I planted last summer.   During winter I've had a hare/rabbit that has chewed them up. Only the 2-3 innermost biggest core branches of each plant remains and these have been cut to 3/4 of their original size.   On these remaining branches part of the bark on the top of half has been stripped off by the animal.   The plants have lost about 1/2 of their original mass.  It's still winter right now. Should I expect these plants to be able to recover this year or maybe next year and eventually produce some fruits?  Or should I just uproot them come spring and buy new ones? 
3305,Can carnivorous plants grow well indoors?,"I will be going to a nursery soon. If I find some carnivorous plants there, would it be wise and safe for the plant to keep them inside, even though I don't keep insects in the house for them to eat? Or are they not indoor plants?  "
3306,Helicopters on new grass seed,Emergency --- Today I planted new grass near/under a maple tree.  Now the helicopters are starting to fall.  Is their a way to protect my new grass from invading seeds?  Would it work to put burlap down? 
3307,Protecting young fruit trees from deer?,We have some land but won't be living on it for another year. I've purchased a few apple trees and peach trees with about a 1 inch thick trunk and about 6' tall. I know about using the flexible black drainage pipe to protect the trunk of the tree but what can be done to protect the branches? I'm worried the deer might nibble on those and kill the trees. Should I even be concerned? 
3308,"I have the flowers, but how can I get seeds from my basil?","My basil has produced very nice white flowers. It's still cold outside so I can't put the plant out and let nature take its course. How do I successfully obtain seeds from the flowering plant? Do I have to cross pollinate, or does basil take self-pollination? After how long will be plant finally die after the process took its course? I'm doing some experiments here, so please bear with me. "
3309,Tear in alocasia calodora,There's been a slight tear on my indoor alocasia plant and I was wondering if it'll heal? Is there anything I could possibly do to help it?    
3310,How should I be fertilizing my container tomatoes?,"Caveat - I am about as novice as it gets when it comes to gardening, and especially with vegetables.  I'm trying tomatoes for the first time this year (Husky Cherry Red), and am wondering how I should be feeding them.  There is so much information (talking about fertilizers defined by 3 numbers, fish oil?, etc.) I just can't make sense of it.  Unfortunately I did not know to mix fertilizer in with the soil at the time of planting.  Here's what I did:  They are in 5-gallon paint buckets.  I drilled ~12 1/4"" holes in the bottom, lined the bottom with about 2 inches of rocks, filled with soil (that said it was for flowers and vegetables), and planted the tomatoes in those organic ""pots"" they came in according to directions (rip the bottom half off and drop the pieces in the hole).  I've been watering a lot, and they look healthy.  In 2 weeks they've grown a few inches.  No fruit yet though.  Oh - I'm in New York and they get plenty of sun.  What should I do now as far as feeding?  There seems to be so many choices - I'm really just looking for a ""tell me as if you were talking to a 5-year-old explanation.""  Thank you! "
3311,Only female flowers on English cucumber,"I got some cucumber plants from the nursery. Now I have got a few cucumbers and it turns out that they are actually English cucumber. Further, I am seeing only female cucumber flowers. There has not been even a single male flower over the past one week.  I do not have any idea how I got the few cucumbers without male flowers. There are no other cucumber plants in the vicinity. Are there any varieties of cucumbers that have only female flowers and can still provide fruits?  I searched extensively on the Internet but could not find anything.This link says that there are cucumber plants that have only female flowers but they still need to be fertilised with a plant that is bearing male flowers.  I can go back to the nursery and get more cucumber plants but how do I figure out if the cucumber plant will yield only male flowers or at least some male flowers? Can that be detected from the seedling?  Thank you for any answers "
3312,When to dig out carrots for consumption at the latest in autumn?,Starting from which temperature it doesn't make sense anymore to keep carrots in the ground if their final destination is consumption?  I'm in the midst of autumn here and last week we had still 20 °C. Now it has drop to 10-15.  When do they stop growing? 
3313,What is the proper method for repairing the holes left behind after pulling dandelions?,"   Possible Duplicate:   What can I plant in dandelion graves?       I've been very active this year religiously pulling dandelions with a dedicated weed removal tool and my lawn is virtually free of the ""yellow menace"" now. When I pulled the dandilions out, a small but noticable hole is left behind. Typically I step on the hole in an effort to close it, but I feel like I should fill it in with soil or something. Can someone recommend a good solution to fill the many holes on my nice green lawn? "
3314,What is causing the bark on my crabapple to crack and peel off?,"I have a flowering crabapple in my yard whose bark has several large areas where it cracks and curls away from the wood underneath:  Hover over any image for description / click for full size       I don't know what variety it is (the previous owners planted it), but it's a flowering crabapple with fragrant pink flowers and inedible 2"" kidney-shaped fruit.  I live in Portland, Oregon, USA which is USDA zone 8a.  My questions:   What is causing this damage and how can I treat it? Should I be worried about it spreading to my real apple tree which is approximately 20' away?  "
3315,How to care for columbines before winter (Zone 5-6)?,I just moved to a new house and I have noticed a nice patch of columbines. I love columbines so I would love to have them back next spring. I live in Toronto (Zone 5-6).   I was wondering what should I do with them before winter. Should I cut them down to the ground or should I leave the foliage as it is? I know they strive in the wild so probably they don't need to be protected like roses. Are they perennials or do they just reseed? If they just reseed then I rather cut them right to the ground because they have leaf miners. 
3316,Is it possible to do my own extensive soil/organic matter testing?,"I've read the posts on soil testing, and I realize it's cheap and widely available through local universities, etc.  Question: Is it possible to do my own soil testing?  Are there some compounds that it's very difficult to test for without a big fancy lab like at the university?  Can the same chemistry be used to test for compounds in things like compost, manure, etc?  In other words, if I invest in a little chemistry lab and follow instructions, can I test any mulch, compost, whatever that comes my way for chemical quantities, and make use of those numbers in deciding how to mix them and how long to let it age? "
3317,What is this mark that appears on my small green plums?,"After the flowers fell the green plums started growing. As soon as they were 1/4"" across, They began developing these little sunken black marks. I have been consistently spraying with fruit tree spray. How can I control this?  "

3319,Seeding grass with milorganite,"I used weed killer almost 2 weeks ago and I think I am ready to seed and fertilize. My yard is around 9.000 sq ft and backyard gets lots of sun light but my trees block the half part so half part is shade and have almost no grass.(2000sq. ft.) My plan is seed then use milorganite. For shade part I think dense shade would be good the rest I can use shade &amp; sun mix. Before seeding I will add some top soil. Any suggestions would be great. I haven't done any lawn care in my life.   Besides milorganite do I have to use anything else? Like turf starter etc?  Is it too late to seed now? I live in Kansas, it is end of may and weather the 70s.   Edit: I added some photos.  [website][website][website][website][website][website][website][website]"
3320,Are my poppy seedlings dying? How can I save them?,Are my poppy seedlings dying? I leave the plate filled with water everyday. How can I save them? (Even if it means ripping some off and leaving them more spaced out.)   
3321,Are large strawberries supposed to be fan-shaped?,"My new Gurney's Whopper strawberries are growing large as advertised, but are an odd fan shape. Is this normal or am I doing something wrong? I have here a picture of Gurney's Whopper strawberries with a regular June-bearing strawberry plant for comparison.   "
3322,What is this tropical-style houseplant?,"I am not at all trained in identifying plants. I've tried the tips from the question: How do you identify a plant?, but I have no idea what kind of group or family this plant belongs to, so starting a search is difficult. Google Image Search yields no results.   So my question is: can somebody identify this plant? It grows quite well in a tropical climate is all that I can say about it. And it measures about 70cm in height.      "
3323,How should I care for my multi-variety apple and pear trees?,"I am a novice gardener living in the San Francisco Bay Area.  When I created my vegetable/fruit garden, the landscaper recommended grafted fruit trees (ones which produce 6 different varieties of fruits).  As a result I have one pear tree which should be producing 6 different varieties of pears.  I also have one apple tree with 6 different varieties.  The trees were planted about 4 years back.  So, I have a couple of questions:   Should I be pruning the extra branches that have been growing every season down to what the original tree looked like (on step, 6 branches)? - see picture of what is looks like today What else should I be doing to get a good fruit crop this summer?  I guess I should fertilize them, but is there anything else?     "
3324,"What are some good vegetables for a beginner, and how do I find quality seeds?","I have taken a recent interest in gardening, particularly growing herbs and vegetables. I don't know much, but I'm going to wing it and learn from trial and error.  I have a few questions that I really need answered in order to advance with my new future hobby:    What are the easiest and quickest vegetable plants to grow, that are self-sustaining so that I don't have to be constantly buying new seeds? What should I look for when searching for safe and quality seeds? Are micro-greens worth it? And what are some alternatives?   "
3325,What is the best shade tree to shade the front of my house?,"What type of tree(s) should I plant to provide the best shade on a two-story house?  I would like to provide as much shade as possible on the red square below:   The part I'm most concerned about is the window area.  That is my office and, in the afternoon, outdoor temps that go over 85 turn that square area into a small oven. Even with the A/C blasting; there's only so much it and insulation will do.  The place to plant the tree is key too.  Here is an overhead view of my house:   Do you see what the evil sun is doing every afternoon from 2-5?  He wants to bake me.  I understand this task will require a bit of patience so anything that would provide shade in the next 5 to ten years would be fine.    Update  Based on an answer and some comments, let me refine what ""best"" means:  How much should it grow per year?  Anywhere between 2-4 feet.   How long should it live?  I don't know the average life expectancy of trees, but something that would last at least 30 years should be fine.  Provide the most shade?  Oh yeah!!!  Much-o important-o!  Especially in that little window area in the red box since that is where I work.  Should it be easy to maintain?  YES!!!  Anything that requires work on the ground (e.g. raking) not a huge deal, but I don't want to climb ladders and trim limbs every season.  How big should the tree be to start with?  Small enough to fit in the Minivan you see in the garage or that would fit on a small tow trailer.  Ideal for your climate?  Yes, obviously, but it would help if I listed climate:  Alabama. I should also mention we get awful tornado weather every year so I would not want to plant something that would blow over and destroy the house. "
3326,How should I care for this houseplant to prevent wilting?,"Is anyone familiar on the name of this plant? I seem to have problems with it wilting during the day, with or without sunlight. I water this regularly during the day and started applying complete fertilizer when I noticed watering it regularly does not help it from wilting down.  Any suggestion on proper caring for this plant?   "
3327,What caused the leaf scorch on my Dracaena deremensis 'Lemon Lime' and what should I do about it?,I have a Dracaena deremensis 'Lemon Lime' in my office. Several month ago it began to show leaf scorches.  The gardener that sold it suggested it could be a symptom of sun burns.  I then moved the plant to a spot where no direct sunlight is coming in.  The plant also shows some yellowish spots (see pictures).  What could it be? What should I do?       
3328,Personal Health: Garden Labor and back injury,"Hopefully on-topic enough:  What guidelines should gardeners follow in order to avoid back injuries and other health problems that could crop up in old age?  Are all intensive gardeners doomed to some health problems from bending, hacking, whacking, shoveling, pulling, heaving, etc?  Is the best answer just: Do everything slowly? "
3329,How fast does human manure turn into compost?,"I want to try turning human manure (humanure) into compost.  How much time does it take to become compost? Or how much time it takes the compost to become humus, ready to be used as a fertilizer? Maybe this is a better phrased question.  I live in Spain.  And what's the best carbon material to use? Straw (hay)? Sawdust? Autumn leaves? "
3330,Will the effectiveness of soaker hoses degrade too much if I connect multiple ones together?,I'm looking to use soaker hoses on my tomatoes this year and need a bit over 100 feet to get all the plants. The maximum length I can get one in is 50 feet so I would need three hoses to get everything evenly. Would they work ok if I connected them all together or would it be better to use a 3-way splitter on them? If it helps the hoses I was looking to get are these. 
3331,What to do when an animal dies inside a hollow tree?,"We have a beautiful Shag Bark Hickory next to the house with a large hole about 18' up.  A family of raccoons moved in a few weeks ago and had a litter.  Recently we've seen a lot of domestic disturbance going on as the mother fought off the father.  Well, I can only assume he's gotten to the kids and killed them.  The tree is starting to smell and we see flies around it.  I don't want to cut down the tree, it's beautiful.  I know it's hollow.  It won't last forever but I still don't want to cut the tree.  What do we do about the scent?  Is there a way to not have to endure it?  Concrete?  Flesh eating beetle?  What advice, please? "
3332,Top Dressing: When and How,"I recently started composting, and I was reading about top-dressing. Two questions I have about top-dressing are:   Is there a maximum to it? Most of my reading suggests up to once a year max. Do I really need to rake it under the grass? Some sites suggest leaving it on your grass (it'll disappear by itself), some suggest raking it until it goes under the soil.   If you're wondering, my backyard area has quite a few weeds (hoping to eliminate most of them), a few small bare patches, and a few areas of yellow/dead grass. I'm aiming to eliminate most of the weeds and get a consistent, thicker grass for this year; maybe some vegetables next year.  Edit: I live in a place where we get cold winters (-20C and under) and hot summers (up to 30C or so). "
3333,"Piece of fabric in planter, how to use it?","I bought few planters with soil and basil seeds included. There was also piece of fabric at the bottom that I do not know what to do with. There were no instructions and I wasn't able to google anything (I do not know right keywords I guess, I am very new to anything gardening related).   planter looks like this:      An idea occurred to me while writing this question, was I supposed to thread that piece of fabric through those slits at the bottom of top part so that it could pull moisture from bottom part up toward the soil? If so, how exactly is it supposed to look? Is it too late to fix it now?  Bonus questions: What is this type of planter called and how to use (water) it properly? "
3334,Compost Bin Full - Turning vs. Layer of Browns on Top,"I have a small open compost bin, it's now full with layers of brown and green. I read somewhere that I need to turn it occasionally (weekly is ideal), and that I need to keep a 1-4"" layer of browns (shredded newspaper is good) on top to prevent bugs/pests/etc.  How do I reconcile these two? Turning it will mix everything up and will disrupt the layer on top. Do I need to then re-layer it on top? I didn't leave that much space. "
3335,How can I keep my cycad from growing too large?,"For the first year, my cycad was a stout and aesthetic little plant. But then its annual fronds shot out. And they kept shooting out. And today the plant looks like this:    Each frond is about 2 feet long. That makes for a big footprint in a small NYC apartment.   What can I do to manage the directionality of its fronds and the plant's overall growth? (Is it too late?) "
3336,Are there trees with edible fruit from the family Mimosaceae?,"I am looking to graft (I hope this is the right word) some fruit on top of an ""Acacia saligna"".  Can this be done?

3337,How do I treat and care for trees infested with borers?,"One of my apple trees recently started to look like it's dying (leaves dying when they shouldn't, bark peeling, lack of fruit, new branches growing and then quickly dying). My neighbor looked at it and noticed lots of small holes, pointing out that borers were living in it and that's what was killing the tree.  I then noticed the same thing in several other of my currently healthy trees, and I have a wide range of trees with them (pine, pecan, almond, lemon, orange, peach, cherry, grapefruit, and much more).  My question is, are there are any tips on treating this? I hear they sell treatments at some of the local stores, though I'm really trying to stay away from chemical treatments whenever possible. Any tips, commercial treatments, or homegrown solutions? I'm completely new to having all these trees too (came with a property I bought) so you're helping a complete beginner. "
3338,Potential problem (root girdling) with citrus tree planting?,"I live in Sacramento, CA area. In April 2018, I purchased two dwarf citrus trees (navel orange, meyer lemon) for planting from our local nursery (5 gal containers). I decided to put the orange tree in the ground and the lemon tree in a planter box. The soil in the ground is 90% rock (the house is situated on a plot which was carved/flattened from the side of a small hill.  For planting the orange tree, I followed most of the basic instructions of planting a new tree. Dug a hole 2-3 times the width of rootball diameter and rootball depth, removed all the rock and replaced with garden soil/compost (50%/50%) mixture, exposed the root flare just slightly above ground level (I think), and kept the mulch a good 1 feet away from the trunk. I have been watering/fertilizing regularly, and the tree looks healthy. Plenty of young fruit which I picked off early to get the tree to concentrate on root/trunk development.  However, I have a concern about the root growth. I notice a root going around the small trunk and what looks like a potential root girdling? I'm attaching some pictures. Is there cause of concern or is this root growth normal? If problem, should I just cut the root that is going out and then back in? Will it kill the young tree? The tree is growing actively so I am not sure.  I'm also attaching pics for the lemon tree and that looks OK. The roots are fanning out in all directions which looks good.  Thanks for any opinions.  Pictures are on on this Citrus Tree Pictures "
3339,What is this grass and how prevalent is vivipary in grasses?,"We noticed some seedlings emerging from the flower head of an unidentified grass flower head yesterday. None of us had seen this before and we wondered how common it was and if it is more prevalent under certain conditions. How common is this? Also are these sprouts, which would either drop singularly or attached to the seed head when it drops, as vigorous as seed germinating in or on the soil?  Below are photos for anyone who thinks they might be able to ID.       "
3340,Cement Blocks for Raised Bed?,What are the pros and cons of using cement blocks for a raised bed?  I am thinking of using something similar to these cement blocks and building them 3 blocks high. That would give me a good 2ft deep bed. I am also thinking (but unsure) if I should pour cement down the slots to help make it solid and connected or how I should go about keeping them together.   Once all the bricks are lined I will also be getting some nice treated wood to build around them. This will be mainly just for aesthetics but I guess could also help hold the blocks in place. 
3341,Does Arugula/rocket flowering mean the plant's crop season is over?,"I sowed arugula/rocket in an outside pot 2 months ago. As it was my first sowing of rocket, it turned out to be too dense so I have thinned it out.  It was growing nicely, but all of a sudden it started sending out long shoots that now have flowers on top of them. Beside this, the leaves are too tiny and cannot be used, and the lower  leaves are turning yellow.     I think the plant is trying to make seeds and then it will die away.  Should I sow new seeds?

I dug my ideal area on the backyard, 6"" deep, just to discover I had chosen the spot where an old foundation had been covered with soil :(. It is right at the 6"" depth that the tulips need to be planted at.  Can I plant them on top of this concrete foundation, maybe less deep (5"" or so) with a bit of soil under them (1"")? Or should I just get over it and choose a different spot?  How about daffodils?  I live in Toronto, Canada, in USDA hardiness zones 5/6   "
3343,My Emerald Arborvitaes are Yellowing on the Inside!,"I live in Utah and the weather is getting a bit colder. About a month ago all my of trees were going very strong, all green throughout, but now they are starting to yellow from the inside out. This makes me so sad.

3344,How much water does my square foot vegetable garden really need if I'm using drip irrigation?,"   Possible Duplicate:   How much water should I give my veggies every day?       I recently installed a drip irrigation kit in my square foot garden with 1GPH heads aimed at the center of each square foot region.  The instructions say to run the system for 30-60 minutes every 1 to 4 days depending on temperature, which comes out to anywhere from 60 minutes per day to 30 minutes every 4 days. If my math is correct, that's anywhere from 1.4"" to 11"" per week!  11"" per week seems very excessive even in the heat of summer for where we are (Zone 10), yet 1.4"" per week supplied via 30 minute waterings every 4 days seems like way too little in this heat.  I don't mind going through the cost/effort of adding extra lower/higher flow heads where appropriate, but I'd rather avoid ruining my crops due to experimenting with vague watering requirements from multiple sources.  Is there a good resource for watering requirements (volume and frequency) based on temperature for different types of vegetables that I could refer to in order to optimize my system?  In the mean time, what watering schedule could I use in general to keep my plants healthy? "
3345,What are these white blades in my lawn?,"As of a few weeks ago, I've noticed that my lawn has started to get a lot of white blades in it.  When I look down close to the ground, the base level seems to be almost all white.  What is this?  Is it just thatch, or is the grass unhealthy? What can I do about it?  The lawn had a moss problem earlier in the year, and I applied an organic moss killer and raked it all out, and reseeded the worst parts. The grass has more or less recovered, but now has developed these white parts.     "
3346,Can I make my Jade plant grow faster?,"A year ago, my grandmother gave me a cutting from her jade plant and it has grown a little since that time. I repotted it about a week ago because the pot it was in was beginning to get too small. I used a 50/50 mix of organic potting soil and sandy dirt and I water it whenever the soil feels and looks dry. It sits in full sun for about 4 hours a day (I live in the UK so the light intensity is not extreme)  Here's a picture of it at the moment:  [website]It grows REALLY slowly (my chilli plants I bought a week ago have grown as much as the money plant has done in a year)  Can I make it grow faster?

3347,"Help needed to repot my 42"" avocado tree in my apt please!","Hello wonderful people with green thumbs! I've managed to grow an adorable avocado tree from a supermarket avocado pit. I don't know what I'm doing and I'm usually awful with plants so this was truly a miracle but I need some help please. My tree is now about 42"" and is in a 10q pot.   We're located in a small apt in New York City and since the winters are too cold for my little tree, we're trying to continue in pots until I can find it a good home in a warmer climate.    I have 3 questions please; 1. I've switched to the pot it's in few months ago but now it's much taller and has bigger roots so I'm afraid to mess it up. What is the best way I can repot to keep my little tree healthy? And how deep should I place the pit? I didn't have a support stick before since it seemed sturdy but now that the top leaves are very big,  it began to bow and now I have a stick as well.   You can see the new pot in the picture. (On the bottom it says 25q) I'm hoping it will be enough until the winter when hopefully we'll be moved into a house so I can get a much bigger pot.  2. 4 of the leaves by the top are dried midway. The lady at homedepot advised me to cut the dried parts. Should I? What caused this? What can I do?  3. The lady gave me Nature's care organic and natural tomato, vegetable &amp; Herb plant food. Would my little tree like this food? Or is there one better suited for its needs?  Thank you so much!! Whatever advice you can give me will be highly appreciated! Please help my tree!  Ps. I dont know how to add more pics but I'll try to do it in replies. Sorry!  ADDED INFO FOR STORMY   Hello Stormy, I am so sorry! I should have mentioned that this isnt the regular spot for my tree. It sits in a windowsill in front of a VERY bright window facing north. (I only have any windows facing north). It was originally in a 3q pot and when the leaves began to grow really big, I switched to the pot it's in now. This was in February. I cant remember which type of soil it was but it was a plant one from homedepot and I think you might be right about it having some type of fertilizer or something in it cause it suddenly grew very fast and tall. I thought it was the new pot. The leaves continued to grow very big and dark green. The top leaves curling up dry happened only couple weeks ago. And I have 2 theories as to what might have caused it;  either the sudden temperature rise and long exposure to sun without enough water OR that it was caused by my stupidity when I accidentally used the same watering can I use to add treated water to my aquarium. (It is treated by a chemical mix called Prime which removes chlorine, and chloramine and detoxifies ammonia). If there was traces of it in the water maybe my tree got a tiny tiny bit.  I switched to a new watering can since then (might explain why the top leaves are all normal and I have new growth coming along)     I never used any food fertilizer etc. I think I might have stuck 2 miraclegro food spikes in there once long ago.  I will return the soil and fertilizer and get one that you recommend. Do you think i should continue in the pot its in?  Since it grew so fast and tall I thought it would need more space to continue. However I can only keep it in the windowsill if it's in this pot. Anything bigger wont fit. I will make sure to lower the shades so it doesnt get direct sun. And if you recommend I repot then I will place it to the spot closest which is the floor by the window.   When you said cut the leaves to the next leaves.. do you mean i cut off the entire plant body from the leaves up or just trim the leaves? There are normal leaves above it and some new growth coming up.  Thank you so much!!!!!   "

3349,Why have my chilli seedlings stopped growing?,"6 days ago, I repotted some chilli seedlings after they started showing their 3rd pair of leaves. They were the biggest seedlings at the time. Since then they seemed to have stopped growing. These are the ones in the green planters in the picture.   I left some of the slightly smaller seedlings in their original planter. These are the 4 seedlings in the black planter in the bottom left of the picture. You can see that they are doing much better than the ones in the green planters.  I found a question about stunted seedlings, but mine don't look malnourished:  Why have my lemon seedlings stopped growing and turned yellow?  What can I do to get the green planter seedlings growing again?  Update  It took a while, but my chilli seedlings have started growing again. I have been lightly fertilising as suggested, I can't say that it definitely helped, but it certainly didn't hurt the seedlings.   "

3351,What variety is this curvy courgette / zucchini with a bulge at the flower end?,"This is a picture of courgette/zucchini from a plant I bought but no longer have the tag for. The shape shown is the same as every other courgette from the plant. They look like a coat hook to me!  The plant itself has relatively small leaves compared with the standard courgettes people grow, and the fruit is smaller too and probably a bit less prolific.   However, unlike the standard ones, the courgettes were also a little more crisp to eat, and didn't grow too large within a few days if left unpicked (the one shown was probably 2 weeks old and is larger than I generally picked them, as I didn't notice it for a while, but it was still delicious!). The plant has also lasted much much longer with no sign of mildew, and is still producing as we get into wintery weather.  I'm wondering if anyone can identify the variety? (it was purchased in New Zealand, but may still be grown elsewhere?)   "

3354,Do I need to change the irrigation for my Shamel Ash trees?,"I have three Shamel Ashes in my yard, all planted at roughly the same time and all irrigated in the same way. Despite professional care they haven't shown any substantial growth in over a year. If anything, they have thinned.    I live in Phoenix, Arizona (US). My research leads me to believe that the tree may struggle a bit in the hot weather but are still a viable choice for the region. I don't believe that they have been substantially under/over-watered though I could certainly be wrong. A small number (&lt; 10%) of leaves have brown tips.  Each tree is currently watered with four drip lines located a short distance from the trunk. They are shown uncovered (normally they are buried) in the picture below.    The water has been on for an hour in this picture. Even if it soaks to an appropriate depth, it doesn't look like the water is well-distributed.   Should I add more drip lines?   Change the irrigation method entirely? Or should I be investigating other problems?  "
3355,"Is this shrub a rhododendron, and how can I help it to flourish?","My mom gave me this shrub/tree/bush a few years back.  She told me it was a rhododendron but had no other information.  I live on the border of Zone 4 and 5 in the Lake Michigan basin.  I planted it on the north east corner of my house in pretty much full maple tree shade.  It hasn't done very well where it is but it has bloomed twice so far (as you can see in the pics).     Does anyone know the common/scientific name?   Does this plant require full sun?  How much should I water?  How much should I fertilize?   I've never covered it over the winter, should I and how should I?     I've attempted trying to tie it up over the winter but the branches are so scraggly that I was afraid I'd break/kill what little remains.  Any help with this plant would be awesome.      "
3356,How to get rid of sprouts coming from a chinaberry stump?,"I had a 30ft (9m) chinaberry (Melia azedarach) removed that the previous owner left for me, four months ago. It had multiple split trunks at the bottom that made every arborist that looked at it concerned, and it was positioned close to the front of the house, so a storm could easily knock one of the major trunks onto the house. The tree removal people cut it down to an inch from the ground. I left an option open to have the stump ground down but didn't have that done.  Now, I haven't been making it a priority to remove it, but I just noticed what looks like chinaberry sprouts coming from the edge between the bark and the wood. As I have read online so far, this sounds bad because I didn't apply an herbicide to prevent this from happening. So, now I am wondering how to best proceed with killing off the chinaberry for good.  Apparently, since it was a four months ago, applying glyphosate to the stump won't help to kill off the roots. Is that right? Should I apply glyphosate to kill the sprouts and possible future sprouting? I already have some potassium nitrate (stump removal chemical) that I was thinking about applying inside the stump.  Also, from what I've read from other chinaberry sufferers is that they have roots all over the place. However, I don't seem to have roots from the chinaberry exposed anywhere.  My gut is telling me to apply glyphosate and then drill holes into the stump and apply the potassium nitrate. But, I also want avoid a dead lawn where I can't grow anything to replace it. There are two live oaks near it that were being dominated by the much taller chinaberry that need help growing especially in the central Texas climate. "
3357,Should I be concerned about my bell peppers,"Started Bell Peppers from seeds may 7 indoors, transplanted them a few weeks ago, I'm in USDA zone 5.

The other 11 I have growing look more or less similar to this one ( some a bit more foliage) and 3 of them have even started fruiting with very tiny marble sized peppers on them as of a few days. Should I be worried at the lack of height and bushiness? How to fix the problem?

3362,Are low double deer fences effective in keeping deer out?,"Most people with large landscaping investments around here fence their property with 8' deer fence. This can be hidden from view in most cases. In certain situations, however, 8' fencing would detract too much from the view, and I've heard professionals recommend the installation of two parallel 4' fences 4' apart. The outer fence is typically some kind of wire mesh, while the inner one is described as merely two horizontal wires about 2' apart, running from post to post. The theory is not only that the deer can see the horizontal wires and fear that they can't jump across the distance, but that they also will not jump into the narrow space contained between the fences.  I have done some research online on the effectiveness of such a setup, but have been disappointed in how little info I've found.   So, does this setup work, or not? And are there specifications for setting up an effective double fence?  "
3363,Tips or thoughts on pruning old giant leggy jade?,"  I have an old leggy jade tree that has a lot of horizontal growing branches. The stems are thick and woody and are already spilling over the sides of the pot, so there's actually only one or two vertical branches. I'd like to get it bushier and grow more horizontal to fill in the gaps.   Looks like I'll have to be pretty aggressive about pruning it back. What do you guys think? Will pruning the horizontal growing branches encourage it to grow upwards? It's also a bit lop sided and the heavier side is what is in the picture. "

A childhood neighbor would burn off his zoysia, but I'm not sure that's allowed where I'm at, or if it would work. Is there a grass I could overplant that would dominate it? Is there a non-poison option that would work? Time is not a huge issue. That is, it doesn't have to be finished this year.   "

3366,What is happening to my chilli plant? How can I help it?,"Some white spots appeared recently on my Twilight chilli plant (indoors), on some leaves brown spots start appearing in the middle. First I thought - aphids, but it doesn't quite look like insects. Or those very small insects. The white thing can mostly be found on the upper surface of leaves. It is a bit sand-like in touch.      The transparent spots on some leaves (visible on the last photo) had appeared earlier, but I didn't panic about those, as the plant seemed otherwise healthy. In fact it still looks quite healthy apart from the described symptoms – it is flowering and first fruits grow.  I am afraid about my other plants on my windowsill – three other chillies and a tomato. They do not seem affected now, though.  What is it? Can it be powdery mildew or rather those are some insects? How can I fight it?  Do all the symptoms (white 'sand', brown spots, transparent spots) seem related or, maybe, some of them can be just an effect on some bad care from my side?  Update 2012-05-15: Thanks for the comments. You may be right, these are scale insects. Though, today I was able to take a bit better pictures and it doesn't quite look like on the other question:      I am starting a treatment, with soap, vinegar and scissors, like it is scale, anyway.  Update 2012-05-22: Just after my last update I have started my 'treatment'. I have washed the leaves and whole plant with a soap and vinegar mixture, then flushed with clear water. I was able to get rid of most of the white stuff and for a moment things looked well. But in an hour first leaves started wilting. In a couple more hours most of them wilted. The next day most of the leaves and some branches were clearly dead. The pests would probably not harm this plant as I did…  I hope they were killed together with the most of this plant.  Probably the solution was too strong, the leaves to delicate for such treatment or I was not able to flush it properly. Or all of these. Do not try this at home!  Out of curiosity I have kept the plant to see if it can survive. Now, a week later, new leaves and branches appear. The three fruits are still there, even some flower buds seem still alive. The pests are nowhere to be seen, but I know I need to wait a few more weeks to know if they are really gone.  The next time the bugs appear, I will buy some pesticides at a local gardening shop and use them properly rather than trying a compilation of 'organic' treatments described on the Internet. :)  Update 2012-06-19: Over a month passed and the plant recovered from my 'treatment'. Unfortunately so did the insects. Yesterday I have found them on my Cayenne plant, then one adult on a Habanero and lots of small ones on the Twilight, which started this story. This time I have bought a pesticide (systemic, for chewing and sucking insects) in a nearby gardening shop and sprayed all my plants… I hope this time the results will be much better. "

The climate where I live is rather cold during the Winter and Autumn, and even though my mango plant is facing the south, during these periods of the year, sunny and warm days are very rare.  I thought I was over watering it, so I planted it in a new (plastic) pot with dry soil, also I bought a fertilizer for plant growing in winter.  What should I do? Should I cut the leaves?

3371,What lawn care steps should I take?,I'm a new home owner and I have no idea how I should start to care for my lawn. Should I fertilize before seeding? Should I kill weeds first? Should I used a shade friendly seed? What about aerating the lawn? I basically would like to know what steps I should be taking to grow a beautiful green and weed-free lawn.   Lawn info: I live in the upper mid-west. The lawn is mostly shaded by very tall trees around the perimeter.

I'm curious if it'd be practical to pump water from the stream into the pond, and then have an overflow that fed down a small run back into the stream?  I know very little about garden ponds at the moment.  I think generally with a liner pond it can be hard to get the nutrient/pH balance correct, and I wondered if feeding it from an existing stream would help or hinder?  Obviously any pump needs to have a filter on it, but it won't come close to purifying the water, so it'll certainly be different to having a pond that's filled from the tap/rainwater.  At a rough guess we'd be looking at a 3-5 cubic metre pond, and the rate of flow into it from the stream could be chosen to be anything depending on the pump used.  Maybe it's a stupid idea, in which case let me know and set me straight!  Thanks "

3377,"New House, Dirt Yard, Ideas in Mind, where to begin?","I moved into my house back in December of 2015. We still have a dirt yard and want to try and get something in before summer time.  I have had a few quotes that are a little out of budget for me so I was thinking about taking this project on myself and then anything I cannot do I save up for and have done professionally (possibly cement).  My yard has a slight grade at the retaining wall going towards the house. The front left of the house is where the draining areas are on the bricks. That is the direction that the yard is flowing towards.  My question:  Since the yard is pretty tough right now, with a few holes from the dogs digging, what would be the first recommendation in terms of leveling out the yard?  Do I need to till the yard to break up the hard dirt and then screed it out and make it level?  I will be adding in sod, rock and eventually a cement area for seating/fireplace.  I am just trying to figure out how to give myself a good starting area.        UPDATE  For those who care to see what I ended up doing, pics are below. Also added a citrus tree in the middle of the back wall (not pictured). Most difficult part of the process was getting the ground level for the bricks, the rest kinda fell into place. AZ dirt is a pain in the ass, especially for the trenching, the machine struggled :)     "
3378,Will small tomato plant thrive under strong heat sun?,"I bought this small tomato plant at a grocery store. I'm considering moving it to our rooftop.   In the rooftop, it will receive shade during sunrise and sunset (there are buildings on both sides), and obviously at night. It will receive direct sun for about 8 hours, and since we're in the Caribbean it will also be very hot (over 90°F). We're also close to the ocean, so the air's salty.  With frequent watering, will the plant thrive or will it die from the heat and the sun? I also tend to rinse the leaves with a hose every few days to remove any salt.  Btw, it's in a 6"" pot. Also, it was always under shade and in a cooler environment at the supermarket. I'm mentioning this since it could be a factor?   "

3383,Are there any disadvantages to using a Tree watering spike?,"(In Southern Cali)  I've been racking my brain about a recent remodel of our irrigation system in a certain zone that has 2 large fig trees in the middle of a section of grass.  The main trunk of each tree is around 6-8 inches wide. They both stand around 10 to 12 feet high. The trees are doing great and give off plenty of fruit.     Green = grass Tree 1 and 2 are fig trees that are about 8 feet apart.  Black dots = Normal sprinklers.  Blue dots = 4-way drip system sprinkler head.    Currently, each drip system head can push 2 gal/minute. I've 2 ran lines from each head directly to the tree trunk, and the last 2 are turned off. So each tree is getting 1 gal/minute.  The lines running to each trunk are placed at the surface level on top of the soil and each tree trunk has a brick barricade so the water doesn't runoff. That's probably a 3 foot circle of brick.  After doing a lot more search in the last week. I released I have been watering these trees all wrong. And the evidence of it kind of shows. I should have been giving them water once 2-4 weeks, instead of 5-7 gals 3 times a week. I can visually see the roots on top of the soil OR maybe 1 foot to 6 inches below the soil. There maybe way more far deeper below, I just don't know. In the past, the trees were only getting water from the sprinkler system and getting water manually. As of last year, I installed the drip system to put water directly into the trees, so it was getting water at a much more consistent rate.   Now i'm thinking about using tree spikes so the water could go much deeper, instead of just being on the surface level and draining down toward the middle of the tree. So hopefully the roots can push down deeper instead of depending on just surface level water.    I'm aware I might be too late because the trees are around 10 years old now. But I have this current system with many other trees in the back yard, much younger trees. Which I could re-do the irrigation setup and install these spikes to push water further down. The other trees in the backyard, don't have grass surrounding them, they are in (in-ground) 5 foot round planter concrete enclosures that were placed when the house was built.  What do you guys think about these tree spikes? Are they a bad idea? Do they work as intended? Are they only intended for manually watering? OR can I place a 1/4 inch drip system line into 1 of them to push water down? "
3384,How do you figure out if you have Rhizobia bacteria in your soil?,"I have prepared a leaf-rich garden patch (see here).  To promote decomposition of the leaves I have planted a lot of beans and peas to promote nitrogen fixation in the soil.  However, I don't know if there are any Rhizobia bacteria in the soil.  How do I figure this out?  How do I figure out their concentration? "
3385,Does my very young Eureka lemon tree have leaf disease?,"I have had a small sprout of lemon tree (Eureka lemon, if I trust the label) for a few months, and for the past two it has been looking weak and sick.  In particular, it's not making new leaves (although it did grow a little) and the three existing ones appear sick and dry, with spots on them (see picture). At first, there was also some web-looking white fluff on them, although it seems to have stopped (for a while, I assumed a spider was building its web on the sprout).     I have tried using water enriched with nutrients (this one) for the past month, but it did not seem to improve.   What should I do — any idea?  I can try to get better photos if these ones are of too poor quality: my cellphone is sort of a shame in that regard. "
3386,What are first steps for a novice gardener?,"After living most of my life in urban apartments, I bought a house in the suburbs and suddenly find myself with a lawn and garden to take care of. Apart from mowing, which I'm familiar with, I have no idea what to do. What should be, say, my first three actions in the yard?  Update: what's in the yard?   1 miniature Japanese maple (h == 18in) A few hostas Other, unidentified things (photos pending)  "
3387,Do we need to replace mulch with soil?,I am planning on planting vegetables and the old bed has decayed mulch which looks reddish and grounded. Do I need to dig out a few inches of this and replace it with soil? Is there a way to find out if this was organic or one of the treated mulches? This mulch was laid by previous owners so there's no way of knowing. 
3388,Should I clear rapacious vines from my garden?,"My back yard is edged on three sides with something that was probably intended as a garden, but is now just an overgrown mess, with, e.g., lots of vines ensnarling everything. In the photo below you can see some of what I'm talking about (the lighter green leaves are the vines):     What is the vine? Should I actually pull up all that stuff and let the intended plants breathe? Or does it create a healthy ecosystem or something to have all that stuff tangled up together?  "
3389,Steps to Follow for Fixing a Patchy and Weedy New Lawn Which was Planted over several times,"Trying to grow an organic lawn over the summer months in central CT but have achieved limited success.  Started 2.5 years ago by completely removing all existing weed and lawn. Put down lime and  topsoil then Safer Lawn Restore starter fertilizer and a quality seed mix from local gardening center. Watered several times a day to keep seed damp. Got patchy grass and with it crab grass and clover.  Started over again in some areas and have spent days hand picking out weeds and clover. Then reseeded and same problems again. How do I repair the patchy lawn and keep the weeds at bay. What sequence of steps should I follow? Fertilizer (type), seed, cover with straw or top soil?  "
3390,ZZ Plant Help Please,"I'm just getting started with indoor plants and heard the ZZ plant was easy and impossible to kill.  I thought it was doing alright, not overwatering etc. But there are some white spots on the leaves. They've been there since I bought it, and the shopkeeper said they were nothing to worry about.   Are they anything to be concerned about? How do I fix it?   "
3391,Fire Damaged Bay Tree (Laurus nobilis) - What to do?,"We have a fairly large (and old) bay tree in our garden by our garage, which I pruned back quite a ways last year (about ~1foot off all sides) as it had grown too large. The hope being that it would sprout back happily this year, which it has started too.  Unfortunately we recently had a fire in the garage (tumble dryer went up in flames, nobody hurt though!), the heat and flames from which have caused severe damage to one side of the tree as can be seen in the pictures below:    (click to enlarge pictures below):       I'm wondering what the best course of action is to try and help the tree recover.  As I say, I'd pruned it quite far back last year. There wasn't much foliage, so the fire has pretty much destroyed all the leaves on that side.  Should I just leave it and hope that it grows back? Should I prune off the dead leaves? If so, how far back would you recommend going?    Extra details as requested:  I'm in the UK, so currently its the middle of spring (May 22nd the fire happened). We live in Leeds (53.8 degree latitude) where it is typically a mixture of cool drizzly weather, and the occasional warm (23 *C) sunny day. Although we've been having a lot of sunny days over the last couple of weeks, so having to do a lot of watering.   The burnt side of the plant is the westward wide (the picture is taken facing the north-east).  The house is pretty near a very old sand-stone quarry, so the soil is full of sand. We have from time to time mixed in compost from our own heap (composted leaves, grass, and vegetable matter).  I know a little about pruning, but would definitely class myself as an amateur. I know the best way to prune varies from plant to plant.  I'll add a photo of the base and inside of the bay shortly. The base is quite a large trunk with some terracotta tiles around it, originally to stop gravel from washing away, but now just decorative. "
3392,Harvest garlic year round?,I'm hoping that using a Popsicle tray I can freeze 6 cloves of garlic and once removed transplant them into an indoor garden.   Would a fridge freezer be cold enough to trigger the budding process in garlic? If so how long would they need to stay in there for?   How large would the Popsicle cone need to be to accommodate the roots growth experienced during freezing?  If its dependent on the type of garlic please let me know the differences.  
3393,How do I dig up or get rid of bushes?,"I've got several large bushes I am trying to get rid of in my yard.  I started by cutting them down close to the ground, and then tried to kill the root stump with root killer (copper sulfate pentahydrate).  However, a few weeks later, instead of everything having died, new shoots are starting to grow!  So I tried digging a hole around a couple of these plants to get at the root bulb, but one of them appears to have a rather large root (2-3 inches in diameter) which goes straight down and then grows under a patio slab.  I think if I had some kind of tool that I could stick in the hole and cut through the root that might do it, but I don't have such a  tool and don't know what kind of tool I am looking for.  The other one I have tried is very difficult to dig around because the soil is full of rocks and roots from the bush.  I cannot use a shovel, because it hits both of these.  I have tried using a hoe or other similar digging tool to dig around but it is very slow and tiring and at the rate I am going I estimate would probably take at least 30 hours to finish, which at about one hour a week until I am worn out digging would take me months to finish.  Is there some kind of tool that I can use to effectively dig up or cut out the root ball?  Some other method I am missing?  I'm sure I could just call a landscaper and pay them a lot of money, but I would like to do it myself if possible.  What would they know that I don't?  Update: Well it was hard to pick from all the answers to choose an accepted one, but the answer suggesting the cutting mattock was the most help, and I found I already had one of those!   For the bush that was accessible I basically just chopped like crazy in a circle around the root ball until it was loose enough to pry from side to side to finish the job.  The mattock basically just pushed the rocks out of the way as it hit them. Along the way I also used a pruner to snip at the thinner roots that were exposed to conserve my swinging strength.  For the bushes against the slab I did not have room to swing the mattock, so I actually used a regular drill with a fresh 1/4"" bit.  First I drilled straight through the center of the root as far below the ball as I could access, then I drilled diagonally in through the same hole around 45 degrees on either side, then continued drilling at angles in between, and then into the same plane from a different angle outside the root.  When I had done this enough I was able to just snap the root in half and the ball came right out. "
3394,Identify caterpillar infestation on apple tree,"tl;dr; Found caterpillar nests. Should I keep them or destroy them?  I spotted three caterpillar nests(?) on my apple tree. The apple tree produces green eating apples (don't know what variety). There are three other apple trees of a different variety and a pear tree which haven't been infested.  Each nest seems to contain between 20-50 caterpillars. The caterpillars are about 2 inches (5cm) long. Some caterpillars are yellow with black markings. Others are grey with black markings. About 50% of them seem to be sleeping while the others are active during the day.  Each nest about the size of a tennis ball, made by wrapping silk around  large leaves. There appears to be a honey like secretion (seen in the first picture) on parts of the ""nest"". There are also lots of black flecks in the nest (approx 2mm in size), which I am guessing is the caterpillars/ excreta.  Question: Can someone identify the species of the caterpillar? Are they harmful to humans? If so, what is the best way to dispose of them? What is their impact on the ecosystem? If they are useful, I don't mind letting them develop into a moth/butterfly.  Location: London, United Kingdom.    "
3395,What does the USDA zone range mean?,"When buying plants I sometimes see info about the plants hardiness described as ""Hardy in zones 3-8"". From what I understand this means that the lowest temperature this plant can withstand is -40? But what about zone 8? Is that the highest temperature it prefers during winter? Or why doesn't the label just say ""Hardy from zone 3 and higher""?  "
3396,Is a screened in porch full sun or partial shade?,"Florida, Zone 9b.  I've got a lot of unused space around a screened in pool so I'm planning to do some container gardening.  Three walls and the roof of this area are window screen material held up by aluminum posts.  The area that I am planning to use gets about 10 hours of direct sunshine diminished only be the screen material and an occasional post shadow.    For the purposes of plant selection, should I consider this area full sun or partial shade?  Also, what if anything, can I do to minimize the affects of the chlorine vapors from the pool?  What flowering plants would thrive despite the presence of chlorine? "
3397,Concerns about my Euphorbia spiralis,"My Euphorbia spiralis family has done well, even though I didn't know until I read it recently that I should have separated the first baby (now a big toddler) when it was small. I have two concerns:  1. should I still try to separate the small one, or will it just grow like a Siamese twin at this point?  2. The mother has two more small babies (which I haven't yet separated). I examine my plants every day (ever since an Opuntia was done in by scale last year), and yesterday I found two very small cottony tufts on one of the babies. Mealybugs?? I removed them entirely and don't see anything else today--does anyone have some advice if I do see more signs of trouble?  I'd be so grateful for help! Also, can I snip off the dead ends of ""branches"" on the mother plant? "
3398,Do I have to line the bottom of my vegetable garden with a wire mesh,"I'm going to build the a box for my vegetable garden that has a 10"" riser with a 6"" bevel frame. The idea is this will stop mice from climbing up over the side.  I was at the store pricing out wire mesh to line the bottom to prevent the mice from digging up under it, but the mesh was very expensive.  Do you think a mesh is required? or is there another way to prevent mice from digging under the box?   "
3399,What is this plant and how can I best rescue it?,I was given this plant (the one in the square pot) about 15 years ago as a house warming gift.  At one point a leaf fell off which I snapped in two and left in the soil. It then grew into the plant in the circular pot.  I have no idea what it is though.  I’d like to rescue them both. They have become too tall and gangly for the pots they are in.  I am looking for advice on how to do this. I’ll be buying some pots tomorrow and want to be able to go with a bit more knowledge. Ideally I’d like to start again and have a small little houseplant again that isn’t over large for the pot.  I’m guessing I can take a leaf and grow from that (as I did before) but is there a better way? Taking a cutting from the green sprouts in the larger plant maybe?     
3400,Is it normal that african night crawlers are always on top of my compost bin?,I don't usually put scrap foods on top so I am curious why african night crawlers are always on top of my bin? Is it because there's a lack of oxygen on the bottom part of my bin? 
3401,"Maple tree, drooping leaves. Can I help it look Fuller?","Admittedly, I'm a new first time home owner. We have this maple in our front yard (Raleigh, NC). The leaves are droopy and it looks hollowed out in the center.  I've tried various watering, more water, less water....doesn't have much of an impact. I've given it a perticide/fertilizer combo that my neighbor recommended (she's got a beauty of a maple).  Would pruning the lower branches help at all? Any ideas?  Thanks! "
3402,How to recover a stressed hemlock?,"I have a well-established hemlock tree in my yard that has started producing large quantities of cones. This is apparently a result of it being ""stressed"" (according to a nursery worker and a tree-cutter). I have given it some tree spikes (fertilizer) in the beginning of spring for a couple years now, but it is still producing a prodigious quantity of cones.  How can I determine what is stressing it? How can I de-stress it?  Note this is in the pacific northwest, so it gets enough water. Also last year it had significant new growth--less so this year--so it does not seem to be dying. "
3403,Why do my Chili pepper's leaves curl,"I have been growing these plants for a while when suddenly their leaves started to curl up, slowly. Is this a sign of root rot? Should I replant with some perlite added?     It seems to be getting worse :/  "
3404,What is the name of this plant growing up in my Garden,I am wondering what kind of plant could be this?     It came up by itself. Is it useful to leave it in my Garden? 
3405,Should I repot my mammillaria cactus?,"I have this mammillaria hahniana:    I'm considering repotting to another container, which is more beautiful, more stable, wider and shallower. You don't see it but there is a drainage hole. Here it is:    My mammillaria is probably going to flower, as it grew some buds:      Considering the time of the year (spring is coming) and the size of the plant compared to its pot, would you repot it now? I'd like it to produce pups but I'm afraid the current pot is too small for that. Also, when I look under the pot, I can see roots going through the drainage holes. Do you think this bonsai container would be appropriate? Could the repotting prevent the cactus from flowering? Should I wait for the flowers to be gone?  "
3406,How can I keep broccoli flowers from forming the same day the bud appears?,"I'm growing purple broccoli, and the petals from the flower on top is forming the same day that it appears. How can I prevent this from happening so quickly?  It's forming white petals if you're curious about the color?  It's been in the 90s all week in MN USDA 4A. "
3407,What is this plant? Is it edible? Poisonous? Thank you,"I was in my garden when I noticed a weed that I’d never seen before. I looked on the internet and maybe it’s a nightshade??? The inside of the fruit had lots of tiny seeds that reminded me of pomegranate seeds. It has white flowers with five points that are yellow on the inside. Anyway, I hope someone can identify it. Thanks.   "
3408,Mower sounds like its struggling to cut?,"I mowed a lawn that had really thick tall grass my blades were already on the dull side, I hit a patch of grass and nearly stalled out my mower. I sharpened my blades, balanced them, cleaned under the deck, and cleaned the air filter. I mowed one lawn after that and it wasnt overly tall or wet and it sounded like it was clogging as if I were mowing really tall grass. It's time for an oil change and I'm gonna change the oil filter as well, but I doubt that's the problem. Could it be the belts? I only have 57 hours on it, it's an ariens ikonx 52. What all should I check for? "
3409,"What is this presumably parasitic plant in an Oak Hickory forest in Eastern Long Island, New York?","This small, skinny, plant was found at the Eastern end of Long Island, New York, USA. It was in an Oak Hickory forest.   I believe it's parasitic, meaning it has no chlorophyll and requires a host to reproduce.   Which species is this? Might it be some species of Orobanche?   "
3410,Zucchini skin disease (holes),"For several years now the zucchini in my amateur garden have always failed in the same way. The fruits start to grow but stay in an arrested development state (their size never goes beyond 12cm, the first photo below represents one of my largest ones) and their skin are punctured with small, superficial holes. The zucchinis also suffer from powdery mildew but that's harmless, right ? The garden is located in South France, in a place with plenty of sunshine and heat. Can anyone diagnose this or suggest anything ?  Update : since some answerers asked, to fertilize I used some horse manure that I buried before putting the plants (note that this is an organic farming question as indicated by the tag below).     "
3411,Particle board for hugelkultur?,"I'm tearing down a shed, and considering the painted particle board walls for putting at the bottom of some tall raised beds.  Is that a bad idea?  Can/should I use the other structural wood from the shed? "
3412,Does moss harm the tree it grows on?,"I have seen some trees with a thick layer of moss growing on their branches, does this harm the tree? Should this layer of moss be removed or can it safely be left on the tree? "
3413,Can I transplant a shade-growing lilac into a sunny spot?,"All of the lilac bushes I've ever grown have been in the sun. I assumed that was important for their survival.    When cleaning up the yard yesterday in preparation for spring planting, I found a lilac in an area that gets very little, if any, sun, especially on a regular basis. It's under large branches from a pine tree, and has some shade-loving plants and ground cover around the base.   The bush is healthy, and beginning to show buds, so obviously it's thriving. We don't need or want it in that spot though, as we can't see and enjoy it. Can I transplant it to a sunny area near our others, or does it need to be in the shade? Is it an anomaly, or are there shade-growing lilac varieties of which I was unaware?  "
3414,Chopping old vegetable/fruit to the ground as compost,"Sometimes I have vegetable/fruit that's gone bad and it's going to be thrown. I was thinking about chopping it and mix it with the ground of the plants I have (not so many).  Will it be helpful for the plant? What I was thinking is that I don't know how the rotting process of the vegetable/fruit will affect the plant, is it useful in the beginning of the rotting process, or only afterwards, as done with regular compost?  If it will, once in how long it will be good to add one? A few weeks?  (My plants are pretty small. They lay in pots by the window)  I leave in a small apartment so I don't have room for compost, and there's no place near me that collects it. "
3415,Are there concrete plant-watering schedules?,"I'm in the progress of making more of my house plants survive, better. (I'm doing OK, but too many of my plants die, or sometimes suddenly nearly die for mysterious (to me) reasons.)  I've started looking up a whole bunch of my plants, and while I found vague instructions (e.g. ""keep moist"" or ""water when the top 1in/2.5cm are dry""), but rarely anything specific (e.g. ""water every 5 days""). At the same time, there are very clear/specific instructions out there for fertilizing!  My plan right now is to create a list of the various watering rules, monitor each of my plants daily for a month or two, keep track of when I water them, and then build a ""static"" schedule (water plant A every 2 days, plant B every 7, plant C every 8) that I can set up as recurring reminders.  Is there a better way? Does everybody do this? "
3416,Will a 24W grow LED be sufficient for a 50cm x 15cm windowsill greenhouse?,"I've got a few 50cm x 15cm windowsill greenhouses. As sunlight at this time of year is sparse here in northern Europe, I'd like to provide a little more light to my plants (primarily tomatoes, peppers and the like).  Will a 24W LED from ebay be sufficient for a 50cm x 15cm windowsill greenhouse?  And a somewhat related question; how safe are these cheap LEDs from ebay? At first sight they generally seem to not be designed with safety as a primary concern. Wires seems to be exposed on surfaces which can be touched. Should that be a concern if I buy one of these LEDs? "
3417,Plant ID: Is this lemon balm?,I found this growing in one of my pots.  Does this look like lemon balm? The leaves impart a very lemony smell when you touch them.  I looked online but the veins on a lemon balm leaf looks more pronounced. Could it be because the plant in the photo is very young? 
3418,Did my aloes sunburn?,"Today has been the first sunny day in a long while, and some of my aloes sat in the sun of a south-facing windowsill for the first time. Two of them were in an office before, never getting direct sunlight.  When I came home, I noticed a new brown tinge had appeared, most pronounced at the base of their new leaves, and less elsewhere.  I learned recently that aloes need to acclimatise in order to stand full sun, but I wasn't expecting such a reaction on the first day.  My questions are:   Is the damage permanent? If not, where should I place them to make them recover, and for how long? What schedule should I follow to make them acclimatise to the windowsill?     Pictues below. The brown tinge looks much more pronounced to the naked eye than in the pictures.  The two plants on the right come from an office setting where they received dim indirect light, until I brought them home last week. Today was their first exposure to full sun. The pup is Aloe Variegata.    Detail of the browning:     "
3419,What's wrong with my house plant? (Chamaedorea),"I should start with the fact that I know next to nothing about plants and plant care, but I'm keen to learn and keep my plants alive!  I have two indoor palm type plants, one has been doing absolutely fine and is twice the size as when I bought it, the other though has just been slowly dieing over the time I've had it, which is probably about a year.  Here's a pic of when I got it:    And here's a sorry looking pic of it now:    I don't really know what's wrong or how to save it?  The care instructions said it doesn't like direct sunlight, so I keep it further in the room away from the window. I water it when the soil gets dry. It was a bit waterlogged at one point and I fixed that but not sure if that's what caused this. There was a lot of dead leaves so I removed them hence why its now much smaller. I've just noticed its a bit dry so will give it some water.  Hoping I can save what's left and bring it back to its former glory?  Edit: managed to find the store I bought it from to get the id, it's a ""Chamaedorea"" The Little Botanical "
3420,Tulips have small leaves and do not flower,"In my garden I preserve some ""wild"" tulips. I say ""wild"" because they were planted many years ago by some ancestor of mine, I believe around late 1700-beginning of 1800. They are of a quite raw quality, not as beautiful as modern hybrids. They have long leaves, very thin, like if they were made of paper, red flowers with cuspid-like petals, and they flower very early, about 1 month before the other tulips.  Here's a picture of them: [website]During time, they spread around all the garden. The point is that I notice that many of them are much smaller then usual and do NOT flower.  Is it a genetical issue (in what they have never been mixed)? Or just a question of exposure to the sun, soil, of some other kind of environmental condition (bulbs are very very deep in the ground, maybe more then 1 m: think that in the same place, my granmother used to work the ground to plant tomatoes, but bulbs were deeper!)? Or perhaps they just belong to joung generations?  In any case, is there a way to make them flower?  I already checked many questions, such as Should I keep tulip bulbs that didn&#39;t flower this year, or replace them with new? , but they seem not to exactly address my problem.  Thanks! "
3421,Mulching Build-Up Under Mower Deck,"Does anyone know of any attachments/accessories that could be attached to the mulching blades, that would remove the under deck mulch build-up as the blades turn???  Thanks in advance Ken S. "
3422,Do I need to mix rice husk and clay soil?,"Someone gave me 1 sack of rice husk and multiple sacks of clay soil. I've been thinking if just planting in a pure clay soil is enough or do I really need to mix it to rice husk?   If I need to mix it, what are the ratio? What are the cons and pros of mixing and not mixing it?   Right now I try to put pure clay soil and after watering my plant it looks like mud to me. "
3423,Is this heavy blue-green growth on my tree trunk and branches a form of lichen?,I have a tree with a fairly heavy growth across its trunk and branches; I suspect that it's a form of lichen but I'm not sure.    Is this something that will negatively affect the growth or health of this tree? Should I spray it down or leave it be? 
3424,Why is my chilli plant so leafy and small?,"I planted some Serranos back in mid may, and at first I thought everything was going great. But after a while they began to slow down and appear to have gone leafy. Friends have planted later than me and their plants have started fruiting already where mine is still quite small.  I was wondering if there is actually any wrong with it or am I over thinking.  For reference I repotted a couple weeks ago using an even mix of perlite and vermiculite. with this soil: [website]And I am using this light: [website]I have (up until the last few weeks) been feeding them weekly with Chilli Focus which I think could possibly be part of the problem as the soil comes pre-enriched with a 20:20:20 fertiliser.  Does anyone know if they're alright or should I change my setup?    "
3425,Will Porcini mushrooms grow under a maple tree?,I am considering growing some Porcini mushrooms (Boletus edulis) under a maple tree in my backyard.  The tree is ~10 years old and is very lush; so I imagine that at its base there might be enough shade for the Porcini to grow.  There is also a good layer of mulch at the base of the maple.  Will the Porcini form a symbiotic relationship with the maple?  What things can I do to enhance my chances of producing mushrooms and of helping out the maple? 
3426,Does Thai muskmelon (AKA Thai best or Tang Thai) do well in a dry climate?,"I read about a kind of melon called Thai best. I think it's popular in Thailand. Anyway, that's where it comes from. According to websites online, fruits mature extremely quickly (60 to 65 days after sowing).  My main concern about these, though, is that they might not do well in a dry climate (it is said to be great in hot, humid climates). I live in a dry climate (not Arizona dry, but dry).  Would these melons grow in a dry climate? Does anyone know the scientific name? I'm guessing it would be something like Cucumis melo 'Thai Long Muskmelon', but that might be another variety. They look like little long watermelons on the outside, with a light-colored flesh and seeds grouped somewhat like a cantaloupe in the inside.  I see it listed on several websites: evergreenseeds.com, seedman.com, lionseeds.com, ebay. "
3427,Should I be burning evergreen trimmings?,"I live in bucolic neighbourhood outside of town.  Around here, when we trim evergreens we make a fire and burn them.  It gives off a lot of smoke.  Is this the best approach to deal with these?  Should I store them until they're dry and then burn them?  Are these compost-able?  Nobody complains about the smoke, it just doesn't feel right. "
3428,Is my cactus okey?,This is my first time posting thing here n honestly the only reason I'm signing up on this website is to find out on what the hek is wrong with my cactus. So please??? I had been searching on Google about the condition of my cactus but I don't really know what to type since English is not my main language. Any suggestions or advice will do! 
3429,Should I prune the lower buds of my bare-root tree that's waking up?,"I planted a bare-root Gala apple tree last year, and it's waking up now and budding all over. However, a good number of the buds are close to the ground, and they're coming out along the entire length of the young trunk.  Should I prune the buds close to the ground to encourage growth at the top? Or will this stress the tree too much when it's just getting established?  For reference, the tree is planted in clay loam soil with a wide mulch basin in zone 7B in northern New Mexico, with spring conditions of 100% sun (all supplemental irrigation), 35-70f daily temperatures, and 10-50 MPH winds, so conditions are rather harsh.

3430,What vegetables could be planted in a limited balcony space in a subtropical environment?,"I am looking to develop and maintain a small vegetable plot on my unit's balcony, the space available is approximately 2m x 1m (6ft x 3ft).  Conditions:  Subtropical coastal mining-port town in Australia, my unit has a balcony with full sunlight from about midday to the evening.  The temperature ranges from low 20's Celsius (high 70's Fahrenheit) in winter up to mid 30's Celsius (mid 90's Fahrenheit) and extremes into the high 30's Celsius (100's Fahrenheit) are not unusual.  Rainfall is not particularly high, especially in winter as the wet season is in summer.  Storms are very rare here.  Maintenance  I work four jobs, so the garden will need to be as low maintenance as possible. I am able to water daily, early morning and evening.  Which vegetables could be planted on my balcony in these conditions?  After reading the questions and answers:   What herbs/vegetables/greens can be grown in a balcony garden with limited sunlight?, What vegetables can be grown effectively in a small, urban garden? and Balcony composting - suggestions for trapped rainwater,   I realise that my situation, while related, is different enough to warrant a separate question.

3431,Any reason not to make my own bark chips for orchids?,"Most orchids are grown in a mix that's primarily composed of bark chips.  Sometimes bark chips are also a component in soil mixes for other plants.  As I was stacking firewood, I realized I happen to have a fairly large supply of bark.  It tends to be from temperate forest trees - sometimes from pines, sometimes from hardwoods.  It breaks off fresh firewood all the time.  It's not rotten, since the trees have been recently felled.  Is there anything wrong with breaking up this bark, baking it to kill pathogens, and growing orchids in it?  Any potential hazards to making my own bark chips? "
3432,Cooked Bay Tree,I bought a small bay tree at lunchtime on a hot day and left it in my car until hometime. It got cooked with all the leaves pretty much dried out.  A friend told me I should take off most of the leaves so it could focus on feeding the remaining leaves. I did this.  I think what it was doing is growing the mini plants that were shooting out from the base because as soon as I stripped the leaves off the little plants started dying.  Now I basically just have two red shoots coming out of the soil at the base.  Have I completely killed the bay tree? Any advice please. Thanks.  EDIT: Added photos of the leaves and the little red shoot sprouting from the base.      EDIT2: As of this morning it really looks like the tree is pushing out those two red shoots at the expense of everything else. I guess I can try to grow two new trees from those.    EDIT 3: A follow-on question would be... how do I separate the two red shoots from the main plant? 
3433,What's the best way to deal with scale insects on Pieris Japonica?,"I have a heavy infestation of bark scale on 4 mature rhododendrons and 3 pieris japonica. I applied dormant oil to the rhododendrons yesterday and would like to do the same to the pieris.  However, the pieris is already in full flower - is it too late to apply a dormant oil?  I also have superior oil, would that be a better choice if the trees are already flowering? I live outside of New York City, zone 6b. "
3434,How do we deal with abnormally heavy rain?,"I just started gardening this year, and we've tried a few methods to see what works best, including a straw bale garden, compost bag gardens, and a tilled field.  Things were going great until about a week ago when the rain started.  Since then, it's rained every day and will continue raining for the next week.  With the rain and the clouds, my plants have slowed their growth.  In particular, my squash in the tilled field is stunted and yellowing and my tomatoes hardly seem to have grown at all.  The problems are the worst in the tilled field relative to the straw bales and the bags.  What should I do?  Do they need more nitrogen, or is it going to take a few sunny days to get back on track?  And is all hope lost at this point?  Will my plants recover when conditions improve or have I missed a vital growth period? "
3435,How can I make this succulent less splayed-out and lanky?,"1) I think this is a Sansevieria suffruticosa, but I'm just guessing based on internet pictures.  Does that seem right?    It made these flowers once,     and looks like this at the base.   2) It's grown extremely long and lanky-looking.  The leaves are >30 inches long, and sprawled and twisted all over the place.  Are they supposed to do this?  Should I have been pruning this in some way to prevent this from happening?  I've seen similar plants where the spines go straight up, but it doesn't look like mine would do that based on the way they fan out at the base.   "
3436,How Should I Take Care of These Two Phalaenopsis Orchids with Different Behaviors?,"I bought a pot of Phalaenopsis Orchid while its flower was almost dead a few months ago. Several weeks later I bought another pot with no flowers on it. I've been keeping both pots in the sitting room at a North-facing window with not a lot of sun, and appropriate humidity. The manual says to water once a week, I followed it when I first bought it, assing the orchid food drops into water, but as I live in a very humid area, I increased watering intervals to twice a month or so.  Question about pot #1:  The first pot's only flower fell off a couple of weeks ago, and afterwards started blooming/blossoming. It looks very fresh and happy and the flowers are coming, and there's a new step growing as well.    It's not growing vertically, so shall I hook it up to the support stand thing to keep it straight or is there a chance I may damage it?         Questions about pot #2:  The leaves of the second pot are getting more and more withered and one of them is turning yellow. The roots don't seem to be in a good condition, either. and the whole plant can come off easily from the pot, as if it's not well settled in it.    What should I do to maintain the roots and the flower's health?   I searched before posting, and I read the answer to this question: My orchid has one yellowing leaf. What&#39;s gone wrong? but I think mine is slightly different, as I have one other pot at the same condition doing pretty well.        P.S. Both pots are kept in the bigger ceramic/porcelain pots. "
3437,Will peach leaf curl affect my fruit?,"My peach trees have peach leaf curl. (Spring came too fast this year, I wasn't prepared, and I didn't get a chance to spray.)  They're still young/small trees (10' tall), but they've got a bit of fruit on them. Will peach leaf curl affect the fruit? Is there anything I can or should do to protect the fruit? "
3438,Are there any methods of fixing transplant shock?,"It's been 2 weeks since I transplanted my chilli seedlings:  Why have my chilli seedlings stopped growing?  They don't seem to have gotten over their transplant shock yet.  Googling seems to mostly mention methods of avoiding transplant shock. With the exception of watering your plant with a sugar solution[1] and providing extra nutrients.  Are there any other methods to speed up recovery?  [1] 1 tablespoon of sugar to 1 cup of water.  Update:  My chilli plants appear to be starting to do better now. I am not sure if doing nothing would have achieved the same result, but light fertilisation certainly did not have an adverse effect. "
3439,What should I do with organic waste?,"The hedge of my small garden is made of cherry laurel (prunus laurocerasus). I have to trim them every year as they increase their volume rapidly. This produces large amounts of organic waste and I don't really know what I should do with it. I don't like the idea of just getting rid of it, as I like to recycle what's in my garden. However, I guess compost is not an option. The leaves just dry out but they hardly decompose. They also contain toxic components that might be harmful for my compost. Is it a good idea to use them as mulch? Do you suggest a clever way to use all this organic matter? "
3440,Is this a aloe vera plant?,So I had this plant for around 1 year and lastly I was wondering if this is a Aloe vera plant? Kind of looks like it but I'm still unsure. If it's not that what is it?  
3441,What are these critters in my guava tree and do I need to get rid of them?,"I have a couple of guava trees that are starting to flower and while noting the flowers today I saw a number of very small, black bugs hanging out on some of the leaves and stems. They look like baby flies.     I noticed there are a few leaves that have been nibbled on by insects, but overall the tree is very healthy. Are these little guys responsible? If so, what steps can I take to reduce if not eradicate them? "
3442,How to properly pick worms?,"I am not sure if this will fit here or on lifehacks.SE.  I have an African night crawler escaping from my vermicompost bin and it's really hard to pick them up carefully without hurting them.   Things that I've tried so far:   Pick them using my hand - This takes a lot of time, specially if they are on the wet places. Use broom and dustpan to transfer them back to my bin - it seems that I'm still hurting them.   My question is how do I quickly transfer worms to my bin without hurting them? Is there a proper way to transfer them? "
3443,Hedge trimmer or pole trimmer for ivy overgrown in tree?,"What is the best to trim overgrowth of ivy out of a crepe myrtle tree, but just a few of the vines? I can use a ladder and get to trim the vine hanging in the area I want to trim out of the tree. What would be the best to use, a pole trimmer for trimming limbs or a hedge trimming to trim a bunch at one time? "
3444,Are cockroaches pests in the compost heap?,"I dug up my compost pile last weekend. it is made of aerated concrete blocks, just layed in a square, no cement. located on the rooftop of our 4 stories building, located in Hong Kong.  Beside the worms, BSF larvae, flies and other insects, I saw a lot of geckos and a nest of cockroaches.  In that specific environment, should I consider them as pest?  I have none in the house, in Hong Kong, cockroaches are extremely common and they are really located at the compost pile place only.   I believe they are helping the organic matter breaking down process, but is that true? do they come without side impact? "
3445,Trimming back a Meyer Lemon tree,"I have a Meyer Lemon tree that I brought inside for the winter and am now ready to bring outside. The problem is that there's no good place inside where it would get 100% sunlight, instead only part of the tree did. As a result one branch grew towards the light and is now longer than the tree is tall and is very straggly.  I want to trim it so the tree is uniform but was wondering if there's anything special I need to do when doing this? I've never trimmed it back before and want to make sure I don't do anything wrong that will kill it. Do I just take the clippers and snip it at the right place or is there more to it than that? "
3446,treating potato plant disease with ridomil,"Potatoes in our garden got attacked by a disease. Take a look:      Presumably, this is late blight. The recommended practice is to spray potatoes with ridomil fungicide. I am very skeptical about using it. Do you think this is the way to go? Are there alternatives? Potatoes were planted 50 days ago. I live is south central Europe.   PS: I've put freshly mowed grass in between some rows as a cover. Is this the reason for diseases eruption?   Also, the garden is tight packed with plants and the lettuce is just a few meters away from the potatoes which makes me want to use fungicide even less. "
3447,Are my orange tree's yellowing leaves a sign of underwatering?,I have a mature orange tree in my back yard and I've noticed that the lower leaves at the extremity of have started to to yellow over the last couple of months.  Is this a sign of overwatering? Underwatering? A lack of necessary nutrients? Something else? 
3448,Yellow spots on leaves of Oak,"I have an Oak (Quercus) in a container grown from seeds, must be 6-7 years old now. And every year it gets these yellow spots on the leaves. When I look under the leaves, I see tiny little red/brown dots, which are the suckers, but they are as small as grains of sand. I can't distinguish legs or body parts or anything. They are also too small for a photo, sorry I only have a camera in my phone.  Does anyone recognize these yellow spots, and know which animal are causing them? Are this Spidermites? I didn't see web yet. How can I treat them (preferably in an organic way), I have tried spraying diatomaceous earth but that did not work.  Maybe interesting, next to this plant is a horse-chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum), which has no signs from this pest (but will get a leaf miner problem later this year, I expect).  The plants are on a balcony (facing east) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.   "

3450,How far apart should I space Thuja 'Green Giant' evergreen trees?,"If I wanted to plant several Thuja plicata x standishii 'Green Giant', how far apart should they be placed, or does it matter?  Some evergreens seem to like being planted close together (and growing into each other), some seem to like being planted far apart and don't do well together, and some don't seem to care at all. With 'Green Giant', what is the best spacing? "
3451,Giant Sequoia Bonsai,"I'm attempting to grow some Sequoiadendron giganteum (Giant Sequoia) from seedlings I received from a friend. I plan to bonsai them, since i don't really have the need or space for a 300ft tree.  The 2 that had leaves were green and awesome when I got them. I put them under a 480 Lumen 5000k led lamp at about 3' above, and near a heat register. I gave them 12 hours of light, and they started dying. Obviously, they weren't happy.  I have 3: #1 is still sprouting and is difficult to judge, #2 has 4 leaves and is now mostly black in the stem and curled over, and #3 has 4 leaves which have browned a bit and the stem has a small amount of brown and curling towards the top. It has 4 new leaves that haven't turned brown yet, but the top is now at 90deg from vertical.  So, realizing there was obviously a problem, I started attempting to mitigate the situation with the following:  I've been keeping the soil moist (not wet) by misting, and have attempted to raise the humidity by setting the pot above a dish of water. It being winter, I knew this could be a problem, but didn't realize how dry it was.  For light, I'm using an 800 Lumen, 5000k led bulb sitting about 12 inches from the pot, that is timed to stay on 12 hours.  3 days, and I'm not seeing any improvement.  My question is: what am I doing wrong? Is there any saving any of these, or should I get some new ones?  Photos:      Thanks for the help. "
3452,Nesting box cleaning,"I was building a nesting box to encourage birds in my garden. It worked, a week ago a family of Blue Tit moved out after a stressful time. I'm curious so I got up to box to check what they left. I was surprised by the size of the nest and would like to know:  1) To raise the chance of having another couple doing their business inside this year do I need to clean or better leave as much as possible of the material inside and do the cleaning in late autumn (or early spring next year)?   2) As it can be seen below 3 eggs ""didn't work"". Is that normal for blue tits or this an indicator for a buggy box or place?  3) I hope GL.SE is the right place for asking this question?!    "
3453,"Why shouldn't squash, and potatoes be planted together?","I did a little research on growing squash with potatoes, and was wondering why they're not good for growing together.    Is this because they take up the same nutrients?  Or is because the squash will cover all of the ground for the potatoes to be dug up?   Any other reason? "
3454,How can I clean yard equipment that has come into contact with poison ivy?,"Yes. I took my weedeater through a patch of poison ivy. Yes. I am regretting it in a big way right now. A week later I re-infected my hand with it off the weedeater when changing the spool (Damnit!)  So what is a good way to clean off equipment that has the taint of poison ivy on it? I was thinking of just running a power washer over it, but I'm not sure that would be all that effective. Is there something I can soak the business end of it in to de-activate the oils from the poison ivy (urushiol)?  "
3455,What's the Minimum Space I Can Leave Between Flower Bulbs That I Want to Plant in a Planter Box?,"I've bought a pile of various tulip, hyacinth, narcis/daffodil, and iris bulbs and I want to plant them in in planter boxes and small pots if I can't fit them all in the box. The instructions on the packaging suggest 7, 10, and 15cm of space between the bulbs, but that doesn't work in a pot or box; this website however suggest planting them in clusters which I prefer more.   Is it ok to take the latter advice, or do they really need 7~15cm space in between to do well?   I live in Ireland which is pretty wet and humid, and the bulbs have already started sprouting outside the soil. I'm planning to keep the boxes out in the North facing balcony which will receive loads of rain depending on the weather!   Is this appropriate or shall I cover them to avoid receiving too much rain?  P.S. The bulbs I had taken out from pots last year were wrapped in brown papers sealed in a plastic bag left out in the balcony to get some cold, and I find out some mould on a few of the very tiny bulbs as they apparently have absorbed all the humidity even through the bag. "
3456,What triggers flowering for an overwintered chile pepper?,"I have a bhut jolokia that is now going on 7 years old.  Each year, I put it outside after last frost.  2-3 months later, I am able to harvest ripe peppers.  At the end of the season, I bring it back inside.  Typically there are only a couple of developing peppers at this point (maybe 2-3), as flowering and pepper production noticeably slows down towards the end of the season.  Once inside, it is placed near a large bay window, where it gets a fair amount of indirect sun.  The last few peppers ripen (usually), but any remaining flowers fall off.  I had always assumed that the duration of sunlight each day triggered flowering, but I've since read that photoperiod supposedly has no effect on peppers.  What causes my plant to start flowering again?  Is it possible to get it to flower inside during winter without a full indoor lighting system (i.e. can I use natural winter sunlight, possibly supplemented with one or two LED or other inexpensive grow lights)? "
3457,Aquaponic ph level for different plants,"I'm wondering how much does water ph level matter for plant healthy growth as an aquaponic system would presumably have one ph level for all growing plants and as far as I understand and find on the Internet, different plants have different preferences for their root environment ph levels.   So, how does having a ""flat"" ph level for all growing plants impact their growth and health?  Does it make sense to create separate aquaponic systems and organize them by growing plants ph requirements?  Thank you in advance! "
3458,Red Amaranth in rainy season,  I had sown a few Amaranth seeds in summer whose seedlings got eaten away by birds. Now some new ones have sprouted up but this is rainy season. Will this grow well in this season? I live in area marked as zone 9 in this link:  [website]
3459,What can I do to stop my Avocado from losing leaves?,"My Avocado plant's leaves are all turning brown from the tips and a good amount has fallen off. The browning has been progressing throughout the winter (and maybe also before that). I usually water it when the soil is (almost) completely dry, but the dirt is a few years old and quite compacted now (is that bad?). Some new (and fully green) leaves have formed in the last few weeks (the sun is shining more now). I also fertilised it with a more or less appropriate long-term fertiliser about two months ago. As you can see, it lives inside and in a probably too small pot, but it's about 2m tall now.  What caused this? What can I do to prevent the new leaves from turning brown too?    "
3460,Growing Epipremnum aureum stem roots on potted plant,"I have an Epipremnum aureum (once rooted from a cutting) in a soil pot. It took some time, but then it grew at an incredible rate, with a thick stem (fingerbreadth) and large leaves.  On the other side, where it’s stuck in the soil, it’s decreasing in diameter (width like a slim pencil), and leaves are withering now for some time.  It’s healthy, bushy and leafy on one side, and waning on its only access to the ground. I don’t want to cut it in pieces just yet. I’d rather preserve its tiny canopy.   Can I do anything to improve the stem’s health and thickness near the ground level? Can I safely grow roots along the shoot parts (like covering it with soil to let it take root)?   I’m afraid growing roots along the stem will confuse growth and water transport. Here’s a picture:   ﾠ  ﾠ       EDIT: I knew about layering below the ground, but I never heard of marcotting (a form of air layering). I didn’t cut the “bark” of the stem and—since I don’t have any Sphagnum handy—strapped some earthy garden moss around three clusters of nodes (here the stem gets thicker again). This surely isn’t optimal, but I’ll keep it moist and see if it takes root.   "
3461,How to maintain indoor Polyscias fruticosa,"I have a little plant of Polyscias fruticosa in my living-room. It is about 1 m tall and more then 10 years old. It is not exposed to direct light.  Last year it started to look a bit painful and, indeed, its root were starting to rot. I changed its soil, adding some sand to it, to drain water.  After one year, it is still alive, but still very painful: very few leaves, not of that usual, beautiful, dark green color. Also, since some years, it is not flowering. It also used to have a strong scence of liquorice, that now is almost unnoticeable (I must admit that this last consideration could be just an impression).  Any suggestions to make it feel better?  Note: I already checked a similar questions (e.g.: What kind of tree is this? ) about Polyscias fruticosa, but replies to it do not actually address my problem.  Thanks! "
3462,Do perennials need to be split?,"This Old House recently published an article about splitting overgrown perennials.  They suggest doing so every three to six years--however, I have a large bed of daylilies, and it's hard for me to imagine how they'd be considered ""overgrown.""   Is this a necessity for the plant, or is it just a cosmetic issue?  And if cosmetic, I assume this only applies to small plantings, not an entire bed?  It would be helpful to see an example of what people consider ""overgrown"" to look like vs. a more desirable appearance. "
3463,Can maincrop potatoes grow in soil-less environment?,I've searched the Internet for answers but cannot seem to find anything about maincrop potatoes being grown in soil-less environment. Do any of you have any experience or knowledge on the subject?   My idea is to grow potatoes in 3 stages in aeroponic/aquaponic systems (depending on viability):    Incubator for small plants ready to become cuttings Suspended aeroponic system for maximum yield of seed potatoes Suspended aeroponic system for growing the seed potatoes to mature potatoes.    Has anyone tried growing maincrop or mature potatoes in aeroponics system? Or in aquaponic?   Please share your thoughts! 
3464,Why did my Crassula Ovata sprout a new plant from the middle of the leaf?,Check out what I found on my Carssula Ovata this morning:    And the back side:    The leaf looks dry/dead because the plant suffered a severe burn from staying in a closed greenhouse in early spring (about 5 months ago).  I guess the new plant sprouted in the middle of the leaf due to some interesting process related to the tissue damage. Have you ever seen anything like that? How is it even possible? 
3465,Only top leaves left on Euphorbia pulcherrima,"Most leaves on my Euphorbia pulcherrima falled down, there are only left on the top of plant. It now looks a bit odd     I'd like to ask what to do with it. Can I cut the top (will the top grow if I plant it?)? If I can cut it, where / when? Thank you for your help. "
3466,What sort of pots are used in the pot-in-pot method?,"The pot-in-pot method of growing uses a production pot inside another pot which is in ground.  This allows you to swap pots easily, and some 20 good reasons why this might be a good idea are listed here.  One other reason I came across was that if you had one production pot sitting on say 4 inches of soil in the ground pot, the latter would reduce perching of water in the production pot improving the aeration of the roots.    I can see this being useful for me as plants wouldn't get blown over in the wind, and watering would be easier if I had frost tender plants in the garden with the rest of the plants. And then I can pull them out for over wintering inside the house, and replace with a winter plant.  So, are there any particular characteristics of the pots that are needed for this to work?  Obviously both pots need to drain, be light weight, durable, and you need a light growing medium.  Anything else?   "
3467,"Thuja green giants, one dead another on the way out","I planted 6 5ft green giants from fastgrowingtrees.com back in May.   They took well until recent. The farthest right is clearly not coming back. But the 3rd from left is starting to look like it's dying as well. What can I do?

3468,How can I clean up my lawn from weeds? What kind of weed is this?,"I recently purchased a house last year, and am noticing that most of the lawn is weeds. There are a variety of different looking ones, but there is one type that is all over my lawn, probably taking up about 60-70% of it. Can someone tell me what I can use (hopefully safe for grass/lawn since it is everywhere)? I attached a photo below. I've tried BioAdvanced All-in-One Lawn Weed &amp; Crabgrass Killer, but I do not think that is working unless I am possibly not spraying enough on?  Description of first photo: bottom of the picture is basically the same picture I took in the beginning. It is the the beginning of this weed growing in the grass, at the same height as my grass. Top of the picture is the edge of my property going into the woods, this looks like same weed, but obviously in a much more mature grown state since I don't mow that area.  Description of second photo: I tried to pull out just one long strand of the mature grown weed.  Description of third weed: close up of roots.  Description of fourth weed: original picture of weed in my lawn.       "
3469,"Leeks, how long from flower to dry seed?","I left some leeks in the ground from last year, and they shot up to form a bulb in December. They flowered shortly afterwards at a height of about 6 feet. I expected the seeds to be ready for planting this year but it's already into autumn and the seeds don't look ready. I've examined a few and they are still green.  Does anyone know how long I need to wait for the seeds to go black? And can I cut the flowers off and let the seeds harden off the plant, or do I need to leave them on?   "
3470,Chuck the plant - am I ill?,"My name's Chuck, and I'm a plant.     Bamboo tells me I'm a Sansevieria trifasciata laurentii, also known as ""Mother in Law's Tongue"" or ""Snake Plant"" (see other question here).   I live indoor with my human flatmate.   I think I may have some health trouble.   The ends of my leaves are turning brown, and so does the whole leaf on occasion (there's one in the picture).   I also noticed my roots are kind of sticking out of the pot a bit...  I am exposed to only electrical light, and average apartment temperature.   There's no way for me to go play outside, as it's freezing and raining all the time out there.    Questions   Is the human not giving me enough water, or maybe too much? Should he move me to a larger pot or am I ok as is? Are my looks ok, considering I'm indoors all the time? When one of my leaves turns entirely brown, should the human cut it out or just leave it there?  "
3471,What trees would be good along a boundary wall and avenue in India?,"I am from the eastern part of India i.e. Ranchi (Jharkhand ). Can anyone recommend some trees I can plant along the boundary wall of a school campus? They should provide good shade, temperature reduction, noise reduction and be fast growing.  We also have a 25 feet wide and 1000 feet long straight road in the campus which can be developed as a beautiful avenue.  What about malia dubai, spathodea, tecoma and tabebuia rosea? Can they serve my purpose? "
3472,Intercropping garlic with white mustard and carrots,"The word around local farmers is to grow white mustard in the soil you plan to grow garlic next year. Presumably, it reduce the amount of white rot (Sclerotium cepivorum).   Does it make sense to intercrop garlic with white mustard? I am thinking of planting 3 rows of garlic, 1 row of white mustards. What is the ideal ratio? I'd love to hear some of your experience.   White mustard  Similarly, a legend says intercropping garlic with carrots repels onion/garlic fly. I am thinking of the same regime as with white mustard. 3 rows of garlic, 1 row of carrot. What is your experience with intercropping garlic with carrots or in general with intercropping? "
3473,When should I move a tulip plant from a pot to the ground?,"I'm in western NY in the US and I have a potted tulip plant. When can I move it to the ground? After the last frost of the season? I usually see planted tulip plants start to pop up in March, bloom before April, and the flowers are gone before May, but these came from the store. I don't want them to die when I plant them. "
3474,Moldy rubber tree plant,"I live in Austin, TX. I have a rubber tree plant that's about five years old. It's not in good shape and I'm having trouble getting it healthy again. A few years back I overwatered it and the whole plant turned very droopy. Since then it's been a battle to try to get it back to normal.     Almost all the leaves have fallen off the two larger branches. There is new growth but they aren't making it very far before falling off as well.  I have it in a pot with a high drainage soil (Miracle Gro garden soil for cactus, palm, and citrus) but the soil seems to get moldy easily. I've transferred the plant to a different pot and changed out all the soil twice now. Both times the soil had a bit of white powder in it.  The plant bounced back pretty well both times and started growing new leaves. However, both times after the one or two waterings it started getting droopy again and the leaves started turning yellow and dropping off. At this point it's losing a leave or two every day.    These days, I only water it once about ever three weeks with a fairly conservative amount of water. When I do this the leaves immediately start to drop off. The pot has a drainage hole at the bottom.  I can try transferring it again but I don't know how to stop the mold from coming back.  Do I need to use a new soil? New pot? Why is the plant so sensitive to water? "

3476,Ground cover - maximizing value,"I planted some fava beans a few months back as cover crop in my vegetable raised bed. They grew very well and as suggested my members of this group, I cut the top part and left the roots inside to provide nitrogen. I am wondering what to do with the top part. I think the recommendation is to bury that I the soil and it provides additional nutrients. Do I have to bury those ASAP or after it dries up?  Also, how deep do I bury it and can I bury it next to the roots itself(between the rows I planted)?   "
3477,How to get a Kalanchoe to flower in bunch,"I have two questions regarding Kalanchoes.   I bought 3 Kalanchoes from IKEA for almost one year. The funny thing is that one of them has lots of flowers, the second one, only one flower, and the third one NONE ! Although they have received the same treatment and sit at the same window. Can anyone tell why are they having different flowering intensity ? Because they got too big, I pruned them for two weeks and propagated the cuttings. The cuttings have grown now some roots, so i now moved them to normal potting soil (The first one had rooting hormone). My question is, when and how can I get them to flower? Should i fertilize them? how to get the maximum of the flowers such as in the nursery where we see a bunch of flowers in the middle and the leaves all around?  "
3478,Transplanting Alocasia Odora Elephant Ears,"Alocasia Odora elephant ears can form giant log/snake-like stems (link kindly provided by Colin Beckingham, thanks M8), often fallen over due to gravity.  Does anyone have experience with Alocasia Odora and know if I can cut that stem close to the ground or even midway to transplant? Will it form new roots, or will the whole plant just die?  I ask because the Odoras I want to transplant are growing on a concrete covered hill, so I can't dig down to the root ball.  "
3479,What should I do with unplanted narcissus/daffodil onions outside of planting season?,"I have 4-5 ""new"" narcissus onions on hand, but the planting season is over now (beginning of March). They should be sprouting now.  Here is the exact variety.  What should I do with them?    Will I confuse their cycles if I plant them now, so should I somehow safekeep them?  Should I just plant them now and they'll do whatever they do and be fine until next sprouting season?  If I should avoid planting them now, what is the best way to safekeep a narcissus for at least 6 months?  "
3480,Is it best to wait for poison ivy to fully sprout leaves before spraying it?,"I have a fair amount of poison ivy growing on one part of my fence.  Now that spring is here, it's just barely started to grow again, and buds that will turn into the dreaded leaves have began to appear (note the slightly lighter colored growth along parts of the darker core of the plant):    Can I go ahead and start spraying it with poison ivy killer now, or is it only really effective once the leaves have fully appeared first?  Or perhaps is it better to simply use poison ivy spray directly where the vine originates from the ground, meaning I can start now and do it repeatedly? "

3482,"Can I add soil to strawberries, creating a raised bed?","I'm moving into a new house that has a good sized strawberry patch on one of the corners of the lawn. I want to build a large raised bed for it and help it spread out more. If I build the border of the bed, and just gradually fill it in with soil, will strawberries be able to handle that? If so, how quickly can I fill it up and when would be the best time to do this? Is there anything I should avoid?  Also, is there a term for this? ""raised bed"" seems to only refer to a structure built before plants are planted, which makes sense. "
3483,Sweet basil: Are dark green and slightly smaller leaves better?,"I planted some sweet basil seedlings into two different long planter pots and they come from the same batch of seedlings. They are at the same location and get the same amount of sunlight and water.  However, the soil in the pots is slightly different as I used different soil mixes. In one of them, the sweet basil plants are lush and the leaves are darker green but slightly smaller. In the other one, all the plants are a lighter shade of green though the leaves are a bit larger. I suspect this pot is lacking certain nutrients.  Is that correct? What should I add to it to make it healthier?  EDIT: Added the photo below. It doesn't seem that obvious from close but from afar the leaves on the left are noticeably darker and smaller.   "
3484,Can a Maple tree be pruned to grow tall and narrow?,"I have a maple tree that's poorly placed. Maples grow too wide and it's starting to crowd the house and other plants. A tree that grows tall and narrow would have been a better choice.  But before I spend the time and money moving it or tearing it out, I want to investigate if it's possible to prune it so that it grows a little taller and a little narrower.   Here's a picture of the tree:    I'd like to prune it so that all the limbs under the red lines are removed:       Will the tree still grow decently if I do this? As a follow up question, can a Maple tree this large be transplanted successfully?  "

3486,Performance of a bamboo (Phyllostachys) hedge in South-West UK,"I am considering a bamboo hedge. I want something with substantial culms, so Phyllostachys sp. and I would like them to stay green. I really like P. glauca. P. bissettii and P. vivax also look good.  I'm based on the southern edge of the Cotswolds, England, so it'll be exposed to mild, wet but blustery south-westerly weather. We get some frosts, but temps rarely drop below -5&deg;C. Soil is free draining, over limestone. Beautiful texture, low in nutrients.  How would a bamboo hedge perform? What sorts of heights can I expect and what time for establishment? How would it look in winter? I am aware of the need for root barriers but depths, spacings and planting tips welcome. "
3487,Can I grow a cherry tree from seed without stratification?,"I'm going to grow a cherry tree from a seed. It's not that easy though and I need some time and patience. I have experience with pine tree and orange, though these are quite easy trees to grow compared to cherry and maple.  At the same time I saw some guys in a YouTube video who advised removing the seed shell for lemon seed to improve germination. They say it works very well and normally you will have at least 4 of 5 seeds germinated.  With cherry it's a bit more complicated. Normally seeds need stratification. Is it acceptable to treat cherry seeds in this way at all or it will just destroy it? If I remove the shell, do I need to stratify it or can I simply put it in moist and wait? "
3488,How do I grow primitive plants in Water Gels?,"I have fern and horsetail spores. I have some Water Gels too. Can I grow fern and horsetails in Water Gels in a dry climate (not too dry, kind of moderate weather)?  Do I need a special fertilizer or anything? (Can I grow these out of spores?) "
3489,Is it beneficial to put plastic or landscaping fabric under mulch?,I am planning on completely re-doing the landscaping around my house and I would like to replace the rock pebbles with mulch.

I'm guessing a bird left a seed but honestly, I don't water there yet it just keeps growing. Is this some sort of succulent or just a weed? You'll help settle a family bet. :) I'm in central California, zone 9. Thanks! (I hope the pics attached!)    "
3492,Can all plants grow inside all year round?,"I live in an apartment and both the entire south-east and the north-west sides are huge windows, so I have lots of light coming in (I think I have about 6h 40m on the shortest day of the year).  I thought that annual plants could only grow from spring to fall and that's it, but then I realised that I've only ever had a garden outside at the farm where I grew up. Is it possible to grow plants all year around indoors? I mean, most plants should do ok with 6 hours of light and the temperature is always around 18-22*C. And for the darkest months, I could probably figure out something with a grow light if needed as well.  I've been waiting for spring to come around since I moved in 6 months ago, eager to plant something delicious, but now I realise that maybe I didn't need to wait at all! (ok, I do also have big plants for the balconies which is currently covered in snow so that'll definitely have to wait!) So can all plants grow inside all year round, and if not, why?   In response to a request to be more specific, these are the seeds I have: Strawberries (Temptation and Wild), Tomatoes (Harbinger, Tumbling Tom and Sweet Pea Currant), Cucamelon, Baby carrots, Runner Bean, Snap peas, New Zealand Spinach, Spring Onion, Sweet Pepper, Jalapenos, Chives, Dill, Coriander, Parsley, Basil, English Thyme, Rosemary, Oregano, Sage, Spearmint, Peppermint, Marigold and Pansies. I already have a small lemon which is about a year old, a ginger which has just started to sprout and I'd like to also have some blueberries, raspberries or similar. "
3493,How long to use mulch when establishing a tree?,"I'm using mulch on my trees and shrubs here in upper SC. We have heavy clay soils. I've been putting mulch around all the trees and shrubs I plant, but I feel like some of them don't need it anymore or at least there is a point when the benefit doesn't out weigh any expense or effort.   For instance, we planted a maple tree in the yard. There aren't any flowers or berries that need the extra moisture retention and I'm sure after the 3-4 years it's been since I planted it, the roots have grown deeper and wider than the one bag of mulch I put on it can cover. I feel like I'm wasting my time and effort. Like it's only there to prevent someone from hitting the trunk with the mower. The same thing goes with my crepe myrtles. I feel like they're starting to get big enough that my bag of fertilizer isn't doing what it once was.  Other of my plants, I'll probably continue mulching because I feel it helps with flowering or fruiting. For instance, my azaleas, small magnolias, flowering cherry, figs, blueberries, etc... However, I just planted some pecan trees and I feel like once they get big enough, it's no longer helping enough to justify buying it and putting it out.  Occasionally, they have a good deal around here with Homedepot putting it on sale at 5 bags for $10, so it's not that expensive, but at current count, I'm taking care of 28 trees, shrubs, etc... It'll add up. Not to mention me having to lug them around and put them out.  So what do you guys think? Is there a certain point where it's no longer helpful to mulch? Like if they get over a certain size or if they've been planted a couple of years and you're not trying to get fruit off of them. Thanks for the help. I'm in Zone 8A. "
3494,Disease / pest identification,"What could have caused the damage in some of the leafs of this pothos? Fungus? Drought? Pest?   Factors:   It appeared suddenly, at the end of winter time, beginning of spring It is an indoor plant, and the windows have been closed for several months, since it is winter. It is not over a heating vent It is not directly exposed to sunlight It has not been treated with any chemical There was a plant in the same room infested with white flies (removed now), but there are no signs of white flies in this plant. There was a plant in the same room infested with fruit flies (removed now), but there are no signs of fruit flies in this plant. Not all the leafs are affected, only 5% of them. And not even in the same stem. A sister plant that lives besides this one has started to show the same damage (three leafs). Notice the row of little holes in one of them. I could not see any pest or eggs on the backside of the leafs, using a magnifier.   Thanks in advance!      "
3495,Tomatoes seem to be stagnating?,"I planted 4 tomato plants later in the season (mid June?).  I have a 12"" raised bed with good soil in it and they get about 10 hours of direct sunlight every day.  I water them every other day with about half a gallon of water on each plant through a drip system.  Usually by the end of the second day they are starting to droop a little and the soil is pretty dried out.  All of the plants have multiple green tomatoes on them but it seems like they have stopped developing for the last few weeks.  Minor changes in size and almost no change in color.  About a week ago I tried fertilizing with some 4-6-3 fertilizer after talking to my local nursery but haven't seen any drastic changes.  Based on what I have said above - am I doing anything wrong or is this a normal part of the process? Should I use more of my Fertilizer?   Fertilizer details:  I used the ""Fertilizer Tea"" method from the bag so I took a cup of fertilizer and mixed it with a gallon of water and split that between two plants.  Below are some pictures of the fertilizer I used and the instructions that came on the bag:     "

I am planning to use a mix of chicken manure and horse manure.  Do I need to add anything else? What proportion of each should I use?  Do I just spread it around the tree base or do I have to dig soil around the main step?  My concern around digging the soil is potentially damaging the roots. "
3497,What are the health concerns of burning with motor oil?,"I know someone who insists on using new, unused motor oil to burn garden waste (in a garden area). Somehow, I'm pretty sure this can be bad for the garden and/or people's health who eat the stuff grown in the garden.  Can you please tell me what, if anything, is wrong with this (besides risk of burns and fire spreading)?  Also, can you tell me healthy alternatives that I can suggest that would work just as well? (If unused motor oil indeed makes the ashes unhealthy for the garden, I mean.) "

3499,How to deal with water pooling on lawn,"I have 3 areas on my lawn where water pools when it rains. My soil is clay and the water takes a long time to be absorbed into the ground.  One of these area is bordered by a planting bed and patio, preventing the water from running off.  The other areas are shallower and I noticed that the grass is less strong there. Maybe because of the pooling, or is the pooling because of lack of grass?  Here is a photo taken in the early spring before the lawn has had a chance to start growing again (in summer it's greener).   ?  This was taken about 2 hours after it stopped raining. During the rain the area was bigger.  What should I do to lessen/solve this problem? Are there alternatives to re-levelling large portions of my lawn (even if they are less efficient)  I'm in zone 4/5 if that matters. "

The first 2 were red. The next 5 are oranga and 1 is purple. Granted that's only half cuz half haven't bloomed yet and I do like the orange but I wanted the array of colprs. Disappointed to say the least. Hoping the other half will be different colors. Could this be something I'm doing wrong? Or is it just the luck of the draw with the aassortment kind? Or maybe the company that sells them have more oranmore I'm not sure. Thanks to any input!  "

3502,What should I consider when planting fruit trees in a windy field?,"I'm working with my campus garden and we're thinking of putting fruit trees next to our garden as an excellent addition to our repertoire of fruits and vegetables. However, as the garden is in Buffalo in a field that is very well know for being in an open (wind-swept Hoth-like hellscape of a) field. Usually it pretty windy, and in the winter it's snowy and pretty cold.  What kind of considerations should go into choosing fruit trees for a colder, open field? Are there ways that the trees may suffer that we should consider? "
3503,"Mushrooms sprouting for the first time, should I gather them or let them be?","In the spring I ""sow"" some mushrooms in a shady part of my garden - Blewitt (Lepista nuda), Wine Cap (Stropharia rugosoannulata) and Elm Mushroom (Hypsizygus ulmarius).  The mushroom spawn I sow came in the form of mycelium sprinkled on various kinds of seeds (at least looked like this). I prepared the mushroom beds as a mixture of straw, sow dust and autumn leaves depending on the requirements of the different species.  Yesterday I noticed that some mushrooms have just sprouted.  I would like to have the sown mushrooms as a permanent addition to my garden, so I am wondering whether to gather the mushrooms or let them get big and hopefully spread through the whole mushroom bed. If I am to gather them, should I cut the mushrooms, or twist them?  I live in zone 6.    EDIT: After letting the mushrooms get big enough, I realized they are none of the species I have bought, so I am not eating them. Nevertheless, when hopefully I get sprouts of let's say Garden Giant, what would you suggest doing with the first crop? "

3507,"Strange Mutation in Toadflax: what is the reason, and is this normal?","[ Location: UK - fully organic wildflower garden ]  The mutation shown in the photographs happened this year to one of my Toadflax. I thought at first that it may have been the result of the plant growing around a rock, but then the same happened to several others.  The plant stalks are supposed to be thin and rounded, - the strap-like stalk on this plant is around 10x the usual width but with the usual thickness.  As can be seen in the photographs, it does not prevent the plant from growing or flowering, and there is no die-back, rot, mould, or signs of insect infestation; so I am thinking that it could be a mutation. Does anyone here have any ideas or input on this?    Fasciation then, or dare I say fascinating? - Thanks for both answers, - this is what I love about gardening: no end of chaos, weirdness, beauty ...and many strange critters (gardener excluded). "

And describe what will they look like when they get very big. Because I wonder what will these two plants look like when they get big?   The left one's stem is some kind of softer and much greener than the right The right one's stem is much harder-branched but smaller than the left They are seperates, their roots are different (not together) The left plant don't have a bunch of thin hair-spreading-like roots coming out from the single stem underneath but its roots are looking like it's sliding right following some long thin-like rounded knuckle which has a dark-brown spot at its bottom end that are not sending thin hairy roots from beneath it, or maybe it will in the future?

3510,Good groundcover for bonsai,"What type of plants are good ground cover for bonsai?  When I first started growing bonsai, I only used a fine gravel for ground cover, but this looked very boring and artificial. Then I tried moss, since it has no roots to compete with the bonsai, but it typically required much more water than the bonsai preferred.  I'm now using various species of Sedum, a small low-growing creeping succulent. It thrives in nearly all types of climates, sun exposure, and watering routines, so I'd have trouble killing it even if I wanted to. My only concern is with how much its root system will compete with the bonsai.  Has anyone had success with other plants? "

Specifically, I have the straight species of Syringa vulgaris, and each year it produces a few seed capsules in the flowerheads. I assume I'd harvest the seeds when the cases split, but I am unclear on the further needs of the seeds, such as stratification, and if necessary, which type.   How are they stored, what are their requirements for good germination, and do they benefit from bottom heat when germinating? "
3514,Are my autumn blaze maple trees dying?,"We live in Oklahoma and planted some autumn blaze maple trees last fall.  They seemed to come out of dormancy fine and the leaves were nice and green.  We planted them in an area that stays pretty soaked most of the time, and I'm wondering if that's why the leaves are starting to turn red.  Is the leaves turning red a sign of over watering, or could it be some other problem I need to deal with?  Below are some pics:        UPDATE: I think I might have multiple problems.  I dug a small hole around the tree and the entire soil profile resembled loose mud.  The hole quickly filled up with water.  Also, for two of these trees, the tree can easily be moved around in the soil (you can see the root ball moving back and forth).  I think I've seen this mentioned as a crowbar problem.  I went ahead and staked the trees to prevent them from coming all the way out of the ground.  Are these trees just doomed if they live in such a wet area? "

The problem is, they've essentially ""boxed off"" a big section of yard to where if I'm going to get at least 50% of my house covered by sprinklers I'd have to go over at least one utility line.  I figure maybe there's a few options:   Dig really carefully (I'll resort to my kid's Sand Shovel if needed)?  One of the lines is a telephone line so I figure if I break the line the electric shock wouldn't be too great. Ask someone about relocating a line? Maybe go topside for a stretch over the line in question? One side of the ""box"" is the property line, I could ask my neighbor about a tresspass to circle around the utilities, don't know about the legal issues there.   Other ideas? "

I don't know if that might not even be it. I'm in Indonesia. The temperature during the day is always around 30+ and I keep them in full sunlight. The soil is compost/black soil. I haven't gotten around to adding something more porous though I mean to soon. I water them every 1-2 days with half a cup of water direct to the soil around them mostly at night, sometimes early morning. Should I buy neem oil?

3522,Crab grass along margins of lawn,"My lawn is very healthy and happy, but all around the paved margins of the lawn crab grass is growing. The crab grass does not grow where the lawn abuts unpaved ground. For example, where there are mulched areas or wooded areas or forested areas, there is no crab grass. It is only where the grass meets asphalt or brick pavers in the walkway. The crab grass is much more prevalent along the asphalt than the brick walkway. Along the walkway there is only a crab grass plant here or there, but along the asphalt it is solid crabgrass.  The soil is marine clay (leda) and climate is New England coastal.  Why is crab grass growing in these margins and how can I get rid of it and get lawn right up to the asphalt?  Is the asphalt poisoning the lawn? Do I need to put some kind of buffer there like brick pavers along the asphalt?  "

At which point in the ripening of the fruit are strawberry seeds ready to be harvested, and how are they removed and cleaned? Do they need cold-stratification? How long do they store under good conditions? I assume berries picked green (such as many found in the grocery store) will have under-developed seeds, and poor germination.

How deep should they be planted? What is the best temperature for germination? should they be germinated in the dark or under lighting? How long until they germinate? How long under optimal conditions should I expect to reach the three-leaf stage?  
3525,Ground cherry problem,"I'm having a weird problem with almost all of my ground cherry plants. The berry, while still on the plant, ends up poking through the paper. it's hard to describe but it's like the paper doesn't grow with the berry and the berry just pokes through the end. Has anybody else had this happen? Any suggestion? "
3526,"Can I grow pineapple plants from seed, rather than crowns?","The other day, as I was eating pineapple, I noticed that it was full of seeds (see pic below for what they look like). I have grown plants from the crowns on top of the fruit (even a couple patented ones that were mutated to prevent propagation - don't tell anyone :P), but I'm actually interested in starting seeds.    What's the most efficient way to remove them from the fruits? Do they require special cleaning (I wonder because of the enzyme content of the fruit) How long do they store? Do they require treatment before sowing? What conditions do they require for good germination?   soil type temperature moisture light planting depth  What kind of fertilizer is best, and when to start applying? How long until germination, and how long until fruiting-sized plants (under optimal conditions)?   Here's a picture of the seeds, for those who don't know how they look:   "
3527,Vegetables for very small pot,I want to make a gift for a friend and therefor bought a small cookingpot. I think it's made for kids to play with.  It has about the space of a soup plate. So about 12x12x4cm circle.  Are there vegetables small enough to grow in there? Or should I go with herbs? 
3528,Is this parsley plant too advanced to be salvaged for use with cooking,"Have a parsley plant (in its second year), and I think it has 'bolted'?, so it not really producing lush green stalks that I can use for cooking.    Can I salvage it? Or is it too far gone? "

There are a bunch of day lilies in the ditch down the road and I'm wondering if I can transplant them right now?    Surely the worst that could happen is that I don't get very vigeroius growth until next year, right?  If the alternative is waiting till this fall to transplant, then why not do it now? "

3531,How to safely control a fire after clearing woods,"I have an empty lot with a tree line that is going to be too close to the home I intend to build on it.  I hired a landscape contractor to clear the woods back about 40ft on the property but to avoid the added price of renting a chipper and a bobcat he suggested that he could just leave it in piles for me to burn.  Luckily there are only a few trees over 6 inches in diameter at the trunk, most of it is brush, saplings and smaller trees, however 4,000sq ft of cleared woods is still going to make for some rather big piles to burn!  I already called my local fire department to ask for permission and they said I don't need a burning permit, just to call them when I know a date for when I will burn so they can mark it on their books that there is a controlled burn at that location.  They didn't really tell me what defines a ""controlled burn"" however, and I certainly don't want to pay the landscaper $60/hr to tend an enormous fire.  My question is, how can I safely burn these brush and sapling piles assuming that I do not have a water source to tap for a hose if it gets out of control?  Is there a safe way to do this to ensure that the grass surrounding the fire won't catch? "
3532,Advice on planting potatoes with long sprouts,"We have a bunch of potatoes with long sprouts from their eyes.  (Actually, we just planted them, but I'll ask the questions I had right before planting.)   Should I leave a 12-inch sprout from the eye, or break some of it off?  On average, the remaining potato chunk is small (&lt;1""), so I imagine it doesn't have too much energy left. Should I plant the sprouts up or down?  (We actually planted them sideways because we weren't sure.)  "
3533,Reduce Waste | Starting Herb Garden from left over Herb Sprigs,"Inspired by User 23550's answer on this question in Seasoned Advice, where they suggested:     Instead of drying the cilantro, why not just plant the other half in good potting mix? You won't have to run to the store for fresh then. It grows quickly too!   Now, I have tried to grow a small herb garden in my house a few times over the years from seeds. Apparently I have the black thumb of death because all I end up with is a nice pot of dirt. The house I live in has a great south facing window which is also shaded in the afternoon (just enough to not fry plants - or maybe by store bought plants are just hardier) it is in this spot that I tried to grow my herbs (rosemary, thyme, sage, cilantro, and chives) but I couldn't get it to take.   This brings me to User 23550 - would her suggestion to ""plant the other half"" in potting mix work for other herbs? Is there a need to try and stimulate root growth using a damp paper towel before doing so?  "
3534,Strimming/Trimming techniques?,"When strimming grass to a nice quality short level the spool should always be tilted to one side so just the tips are cutting the grass? Is that right?  Should you always tilt the spool in the opposite direction of travel so that there is like a tail cutting the grass behind the spool?  I'm mostly strimming steep grass banks, so and tips much appreciated? Using bull horn industrial strimmers.  "
3535,How to care for a large redwood?,"I just bought a home in the CA bay area.  My front yard is dominated by a large redwood tree that seems in good health.  I really love the way it looks.  By large I mean 5-6 stories in height, planted most likely in the late 40s.  The tree is somewhat close to my front porch in that eventually some of the branches will probably grow out to touch the roof.  I assume I'll need to have those trimmed back.  I don't know how much tree trimmers know about redwoods specifically, so I want to be knowledgeable myself.  A trimmer recently recommended thinning out the branches and getting rid of the lower hanging branches.  I kind of like the lower branches (still above my head) as it feels more forest'y.  I worry about thinning reducing the shade.  What kinds of trimming should I be doing regularly other than keeping branches away from my roof?  Are there any other things I need to worry about with an old redwood: watering, pests or anything else? "
3536,Is it time to transplant these indeterminate San Marzano tomato plants?,"As you can see, I have two seedlings in each ""container."" I don't want their growth to be stunted because they are so close to each other. I know that normally, you would thin them out at this point. Instead of thinning, I would like to have 4 separate plants in their own individual container. I live in an apartment building with lots of direct sunlight, so I will keep these plants indoors. I have a few questions.   Is it time to transplant these seedlings into their own containers yet? Is the pot in the picture the appropriate size? How deep should I bury the main stems in the new pot? I don't think the pot is deep enough to bury the main stem all the way up to the cotyledons without it having to sit on the bottom of the pot. Should I add fertilizer (Miracle-Gro 24-8-16) after transplanting? (I am using Miracle-Gro potting mix, which claims to already have fertilizer in it.)    "
3537,Is this the tomato potato psyllid?,"I noticed these sugary white granules on my tomato leaves a couple of months ago, and saw some insects which I thought were aphids but didn't look closely. Now it looks as though my potatoes are infected.  The tomato potato psyllid (TPP) arrived in this country in 2006, presumably from the USA, and I was quite unfamiliar with it. I suspect that this is my problem.  Sugar granules on tomato leaf    Nymphs and winged adults    Tomato caterpillar lying amongst psyllid sugar   Potato leaf curl    I'm going to remove and bag up the infected plants, but a couple of weeks ago before I realized what was wrong I pulled the spuds out and put them into the compost.  Do I need to remove them from the compost pile or is it too late? And should I remove all guest potato plants from the garden, infected or not? "
3538,What is the benefit of using peat?,"What is the point of adding peat (peat-moss/sphagnum-peat/sedge-peat/etc.) to soils and substrates? What benefit does it provide?   I like the texture of it, and being that it's composed of partially decayed or decaying vegetation, I presumed that it would be full of valuable nutrients.  Although, some preliminary research suggests that it actually doesn't contain  much in the way of nutrients at all; similar to other soil additives, like coconut coir, perlite, vermiculite, etc. "
3539,Are blackberries hard to control?,"I just planted two unnamed blackberry cultivars in a raised bed with rhubarb surrounded by flagstone.  It seemed like a good idea at the time but now based on a remark about how they are a ""nightmare to control"" I'm having second thoughts.   Do they send out a lot suckers? Can they be controlled by yearly hard pruning? How far will the suckers extend?  More than a few feet?   Edit: I cannot mow the plants down in a raised bed. Is it feasible to plant them in a bottomless pail so they only send new canes from the base of the roots and not send suckers under my flagstone path?  Edit: in 2015 the blackberries have been planted for three years in a shady area with good soil and water and three competitive rhubarb plants.  Last winter in USDA zone 4 they were killed to the ground but still managed to grow ten feet in a season.  No berries though.  Rhubarb is doing great! "
3540,For how much area should I amend the soil for a given plant?,"My question is not about depth, but area.  For a given individual plant, do I amend the soil for an area the size of its seed spacing recommendation (12 in., etc.)?  Or is less required?  I am a complete beginner.  Thanks!  Sarah "
3541,How to replace the grass in a yard?,"   Possible Duplicate:   Can my lawn be saved or is it time to dig it up and re-sod?       I have two problems that I am trying to knock out with the least amount of work possible.  The first problem is I have bluegrass taking over my yard. It started out this season in small patches and has managed to cover most of the back yard now.  The second problem is the unevenness of the yard. There are small holes from a dog digging, medium hills from a sandbox that was removed, and large grading that was never leveled when the house was built.  I thought I might be able to kill two birds with one stone. My thought is to kill off the current yard (with something like roundup), get top soil brought in and spread across the yard, then seed with new grass.  Is there anything that I am looking over here that might be an easier plan of attack? If I do use something like round up, is there any standard time I would need to wait before replanting?  Details: I am in zone 6B. Primarily people have Fescue (which is what I currently have) but a few do have Bermuda. "

3543,How can we salvage a poorly pruned mature pear tree?,"I just had a company prune my mature pear tree yesterday. But I think they did it all wrong. I asked for the top to be trimmed down as much as possible and prune around power lines and over our neighbor's property.   The tree is over 2 car garage stories high and diminishing the amount and size of fruit on the tree.   What they did was just snip part of the highest branch and basically cut off all the lower large branches rather than prune them.   What can I do now?  The tree looks like an arrow shooting to the sky and very sad looking with no branches spreading out horizontally.   We're very sad about what's happened to our tree.  Is there any way to save it?  I was hoping the pruning would produce more quality pears that are reachable to pick. They were too high up before and small since the tree was so big and tall. Now I wouldn't be able to get any pears if they grow next year.   Sorry, I'm new to this site.  Can't seem to figure out how to post pictures.  "
3544,Hydroponic sensors are so expensive?,"I am new to this so forgive me if its basic. We are hardware engineers investigating the development of hardware systems to home hydroponic small gardens.  After reading a lot, I could see that there are some factors you need to keep, some of them are : ph in water, ppm, water conductivity, temperature.  I still have a few holes.   I saw some simple DIY systems where people just use the Kratky method, where they put water in a box, with a little air left to the plant, and it works great without checking all of this stuff like pH, DO, E.C , etc. So, measuring them is a most, or just an enthusiasm of beginners? Do you really need that if not in a big scale? As hardware engineer i have checked all ph and E.C sensors, the basic sensor, without any circuit to analyse it, costs more then 70$ , why is that ? It's the same for E.C , so I have started to ask, can you get this data from other aspects of the water like temperature? moisture ?   Seems that turning it to be smart, costs too much for home applications.  Thanks. "

The shoots started to grow the next day, although they were still unplanted. After that, I have bought some general purpose potting soil with pH in the range of 6,5-7 and planted them.  My questions are:   Will these roses bloom this year or are they too young? Do I need to plant them outdoors to get them blooming? Has anybody grown indoor roses?   If it helps, the reddish one on the left is Rosa ""Dame de coeur"" and the other one is Rosa ""Mr. Lincoln"".   "
3547,I cut the top of my schefflera plant and it's been droopy since then,"I had 3 stems of schefflera plant but 2 of them died and I was left with one. It was doing well but the roots were minimal and I found some worm in the soil that may have damaged the stem right above the root. I washed it and cleaned it and repotted it in new soil.  Then I read cutting the the top part of the plant right above the node will stimulate it to grow further and I did that as you can see in the second image. However since then its branches have been droopy and are wilting. Is there anything else I can do about it? I do no want it to die as it is from a dear friend. I'm keeping it under good sunlight for 8 hours and at room temperature.     This is a week after repotting and finding the worms. This is how the root looked like. Is the white stuff fungus?      This is how much roots it has:    This is after I washed it off the soil so we can have a clearer look  at the roots ans the stem:    Can I cut off the lower part and hope for it to revive and build a new root system?  This is what I did with the side branches:    Update: Ok, instructions followed and my fingers are kept crossed for any new growth from any of them, pics attached.      Will follow up with pics as soon as a new root or develops or otherwise in 6 wks hopefully. Thanks a lot:)  So heres an update after a week of cutting up the stem as per instructions followed.. in hope new roots will be made and the other severed stem was cut into half and put in water.. but all results are drastic. The mainnstem left in the soil was shrinking and getting a peau d'orange appearance ( the dotty skin appearance of oranges) as.. it was rotting away slowly and so did the stems i kept in water.

3548,What to do with a this tree which has become too big for its current position?,"I've got an tree (see this question for ID) which has been planted by the previous owner in a position where it now has outgrown.   I would like to remove it from there and like know what are my options.  Three years ago, when I moved in, the tree was more like a shrub. About 1m high. The first year the winter was quite hard and most of the branches and leaves had died. I thought for good. Then in spring it came back to life. New growth showed up. The last two years the winters were quite mild and thus it grew on and on.  Now it is 3-4 meter high and the main stem is about 8 cm thick at the bottom and it doesn't fit anymore in the place where it is now.   Here are the options I'm currently thinking of and I hope to pick the right one with your help.   Cut - shred - compost it If this option turns out to be the best one I'd like to know what to with the roots, leave or dig it out? Cut and cultivate as a shrub When to cut, how much and what are the risks? Dig it out and put it into another place My favorite. What do I need to take care of if this is a possible way? My soil is relatively heavy clay, how will this have influenced root-growth regarding spread and deepness? I surely will harm some roots, how much do I need to cut back the tree in its new position and when to cut back? What is the right position for this tree?

He went looking for it after noticing that his crops were smaller at the edge, and that the soil was dryer on that side, too, in the summer.  Knowing that the tree is about 6 years old, and it's crown has a radius of about 3m, and that we barely cut it, is this excessive rooting to be expected?  What can I do to to show my tree some 'manners'?  Prune it?  Cut the roots on one side? Lead the roots elsewhere?...  [EDIT] I have the role of the 'other party' in this question. "

3553,Can I overwinter runner bean seedlings for cropping the next season?,"Clearing up my vegetable plot this autumn I have found several young runner beans have self seeded and have put up new plants currently 10-15cm high. I've not seen this before but we have had a very mild autumn.  Are these viable seedlings and would they produce proper runner beans in the spring? Would they give me a much earlier crop of runners (which would be great as it's always a long wait till August for a runner bean crop).   All this assumes of course I can get them through the winter (I would of course bring them under glass). Am I even going to be able to keep them alive, as runners are not of course traditionally an autumn sown crop? "
3554,Should I trim this small peach tree shoot?,I grew this peach tree from a pit from a peach tree that grew in in my yard which grew the most delicious peaches. That was in Seattle 2 years ago but now I live in Colorado and I'd like to plant it in the ground eventually. The leaves are starting to come back after the winter.   I trimmed the tips off the branches because they were dried and dead looking after the winter (maybe 1-2 inches depending on the branch). I was watering the plant in this pot during the winter.  My question is about this little shoot coming off the bottom. Should I cut it completely off? Should I let it grow? It is growing much faster than the rest of the leaves. Is it pulling energy away from the rest of the tree? Is it a problem that it is coming out of the base?     
3555,Should I trim the leaves off my fig cuttings?,"I have a Black Mission fig tree that's getting removed soon, and in order to (after a fashion) rescue it, I've taken some cuttings from it using the instructions I found here.

Maybe just remove the big ones and leave the newly-budded leaves? "
3556,How far should I place garden plants from concrete and fences?,I have a 9' strip of land nestled between my driveway and the neighbor's fence. I'd like to plant some rows of blackberries and make some raised beds with tomatoes and vegetables here since it's one of the few locations not shaded by trees on my small property.    How far from the concrete and fence should I plant things? Can I make the raised beds go right up to the concrete and right up to my neighbor's fence? From the survey it looks like the fence is right on the property line.  I live in North Texas (Zone 8a) so I'm worried the heat retention and radiation from the concrete driveway will be an issue. 
3557,Can I re-grow roots from a piece of a trunk cut from my green ash tree?,I have a 3 ft stump of a green ash tree that I pulled out of the ground. I cut 3 root stubs with a chain saw.

The root stumps are 3 inches thick. Thank you.  
3558,What precautions can I take when planting a living fence to avoid it becoming troublesome?,"I'm interested in a living fence for my house and have a great source of straight growing willow normally used for biomass. This is in zone 4/5 of northeast US where we ge ~1m of precip per year and where I believe willow is native. I'm wondering what precautions need to be taken, if any, to avoid living fences getting out of control to a troublesome extent.  Why I ask is that I've heard horror stories of some pioneer plants like bamboo being planted in one area and with only a little bit of neglect (the kind that could easily come with a change in land ownership) they quickly claim huge areas for themselves and their presence keeps humans and other creatures from enjoying that area. Worse yet, once they're there, they are very difficult to get rid of even if someone's willing to invest significant effort in doing so.  I realize bamboo and willow and other living fence candidates are not all equal. So, if needed, please answer specifically for coppicing willows. I am wondering in general though, what precautions need to be taken to avoid a living fence getting out of control as I've heard bamboo has? The two main concerns:   The plants spreads out beyond the area intended for fencing. Of course some maintenance is expected, as any kind of fence occasionally need, but how to avoid a living fence that needs so much maintenance that it could be a turn off for future home buyers? (I realize that's relative, just looking for general things to do / look out for before and while working to establish a living fence.) The plants become extremely difficult to remove. I'm not sure if this is actually a problem, so answers about this point might bring to my attention that generally this is a non-issue. A high quality conventional fence is not something any potential home buyer is likely to get rid of, and if they did it could be a ton of work (especially if there's concrete anchors for posts), so a living fence might not actually be that much of a turn-off relative to other fences in cases of new owners wanting to change it up. I just can't shake this concern before growing something with fast spreading roots and vegetative reproduction: could it scare of future owners who don't want it but fear they'd never be able to get rid of it? If there's any need to worry about that, what precautions, if any, can be taken to address it?  "

3560,How long will leafhoppers stay after grapes are removed?,"We have grapes that have sadly been overwhelmed with leafhoppers, which totally decimate the appearance of the leaves, to the point of white chlorosis. Control methods have proven only temporarily effective, and a lot of work. We're planning to cut them down (before the plants return from dormancy), but I'm wondering, how long would we have to be without grapes before the leafhoppers moved somewhere else? Would they stick around the yard longer than a year even without grapes? (Assuming the grape vines are completely removed, and then new ones are replanted after the waiting period.)  Here's a picture of the leafhoppers, taken in the 2015 season before they did much foliar damage:    Here's an example of damage to the leaves (although it can get to the point where you don't really see much, if any, natural green on many, if any of the leaves):    Note that I'm not particularly looking for methods of controlling leafhoppers (although you're welcome to mention them, too). I'm just wondering how long these leafhoppers will stick around in an area after the grapes are gone (i.e. how many years, if more than one).  Update (30 June 2018): We kept our grapes, but we got rid of the trees that shaded them (and all of our other trees). Earlier, before the trees were gone, this year, we had some leafhoppers and leafhopper damage, but now I don't see any foliar damage, except on the old growth that is shaded by the new growth. I guess they don't like vines in full sun as much (or maybe their predators like the sun more). The leafhoppers seem to be gone (I don't see any, even on the old, shaded growth). "
3561,Cuttings growing leaves underground,"I took a cutting from my hydrangea. I left two sets of leaves and plucked off the rest. I then stuck the plant into a blend of soil and perlite with two nodes under the soil. It has sprouted a few new leaves so I decided to transplant it, but when I took it out of the soil, It seems that instead of roots sprouting from the nodes, there were leaf buds there.     As far as I can tell, there doesn't seem to be any roots growing anywhere else. Should I leave it alone? Can it still work? Will it grow roots on its own? Should I chop the bud off?   Edit: I did this about two weeks ago, taking a cutting from a mostly dormant branch near the ground. I used the Schultz Take Root Rooting Hormone and dabbed it on the sides of the cutting, including the bud. I have no idea what kind of hydrangea it is, but it is this one. From the link it seems to be French Hydrangea. "
3562,My new jade plant,   Possible Duplicate:   How can I help a sunburned jade tree recover?       I bought a jade plant from a lady about two weeks ago. I can tell it wasn't being taken care of. From experience (my mom having this kind of plant when i was younger) I brought it home watered it and since it was summer stuck the plant outside to flourish. I did not know it could sunburn. When I saw leaves turning brown and shrivelling up I quickly brought it inside. I believe my variety of jade is the e.t. Well I wanted to make sure my plant was healthy before I started pruning and replanting it. From the looks of the plant it has not been pruned for awhile.   My question is what would be the proper action to take to ensure the continued prosperity of my plant? I do not know how to post a pic of this plant otherwise I would. 
3563,Bay Leaf Tree (Laurus Nobilis) with severe scale,"I'm new to gardening as I have just bought my first house.  I inherited a very large (about 6m tall) Bay tree that is severely sick.  I took a sample to my local garden center and I was told that it is infested with Aphids/Scale (I think they mean Scale as I don't see anything that looks like an aphid) and they are producing honeydew, which has also caused the tree to be covered with a sooty mould.  New leaves coming out are fine, but they soon succumb to the sickness.  I am carrying out the garden center's recommendations but just wanted to ask here to see if they are in line with what you would do in my situation.   I gave it a drench treatment of Thiamethoxam (following the directions for a 10m conifer) dissolved in 2 liters of water, as a systemic insecticide to hopefully kill the bugs feeding on it.   Using a hand saw, I am now in the process of VERY aggressively pruning it back to basically just a pair of 3m high trunks with some main branches(as the tree is far too large anyway).  I will then scrub the sooty mould off with soap and water.   I also bought an oil insecticide which I plan to apply to any leaves that are left.   The problem is very severe and is infecting other trees in the neighbourhood, so it is important that I sort it out quickly.  I think my Bay is the epicenter as apparently Bay trees are very susceptible to scale.    Do you have any other advice for how to treat a 6m Bay tree for severe scale?  Is it OK to aggressively prune it back, as it is far too large?  Is there anything else I should know about taking care of my Bay?  If it is important, I live in Cape Town, South Africa.  We are in Spring, going in to Summer.  The soil is sandy to loamy and we have already had most of our rain - our summers are dry and hot and our winters cold and wet.    EDIT:  As requested, here are a few pics of my tree.  Hope this is sufficient to identify the species, I'm not sure what to look at.  I was told it is a Bay leaf tree (the kind you can use in curries).  It is aromatic when you cut it.  The tree has a silvery brown bark with some nodules and lots of scarring where the trunks have been damaged and pruned.  The fresh leaves are oval-shaped and bright green, older leaves seem to be a dark green but there are no older parts that are not severely infected.  At a guess I'd say the tree is between 30 and 100 years old (the houses here are about 100 years old) and the tree is well loved by my neighbours (and me) so I definitely want it to survive.  On the advice of the garden center I have got stuck in with a saw but I'm postponing doing any more pruning until I hear more from this forum.    View from my roof (bamboo fence behind is 2m tall)    Another angle from roof    Close up of diseased leaf showing scale and sooty mould    Close up of fresh healthy new shoots showing one or two scale spots just starting    Trunks showing numerous scars from previous pruning and black sooty mould.  There is a large wound on the one trunk that almost looks flaky and rotten on the inside.    Thanks for your interest and help! "
3564,Get rid of ants with sugar/yeast cocktail,"I want to get rid of ants on my balcony, because they are one of the reasons my plants always get aphids (no aphid problem yet, but I know they will come back every year). The ants probably have a nest in one of my (large) plant pots/containers (but don't know which one). I read you can kill a nest by porring boiled water, but that would also kill my plants, so I am looking for other ways.  I have read about yeast and sugar cocktail, but does it really work?  I made a cocktail with a teaspoon icing sugar mixed with a teaspoon of (dry) baker's yeast granules (from Dr. Oetker). They are on a small dish next to a plant that has ants on it. But it doesn't look like the ants are interested in it.  Does anyone have experience with this method? Or have better (organic) methods that do work? "
3565,Citrus plant with strong growth but yellowish/lime-green leaves,"I know that (generally speaking) yellowish to lime-green leaves combined with slow/weak growth in a plant are an indication of inadequate nitrogen, and one must fertilize accordingly.  However, does the same apply for a plant that is showing considerable growth but with pale-colored leaves?  Consider this calamansi (citrofortunella microcarpa):    The previous growth (before I bought it) consists of small, dense, dark-green leaves. The growth since then takes the form of much larger and paler foliage.  I do fertilize (though not too much), and the leaves are from the same stem so it's not graft vs host.  Am I doing anything wrong or is everything normal? "
3566,Can frog droppings be used as fertilizer?,"In the context I am thinking, I would essentially be mixing the droppings into the topsoil in a plant bed.  How much would be too much? How much would be too little to make a difference?  Nutrient breakdown?  Is Salmonella a risk? "
3567,Why my White Bell Peachleaf Bellflower's leaves are curling up or leaning upwards?,"I bought this plant on March 15, 2017 at RONA Garden Centre. Yesterday when I planted it in this pot the leaves are all like natural, no curling sign/stem moving at that any point. But today on March 16, 2017 this morning I noticed this plant's got about 2 leaves that are halfway or sideway curling also some of these leaf stems are leaning not down like yesterday's but upwards, is this normal or not okay? Is it normal for this type of Bellflower to have curly leaves/stems leaning upwards or it might be a problem and how to solve it...

The other one is not, what's going on here?  The plants are from seeds, and are in full ground since they were little. They are in the north-west corner of my garden (so facing south-east). They were both doing fine, until last week, the one on the right is having problems, the leafs are withering and browning and hanging. What can be the cause of this?  I live in Amsterdam, we had normal weather the past few weeks, however since last weekend the temperature is going tropical again (30 C or higher). But it started last week before the heat already.  NB. I have two more of these plants several meters to the right, which are doing fine. So it seems only one plant is having these issues.         "
3569,Can you tell if a tree stump is dead or alive?,"I have an ash tree that was broke in a microburst. The stump is about 4"" above ground and 5"" in diameter. It spouted a leaf off the stump just before winter. I would like to know if it is still alive or dead. Is there a definitive way to tell in winter? My HOA wants a new tree planted but I would rather let this one regrow. Is there a way to tell or will I have to wait until spring to look for regrowth? Thanks for any help    Thanks for all the responses. I live in south dakota so hopefully it will show signs of life soon. My goal is to keep the HOA off my back. I plan on planting several more trees this year but I do not have time to do it by may 1st deadline. They require 3 trees that I had until this guy broke. I dont want to be rushed into planting new trees. I obviously made a poor choice on the ash trees. I need time to do more research and find a fast growing tree that will thrive in western south Dakota. The problem is the local green house recommend that I plant the ash tree's. So how do you choose a tree and who do you trust for advice if not the people who sell the trees. Thanks again. "
3570,Can I grow herbs in a glass bottle with no drain holes?,"I read this page, Mason Jar Wall Planter, and many people complained about the bottles not having drain holes, but many others said that simply adding some rocks at the bottom will fix it.

3572,Can I water plants with spoiled wine?,"I have a small indoor garden. Unfortunately, I also have a dozen liters of spoiled wine. Intuitively, I think watering edibles with wine will be beneficial for them, as the wine carries already dissolved organic material.

Leaves are up to about 12 cm long, but I guess they could grow bigger as the plant grows. It also produces a white sap. Also notice the hairy kind of structures along the stem - sorry it's not a very good picture of that part.  Can anyone identify the plant? And any care tips? We are in a dark winter here in Sweden and I want to make sure they survive the lack of light as best as possible. Recently a few of the lower smaller (and older) leaves went very yellow and dropped, I thought maybe I'm over watering.

I started them in my greenhouse and moved them outside around the time of the last frost since it was really warm out (+30C during the day, +13/14 during the night).   However, they haven't grown at all since I moved them - it's been a few weeks. The zucchini and squash (moved outside at the same time) are growing nicely in the same conditions.  I have them in full sun locations, they're growing in composted manure.  So, what's up? Are they too cold? They're not dying, but they're also not doing a whole lot. Should I just be patient? "

3579,Is dry sphagnum moss dead?,"When you buy dried/dehydrated, compacted bricks of sphagnum moss from gardening suppliers and stores, etc., is it supposed to be alive, and/or able to grow, upon rehydration? Or is it dead?    I bought some of this Brunnings brand, expanding sphagnum moss (not sure what species, possibly Sphagnum cristatum and/or Sphagnum subnitens), from the similarly named (but unrelated) Bunnings Warehouse. It is supposedly ★★★★★/AAA-grade New Zealand sphagnum:      I experimented with it in a bunch of different environments, including some living terrarium/vivarium type landscapes.    Basically, it looks like a sopping wet, dark brown/yellow, lifeless mess of decaying fern fronds and leaf litter, blending in the the soils and substrates, and eventually taking the shape of its container. I was expecting it to develop into a lush, living, upright, green blanket, or carpet of sorts; like this:     Sphagnum squarrosum "

My concern is, I planted about 2-3 seeds per container, and now I have about 2 sprouts in each container. When I need to transplant them, do I need to separate the sprouts and plant them individually? Or can I leave them together? Will it be two trees in one pot eventually? Or turn to one tree? "

Here is the design:   So, some design questions are:   What would make a good mesh?  Chicken wire with 1/4"" squares?  Large chicken wire + large-mesh burlap?

3582,Automatic drain valve for drip irrigation,"I have a terraced drip irrigation system that is a few stories high.  I’d like to put an automatic  (but passive) drain valve at the bottom, so that when the system isn’t pressurized, the valve opens up and drains the water out of the system tubing into a cistern.  But when the system turns on again, the pressure closes the valve, and it waters like normal.    I don’t know what such a valve is called though.  I have searched amazon and the web under many different search terms, but am not finding what I want.    One thought... Could I use an anti-siphon valve (installed backwards?) to do what I want? "

3586,Using Rain Bird drip irrigation tubing with quick connect fittings,"Has anyone ever used Rain Bird (or similar) drip irrigation tubing with quick connect fittings (tees, elbows, valves, etc.), such as Sharkbite or John Guest fittings?  If so, what was your experience (bad, good, otherwise)?  Those fittings are obviously much more expensive compared to the barbed fittings that Rain Bird makes, but we reconfigure some portions of our garden a lot.  I've done the numbers, and if those quick fittings work technically, then some of them may be economic (and just much easier to use) for use in some of our areas.  But I'd like to know if anyone has experience with them, and whether they would actually work.  BTW, I'm fully aware of the potential UV concerns.  We'd take care of those through how we deploy them.

I have no idea how good of condition their soil is in (i.e. maybe they haven't touched the garden in years or perhaps they take great care of it).  Should I do a soil test when we move in?  Or should I assume the soil is lackluster and instead put in a mixture of compost and topsoil?  Or should I do something entirely different? "

It gets some sun in the morning and a tiny bit of sun in the afternoon.  I'm still a beginner and would love to have some low-maintenance edible plants on my patio. I don't want to start from scratch every (other) year, so the plants should be perennial and winter-hardy. Also, I don't want to grow salad, because I think it will require much more space than other plants. I've asked some more experienced people and done some research online, and already have the following candidates:   Chives Lemon balm Mint Parsley Wild garlic   I'd love some thyme and rosemary, but according to a lot of websites, they only do well in a very sunny place.

3595,"How do trees respond to solid, isolated, chunks of minerals such as iron, placed in the root zone?","Let's say you had a cast-iron pan and an apple tree that you were going to plant. Let's say you dug a large hole, threw the pan in and planted the tree near the pan.  One might imagine that the tree would use iron from the pan when it needed iron, and ignore the pan when it didn't. However, what is the truth of this matter? How would the tree treat the pan? Would it entirely ignore it, get too much iron from it, get the proper balance or what?  Let's say the pan and the tree were there for 20+ years and the soil was just slightly iron-deficient to begin with.  This is a hypothetical question. I don't have a tree I'm planning to plant any time soon. You can substitute apple with pear, peach or whatever. You can substitute the cast-iron pan with an unpolished brass (copper/zinc) turtle or some other mineral chunk. If the answer would differ based on the kind of tree and the mineral, go with an apple tree and iron. "

3598,Proper sequence of Northeast lawn maintenance this spring,"I live in eastern Massachusetts and have a big project coming up for my lawn. I am planning to get part of it excavated to fix an issue. Once fixed it will be back-filled with soil and I'll move onto my next project of getting an in-ground irrigation system. Once that's done I plan to loosen up the soil around the entire yard as its very packed and I strongly feel that is contributing to spotty patches of grass and in some areas, no grass is growing. I plan to do all of this in the next 6-8 weeks in spring but I've heard core aerating in spring might not be great as it could provide more opportunities for weeds. Does this plan make sense or should I adjust:   Get soil test Priority #1: Excavate sub-portion of lawn Priority #2: Install irrigation system Core aerate entire yard (is it fine to do this in spring or should I wait till fall?) Depending on soil test, I may need lime, or not. I read I shouldn't lime and fertilize at the same time. If I do need lime, when should I do it? Fertilize excavation site with starter fertilizer (was planning to try LESCO this year) and seed it Fertilize established areas of lawn with crabgrass prevention fertilizer (was planning to try LESCO this year)   A arborist that also does yard work once told me if I core aerate an excellent thing to thicken lawn after I core aerate is to broadcast seed all over the lawn as some of the seeds will germinate and thicken the lawn. Is that correct? Or should I ignore that and really follow a traditional overseeding plan? Also, if I do core aerate and broadcast seed over it should I have then only used starter fertilizer for the entire lawn due to the new seeds?  I'm trying to understand the timing of all the things I'm trying to do and want to make sure I don't do the wrong things.  Update with pictures:  Debris pit area   Patchy lawn   More pictures of lawn      UPDATE as of 7/24/2017:  I've made progress on my plans and I've accomplished the following based on this thread:   Get soil test (completed - details are here) Excavate sub-portion of lawn (completed - the issue was an old tree stump that was ground up and left to sink over many years) Install irrigation system (completed) Core aerate entire yard Add lime (completed, need to add more in fall) Fertilize excavation site with starter fertilizer and seed it (completed, looks OK, need to overseed it in fall with more seed) Fertilize established areas of lawn with crabgrass prevention fertilizer (completed as part of spring maintenance)   So my next big things are to core aerate, top dress, and overseed in the fall.  So the big question is: if I live in Massachusetts, when is the best time to core aerate, top dress, and overseed in the fall? Are we talking early September? Mid September? Late September?  Also, I plan to buy good quality mix of seeds for the northeast that will contain KBG, fescue, and perennial rye. Once I do my core aeration, top dressing, and overseeding, should I still keep the lawn moist every day as if I was doing the same routine in the spring? I assume so since I need to keep the seed moist with the warm soil temperature to germinate, but I just want to confirm. If so, I assume I can flip on my sprinklers daily in the early morning for about 5 minutes per zone max just to get the ground moist and keep it moist through September? "

I think they are mostly box-elder tree parts.  Is there anything we can do in order to turn this into useful garden material? Either fertilizer or somehow otherwise use it?  It seems if we could convert this into something, it'd be useful for our garden. My best thought so far is to burn it and use the ashes.

3602,Will mowing sprouting silver maple saplings eventually kill them?,"I recently seeded approximately 600 sf of lawn and unfortunately the timing corresponded with my neighbor's silver maple (Acer saccharinum) dropping it's samaras.  Needless to say the maple seeds love all the water and are sprouting up everywhere.  I pull all of them I can reach but do not want to walk on my newly sprouting Kentucky Bluegrass.  What I'm hoping is that once I start mowing this area again the maple trees saplings will eventually not come back.  However I'm a little concerned that their root systems may take away nutrients from the grass I'm trying to grow.  Will it be alright to wait and mow over the saplings later?  If not, what other options could there be?  Note:  I did see this similar SE G&amp;L question, however I believe this is different given that it's a new lawn.   "

This Orchid has been doing really well, and it's full of flowers at the moment, but one of the leaves is almost falling off, turning yellow from the base. I feel the same thing is going to happen with the other leave. This is while the stem of flowers is growing from that certain 'bush'. What should I do?        UPDATE: As I'm waiting here for someone's help, that leave just came off yesterday, and the other one today. The small leaves also look unhealthy and moldy. The stem still seems pretty happy and the flowers are all in good order.   I keep looking closely, and that stem comes just below these leaves and that worries me, unless it's the other 'trunk' beside it that is supporting the flowers.  I feel the roots have changed a bit, too (those dark lines on the roots on the right of the leaves in the picture below).   "

3607,Viability of tree seedlings with double tip,"This is a somewhat hypothetical question, but:  This little Quercus robur seedling was pulled out during a weeding session. Apparently it’s at least two years old and the original tip was cut off at some point, causing it to develop a double tip/stem.       Admittedly, we have dozens, if not hundreds of healthy and vigorous (and single-tipped) seedlings in the neighborhood (we had a huge mast year), but minor 2 is at an age where she will try to protect every life form at hand, so the debate is whether we will replant the seedling instead of putting it on the compost heap.   Which leads to the question at hand:     What will be the long-term effect if such a seedling grows into a mature tree?   I assume it will develop a double trunk. Will there be stability problems? Greater risk of fungal infection or breakage? Other side effects or potential problems?

3608,Butternut Squash Cross Pollinate?,"I grew some butternut this year and they turned out great but one of the vines has started producing something that doesn't look like a butternut:    In hunting around the closest image I've found so far is from this blog: [website]My questions:  Is this a cross-pollinated butternut or a recognized vegetable? If the latter, what is it called? Is it edible, and if so how can I tell when it's edible? "
3609,Is it possible for an almond tree to grow in a tropical country?,"I have been searching in Google, but I got neither information or reference regarding this issue. I'm wondering is it possible for an almond tree to grow in a tropical country such as Indonesia?  If it is not, why? Is there any study to make it possible? "
3610,What tree is it? (orange/yellow Jacaranda?),"It looks very similar to Jacaranda, which I have in my garden, but the flowers are orange (and see another similar trees with yellow flowers).  Couldn't find its name, is it from the same family of Jacaranda? The same but with different color?  (If that matters, it's in Israel)  Thanks!         "

3612,Should I be removing the oldest limbs from my palm?,"I’m trying to figure out how to care for this palm. It’s not growing fast, it’s just grown it’s first frond after 2 years in the same pot. We repotted it when we got it 2 years ago.   A few questions:   does anyone know what kind of palm this is?? Should I be removing the oldest fronds as they brown? The young fronds are beautiful and green, but the oldest ones are browning. If so, where do I cut them? The tips of the leaves are brown- is that too much or too little water?        "
3613,Why did my Agave plants stop growing shortly after sprouting?,"I planted some agave seeds about two months ago, which sprouted into 4 or 5 little 0.5 to 1 inch sprouts within a couple of weeks. However, they haven't grown at all since then. I water them about 1/3 as often as I water my other plants, which seems to keep the soil about the right moisture according to my meter. My apartment is usually 65 &deg;F at night and 72 &deg;F during the day, and it's in full sun for most of the day. I've been considering getting a heat lamp for growing the more tropical plants.  Is there anything I'm likely to be doing wrong (it's my first time growing that type of plant)?  Does agave normally stop growing for a while?  Is a heat lamp required for plants like agave? "

3615,Help identify this seedling (baobab?),"Can anyone identify this seedling?  I bought (what I thought were) baobab seeds online. When they arrived they looked nothing like I expected, small and brown and glossy, resembling apple seeds (see picture).   One of the 10 seeds germinated and is growing well - I’m not sure it’s a baobab though! 2 thick starter leaves and some fern-like fronds which open in the day and close at night. Seems like a very cool plant!!  Any one have any idea?  Cheers       "
3616,How can I safely prune a melon vine?,"I have a volunteer melon vine (it looks like cantaloupe) growing at the end of my garden area.  I chose to let it grow out of curiosity.  It's now producing a number of healthy looking fruits.  However, it's also invading my tomato plants and my lawn.  How can I most safely prune the vine to prevent it from continuing to invade my yard?  I don't want to hurt the health of the existing fruits, although I don't feel the need for more fruit.  Can I simply cut the long and/or troublesome vines? Is it important to let some of the vines continue to grow and leaf out for the general health of the plant?  How far from the base of the plant, or the nearest fruit, should I prune?  Or should I avoid pruning all together (google disagrees on this), and just redirect the vines that are competing with my tomato plants, and mow around the ones in the yard?  Perhaps installing a trellis or other climbing structure for the vine would be preferable? "
3617,Why do the leafs of peppermint plant look ill?,In the image below that I just took of my peppermint plant you can see that the leafs have this silver-grayish spots that don't look healthy. What am I doing wrong? Is it too much sun maybe?    
3618,What's the best thing to do for a neglected agave?,"I have an Agave victoriae-reginae.  This plant has had a hard life. I bought it at a local greenhouse in 2011, and kept it properly all year, on a stump on the hill, with other plants in a collection (which has now dispersed). When winter came, it somehow got overlooked, and remained outside. In early January, it was found and brought to me in its clay pot (which had cracked because the wet mix had frozen) and it was encased in ice from the freezing rain. I set it on the counter, and it thawed out slowly. Then I looked at it, and it was still alive! The outer leaves had dried, but it was surprisingly still alive.  I trimmed it, repotted it, and set it on a shelf in my basement, where there was a grow light installed. The shelf was up against a wall. It went missing soon after, and with all the traffic the area gets, I kind of forgot it existed.   Seems it had fallen behind the shelf, come out of its pot, and lost most of the soil. It must have been like that for almost two years. I just found it now, and it's ... still alive! Much smaller, and very shriveled!    What is the best thing I can do to revive the plant? It's kind of cool how it has survived, I didn't know these were so resilient. Do I immediately put it into good conditions, or break it back in slowly?  "
3619,"How can I ensure that hellebores in 6"" nursery pots survive the winter?","Earlier this year, I bought some hellebores (Helleborus niger hybrids) to plant in a shady spot near my Magnolia tree. I promptly forgot them, partly because of being ill for a couple of weeks, partly because of other plants growing up and around where I'd left the pots by the time I'd recovered.    With things dying back for winter, I've rediscovered the hellebores still in their 6"" (15cm) nursery pots and wonder what I should do with them. I live in Portland, Oregon (USDA zone 8b) and we've already had our first frosts. The winter weather here is usually wet rather than cold, but we frequently have stretches where the temperature doesn't get above freezing for several days at a time.  Is the end of November too late to plant them in the ground? Should I bring them indoors for the winter? If I leave them outdoors, what should I do with them during cold snaps? "
3620,Recover (probably) struggling Fittonia/Nerve plant,"Around the end of May (which would be the end of Fall here in the southern hemisphere) I bought a small potted Fittonia to keep in my bedroom. As you can see in the picture, by the time it came it was very bushy:    The store I bought it from recommended that I water it (4-5ml) every week or so, but quickly I started to realize that leaves would wither (and then they would just come off, I wouldn't even call it plucking) and sometimes the plant would overall shrivel up. I then started watering it every 2-3 days (also tried to give it more indirect light and misting), and it stopped shriveling up, but there were few leaves left, and some of them looked damaged.  I've been keeping it up and nothing has changed. I can see some small leaves sprouting, but they've been the same size for a long time now. We're nearing the end of winter (although in a tropical country), and the plant looks like this as of right now:    What have I been doing wrong? Water, light, humidity? Can I do something to repair those damaged leaves? Has the growth stopped because of permanent damages to the plant or does it have to do with the seasons? Any help on how to recover this plant would be appreciated. "
3621,Concerns about Petty Spurge and toddler,We believe we have a thick scattering of Petty Spurge in the garden and patio. I've read that it's sap is toxic and a severe irritant. NOT what you need with a very curious toddler around.  Can anyone suggest the most effective way to rid ourselves of this plant? And keep it away?  Thanks 
3622,What has damaged this tree?,"What type of damage has this tree suffered that has made the bark separate? I suspect a lightning strike.  [Trees struck by lightning may exhibit variable symptoms. When lightning hits a tree, water in the cells beneath the bark is heated past the boiling point. The resulting steam causes an explosion that removes a strip of bark. A crack in the bark appears when a continuous groove of bark is stripped along the entire length of the trunk or main branch. A crack that does not run the length of the trunk may indicate a side flash. A side flash occurs when electricity strikes the tree, travels down the trunk, then jumps to an object with less electrical resistance. If lightning strikes a bit deeper, the entire tree may blow apart. The tree may or may not have blackened or charred areas on the trunk.]1    The blackness here looks like charring to me which - along with the winding lightning style patterns - makes me suspect exactly that.       How can I determine exactly what has killed this tree? "
3623,Do cloned tomatillos pollinate each other?,"For tomatillos that require a pollinator, if I have only one tomatillo plant, but I root some cuttings from it, will the plants pollinate the other clones (and/or the parent)? They're all from the same plant, originally, and should be clones. So, I'm guessing they wouldn't pollinate each other well. Is this true? "
3624,Cactus and Succulent in the same pot,"I am looking to plant several cacti and succulents together in a single pot.  Several of the plants will include a grafted ""moon"" cactus and a succulent ""Eceveria Mazarine"" there may be one or two similar plants added additionally.   I have read the cactus cannot deal with direct sunlight since the ""scion"" cactus on top lacks chlorophyl so it needs indirect sunlight.  Where as succulents prefer direct sunlight.  Both plants require soil which drains quickly.    As for the light the plants will be placed indoors behind paper blinds in a relatively sunny window which does not let any direct sunlight in.   As for the soil I plan to use regular potting soil will a small amount of sand I have collected from near the oceanfront added to the soil, then gravel as a top layer.  Are these plants compatible together?  and are the lighting and soil conditions adequate? "
3625,Using tiles to build planter?,"I've been trying to build some large (24""x24"") planters on my own. I don't want to spend more than $20 on materials.  So I asked myself... why not use tiles to build it? This stone tile at home depot is $1.06/sq ft.  Has anyone tried using tiles like these to build large planters? These planters would be outdoors and will be grow fruits and vegetables.  I was thinking of something like this:  "

So far I have identified a tomato and squash plant, but this one is a mystery. When it first started growing it's first leaves looked very similar to a squash plant, but as it grew it turned into this:  Top View  Side View  The leaves have a sort of hairy texture.

3629,How do I control suckers on pear trees?,I have several ornamental pear trees of which one keeps producing suckers.  I have tried cutting them off as low down as possible and have even resorted to weedkiller but they just seem to keep coming back with a vengeance.    Will using weedkiller stop the suckering on ornamental pear trees and will it affect the parent tree?  Any other suggestions to remove them? 
3630,indoor plant prunning,I have 2 avocado plants. i pruned them both and the new growth is growing sideways. I stake one to get it to straight and that plant now has trouble supporting its own weight. I would like to prune them both back to see if the stems will get stronger. they are both in pots inside as we have bad winters. this is just for fun. Do  you think a hard prune indoors at this time is a good idea? or should i wait until spring? 
3631,"For fruit trees, is it better to plant a single multigrafted tree, or multiple trees in one hole?","In fruit tree catalogs, I've seen multi-grafted or multi-budded trees. Here's an example.  And I've also heard of a technique where you plant 3 or more trees in the same hole. Here's a youtube video talking about it.  Which one is better? Or what are the advantages and disadvantages of each technique? Is one likely to yield more fruit than the other?  What about planting multiple multi-grafted tree in one hole? I suspect that would be a bad idea, but I thought I'd bring up the possibility. "
3632,Able To Save This Tree,"I recently moved and a tree that was blown over in a storm has been growing again for a few years.

Or should I remove it as soon as possible?      "
3633,Is my jade thriving?,"As stated before I bought my jade 2 or 3 weeks ago from a lady over f.b. I have not seen any new growth on my plant. I was wondering what is a sufficient amount of time to wait to see if my plant is thriving? I am planning on pruning and planting leafs so I can have multiples of this beautiful plant. I keep seeing the word porous when talking about planting stems and leafs. What does the word ""porous"" mean in this context and how is it achieved? If I plant multiple leaves in one pot and one gets root rot can I save the rest of them? Do I have to throw away the soil and start over? "

3635,Hostas in river rock - am I doing it wrong?,"Last year I put water permeable fabric and then river rock down on a slope that sends water runoff toward my garage. A furrow at the edge of the rock helps direct the runoff away slightly better.  It’s a shady spot with only morning sun so I plopped a few gallon hostas in there.   So far this year they’re ok but I’m concerned I’m guessing. Anything I should do to make sure they thrive? Back off the rock around each a bit maybe?  FYI, I have been applying the rabbit repellent.   Please take a look:      Thanks for any advice. "
3636,When to cut roses?,In my garden there some roses that are growing wild. Some of theme are at least two meters high with the flower only visible from down below.  Can I cut them in the summertime? Or is it best to prune them down late winter? 
3637,Borders and weeds,"I am planning a border around our fence, which will be approximately 50m by 1m in total. As a test, I made a 2m by 1m test border, and planted malva, anemone, campanula, delphinium, lavender etc. On top of the bare soil between the young plants I've layed 70 litres of ornamental bark, to keep weeds out.  However, after a week or 2, there are already plenty of weeds coming through the bark. I'm also a bit confused about how the border plants will grow so they will fill up the border, when there's bark preventing plants to grow? That seems contradictive?  What is the advised way of setting up a border like this?   "
3638,What animal is digging at my pepper plants and what can I do to prevent it?,"Some animal has been digging at the ground around my pepper plants.  The rest of my garden is fine, including my tomatoes.  This is a regularly occurring problem, every two days or so.  What animal could be responsible for this?  I've seen a skunk, squirrels, chipmunks, rabbits, birds, toads and a cat all roaming around my yard, so I'm not sure what I'm trying to defend against.  Are there any suggestions for keeping them protected?   "
3639,Whitening of some leaves of a potted key lime tree,"I have a potted one-year-old-or so lime tree, which has looked quite healthy for the past two months or so (after recovering from a winter where it lost a lot of leaves due to overwatering).  Since the outside was really cold and it's on the ledge of the (closed) window of my office, I let the heater on during one night, in addition to the usual central heating -- so when I cam back the next day, my office was quite warm, maybe 27° C.  Later that day, I noticed that two leaves of the lime tree had edges that were whitening; after a few more days, it does not seem to spread to many leaves, but it currently had 3-4 leaves showng the same sort of whitening:      In terms of watering, I water this tree twice a week, and try not to overdo it; it's on the ledge of a window headed East, in an office in Manhattan (so, recently, it's been rather cold outside, roughly freezing temperatures; but my office stays at 18°-20° C).  Should I be worried? Am I doing something wrong? "
3640,"Fertilizers and How to ""error""","I am following instructions (or attempting to) to plant a pecan tree and one of the steps is to add 5-10-15 fertilizer around the tree. I can find no 5-10-15, but readily find 5-5-5, 10-10-10 (and other varieties) If I cannot find the ""right"" mix, how do I determine what the 'best mistake' to make would be?   At first glance I would think ""compromising"" to 10-10-10 would be a good solution. However, some initial research suggests ""Too Much"" nitrogen and ""Too Little"" potash are both potentially problematic. But I can find no guidance as to what is the ""safe range"". If 5-10-15 is ""just right"" is 10-10-10 ""too much/too little"" or is that within an acceptable 'range' of 'OK'. The author of the article I'm looking at may believe 5-10-15 to be optimal, but plants would never grow in the wild if the ""perfect"" blend is required.    So, how do I calculate what is ""close enough"" when dealing with fertilizer? "

3644,Overgrown Front Tree Bed?,"We have a front tree bed in the front of our house that has had the plastic under-layer destroyed by replanting trees over the course of a decade. Weeds keep growing in the environment causing a persistent problem for us.   What is the best approach to stop the weeds from growing here? We've already taken out a lot of the rocks that we added originally, should we try to cover the area with another plastic barrier? The problem with that is we already have trees planted there now, so how can we place a plastic barrier over the ground with the trees there already?  What is the most efficient way to go about resolving this?    "
3645,How can I automatically fill a water reservoir when a low water mark is reached?,"I have a reservior of water which feeds a vertical garden.   I want to install a type of switch/valve?? that fills the reservoir to a specific height if the water drops below a certain point (low water mark). The reasoning is if the reservoir runs dry the water pumps cooks out.  A float switch (like those used in a toilet) will not work (to my knowledge) as the water level drops and rises during the day (when the water pump comes on) but only reaches the low water mark every few weeks after some evaporation takes place. A float switch would fill the reservoir every time the water level drops, creating over flow. "
3646,What is causing black spotting on my air plant?,I've had this tillandsia for about three months now. I watered it yesterday night and left it to dry upside down over night like I normally do. Just this morning I noticed some black spotting on the growing (and hopefully will be blooming) part of my air plant. The spotting is only near the top of the bloom. What is it caused by? can I get rid of it? and will my air plant survive? 
3647,Optimal temperatures and light times for pepper plants,"Day/night temperatures?  How much light is too much?  Right now I have an indoor pepper plant that is usually 80-90F during the day with 18 hours of light. I'm pretty sure I'm overdoing it as the pepper plant is sort of wilting/curling yet is mostly green and does not feel too dry to the touch.  It drops to a nominal 60-70F the other 6 hours and the humidity raises usually from 30% during the day to 60% overnight.  It's also worth mentioning that the LED light I have might be overkill and puts out 500k lumens @ 300W. By comparison, a 4 foot fluro strip I have puts out 100k lumens at 220W with the same light meter at the height of the canopy.  What can I do to optimize my growing environment?  What I have in mind at the moment is significantly more ventilation assistance to keep the ambient air temperature closer to the outside air as well as moving the light up further to the point where the canopy reads around 300k lumens.

3648,Why do my bonsai seedlings die after a month?,"I got two bonsai kits and have tried growing from seeds. Both times my sprouts grew to about two inches and then flopped over and died. I watered them daily, kept them in a plastic bag most of the time to keep them moist. It seems I may have drowned them. One of the seedlings was from a red maple. The other was from a black pine.  Here is a shot of how far I got:    What is the correct handling for growing a bonsai from seeds? After sprouts reach a certain height, should I stop watering so much? "

3651,What's causing the yellow spots on my rosemary?,"I live in Carmel Valley, San Diego and I have a rosemary plant that has been sitting in my back yard for almost 6 years. The weather has not changed for quite a long time. The soil is a free draining sandy soil. A week ago, the rosemary started flowering. It had only flowered once before four years ago. When I looked closer at the leaves, I found yellow spots on most of them:    The camera makes the color more green but really the whole leaf looks yellower and not healthy. Normally I would wait a few weeks just to see if it would go away, but I also started noticing white fruit-fly sized flying insects around the rosemary. I'm also particularly worried because my parsley had been infested by these insects a few days ago:    Also this insect:    I uprooted the parsley and disposed of it properly and I'm wondering if these are the same insects that are damaging my rosemary.

3652,Greenhouse in a tropical climate,"This may be an odd question. I live in Singapore and I recently bought a small greenhouse because it was cheap and it looked nice. It's about 20x40x50cm. I'm originally from a cool temperate climate where a greenhouse makes sense.  Are there any plants that would survive in a humid tropical climate inside a small greenhouse? Placing it in the sun would probably cook anything inside it, so assume it will remain in the shadow.  Could there be a plant that would benefit from being inside a greenhouse in these conditions? "

3655,Source for apple variety information,"I'm learning more about apples.  Here's my dilemma:  I can get about a dozen varieties from my usual supplier.    Generally prairie hardy apples are not commercially viable due to their size.     Now in the garden catalog they use words like 'crisp' and 'good fresh' and 'good storage'  but they only use 2 lines for each variety, and it reads like they have picked attributes at random.  So for example, they will say, ""fireblight resistant"" for one.  Does that mean all the other are susceptible?  As it turns out, no.  Is there a website that compares apple qualities, preferably with hard numbers like brix, and pH and titratable acids?    Due to some of hte answers given, let me clarify:  I'm looking for comparison data.  I don't want to know that it's sweet, I want to know that it's sweeter than X, or about as sweet as Y. or best Brix 15.  I don't want to know that its 'good in storage'  I want to know 'Stores for 5 months' at 40 F.  Or 'Use it or lose it in 4 weeks'  I don't want to know 'good for cooking'  I want to know 'better for cooking than Z'    I want information that allows a person to decide, ""September Ruby, or Dolgo"" for eating.

3656,How can I stop vine borers from killing my squash?,"A few of the squash plants in our garden started wilting for no discernible reason late last week. We lost three sweet meat squash plants before we figure out that vine borers were attacking the squash.   At this point, most of the squash plants have signs of vine borers. The zucchini, spaghetti and acorn squash plants all show signs of vine borers - holes in the base of the vine and wilting leaves. The butternut, Hubbard, and pumpkin plants seem to be unaffected, but I'm not sure if they're resistant or just haven't been hit yet.  Is there anything that can be done for the plants that are already affected? I tried cutting open some of the stems lengthwise and pulling the vine borers out, but I'm afraid I did too much damage to the plants, and I know I didn't get all of the larvae out.  What about the plants that don't show signs yet? Should I wrap the stems in foil?  Side note: We're trying to do everything organically. So far we've been spraying weekly with neem oil, and occasionally spreading diatomaceous earth. "
3657,What are my options for securing my fenced back yard against rabbits?,"I want to plant a vegetable garden in my backyard, but there are a ton of rabbits in the neighborhood. Instead of enclosing my entire raised bed(s), it seems like it could be simpler to just make the entire backyard impregnable to bunnies.  Is this feasible? What are my options to accomplish this? If I staple some chicken wire or nail some plywood in the areas with gaps between the wood and the ground will that be enough? "
3658,How far apart do raspberries and blackberries need to be planted?,Most horticultural guides I've read recommend not planting blackberries and raspberries near each other because they will spread diseases between each other. How far apart do they need to be to prevent contamination? Is the opposite side of the yard (e.g. 30 feet) enough? Or do I need to try to figure out a way to incorporate one of them into my front yard landscaping? 
3659,How do you get rid of a swarm of cicadas?,"I noticed a swarm of large amber coloured bugs on my walk home today.  I think they were cicadas (they were moving too fast and it was too dark to take a picture).  They seemed to be swarming around the small trees on the walk (maples and oaks).

3661,What can I do about carrots having weak stems?,"Should I plant then deeper, fill in dirt around them as they are growing or perhaps something else?  It seems like they grow faster than they can keep up with themselves, and if I do nothing, I'd end up with a ton of right angled carrot stems.  Is this why seedling starters are used? "
3662,What happened? - Chilli plants are developing spots on leaves and the edges are curling,"I found some questions about other chilli plants, but I don't think the leaves look quite the same as mine, though it may be the same as the 2nd question posted.  What is happening to my chilli plant? How can I help it?  Dry brown patches on cayenne chilli plant leaves, leaves starting to curl, tiny black spots  Light brown spots have been developing on some leaves, and some have dry, curled up edges. I have been adding a general fertilizer once a week. I have also been using pyrethrum spary perhaps every 1 and a half weeks. They also have some slow release fertilizer under that mulch.  Edit:  Watering schedule:   Every 3 to 4 days, depending on weather. If it's a hot day I may have to top it up a bit, or they start to wilt.  Fertilizer   Slow release NPK: 15.3%, 4.3%, 5.9%  General purpose NPK: 24.2%, 5.6%, 11.7%   I haven't used the slow release fertiliser since I posted this question.  Pests  On my largest chilli plant, it looks like some of the leaves have been eaten by some bug. But I have checked for pests and can't find any.  Pyrethrum  I don't use this very much since I posted my initial question. I was experimenting with it as a way to control fungus gnats. Pretty sure it does nothing.  Update 2 So I picked Enigma's answers since at the time of acceptting answers it had other information in it.  But yes, everyone appears to be right. I stopped the fertilizer and now, the damaged leaves are still damaged, but new leaves are fine and and the problem has not continued. I will also try getting new fertilizer sometime.   "

3665,Is it practical to sharpen hedger blades yourself?,"I have a gas powered hedge cutter that is quite nice, but it usually goes dull quite often under heavy use. I always put on spare blades and get the others sharpened, but I'm interested how long it would take to do it yourself. I could save a bit that way, if it isn't extremely time consuming.  Is this a practical idea? "

3667,Will prickly pear thrive under the eaves on the west side of my house?,"The front of my house faces due west, with about a 2' overhang underneath the eaves. There is a 12' section between the northwest corner and the walkway leading to my door that has proven very difficult for me to establish any plants in because it doesn't get much rain, and it can get very hot there from heat reflected off my concrete porch. Currently, I have a few volunteer Rose Campions (Silene coronaria) growing there, and some mint popping up until I pull it out.  I have been thinking of growing some prickly pears in that spot, with the hope of also getting some fruit to eat (I'm not a huge fan of the leaves). With the overhang and shade from a magnolia tree at the southwest corner of my house, they would be in shade until early afternoon, then a brief period of partial shade, followed by full sun for the remainder of afternoon and evening; perhaps six hours of direct sunlight per day near the summer solstice.  I live in Portland, Oregon (USDA zone 8b) where summers are typically warm and sunny, and the other seasons mild and wet.  Would that be enough sunlight for them? Is there a species or cultivar of prickly pear that would do well in that spot? "

3670,Can citrus tree health affect the seed count in the fruit?,"I have a Clementine Orange which used to produce pleasant fruit that was lightly seeded.  In the last few years, the number of seeds in each orange has increased dramatically. The tree has fallen to some neglect and I'm wondering if this could be related.  Does the health of a tree have any effect on the number of seeds it produces? Is there any way to affect how much seed an orange tree will produce, or is that strictly genetic? "
3671,Pruning leaves from bell pepper plants,I have a few bell pepper plants out in the garden and they are finally starting to bud. Is it a good idea to prune the older and larger leaves below the buds to encourage larger fruit?  I am growing them in a Topsy Turvey&trade; and they are doing quite well.  The ones I planted in containers seem to be getting their leaves munched on a bit which is why I have been pruning those.    What is the best practice with regards to pruning leaves in peppers or other simple leaf type plants? 
3672,How should I prepare a bed of chrysanthemums for winter?,"I would like to prepare a bed of chrysanthemums for the winter. The plants have grown up to sizes of 1 to 1.5 meters, some of then have colapsed slightly because they evidently became to large. I've been told that the bed contains both perennial and other varieties.  What is the best way to prepare this bed for the winter? For instance, would cutting all stems back to, say, 5 cm be a good idea? "
3673,What are these trees?,"My house has these two mystery trees and nobody I know can identify them. I am quite fond of them, since they look nice and provide fantastic shade:    They're deciduous, but never flower in spring. Not enough chill hours, perhaps? I live in zone 7b New Mexico, but the trees are positioned such that they catch a lot of winter sun (southwest side of the house, close to a thermal mass wall that soaks up heat).  Growth is extremely vigorous every year, and they grow large numbers of lateral branches, resulting in a lot of crossing and rubbing branches and an extremely dense canopy. Here's what the leaves look like:    Buds grow right out of main trunks all the time. New ones appear every year:    Their bark is gnarled and dark gray, in places almost black:    One is multi-trunked, and the other had a central trunk (with a lot of branches):      Any idea what they are? "
3674,Do i have maggots grow g in my plants?,I noticed a few days ago but the leaves on my spinach plant started to turn brown. I honestly thought maybe they were just getting too much sun or maybe the leaves had burned from being watered in the afternoon. I was in the Garden today we eating and decided I was going to just pull the plants out and replace them with something else that's when I noticed there is tiny insects that look like maggots in between the leaves. Aside from growing the yard tomato plant this is the first time I've had a real Garden and I'm not quite sure what to do to prevent it from spreading to the rest of my plants what is this exactly??? 
3675,Apple tree limb rooting,"I am trying to root a limb from an apple tree we had to take down. For 1 day the limb, about an inch in diameter and 6 to 7 inches tall with leaves, was in a bottle of water. I then dipped it in root enhancer and planted in a small pot in peat moss. It was doing well until about 2 hours ago. The leaves are limping. Help? What causes this? The peat moss is damp to the touch but not soaked. Please help.  "
3676,Killing ants without killing the grass,"The front lawn of the house we rent is infested with ants. Can I use laundry detergent (liquid) to kill them without damaging the grass? I know dishwashing liquid will kill the grass, but will laundry detergent, too? I currently use to kill them with the smell from the shared septic tank which overflows when it's raining but the rain dilutes it until it doesn't kill anything. "
3677,How can I tell if a tool I'm holding is well made?,"One time I purchased a hand trowel, it was pretty cheap so I didn't expect too much from it. But as soon as I tried to use it, the pressure from lifting the dirt out of the ground broke the wooden handle. Looking at it, it looked like it broke because of how the handle was bolted into the handle, it split the wood when pressure was applied to it.  Ideally I'd like to know when I'm buying the tools in the store whether or not they're going to be able to last for more than one use or not.  Is there a way to tell if a tool is well made or not? Like should I be looking for tools made out of certain materials, or avoiding tools with bolts in certain places? "
3678,Does an Eastern Redbud tolerate partial shade?,"I'm thinking of replacing an ugly evergreen shrub in my front yard with a flowering tree of some kind. The location on which I'll be placing the tree is overshaded by some very large old oaks, so I'm looking for something which:   is relatively short (ideally 10-15') has attractive spring and/or fall colors tolerates shade well grows in hardiness zone 4   Based on my own searches I'm looking at an Eastern Redbud, but I'm worried that my location is too shaded for the redbud to thrive. The surrounding oaks shadow the potential location for all but a few hours of the day, and if the redbud really needs ""full sun"" as described, I don't think it will do well.  Does anyone have experience planting redbuds in shaded locations? Is there another tree that meets my requirements that would do better? "
3679,How should I straighten my bent baby Euclyptus Tree?,I purchased a small Rainbow Euclyptus tree off Ebay about 1.5 months ago. It arrived healthy and looks to be doing well.  Though I'm concerned as it has a really crooked part of the trunk just at the base.  Knowing how huge this tree will become...should I be concerned? How should I go about straightening it?  I'm thinking either:   Put in some stakes and rope to slowly unbend the trunk. Or Simply dig a deeper hole and bury that bent portion underground.     
3680,How to pinch off small harvests from thyme plants?,"I am planning on harvesting my thyme. The thyme plants, 7 week-old since planting (seed pod going in a hydroponic system), are short and tiny compared to other herbs. I'd like to harvest some sprigs and still allow the rest to grow. Where/how should I cut? Should I pinch off whole stems where they branch off or should I keep some vital parts for regrowth?  Edit:  Please see photo below. Don't mind the basil behind. I know the thyme is being overpowered...   "
3681,starting first-time garden in yard with a lot of english ivy - raised bed vs. double-digging,"I've never gardened before and would like to start a small (4' x 8') vegetable garden this year in our yard.  I'm hoping to plant sugar snap peas, tomatoes, cucumber, zucchini, and possibly watermelon.  We're renting our house, and the yard has quite a bit of ivy (6'-8' border) around the edges of the backyard.  Someone has apparently had a garden in the corner of the yard before, as there is still wire around the garden and wire trellises in the plot.  By now, though, that area is completely overgrown with English ivy.    I'd like to plant our garden in the previous garden plot, as that's most convenient for us in terms of location.  I was planning to uproot the ivy using the white vinegar method as cited here: (How to Get Rid of English Ivy in the Landscape) for several weeks in a row.  As I'm pregnant and have two toddlers running around, I'd rather not use toxic herbicides. I'm concerned about the surrounding ivy growing into the bed, though.  I've read about two general methods for growing - double-digging vs. raised garden bed.  Both are equally difficult for us to implement, with the raised garden bed being somewhat more expensive.  Will either be better in terms of preventing the surrounding ivy from infiltrating the garden?  Or is there something else that I should do in terms of getting rid of the ivy?       "
3682,Correct position of Bypass Pruner/Lopper Blade,"I have recently bought a bypass lopper and apparently there is a correct way to position the blade when cutting; that is, reversing the position would damage the branch.  gardenmyths.com claims:    fuf.net makes the same claim:    Apparently, one side of the branch gets crushed when cutting.  Is there any truth to any of this?  In the gardenmyths image, it seems more likely to me that the blade side would get crushed, because the ""hook"" side has less going on during the cut.  Can anyone confirm or deny this?  Is there any convincing argument to any of this? "
3683,amendments to soil to make it hold LESS water?,"I have some potting soil that I'm using for a self watering planter.  It's peat moss based, and I see some perlite in it.  I notice that it's wicking too much water (too wet).  I tried the 2 knuckle test and can tell that it's just a little too must down there. I also tried a moister meter, and it shows that moisture is on the high side.    Is there any soil amendments that I can add in to reduce the amount of water this stuff will hold?  My goal is to slowly add something to reduce the moisture retention, until I get it just right.  But what can I add? "

3687,Can you identify the genders of two pistachio trees from the photos?,"I ordered two pistachio trees (one male + one female) over the internet. I have just received them yesterday. Unfortunately, they didn't label them and now I can't find out which one is male/female. Can you please identify them from the photo below?    One of them is shorter and has larger leaves. The other one is taller and has smaller leaves.  Google doesn't help me very much. I asked the seller and he said that the one in the blue package is female. However, this is my first time shopping from him, so I don't want to be wrongly informed. Can you please confirm the genders of these trees? "
3688,How should I prune a common fig for best productivity?,"Figs have a unique fruiting cycle, fruiting on old wood first, all at once, then on new wood for the rest of the season. What's the best pruning system for these, to maximize production?  Is it best to balance old wood with the new in a specific way, such as pruning it to form long canes, or is it best to prune it into a dense shrub form, or some other way?  This is for optimal production measured as pounds per plant per year. "
3689,Moving and replanting an avocado tree questions,"I'm in Southern California  Currently we have an avocado tree that was planted in our vegetable garden from a seed, it's like 4-5 feet tall now. And it's time to move the tree to a more permanent location. We did not expect the tree to be successful and it was more of a ""what if"" it grows sort of thing.  The only spot we have room for this tree is on the side of our property that has a 40-45 degree slope. The problem is, i'm used to planting trees on a flat surfaces, and not on a slope.      These are the only 2 options I can think of to plant this tree. Trees on this slope have been successful in the past, so i'm not worried about that. My question is, is there a different method to plant this tree? If A or B are the only options, which is better? If both A and B are both acceptable is B really worth the extra effort to hold back the soil so the tree can be flat? How much of the garden soil should I move with the tree? I don't want to shock the tree to a new area. As much soil as possible? a little bit of soil? Or should I just buy some new soil and leave all the surrounding soil where it is? Is there an issue with moving a tree like this during the summer time? Are there better times of the year to move a tree? Does it matter?   thanks. "
3690,Why the leaves of my guava getting dry and dropping?,"I have purchased a guava plant one week ago. from the start of having this tree, some of the leaves getting dry and wavy then start to dropping without getting yellow. is this natural or my tree has a disease?  It's near the window and has sunlight about 5 hours a day. The temperature is between 15 and 25 degrees Centigrade, and the humidity is low but I spray water 3 times a week.

3691,"Mexican Lime tree planted too deep, trying to address the issue early","This lime tree was planted about 2-3 years ago, and isn't growing as fast as we thought it would. Maybe the tree just grows slow? I'm not sure. Recently I dug down to see where the root system started and to find the root flare.  And i'm still not exactly sure If I dug far enough down. But after watching a ton of videos about the root flare, I discovered we planted a few trees really deep, and I'm currently attempting to address the issue now, and not 5-10 years from now.  The biggest issue with the root flare being buried in dirt or mulch is that the roots may grow near the flare and strangle the tree in the future. Do you guys see the root flare in these pictures? Do you see any issues with the way the roots are?      In this 3rd image, i believe this is the root flare, and I should cut all the roots above it. And was planning on putting in fresh soil just to the root flare, if that is what we are seeing here.  Also, do lime trees grow especially slow compared to say an avocado tree? "
3692,Soaker hose with a rain barrel,"I have a simple setup with a rain barrel, and I'd like to run a soaker hose from it to water some flowers at my house. I am hoping to find a soaker hose that will be reliable enough to use for a few years at least, and I'd like to avoid the complexity of dealing with a drip system if possible.  I tried this product, which worked so-so for a little while, but as many reviews stated, it virtually stopped letting any water out after a few months. I took off the cap and let some water run through it, but that didn't seem to help. I disconnected the hose and put a coat hanger in each end to try to dislodge any debris that might have gotten clogged inside, but I didn't find anything, and the behavior was the same after that.  I have read that a 200 mesh filter could help keep a soaker hose from getting clogged with debris. I also plan on elevating my rain barrel with cinder blocks in order to gain a bit more pressure. But I will need another soaker hose to run to another area, and I'd like to replace my current soaker hose, which I think is useless now.  Where can I find a reliable soaker hose that will work with a rain barrel?  I've come across the following in my search, but I have no idea whether they're reliable, since I could find very few or no reviews for them online.   DripWorks - actually couldn't find any proper soaker hoses for low pressure there, just something called a soaker dripline Rain Barrel Soaker Hose, also seen on Mr. Drip and Rain Barrel Man   And searching on the following sites produced only products that required higher pressure than rain barrels or products with many poor reviews.   Amazon Home Depot Lowes   Where can I find a reliable rain barrel soaker hose? Or should I give up this search and use a drip hose instead? "

The literature is confusing on this issue.   Edit: we have only ever seen one deer in seven years and it was confused so I can't tell if these honeysuckle are a tasty treat for them. Right now they are just snack size.

3697,How important is it to till before sod installation?,"I got a few quotes for installing zoysia sod.  All of them are in the range of about $5000 bucks.  The difference is in the amount of pallets offered by each group:   Spotfill About 75% of the yard. 100% of the yard.     I am of course leaning towards the 3rd estimate.  The concern I have is the estimator told me they scalp the lawn.  He said they do not till because of the risk of damaging the sprinkler system.    Is that a big deal?  I feel like tilling is a lot of work and both of the other contractors do it.  So why do it if it isn't important right?  I'm no landscaping expert, so help me out.

3699,Cactus in hydroponics: Keep water levels up at all times?,"I've read a bit online about growing cacti in hydroponics, and basically every site I found agrees that it's possible, and it should basically work like any other hydroponics: Set the plant (in an inner pot) in some substrate, like expanded clay, put that inner pot in an outer pot, fill the outer pot with nutrient solution until it reaches the roots.  However, if you grow cacti in soil, the rule seems to be that the soil must really dry out from time to time. Now I wonder: If I keep the nutrient solution filled up at all times, the cacti's roots will never be dry. Do cacti like that? Or do all the ""cactus in hydroponics""-websites forget to mention that you should let the outer pot run dry every once in a while?  Thanks a lot! "

However, the landlord overwatered one of the bushes for several months.  It's now got some kind of fungus or root-rot which causes it to look unhealthy and the leaves on some branches to turn yellow.  Since then, I've removed the soaker hose he put there, and have been letting it dry out.  It doesn't seem to be getting better though.  My question is: is there a way I can rescue this rosemary bush?  Should I expect it to recover with mostly dry soil and infrequent watering?  Or is it doomed at this point and I should rip it out and plant another one? "

3703,Is spinach which has bolted as unusable as bolted lettuce?,"Bolted lettuce is famously unusable because your sweet salad leaves turn bitter.  But does the same apply to spinach? It's a lettuce type crop (and equally prone to bolting in hot weather) but it's basically a bitter leaf anyway and typically cooked to a mush (a nice mush, if spinach is your thing, but still a mush) anyway, so does it really matter if additional bitterness has entered the plant?

3706,Composting Equine Pine and Rabbit Manure,"My wife raises show rabbits, and about a year ago we switched to stacking cages with trays instead of hanging cages. (We switched to an insulted building in order to run an AC window unit due to heat issues every summer)  In order to reduce on the ammonia and oder, we have been using, as litter in the trays, a product called Equine Pine which is ""made of 100% pure Pine pellets"". After use, the pine pellets seem to turn into something closer to a corse sawdust. My wife also sometimes sprays the litter with a product called Zaps It.  So we have a slowly growing pile of former pine pellets and rabbit manure. (All of which at one point was soaked in rabbit urine). There's also a little rabbit fur and a bit of straw.  The pile isn't really doing anything though. The parts of it that are a year old look about the same as parts that were only added last week.  Should I buy or make a compost bin for it? Do I need to add something else to it?  Would red wiggler worms help, or would this be a medium that you could raise them in?  I've read a little about it in the past, but I don't have any experience with composting.  Edit: The pile is about 8 foot by 5 foot, and is maybe 2 feet tall at the tallest point. With nothing to contain it, it's kind of a sprawling pile. "

The only thing i can think of is that I used mostly seeds collected from last years plants. Is there a process I am unaware of as to storing the old seeds or?? the vines and leaves are otherwise healthy. thanks! let me know if i should just go back to nasturtiums next year.. I miss my flower blooms climbing all around the front window! "
3709,Is this underground compost system likely to work?,"I live in an arid area with strong winds and very hot summers. I've tried a regular compost pile but have had problems with pests (migratory rats that seem to be attracted by the smell) and the heat: it dries the pile up faster than we can add new organic material to it.  I came across the idea of having an underground compost. For this purpose, I bought this small receptacle:    My idea was to dig a hole and put it in the ground and fill it daily with organic material. I'd put drill holes in it so the excess liquid can drain. Because our soil is very loamy, I'd surround it with a layer of sand to support drainage.  What I'm hoping for is a composting system that doesn't attract any pests, and doesn't get dried out as fast as a regular overground compost. When it's done, I'd just shovel out the soil and fill it anew.    Does this make sense?   Are there any weaknesses I'm overlooking?  What size should I drill the drainage holes, and how many?  "
3710,Plants that grow well in offices,   Possible Duplicate:   What can I grow in a sealed office environment with no natural light or airflow?       Can anyone recommend a plant that do reasonably well in an office environment please?  The office is well lit but I am a good 10m away from any natural source of light.  Bonus points to something that would fruit or at least provide some colour. 
3711,Dead grass in lawn after winter,"Where I live, we have a severe rodent problem during the winter, such that when spring comes around, I have little vole/mouse trails in my lawn and patches of dead grass where the rodents had made nests.   I began raking the dead grass (not even sure if I should do that?) to find the grass was completely detached from the soil. There were a few green strands of grass here and there.   I also have patches of grass left untouched by the rodents, but it has dead/brown grass mixed in with the healthy looking stuff. This problem persists during the summer.  Should I be removing the dead grass in either case?   EDIT:  I am living in Northern Utah (Cache Valley). As far as what type of grass I have, it is a thick grass; from what I've been able to find, it looks like I either have a Ryegrass or a Kentucky Bluegrass. I am by no means a grass expert, and by that token, very experienced when dealing with lawn care. I'll post pictures as soon as the snow goes away :)         Now that the snow is gone (hopefully for good!), I was able to snap some pictures. This is the current state of my lawn; my watering schedule is every other night (I believe M, W, F). Should I rake all this dead grass?  "
3712,What are these green weeds on my grass?,"One month ago I used weed killer and waited two weeks to overseed and after seeing all weeds dead I overseed and used starter fertilizer and now I have some green weeds on my grass. What are they? what did I do wrong? Right side have no problems. I haven't seen new grass anywhere though, maybe they dried because of sun. Before overseed I did rake my grass and got rid of dead grass.  I kept soil moist all the time. Temp. was around 70-80 range. Kansas City, Missouri.  I don't know the last time it was fertilized.

3713,What else (if anything) can I support in the same pot with my lime trees?,"I have two lime trees in pots, because I need to bring them indoors during the winter.  Additionally, we recently found that keeping mint in our lawn garden was a bad idea, since it spreads so vigorously.  Can we move the mint into our pots with the lime trees to keep the mint contained?  Will the mint compete in any way with the tree itself? "
3714,How to protect my nectarine tree from hyraxes?,"I have a young nectarine tree. Some months ago, it started to give fruit, but while the fruit were still small, they were eaten by hyraxes (I saw them coming at night). Some time ago, the hyraxes ate even the leaves. Now the tree is almost naked.  The garden is surrounded by a fence, but apparently it does not help - they easily climb over it. What else can I do to protect my tree?  I thought of several solutions, not sure which if any is good:   Wrap the entire tree with a mesh. Is a simple mesh strong enough to stand the hyraxes' teeth? Install an electronic device that makes a strong tone that only hyraxes can hear, hoping it will scare them away. Is there such a tone? Put a scarecrow - since hyraxes are apparently afraid of humans. Will a simple scarecrow scare them away? Plant a thorny bush around the tree, so that the hyraxes won't be able to access it. Will this help?  "
3715,Are there any plants that shouldn't be planted near garlic?,I recall reading something on companion planting and crop rotation that mentioned some crops shouldn't be planted near or where garlic or other alliums were planted. The reason was that those plants would have stunted growth.  Is this true and if so what plants are affected by this? Are there any plants that benefit from being grown in a location where garlic was? 
3716,How can one prevent baby/recently sprouted plant disease?,"When one desires to germinate seeds in the seedling tray, he/she has to keep a humid and warm environment.

Also if you sterilize the soil will you have the same germination rate? "
3717,Dying Pony Tail Palm,"Is my ponytail palm dying and how can I save it? I have had it a few years now. Used to have lots of leaves but for the past year or so the leaves have all wilted and most recently started browning very fast. Also recently the leaves all bent over right at the top of the stalk. Any ideas why this bending happened? As for the browning, I try to cut it away but as you can see it quickly becomes brown again.   Recently I noticed its roots were growing out of the soil so repotted it, added soil, and noticed the soil stayed moist so I took it out of the new pot and let it dry then put it back and have not watered since. I heard this can be traumatic for it, but it was already looking bad like this beforehand. I’m hoping if I just leave it alone for several weeks it’ll slowly revive itself.   I live in the south where it is hot and humid. My house is usually around 77 degrees with 60% humidity. The plant does not get direct sunlight but it sits under a window without window coverings so it does get some light. I used to have it in a pitch dark room that hardly ever had blinds open and it was fine for years.   Please help!   "

3719,What should I do with leaves skimmed out of a pool?,"We moved into a house with a large in-ground pool, and have been learning to maintain it (I'm a yard-work newbie). We skim leaves and twigs out every few days, and some days there is rather a lot of them. For example after some storms this week, there was a lot of leaves in the skimmer basket and that I skimmed out manually. I can't even imagine what it will be like when the trees start losing their leaves.  Is there any preferred way to deal with this waste? What would be most practical, economical, and environmentally-friendly of my choices?   Dump them on the lawn, let them blow away? Dump them on the concrete, let them dry out and crumble? Compost them? (I have no idea if this is feasible) Accumulate them in village yard-waste bags and put them out with the trash? Something else?   We use standard chlorine tablets, occasionally augmented via chlorine ""shock"" powder, chlorine stabilizer (cyanuric acid), and simple chemicals to adjust the pH when needed. We use a basic pump and sand filter. "

3721,Succulent turning yellow,"My plant is suddenly turning yellow and I don't know what it wrong with it or if it is normal. I have it for about 4 month and this happened only this week. I don't know if it's related, but it has been very hot in my country these days.      This is a photo from a few days ago when I asked about the identification of the plant. (Euphorbia mammillaris)   edit: The yellow parts dried and I'm worried for the others. I didn't water it at all since then and I added some sand. Should I cut the dead parts?

Over several years removing the lower branches to start a new crown a bit higher up. We do not have a problem with limited space or plan to plant it on a patio "
3723,How to keep a tree and the grass around it well watered?,"I am having a problem with keep the grass around my trees green. Half a dozen trees died in the area last year, so I am trying to make sure that doesn't happen to more. I suspect I am not getting enough water to the area despite having almost maxed out my water rationing.  I remembered awhile back seeing a rod that you would stick in the ground that water a few feet below the ground level in order to keep the roots growing deep and not pulling water that the grass needs. Here is an example on Amazon. I wasn't able to find one at my local hardware store and the selection is very small online. This has got me wondering if they really don't work that well.  So, are these actually helpful to use? If not, is there any approach I should be taking to try to get enough water to this area?  My current water rationing allows me to water 2 days a week for a total of 10 hours during each of those days. Split this across 10 zones and I am maxed out at an hour per zone, 2 days a week. Currently I am watering this area for 45 minutes, 2 days a week. "
3724,Eradicating brassica aphids,"I live in Portland, OR.  Here we have a species of aphid that attacks brassicas (kale, broccoli, gai lan, etc.), and only brassicas.  They are a bit larger, and a darker blue-green than regular aphids that attack other plants.   Every method I've tried for eradicating them fails:   We have plenty of ladybugs in the yard, naturally, so much so that regular aphids and whitefly are simply not a problem.  However, our ladybugs won't eat the brassica aphids at all. Spraying them off works breifly, but requires spraying the plants every 24 hours throughout the whole growing season and isn't practical. Insecticidal soap isn't effective, unless I use it in sufficient quantities to hurt the plants (the soap causes the leaves to lose moisture somehow). New Zealand Ag recommends Entomophora fungus as a biological control, but that doesn't seem to be something one can buy in the US.   Infestations on my kale and broccoli were so bad it was killing the plants and I had to raze them all.  I'd like to be able to plant again.  Ideas?  This is related to this question but the only answer there is ""ladybugs"" and see above. "
3725,Auckland Rural Zone and Confusion about Frost Protection,"The more I look into it, the more confused I'm getting about frost protection.  Any advice to help me get a grip on the issue would be appreciated.  I have a property in Dairy Flat, which is rural Auckland, New Zealand.  Our temperatures tend to get 4 degrees centigrade colder then weather forecast (but not when there is lots of cloud), and I measured - probably inaccurately, a minimum of -3.5 degrees C last year - which came along with ice forming in water outside (and a burst hosepipe).  A large local tree seller not far away advised they got down to -5 degrees C - which killed their outdoor trees, but the trees which they place in the sheltered area were unaffected - the sheltered area being a large hothouse like structure covered in shade cloth down to 40cm above ground level.  (I understand that structures on the property and area can create micro-climates which make a big difference, but I am struggling to work out out how to accurately predict micro-climates around my property, not having had sufficient knowledge to observe these over the past year I've been at the property)  I'm struggling to understand -    How a sheltered but not waterproof area can provide such a high degree of protection as advised by the tree company - and if this is only beneficial to large plants like trees, or if it can be applied to plants like tomatos ? What US hardiness zone would be comparable to Rural Auckland (Knowing this would appear to open a world of knowledge applicable to the USA I think) ? Why a hosepipe in an area near a small, enclosed citrus fruit orchard (about 6 trees) would freeze and burst but all of the citrus trees  were fine ? What this means for my avocado avocado trees (which are 1 year old, in a  semi-sheltered environment and have been ravaged by sheep and thus  have very limited foliage going into autumn) If using an unheated 6m x 3m polytunnel will provide protection sufficient to allow me to grow tomatos, eggplants, zuchini, Cucumbers and the like through winter ? Can frost-tender plants survive sub-zero temperatures if protected from moisture, and how to work out down to what level ?   Any advice, help, resources or pointers would be appreciated. "
3726,Salvaging a Damaged Miniature Rose,"My fiancee has a miniature rose she was given as a gift, which we keep indoors as we live in an apartment. After recovering from being left in an abandoned office for a week or so, it's been thriving - survived a summer, this last winter, and into this summer.  This summer however, it got hit with a very bad case of powdery mildew, and by the time we managed to get something to treat it, it's sustained some pretty bad damage. Essentially all its leaves are curled and brittle, and it looks ""dead"" - or close to it.  Is there something that can be done to salvage it? Is there a place to cut to essentially encourage new growth and starting over? Or is it on its way out? "

3728,How should I care for a young cherry tree?,"We recently had a cherry tree planted in our garden. I don't know the age of the plant nor the exact species but it's currently below 2m (6 ft) tall, including the branches, with a thin trunk.  There are 6 branches with plenty of buds. These just started opening although I can see other cherry trees were full of flowers already at the end of February.  What care does my tree need? Is it growing normally?  UPDATE: The tree was planted early February by the estate builder. They didn't mention what kind of three it is (just ""A cherry, the one with pink flowers"") nor the age. They didn't put any compost, just dug a hole and put the tree inside.  I'm in Kent, UK.  UPDATE 2: There are a few flowers now on the tree and more are coming out but they are white, not pink. Wonder what they've planted in my garden...   "
3729,Will brickwork affect the water quality of a pond?,"I'm building a fairly large raised brick pond in the back garden. It's walled on both the inside and outside of the pond, so you can't see the foil.  the wall stretches out about 7,5 meters (24ft) round, and is about 1 meter (3ft) tall.  The wall is cemented, and flushed afterwards with normal mortar (based on portland cement)   Does the water eventually break down the interior wall? I know it will inevitably damage it by time, but will the wall hold? Does the water get effected by the mortar in such a way that it won't get 'clean'. (for plant growth purposes only)   The first year, only waterplants will inhabit the pond.  Different sources give different perspectives: some say to clean the dried wall with vinegar, others say that I have to fill the pond with water, adding 1 liter of vinegar with every 100 liter water... others say don't do anything. What to do? "
3730,"When building a cinder block wall, how do I attach/level the stacked blocks?","I am doing some garden remodeling, which includes making sunken beds for veggies. To separate the beds, I am stacking cinder blocks. The problem is that the base is not level, and there are some places where existing work means that the blocks can be offset vertically by as much as an inch.  So what I need to do is to get the second level of blocks level, and get the gaps/vertical differences filled. How do I do this? Mortar? Concrete?   Update  I need to be a little more explicit. I have the base line of blocks as level as I could get it, which is fairly close (I can usually get to about 3-5 mm). The bigger problem is where there is existing stuff that causes the office. These include fence bases, old walls, and old, buried railroad ties. I try and line up the blocks so the tops are at the same level as the obstruction, but I can't get it perfect.   The top of the cinder portion of the wall has concrete tops (landscape blocks), and even a little bit of a gap causes the blocks on top to be unsteady. I was thinking that mortar or whatever I should use might make everything more stable.  I will be walking on these (to weed, etc), and I noticed that some I built earlier are not stable. I think that the gravel might have settled, or something else. I'm not a pro, so I have done the first level incorrectly.   Thanks for any help/suggestions!  Erick "

3733,Do's and Don't's for a backyard compost?,"We have a backyard compost bin for our vegetable garden and a few flower beds. Forgive me for being a total noob on this, but can someone offer me couple of good resources on what's ok and not ok to put in it and some best practices? Currently we are trying to only put in food scraps like the fruits and veggies, used tea leaves, coffee grounds... Is it ok to put bread in it? Cheese? I think it's not ok to put in meat or highly processed foods, right?  Over the winter, we mistakenly used the compost as more of a garbage disposal and it has too much processed food in it. Is it still useable? It's kindof a large bin and we're a few weeks away from planting our garden and don't want to lose everything in there.  Edit to add: The compost bin is about 2' x 2' x 3' and it has a lid and sliding door opening toward the bottom. My husband turns it often. And we do add grass clippings, leaves, and other small backyard organics (dug up plants, etc) to it. "

3735,Grafting compatibility,"I have a fairly small yard, in which I've got a well-established (no idea of the age) mirabelle plum tree, and 3 young trees that I bought last year (malus apple, conference pear, I-forget-exactly-what-but-not-bing cherry).  I'd like to do some grafting, with the goals of providing pollinators and adding variety.  Questions concerning compatibility:   The neighbor has a quince and at least one apple tree. This year, my apple was the only one of the new trees that produced fruit. No problem grafting a scion from his apple onto mine, right? Would scions from his quince take on my apple (or pear)? I've seen online that pear, apple, and quince can be grafted together (in fact, putting an apple onto a quince rootstock is supposed to make it a dwarf). Is this true? I've also seen online that plum and cherry (and a few others...) can be grafted together. Is this true? Could I put some cherry pollinators on my plum tree? Could I put some fresh plum branches on my cherry tree (to make a ""backup"" of the old tree)?   Questions concerning technique:   The hot season (i.e., now) is when I should be T-budding, right? Why would whip-and-tongue grafts not take?  "

3738,Are muskmellons self-fertile?,I am experimenting with muskmellons this year.   Starting from seeds I kept from a melon I bought last year I was having 3 nice seedlings by the end of April. Putting them outside in May (and hoping that the weather will be warm) I had to witness 2 of them dying. But one of them is still there and now it starts flowering.  I'm sure that there are no other mellon plants nearby - hence my question: Are muskmellons self-fertile? Will I get fruits from my lonely plant? 
3739,"Willowbranch in small pond: it grows, but what now?","I have a (very) small pond (well, it's a .5x.5 bin with foil) with some still standing water inside. It's mainly inhabited by frogs, insects and visited by the local cats and contains a lot of duckweed. (it's more a 'frog ditch' than a pond...)  Last year, I put a small willow trunk in the water, and after a while, it started to grow. That is not specifically special (willows like water), but it's still growing and it has it's complications. The small branches quickly get too high which makes the trunk topple. The small branches lie in the water, and after a while, new branches start to grow. Under water, the trunk creates roots, which start to rot once they appear above water level (due to toppling).  What to do? I don't want to pull the trunk out of the water; I like the small growing willow. But what will happen once I fix the trunk in some way or another? will it grow, silt up and become a 'full blown' healthy willow tree? "
3740,Is something wrong with my zucchini plant?,"I have three large zucchini plants in my garden, and all three have been producing nice fruits for a few weeks.  The last couple days, one of them has started to turn yellow and sickly:     I've never grown zucchini before, so I'm not sure if this is just the natural progression, and the plant's life is over... or if this is a sign of some damage or disease.  If it is the latter, can I nurse the plant back to health? Or should I destroy it so it doesn't infect the remaining healthy plants?

Due to excessive heat the last two years about half the plants have died. I would like to dig up the remaining plants and move them to a better spot in the garden. Would it be better to do this in the fall or spring?  Since I'll be moving the plants and will be able to amend the soil is there anything in particular that I should add for them or is compost/composted manure good enough? 
3742,Tree identification - shelter belt,"I'm looking at buying a house.  There's a belt of trees on the south-west side, which is inside the property boundary but outside the fence.  The local council has a covenant on the property that says the trees are not to be removed ever but does permit periodic trimming, so its a glorified hedge.  Questions  What trees are these, and how could they impact my new home in the future?  Do they drop leaves all year long and block up guttering?   The area is known for cold antarctic winds from the south and southwest so this line of trees is a good thing for wind reduction. Latitude is around 43.6 south and an elevation of about 50 metres. Its in the South Island of New Zealand, in Canterbury. Trees are definitely evergreens not deciduous. Snow is rare but not impossible.  These trees will have survived at least three snowfalls in 2010 (and none since) There appears to be a ""dead"" core visible in the aerial photo - Trees are definitely more than 9 years old and probably 15-30 years old.       2009 photo showing a recent cut/prune    2009 growth   2012 growth  All imagery is from Google maps or streetview and their licence applies.

3746,How do I control weeds and moss on a brick walkway and driveway?,"I have a brick driveway and a brick walkway.  There is no grout between the bricks.  In the sunny areas, small weeds grow between the bricks.  In the shadier areas, moss grows between the bricks.  The moss isn't that slimy moss like in  How do I remove moss from an outdoor brick walkway?.  It's just the dense, fuzzy stuff between the cracks.  I just spent a couple hours clearing one walkway's cracks with an old debit card.  It looks great now.  The driveway and other walkways are next.  There really isn't all that much, but I'd like to discourage future growth if possible.  I've heard vinegar might be an option.  Does vinegar work to discourage moss, or is it only good for weeds?  Is there a better natural way to do it?  I've seen suggested filling the cracks with sand, but at this time, I'm looking for a spray option, rather than adding sand to the mix.  (Unless of course sand is the best option.) "
3747,Why do people paint some tree trunks white at the bottom?,I've seen trees with the lower trunks painted white in a number of places around the world but have never found a definite answer to why this is done. Some suggestions that I've heard are to make them more visible at night time so people don't walk into them. Another is to make it easier for birds to see bugs on the trunk. Does anybody know why you would paint part of a tree white? What type of paint you would use? And why that paint doesn't damage the tree? 
3748,What are those red dots on the leaf stems of my cherry trees?,"While inspecting another problem I observed that most of the leaves are having two red dots (or very small bulbs, maybe cocoons) at the stems of their leaves: it is something harmful or even a pest? If so, do I need to do something?   "
3749,Why do plants need water?,"Might seem like a stupid question at first, but let's think about this for a minute.  Obviously, the living tissues contain some water, but it seems negligible compared to the quantities that plants can seem to require.  Ask practically any child, or non-expert, ""What do plants need?"" And you'll probably get some variation of the same answer, ""Sunlight and water"", every now and then, you might even get ""Carbon-dioxide"".     Light is understandable, right? Because, photosynthesis:   &nbsp; &nbsp;     Dihydrogen-monoxide (water) and carbon-dioxide (exhalation) are also required for oxygenic photosynthesis:  CO2 + H2O + photons→ [CH2O] + O2    Or more specifically:  6CO2 + 6H2O + photons→ [C6H12O6] + 6O2    But still, I feel like this doesn't really account for the entirety of water spent (even considering evaporation, drainage, etc). Otherwise (it seems), we could flood LED lit, hydroponic greenhouses with pure carbon-dioxide, and watch the plants grow, science-fiction style.    Am I missing something here, or am I just incorrect? "
3750,Leaves at the tip on new branches of my cherry-trees are wrinkled,"On my cherry-trees I observed that the leaves of the tips of newly grown branches are wrinkled and inside there is something which simply said looks like black dirt. The leaves do not look damaged, only their form has suffered,   It seems that only tips are affected which are not higher than 1.5 to 2m from the ground.   Additionally I saw that several ants where walking on the branches.   Is this a pest? Could it be an ant-tribe which is farming? Do I need to do something?  Click to enlarge the images    "
3751,What is happening to my squash/cucurbita?,"I have planted in a pot the seeds of a squash/cucurbita (this type) and it was growing very quick and nicely.  In the last couple of days I noticed that the leaves looks half dead/sick, and I don't know what is the cause and what can be done - is it bad treatment (water, sun etc.) or a disease? What can be done to help it?  Of course I can remove the infected/dead leaves, but I'd like to know what is it and how to approach it to improve it.         (I guess that if it will become bigger I'll have to transport it to a bigger pot or to the ground)  Thanks! "
3752,How should I harvest Basil leaves as to be least harmful to the plant?,"I have a small basil plant similar to this one:    Mine's actually a bit smaller, but well.  I cut leafs off it for cooking but I try to keep the plant healthy by not using up more than can grow back. I'm under the impression (I'm no expert at all!) that the plant would die if I remove too much leafs.  However, I still want to maximise the output while keeping the plant alive and healthy. So I wonder which algorithm to use when picking which leaf to take. Should I prefer leafs from the top, from the bottom? Perhaps always pick the largest leafs? Does it even matter? "
3753,Why is my philodendron getting these brown dry parts on its leaves?,"Why is my philodendron getting these brown dry parts on its leaves?  You can see in the attached photo where it is starting to get brown (bottom left). In the second photo you can see that almost the whole middle of the leaf turned brown and cracked in half.  However, since this pic it has developed further on this leaf, as well on other leaves on this plant.  I got frustrated the other day and cut out all brown parts on each leaf; I hope I didn't damage it more.  Just an FYI it's still planted in the original planter that I purchased this in.    "
3754,"My chilies look weak, what is the problem?","My chilies do not look good since a couple of weeks.   They look generally weak: the leaves are quite pale/yellowy, and many drooping or even falling. Some leaves are turning all black starting from the exterior. Many are not growing anymore since a month or two.   What do you think is going on? What can I do?    "
3755,Fall seeding a lawn in Northern Ontario,"I live in Northern Ontario, where evenings below freezing start in October, and snow begins as early as November.  I'm looking to aerate and seed my lawn.  I've read that Spring and Fall are the best times to do that.  Being in Northern Ontario, is Fall too late in the year to effectively aerate and seed a lawn?  I would imagine that for seeding to be effective, the seeds should have time to germinate before frost.  Should ""Fall"" really be ""End of Summer""?  Would Spring be a better time? "
3756,Alpine strawberries growing conditions,"I remember eating the most flavourful and fragrant alpine strawberries in Germany a few years ago, and I'd like to try growing them in my garden in South Africa. The climate is obviously quite different here, most notably the temperature never goes below 0 degrees in my area.  Do alpine strawberries (Fragaria vesca, also known as wild strawberry or woodland strawberry) require any particular climate in order to grow and bear fruit? Some berries require below-zero temperatures, and I wonder whether this is also true of alpine strawberries? For the record, ordinary strawberries grow quite well here, so this question pertains to alpine strawberries in particular. "
3757,"How can I save seeds from a large, fast-growing arugula plant?","I planted arugula seeds in small containers. They are all so tiny, except one plant that grew very fast and looks dramatically healthier bigger and just different from the rest of them. It might be a mutation since they are all in the exact same circumstances. I would like to let it seed so that I have more of that container-robust variety. I am not sure when it will flower as it has already been in the pot about a month and is not doing anything but growing! Any ideas? Will it die if I leave it longer? "
3758,How to sell seeds,"If I wanted to start selling seeds (for example, tomatoes), how would I go about doing that? Do I have to grow my own strains, and then harvest the seeds, or is there places where you have to buy seeds (like a wholeseller)? "

3761,Why are holes and divots typically filled with a sand mix?,"I was taking a lunch time walk at work and noticed some council workers filling in a sizable patch (about 1m square) with soil. I've noticed this done on golf courses and also on sports grounds and I am curious to find out. Why are divots, and small ditches filled in with sand or with a very sandy soil with very minimal organic matter?  My brother used to work on a golf course and the typical thing for someone to do to fill in a sizable divot is to fill the spot with sand.  Why is this the case?  You can see an example of this here: [website]"
3762,Can tree cuttings root in just water?,"I have rooting powder already, so this is more of a curiosity question. Can tree cuttings root in just water? Or, has it ever been accomplished?  "
3763,Why are cut roses doing so much better in a ceramic vase than a crystal vase?,"I have two dozen cut roses, one dozen in a crystal vase, and one dozen in a Lenox ceramic vase. We're in a dry (70&deg;F) heated house in the middle of winter, and the roses in the ceramic vase are far happier (less wilting) than their crystal counterparts, despite their identical light exposure and watering.  Is this a property of the material of the vase? Should I only put these roses in ceramic from now on?  These were purchased as two-dozen, and were mixed prior to cutting: The roses are identical in every way I can imagine, except for their vase.  [EDIT]: Some pictures!     To wit, the diameters of the openings (and the water levels) are the same in both containers. "
3764,"Will this 20,000k LED bulb function as a grow light?","I see a 20,000k (color temperature) 12 watt LED E27 bulb designed for coral, aquariums and such. 7000k is supposed to be full-spectrum light, I hear. So, I imagine a 20,000k would be even more full-spectrum.  I realize 12 watts isn't going to be as powerful as sunlight.  Anyway, how effective is this going to be as a grow light for vegetables compared to blue and red LED 12 watt grow lights? Will it have infrared and UV rays?  Here's a link to the product if you're curious. (select the 20,000k option)  They also have a 10,000k bulb.  Since they're marketed for helping coral to grow, I imagine there's more to it than merely giving the appearance of 20,000k light, but I could be wrong.  EDIT: I ordered one bulb, and a blue one from the same seller. So, I guess I'll be able to answer this question within a month or two (granted there's no red in the light to compare in that regard).

3767,Is there an almond that grows inside a peach?,"I see that Luther Burbank wrote a book on the subject around a hundred years ago. But I don't have access to that book. Was he, or anyone else, successful?  I thought that I had seen something like that for sale in a catalog long ago, but I can't seem to find any reference to it with a Google search. I can't even seem to find anyone talking about it, besides Burbank.  Here's the Google Books link to the page of the preview that looks most relevant.  Additionally, does any edible nut in an edible fruit exist? That is, what did I probably actually see in a fruit and nut tree catalog if almond in a peach doesn't exist? "
3768,How to have constant supply of dill throughout summer?,"I really like dill, so I would like to have a constant supply of it in my garden.   However, every time I sow dill, it grows and has some leaves, eventually flowers and I am left without any of it.   Having recently read the question on Best conditions for basil  I have seen how beneficial flower pinching is.  My question is, can dill's life be prolonged by removing the flowers and pinching the stem? Or is it just a plant with short lifespan and the only way of having constant supply of it is by reseeding every 2-4 weeks? "
3769,What purpose do these towers serve in drip irrigation?,"I bought a foreclosed house that already had drip irrigation installed. The system can be turned on via a control panel in the garage. The previous owner was angry that he lost his house so he snipped many of the irrigation tubes before leaving. I've ripped out most of the snipped tubes and thrown them away, in preparation of redoing the whole drip irrigation system. What remains are these tower like structures spaced about 7 feet away of each other.    What purpose do these serve?  Are they connected to my water supply? So should I be wary of flooding the backyward by pulling these things out?  Should I replace them with new ones or are they too expensive / time consuming to replace?    "
3770,Will potted HOYA grow well in Los Angeles?,I live in Southern California (Los Angeles) and it can be quite hot and dry here (low humidity). Can I grow potted Hoya? Does it tolerate/prefer direct sunlight or just bright light? Can it be grown indoors? Where would I find it to purchase? I have never seen it in any nursery.  Thanks for your help! Dido 
3771,Should I be concerned about these purple stems and dead leaves?,"I have a small mint plant that a friend grew from a cutting and gave me. He had it in a tiny pot, so I transferred it to another pot in pretty short order, and it's certainly been growing. I have not yet used any sort of fertilizer on it. Recently, I've noticed some of the stems are purple, and those purple stems have dead leaves. Here's a picture:    One possible cause that I'm aware of is that it's gotten too much water. I generally keep it out on a window sill, but it's been raining a lot the past few days. Would it be better to keep it inside until the weather clears up (or at least until the soil dries out a bit)?  But more to the point, should I actually be worried about this at all, or is this considered normal behavior for mint? "
3772,Mugho Pine browning,"I have a Mugho pine in my front yard this is browning. I've examined it and it appears that dead needles and excess mulch exist, and roots are growing up into the mulch -- a process that I've read is not healthy.  I'd like to clear away some of the excess mulch to help properly water the pine, but don't know what to do with the secondary roots -- can they be reburied? Should I cut them?   "
3773,Why do the leaves of my (very young) Eureka lemon tree look folded?,"(Edited to add more detail and an update at the end)  I have a small Eureka lemon tree that is few months old, and is currently showing signs of weakness that are worrying me. In more detail, some time ago it was withering: following this question, I moved it to another pot with drainholes and changed the soil, after which it started making new leaves (while the 3 it had before, probably dead, kept on withering).  But now, for a couple days its new leaves have started pointing downwards, and folding (picture below). This looks quite abnormal to me (isn't it?), and I have started worrying: what is wrong, and what can I do?   Rk: the big leaf behind is one of the 3 from before it got better, and probably dead. The other ones however are new, and for instance the small one at the top is folded...    (Too much water? Not enough? Too cold? The pot is inside, next to a window pointed East.)    Edit: after a few days trying to give it more sun (moving it to a South-facing window whenever possible in the afternoon), it does not have improved, far from it:    (the picture was taken this morning, just after I watered it)  Also, in case this was not clear: the transplant was 3 weeks/one month ago, not a couple days. Now, not only the leaves, but also the stem is getting brown and dry. I am really at a loss, and am afraid it is dying quite fast. "

3776,Infestation of Locust borers on Black locust tree. Too late for it?,"Over this season I've narrowed down my black locust tree to having possible locust borer problems.  I used an insecticide tree and shrub drench in June after seeing the tale tell signs, with a ring of wood dust on the ground.  There are little holes sporadically through the tree trunk and branches, and a few small limbs broke from the damage caused. They gave way after some stronger winds, which would have normally held up okay.  This weekend I noticed them crawling all over the the tree (Which seems common for this species in late August and September). Is it better to cut this tree down in November, or spray it with Sevin and try to save it? Will Sevin 500 work? I read Carbaryl is effective and there is a Sevin with Carbaryl in it, but only available for purchase over Amazon or online. No local hardware stores carry it, just the Sevin 500 series. Carbaryl seems to have some possible harmful side effects to humans (more than most chemicals used in insecticides) so I am thinking that's why Sevin with Carbaryl isn't readily available in my local hardware stores, like the Sevin 500.   I've had a previous question for more details earlier in the season: Tree not getting leaves in one section     "
3777,Fastest way to move dirt using only an excavator?,"While watching the neighbor go at a huge pile of loose dirt (500 tons+) with a mini excavator (2.7tonne) I got to pondering whether it's faster to drag the dirt (pile it round the excavator) move the excavator back, drag again.. or whether it's faster to take a bucket full, slew 180, dump it, repeat essentially moving the pile by whatever the max distance is between a full arm extent at 0 degrees and a full arm extent at 180?  Personally I've always dragged the pile because I find the slew action much slower than the arm and dragging can move more dirt in one hit than a grading bucket can hold but the neighbor has more driving experience and he's using the slew 180 method. The aim of the exercise is to move the dirt from A to B then spread it out, so it's not too much of a worry if the ground in between gets messed up   I'm wondering if there are industry pros on here with thoughts on which technique (or even another technique) is more effective?   Of course the best way is to get a large dump truck and it a bigger excavator, but if you could only get the excavator, what would you do? "
3778,Can I cut the top off my Lace Aloe plant?,"It is having trouble supporting its own weight, and I am hoping that cutting off the top (where it starts to droop) would let it grow more full, rather than just tall. Would that work? Does it work with all plants?? I have a few that seem to have this issue.   "
3779,Are these black pods something to do with wasps?,"I have a tree that is swarming with wasps. I cannot see a nest but assume there is one somewhere. I also noticed the tree is covered in patches of black pod types things:  Are the two things related? If not, what could these pods be?  This is in the south of the UK. "
3780,Is it OK to plant Daffodils on a forest floor?,"I'd like to plant Daffodil bulbs in a forested area visible from a kitchen window. The area in question belongs to the homeowner, has no understory (deer browse) or early season ground cover, and is canopied by oak and hickory trees of varying age. Later in the spring the area would be covered almost 100% with wild sarsaparilla (Aralia nudicaulis)  Would Daffodils do OK or establish in such a setting? Why or why not? "
3781,Some of my walnut trees have double trunks. Is it safe and wise to remove one?,I have bought an orchard which has some walnut that are about 10 years old. These walnuts have been never pruned. Some of them have two or three trunks. Is it safe or wise to remove one of them?   Can I remove left and right branch from below tree? or they are too thick to be removed.  
3782,Why does my peppermint have long purple stems with very small leaves?,For the past few months I have been trying to grow a peppermint plant indoors. It grows pretty well except for a few stems that have gone purple and only seem to be able to grow these small leaves and seem to be trying to dig their way into the substrate. Should I be concerned about it? What is the cause of these stems?    
3783,Can blossom end rot appear on side of pepper?,"Some of my bell peppers have rotting spots that look like blossom end rot, but in each case, the rotten spot is high on the side of the pepper, nearer the stem than the end. Could this be blossom end rot? Or is it some other problem?  The weather has been perfect for causing blossom end rot (hot and dry, followed by days of heavy rain).  Update: See photo. "
3784,How can I tell the difference between etiolation and a sunburn?,"I'm attempting to grow plants from seed during the winter, by using a desk lamp and a timer to simulate 12 hour days.  Since I know sprouts require a lot of light, I placed the desk lamp such that the bulb is about 2 inches (5cm) away from the soil.  The bulb is a 60W incandescent.  Unfortunately, there's something wrong with the one surviving sprout.  The leaves are yellowed, with tinges of brown at the edges.  The plant still engages in heliotropic behavior - that is, a few hours after moving the lamp, the leaves have moved to face the bulb.  The plant is a Sweet Basil.  I've never tried this before, so it's hard to tell if a) the bulb is too hot too close, and is burning the plant or b) the bulb is too dim, and the plant cannot complete sufficient photosynthesis.  A Google image search shows leaves with this coloration for both etiolated and sunburned plants.  How can I tell if the plant is etiolated or sunburned?  Alternatively, in this specific case, is it burned or etiolated?   "
3785,What to do with bugs on bell peppers,"I just noticed that I have these weird little bugs on my bell peppers.

Thanks in advance "
3786,Separating landscaping from short foundation and low wood siding,"We have a house with a concrete block foundation, a layer of brick on the outside visible portion of the foundation, and painted wood siding that comes down to within an inch of the surrounding ground.   We have a very shallow pitch from the side of the house out to the street, but want to put in landscaping beds around the house. What's the best way to put in the beds but keep moisture away from the wood siding?   We're considering:   Raising the beds as little as we can and keep the height low next to the house Putting a 12-inch barrier of gravel between the house and the beds Put a vinyl cover over the bottom layer of the siding (one landscaping contractor suggested this, but we're worried that it would just trap moisture against the siding)   What would be the best way to go keeping moisture away from the bottom of the house?   "
3787,What do I have to pay attention to with pre-potted growing sets of herbs?,"I'm very inexperienced with gardening and I got two growing sets from IKEA, including sets for basil, parsley, peppermint, coriander, oregano and thyme. Most of them have begun to grow and it seems they are in good shape so far:    [website]I bought the basil, parsley and peppermint first and the other 3 were added later. Now the IKEA instructions don't tell me a lot about how to take care of the herbs, which is why I'm asking here.   Do I have to repot them at some point? In the IKEA pictures, it seems they can be left in the included pots for a very long time, but I don't know if that's a good thing. If I have to repot them, can I put a few of them (say 2-3) in a single pot or do I have to put them in separate pots? They are currently sitting on a window sill facing east inside my living room (I don't have a lot of light in my kitchen unless I turn the lights on). Should I put them somewhere else where they are not exposed to direct sunlight or will they be fine? How often should I water them? I have some other indoor plants too, and the way I have to take care of them varies a lot, some need the earth to almost always be wet whereas others should be left until the earth has become a bit dry. Do I need to use fertilizer at some point? Which one? What do I have to pay attention to if I want them to survive the winter? And most importantly: When do I know that I can use them for cooking? What do I have to pay attention to when I use them? Should I only use a few branches every time?   Thanks a lot in advance for any help! "
3788,Why aren't my new echinaceas true perennials?,"The purple coneflower (Echinacea purpurea) is one of my favorite flowers; it's easy to grow, cheap, spreads quickly (giving me lots of new plants to spread around) and looks good over a long season (I leave the seedheads up for the birds).  I so fell in love with purple coneflower that I planted other types as well, White swan, some of the Big Sky hybrids, and others.  I bought and planted in the spring, in well-draining loamy soil and full sun (watering them in, and appropriately until established), fed only early in the season with Osmocote giving them an opportunity to establish. To my disappointment, none of the newer varieties came back more than for one additional season (except for White Swan, which has done well.  I decided that either I know a lot less about gardening than I thought I did, the new echinaceas are weak, or maybe both.  Has anyone else had success with the newer echinaceas? Are some better than others? At this point, I don't even know why they're labeled as perennials.  Can anyone tell me why I am incapable of keeping the newer varieties? I am in zone 6b, but my microclimate is probably more like zone 6. "
3789,How (and when) should I prune a grape vine that's mainly for shade?,"I have a vine growing up my porch, mainly ornamental/for shade in summer and a windbreak in autumn.  I did get some grapes last year (a little sharp and pippy, but tasty) but my climate is marginal for them to ripen especially given that it gets quite a lot of shade.  Any edible grapes are a bonus, and I've been known to stuff a few leaves as well.  The vine has been in the ground about 3 years, and this summer's growth was quite prolific; I need to do something to keep it manageable.  Last year I just trimmed it a bit, without too much thought.  All the guidance I've seen online has been about pruning for cropping.  Should I cut it back hard? Will this keep plenty of leaves low down?  Will it grow back nicely if I cut back to old wood, or must I leave some green?  What time of year is best to prune? "
3790,Identify root growing from tree?,"What is this white plant growing from the tree? The host tree (not the white root) is about 30” tall.  I was checking the soil from this tree because it was deteriorating pretty fast and I wasn’t sure what the problem was.  So I remove it from the planter and I notice this white root growing. The tree is basically dead, but this white thing is growing.  I was about to throw it away when I noticed this.   Can anyone identify this plant and should I still throw it away?

3792,How to care for bent avocado tree,"I have an avocado tree I started from a pit. It has lived in upstate New York indoors and has grown tall and skinny. I recently moved to Atlanta, Georgia and so can have it outdoors more. The tree is somewhat crooked.    Should I prune it? (Possibly even cutting off the top half of the tree?) Should I get a bigger pot? Should I get some kind of system going to stabilize and/or straighten it out?  Should I keep it outside all of the time?    "
3793,Methodology and resources for planning a perennial flower garden,"I'm new to landscaping and completely unfamiliar with different types of flowers and bulbs. What is the best way to plan a small perennial flower garden? Is there a website with charts comparing common flowers, bloom times, sun requirements, height, etc? I've looked online but haven't found anything comprehensive. Am I even going about this right? What is the best way to learn and plan? "
3794,Taking a cutting from cherry Tree,"I'm travelling around various family members all over the UK for the next week.   The family members I'm with at the moment have a really gorgeous cherry tree that I would really like a cutting from, but won't get it home to do the actual rooting (hormone and potting) for another 5 days.  How long after taking the cutting off of the tree will it remain possible to successfully root it?   Is there anything I can do to maximise my chances of getting it home healthy? I would obviously take a few cuttings to increase my chances, but wondered if it is even worth it. "
3795,How to setup a green house that loses heat but not humidity,"I'm deciding to build a green house to grow some of my favorite plants. My place is quite hot and dry, and water is very precious. My priority is to keep humidity inside. But I couldn't find a solution about that. The normal green houses use fans and open windows to replace hot air with cool air from outside to control the temperature. But I guess ventilation like that means losing humidity which makes it require more water insertion into the green house.  Is there any design or solution for this? Or maybe I'm not considering something here?    update  I guess I should have explained more that I'm more interested not to lose water instead of having a very humid green house. I don't want to face a dried green house that needs watering several times a day.  I thought that a humid air will keep the pots from drying off, but now that it introduces the danger of fungus,  I think an AC will be the best Idea here; Both to cool the air and converting humidity into water for later use.

3798,Lemon Cucumbers Pollinating Pickling Cucumbers,This year I tried to grow two cucumbers. Lemon and Pickling cucumbers. However I am only seeing Lemon Cucumbers show up on all of the vines. Would cross pollination cause the other vines to grow Lemon Cucumbers? I am positive that I planted a row of both types of cucumbers. They are not that far apart and maybe that was a mistake on my part. Has anyone ever heard of this happening? How far apart should I be planting different type of cucumbers to avoid this. 
3799,Will creeping jenny kill my honeysuckle vine?,I planted a honeysuckle vine from a pot that also contained creeping jenny. The creeping jenny took off and is thick around the base of the vine. Now the leaves on the honeysuckle are yellow and some have dried. Flower production was minimal this summer. Should I remove the creeping jenny? It seems to be comingled with the roots of the honeysuckle. Or is it a nitrogen problem?

3801,"Root system size and planting distance from smokebush (smoke tree, cotinus coggygria) to wall","Am thinking of planting a smoke bush in an area that is enclosed by a retaining wall, but am concerned about the root system eventually growing big enough to displace the wall.  How can I estimate the eventual root system size to prevent or mitigate displacement of the wall?  Note: I am a shrub and tree novice. So if my question or the way I've asked it seems ""off the mark"" or if more info is needed, then of course that feedback is welcome. I did an online search and found articles that stated the ""spread"" as 10-18 feet, but could not determine if that referred to the spread of the branches, the roots, or both.  For example, if I know the eventual root size, then do I add some additional distance between the wall and smokebush, such as roots = 15 feet so planting distance is 15 feet + 5 feet? "
3802,What to do with fallen fruit?,"I have lots of fruit trees, some of them fairly old, and some of them just drop significant number of fruit. some of them prematurely, some of them naturally. Anyway, most of them are not for human consuption - and I am not concerned about loss of them.  However, what to do with them?  A. Leave them where they fell. (but mowing could be tricky)  B. Collect them and put in the compost pile.  C. Collect them and put around other selected plants.  D. Collect them and throw them over the fence to neighbor's yard.  E. Collect them and put in garbage.  F. ??? "
3803,Why does it matter so much in which season to prune?,"When I read about pruning the proper season to do it is often specified, and differs between plants. Why should the season matter? Are there actual risks to pruning at the wrong time, or is it just a matter of the time a plant takes to to start sending new growth around the cut parts? "
3804,How should I deal with garlic rust after the harvest?,"I've grown garlic that got infected with garlic rust. I had some luck in that the infection started late in the spring so the bulbs are actually pretty big - around 60g, cleaned.  The garlic stems and leafs are heavily infected by now. I've found some resources that say the disease is air borne and it is okay to compost the foliage, others say the opposite. I am looking for an authoritative answer on whether or not I should compost them.  Also, can the harvested bulbs be used as seed next year?  Does the disease spread to the cloves? Does it affect storage longevity? As with the previous question, I am getting some mixed search results so an authoritative answer is desired.  Thanks for helping me out! "
3805,Rocks and sticks in loam used by landscaper. What to do?,"6 days ago I had a landscaping company perform a lawn renovation. The first few inches of the existing turf was removed and new loam was trucked in, followed by hydroseeding.   Shortly after the hydroseeding, we had some pretty torrential rains overnight. Now looking at the soil, countless rocks and sticks seem to have been exposed or surfaced by the rain. The entire yard is covered in rocks and twigs, some upwards of an inch, some sticks measuring several inches or longer. They quote was for screened loam, but now I'm dubious and I don't know how to proceed. If it was screened it was clearly screened to maybe an inch at best. It looks like total crap and I worry about the impact on the grass and the ability to mow it safely. I'm not sure how to proceed.   Is this normal, or am I getting screwed? Can this be raked out without damaging the seedlings and requiring re-seeding? Any advice appreciated.    "
3806,Should I thin out apples or let the 'June Drop' take care of this?,"June Drop is where apple trees (maybe others?) tend to fruit prolifically from every flower, then naturally thin out a lot as the fruit start to grow - typically around June.  I'm unsure if this means apples should be left to their own devices, or I should intervene for best crop results? If so, how should I do this and should it be before or after the June drop occurs? "
3807,Is this rose seed going to germinate?,"I am trying to germinate this rose seed, first I soaked this one seed into the egg incubator at 40 celsius lukewarm temperature water for nearly 1 week or less. Before when it was unsoaked I saw its seed coat is yellow, after soaking its seed coat turned half mixed yellowish with little reddish color, next when I put this seed into a terracotta pot and sprayed it, its coat turns fully reddish brown then its coat splits and inside theres a white thing from it but no signs of a stem coming out through it, does this mean its embryo is dead inside or still alive from the warm soaking that I just did? Is it still going to germinate if I wait longer? I think its white embryo inside is plumper now than last time when I tried to germinate it without soaking in the warm water then put into the soil and it looks skinny or flattish.  "
3808,Continuously replacing privacy garden hedge while maintaining privacy,"I want to replace thuja hedge with something else (e.g. amelanchier), but I want to maintain privacy during the process.  What are my options? Can I keep some thujas and growing amelanchier between them and continously swap thujas for amelanchiers?  Or is only possible way to completely dig out thujas, plant new plants and in the meantime use some privacy screen on fence? "
3809,How helpful are whirligig mites?,"I've noticed these guys in the garden for years but never bothered to find out what they are. They are bright red, move with great speed, have a single body, and 8 legs.     Seems it's actually a whirligig mite which is supposed to be a predatory insect that eats mites and aphids, and possibly scale insects.  What role do they have in pest management in a home garden? Should I move them to aphid or pysllid infested plants?  I found them roaming amongst the carrots and what's left of the potatoe leaves. "
3810,What's wrong with this basil plant's leaves?,"Bought this basil about 2 weeks ago. It dried out a lot so I gave it a good soak by putting it in a pan full of water so the water would go up from the bottom.  Now the ends of some leaves have gone brown. Has this been caused by too much water? how often should I water it?  It's from a garden centre, not the supermarket 'living basil' pots.    "
3811,Is my bird of paradise too crowded? Should I divide or repot it?,"I have 3 bird of paradise plants in a 16"" pot, and I am worried that they are getting too crowded. I water them 1-2 times per week and fertilize about every 3 months using 19-6-12 Osmocote smart-release plant food. I live in Seattle, WA, so they have been inside about October-April, and I just moved them outside.  I understand they like to be crowded, but I wonder if their current condition is too crowded. Should I divide them, or get a bigger pot? Or should I just leave them as is?       "
3812,"Banana plant leave stems broken, cut off completely or splint it?",I bought a 2ft tall banana plant with some pretty large leaves from a nursery. It is in good health but unfortunate a few large stems broke during transport. It is still connected but no longer able to support the weight of the large leaf.  I tried to splinter the stem with a pencil and tape to hold it up. Is this a worthless effort? Should I cut the stems off?  How fast can I expect the stems to grow back? This is planted in a 16 gallon pot on a south facing balcony. What are some tips to make the recovery fast? 
3813,Why is the seed coat opening now?,"After eating a Honeycrisp apple, I thought I would dry the seeds out and attempt the germination process, just for fun. One apple produced eight seeds, so I sat them on a paper towel to dry them before starting the winterizing process. In a matter of 3-4 days, however, the seed coating started opening and some of the inner white seeds have come out on their own. Is this normal? Does it impact the steps I should take to winterize the seeds to prepare them for germination/implantation?   "
3814,Please identify this plant?,"I also saw this plant in a house in Florida. The fruit (if that’s what it is) is small, it’s the same diameter as a regular pencil.  Can anyone identify it? And is it edible?  This is what the inside of the fruit looks like:        "
3815,eating stalks and seeds of bolted lettuce,"I often put leaves from bolted lettuce into my fruit-veggie smoothie. The smoothie tastes great. I wonder if I could also put the actual STALKS of bolted lettuce into the smoothie? I’ve searched on Web “are bolted lettuce stalks edible” , “are bolted lettuce stalks nutritious”, etc. but get nothing (except info about the Chinese stalk-lettuce).  And some bolted stalks have seeds at the top.  Are the seeds edible?  Nutritious?  Again, web search has yielded no info. "
3816,How to trim a rubber tree plant when all of the leaves are at the top,"I want to trim my rubber tree because it is too tall, but many of the leaves have fallen off. Now, there are only a few leaves left, and they are all at the top.   I water it about once per week and fertilize about every 3 months using 19-6-12 Osmocote smart-release plant food. I live in Seattle, WA, so it has been inside about October-April, and I just moved it outside.  Also, instead of cutting off the branch, I was going propagate the trimmed section into a separate plant using air-layering. But where should I cut it?  I think the plant hasn't been doing very well because it lost a lot of leaves over the winter while indoors. I just moved it outside, so I hope to strengthen its stores before beginning the trimming/air-layering process.          Update:  I think I will follow @stormy's and @Bamboo's advice by doing the following:   repot the plant and only use distilled water. cut down the mainstem to the highest lateral, and propagate it air layering on the side of the longest remaining lateral and propagate it   Does anyone have suggestions about the timing of these tasks? Here is my schedule: I repot first, wait 3-4 weeks, cut mainstem and propagate, wait 1-2 weeks, air-layer and propagate.  Also, just to be sure, where should I cut the mainstem and where should I perform the air layering on the longest remaining lateral? Here is a labelled photo of my plan:   "
3817,Drying and curled up leaves on pluot tree,"We planted the tree about 2 months ago. It was thriving beautifully. Last week suddenly the leaves curled up and dried becoming brown. It coincided with dry days (I’m in northeast) so I started watering it every day but so far it hasn’t recovered. The main stem and branches look,healthy and their tips are still green.  I tried to give it plant food but noticed no difference. My neighbor suggested it may have used up all the good soil from the pot where it came and now it is facing the clay soil in my house. Is it possible? Is it dying? Any suggestions? Thanks. "
3818,"I have planted some seeds but they don't grow to a full plant, why is this?","I bought some seeds such as the following (pepper), but there are also seeds of other plants. I'll use this one as an example.     In the back, there are instructions:     It instructs to plant in a 0,5cm hole, and then when the plant gets a little bigger, one should transplant it to the definitive place the plant is going to stay. I have tried to do plant it directly but the seeds germinated and grew to a maximum height of ~1cm. I have these questions:    Does direct planting works for these seeds?  Why do they suggest to plant and then transplant?  Why didn't the plants grow to a full plant?   "
3819,Is my pineapple dying,  I have been growing this pineapple for about two months and recently the fruit started turning brownish. Is it dying or have a problem? What should I do? 
3820,Pruning versus girdling,"If I were to prune a branch, it would interrupt the flow of auxin in the cambium and release buds below that have been held in stasis (of course there must be cyokinins in the tissues below to release the buds; i.e., the plant is actively growing). If instead I girdled the branch, I would also interrupt the flow of auxin to the tissues below and this ought to release buds in stasis just like decapitating the branch.  Am I right/wrong that girdling and pruning are equivalent in this respect (and why please)? In other words, is girdling and pruning equivalent as far as the response of the rest of the plant is concerned?  Girdling is removing a ring of bark completely around the stem. This also removed the phloem or inner bark in which sugars from photosynthesis are transported down the tree from the foliage toward the roots. This also removes nearly all of the vascular cambium through which auxin is transported from cell to cell (like a bucket brigade). However within a day or two exposed to the air any residual cambium cells desiccate and die - in effect, girdling also removes all of the cambium. The xylem (wood) remains in tact, supplying water and minerals to the portion of the branch above the girdle.  A girdle cuts off the flow of auxin to the branch just below the girdle as well as sugars from above. Pruning cuts off the flow of auxin and sugar as well. Yet many people tell me that pruning will release more buds than making a girdle. I cannot understand how this could be true. Is the effect really different? And if it is, I am very interested in an explanation of why. "
3821,Planting immature garlic,"This year's garlic got infected with garlic rust. The bulb's are actually decent size (60-80g), but I have a feeling that the garlic didn't mature due to being heavily infected. The leaves are completely dry, but the stem and cloves look like they might need some more time.  Garlic was planted in October, 10 weeks before the first frost due to unusually warm weather we had and harvested today.   Is it okay to plant garlic cloves that were harvested too early? Will such garlic develop normally? "
3822,What ate the leaves of my pepper and tomato plants?,"  All the damage occurred over the course of one sunny day while I was at work, several pepper plants and young tomato plants defoliated severely.  I suspect rabbits as I've seen some around and I haven't seen any worms, but my friend isn't convinced.  Are there any insects that could cause this much damage in a single day?   Edit: Also, are there any indicators this ISN'T rabbit damage? "
3823,How do I inoculate plants with garden giant when not disturbing the soil?,"I'm wanting to hook my plants into Garden Giant spawn, but not disturb the soil. How can I best, and quickly put the spawn into the plants while not harming the plants?  Is it reasonable to put a shovel in, open up the ground, and put a little spawn in the hole? "
3824,Why does my green giant arborvitae have so many buds?,I have about 10 green giant evergreens and only one of them has what I call large buds on the tips of the branches. Why only this one shrub? Some branches are so loaded that they are drooping?

3826,What's the function/purpose of the waterproof tarp a few inches beneath the ground in my yard?,"When I tried to plant some plants and dug up a hole in my front yard, it appeared that there is a waterproof, at least it appeared to me so, tarp under the soil and mulch mixture, and it extends to a very large area, probably as large as most of my yard. The material of the tarp looks similar to this.    Source  What is it called? What is its function/purpose? When planting perennial plants, should I dig through this tarp or not? If not, the depth of the soil/mulch does not seem deep enough for the plants to develop a large root system.  This yard is located in Pacific Northwest which alternates between a rainy fall-winter season and a dry summer season. "
3827,Zone 4 - Can you overwinter garlic too early?,I live in Zone 4 (Minneapolis area) and I'm wondering if it's possible to plant garlic too early for overwintering? I had a bed free up earlier then expected that I'd like to turn and mulch but I don't know if it's possible to overwinter too early and what effect it would have on the garlic?  
3828,Corn stunted in one area of my plot?," Can anyone tell me  why this is happening!? When we till after soil, we added composted manure her and 10 1010 fertilizer.  Our seeds are the honey select  variety from a reputable greenhouse in my area. They are treated seeds if that makes a difference. I planted the corn about A month ago and I have seeded the bare spot three times now.  Everything growing in between it is growing wonderfully but why is there a spot, a huge spot come out right in the middle of my corn plot or nothing wants to grow? Things will grow to three or 4 inches tall and then stop and start turning brown or just stop completely without turning brown. I have  added lime because we had a bunch of moss grow because we had a very rainy start to the season so I  raked it off, added lime, until that under. Last week, I side dressed with 10 10 10 fertilizer  and I feed once a week with miracle grow, the water-soluble. I have tried to baby this corn and give it all the nutrients it's been needing so what is going on? Any ideas!?  EDIT:  I am in West Virginia and the un-amended soil  is a very  compacted heavy clay soil. It is a bout a 10 x 12 plot and we used 3 to 4 bags of black kow manure  before planting and we lightly tilled under the manure with a garden claw.   "
3829,Please ID this cactus species,"The label that was in the pot when I got it identified the genus as espostoa. Is it possible to tell what species it is? If not, does it even matter? I'm trying to figure out the name of the species so that I can look up information about it. Do all cacti in the espostoa genus require the same care, making the species name irrelevant (for learning about how to care of it)?  I am starting to doubt that it is even in the espostoa genus. All of those cacti seem to be fuzzy.    "
3830,What's the best way to care for this damaged plant?,"This pot plant used to be double the size it is now, and was sitting on our outdoor table when some hungry cockatoos knocked it off and snapped off the other half of it.    I've since moved it to where they're unlikely to play with it, and have been watering it regularly hoping what's remaining will stay healthy. The leaves have been going a bit brown, but other than that it looks like it's neither dying nor thriving.  My question: is it likely that this will always be a half-plant? Is there anything I can do to 1) help it stay alive or even 2), help it grow to be more bushy again? "
3831,Cold frame for starting seedlings,"I live in Sacramento, CA (zone 9b). Winters are mild. Dec/Jan average temps range from 55F - 40F during day/night. However, depending on year, we can get some frost from mid Dec - mid Jan. I would like to start seedlings (marigolds, zinnias, petunias, violas, salvias, vincas, pansies, snapdragons) around early/mid Jan for transplanting by March.  Right now, I am using two seed trays and a Philzon grow light. Results are very good. However, space is limited and I foresee using about 6 seed trays per year to cover all the flowers for the year for front/back garden.  I was thinking of building a small cold frame in my backyard, and putting the seed trays in there in early/mid Jan for sprouting / growing. Is it a good idea and will it work?   Something like this: [website]"
3832,Why is my plant dying?,"So this plant was a present and its blossoms were already kind of wilting when I got it. I tried my best and repot it asap and watered it on a regular basis. It had a few symbols as instruction how to care for it, for example semi-shaded and lots of water. But still, the blossoms hung more each day. I was told to remove the ""dead"" parts carefully, which I did. I still regret it as I feel like it could have been saved.  What should I do to save this plant or what exactly am I doing wrong? And does anyone know what kind of plant it is?    "

3834,White crystal like spot on bottom side of chili leaves,"I have a (thai) chili in my kitchen. It seems to be fine overall. One week ago I discovered some white spots on the bottom of the leaves (see image).      Whatever it is it does not seem to be moving. It is also kind of hard to scrub off. I tried it with the fingers, that does not work very well.  Some leaves are more afflicted while others do not have this symptom. After a search I found this question. In this question the plant seems to have scale. While the white spots do remind of what my plant has, mine does not have any brown or dying spots on the leaves. It also seems that her/his plant has this on the top of the leaves too.  So I wonder is there any reason to be concerned? Can anybody confirm scale or anything else?  Update:  After some more research I discovered a condition named Chlorosis (Edema) which is caused by overwatering. I have to admit the photos I saw look a lot like what my plant has.      The strange thing is that I did not have the impression that I am overwatering. I always wait until the soil is really, really dry. Might this also be caused by putting too much water at once? "
3835,Growing a healthy lawn,"We've recently bought our first home and I'm slowly getting in to the garden. I have a lot to learn, so starting small - amongst some basic composting and herb growing I'm also trying to fix our lawn.  I'd love a nice healthy lawn, but it currently looks like this:      The first photo is the sunny part of the lawn, and the second photo is the shady part. Obviously, the sunny part is looking a lot nicer, but does still have some bare patches.  We live in Melbourne, Australia - fairly unpredictable weather but generally cool apart from summer when we do get some hot days. So far, I've been watering the entire lawn regularly, and bought some PatchMagic ([website]The part where I used it to test is along the bottom of the second photo. It hasn't helped much but there have been some some tiny patches growing here and there. There have also been some new patches growing up along the left of the second photo.  I've been mowing - mainly in the sunny part - every few weeks or so, whenever the lawn starts to look a bit longer.  So I guess there's a few questions here:   How long should I be waiting to see results, before deciding that what I'm doing isn't working? Should I even be trying in the shady area? Should I instead be looking into alternative uses of this part of the lawn and/or getting rid of the tree that's causing the shade? Is there a better product I could be using rather than something that markets that it grows on concrete?  "
3836,Growing bur oak from stored seeds - how to start?,"I was given a bag of bur oak seeds that were collected from my region (northeast USA, zone 5) last May (it's been a while). I found them stashed in a wooden drawer in a cool room, in their original brown paper bag - where I left them many months ago. Some feel partially hallowed out, some have holes, but some are pretty solid (below is a photo of one that looks and feels good on the left, and the opposite on the right).    How do I get these started? It's been stored for a while but I want to at least give them a go. I've heard moisture is a big part of getting them started; that I can test the seed quality by seeding if they sink or float; and can rehydrate them after storage by leaving them submerged for 24hrs. So, I'm thinking to put them all in a cup of water, remove the floaters, then tomorrow plant them just barely into the soil of pots of moist soil that are ~6"" deep. I can keep that under a light, could even put it on a slightly heated tray to encourage root growth. I figure from there I'll grow them indoors for a while before transplanting to larger outdoor pots, for eventual transplanting to a permanent site.  Does that plan need any adjustments? I'm under the impression I don't need to do any special stratification to get these seeds started, aside from re-hydrating them as needed. "
3837,Retaining wall and water management in a tight space,"I'm buying my first house very shortly, and as expected it has some problems. One of the big ones is water management around the garage. There is already water damage inside the garage so I want to tackle this as soon as I take possession of the house, but since I haven't yet all of the numbers below are eyeballed.  The garage is freestanding, with no gutters. To the left of the garage and behind it, there is roughly level ground for about a foot all around, before sharply climbing at a slope of probably 50+ degrees. The slope begins towards the front of the garage, but by the back of the garage it's about 3' tall. To the left of the garage, the top of the slope is almost right at the edge of the property, where the neighbor has a fence.  Here's a quick Sketchup to illustrate, because I'm sure that's as clear as mud.    The previous owner had filled that trench in between the slope and the garage with sandbags in a failed attempt to keep the water out.  What I'm thinking about doing is constructing a retaining wall to clean up that slope and hopefully gain me a few inches, and then run a curtain drain (or French drain, there seems to be some terminology disagreement here) along the side of the garage, sloping towards the front of the property, and draining into a narrow bioswale or similar in between my driveway and the neighbor's property. I would also like to install gutters, and pipe the downspout on the left side down into the curtain drain.  In the back there's a good bit more space, but that hill runs the entire width of the property.    Here I'm at kind of a loss. My inspector recommended constructing a ditch that ran behind the garage and then down the contour, directing the water to the right of the garage. That would dump the runoff pretty much right where I was planning on making a garden, which is less than desirable. I had considered constructing a swale on contour instead to hold the water and encourage infiltration, but my understanding is that would be detrimental to the retaining wall I want to build to prevent erosion and for aesthetic reasons.  Is this feasible to pull off in such a tight spot? Would it actually work? Do you have any better ideas? What additional things should I consider? "
3838,Night-Blooming Jasmine plant continues to wilt even after treating with baking soda-water spray,"I recently purchased some night-blooming jasmine plants. After a week the plants are wilting. I transferred them to new pots with different soil but no improvement noticed. I also sprayed numerous times with baking-soda and water(also mist with just water alone, and yet no improvement.

3839,How to get my aloe to grow,"I was given this aloe pup as a gift some years ago and never got around to replanting it from its tiny pot. Since then it has never quite grown. Its 3 leaves are still green but it has stayed a tiny plant.   I was wondering what I could do to stimulate growth?   Some side info that might be useful.   When i first got it, I placed it in my south facing window but it burned terribly there so i moved it to the side, on my dresser where it got some sun and some shade. My apartment stays very warm and sunny thru the year.  When I first got it I also overwatered and almost killed the plant. Luckily i think i realized quickly enough what was happening and stopped watering it so frequently. Would this stunt its growth?   Is it sunlight? the soil? watering? the size of its pot?  "
3840,Can I water indoor fruit trees with aquarium water?,"I have kiwi, lemon, orange, mandarin and avocado trees, grown from seed from normal fruit which I have eaten.  I also have an aquarium with turtle. I've treated aquarium water with ReptoSafe and ReptoFresh.  I was thinking to use the water from the aquarium (containing turtle manure) to water my trees. They are just small indoor trees.   Is it feasible to use aquarium water on my trees? What water parameters I should measure (like pH)? How should I measure those parameters?  "

And now we face one of the hottest heat wave nowadays in Europe.  I noticed some leaves are already dry, some of them are burnt.  I water one day on two... and yesterday night I used an atomizer for the leaves.  But I wonder if I could also use the atomizer during the hot daylight. I fear that the droplets may act like magnifiers and burn the leaves all the more... I don't know. Is it a rationnal fear or is it completely unaccurate ? Will a little mist do any good to my Japanese Maple? "
3845,"""Plenty of light but no direct sunlight"": reflection on walls vs shades diffused sunlight","For many indoor plants I read this instruction regarding light requirements: ""Plenty of light but no direct sunlight"". How I understand it is that the light has to come from a secondary source of light (meaning from reflection, most likely on walls). I was wondering if direct sunlight going through a cream colored fabric shades (pic below) before hitting the plant was also acceptable as the light is dimmed/diffused by the fabric? Or what are the other ways to avoid direct sun light while having ""plenty of light""?   "
3846,What is the difference between compost and soil?,This question has been asked many times on the net and the information provided is unreliable and mostly wrong.  What I am aiming to understand is what is lacking in compost that we can't just add it to make it the same composition as a rich soil?    Is it the amount of time that is needed to completely break it down? Are there some special ingredients that are built below the surface that can't be organically added to the compost mix? Is there some special conversion process that happens underground that makes it different from compost?  
3847,How can I keep a dog out of my vegetable garden?,I have a small vegetable garden and a small dog. I'm looking for advice on the best way to keep the little guy out of the veges. Advice on the following would be appreciated:   Is there anything I can plant that will deter him? Is there a minimal barrier or obstruction that is known to work to deter dogs? Is a physical barrier the only sure way?  
3848,Diseases Wreaking Havoc With Peppers Should I Discard Them?,"This post has multiple questions inside that I really need help with identifying what's wrong with the plants and should I remove them, if so, which ones.  I'm also curious if any of those issues could transmit to tomatoes, figs, bananas and cucumbers in particular.  Location: Memphis/TN, grow-zone: 7-b, weather: inhabitable/uphill battle.  I have 2 sets of hydroponic peppers outside in the patio with a couple pot planted peppers. I know the diseases aren't from the seeds since the peppers inside are doing just fine but sadly I only have 2 plants inside the tent.  One disease manifests with making the entire leave to lose color and turn into a weird mixture of brown &amp; yellow with small green specs. Here are the pictures of those:   When the disease is advancing:     And it eventually killed one of the small plants as such:    Question is Should I remove these or I could apply some sort of fungicide / hydrogen peroxide? Would there be a possible way to save the ones that still have green set of leaves? If so, do I need to remove all or just removing the obviously infected ones and treating the rest with whatever solution available out there is fine?  Other disease is I'm assuming mild mottle, I'm attaching the picture just to confirm if I'm right or not (this is also a hydroponic plant that I moved to different spot to prevent contact with ghost peppers)  Question #2 is: Is this mild mottle and if so, should I discard this or there's a way to save it?    Following are the same species of peppers with the one above.  Question #3 is: does the following plant seem to have mild mottle? Do I need to remove these? Is there a way to save this?    And finally I have the mad hatter, I thought it had some sort of fungus when the leaves started to have yellow dots and I applied copper/seranade mix with the same ratio I apply to tomatoes. It seems to have made the plant worse and now the disease seems to have spread into much more leaves than it was.   Question #4 is:How can I identify what this is and if it's bacterial, viral or  fungal?      Sorry for asking this many questions in one post but I thought it may be relevant to each-other, particularly if I need to remove all these plants... Hopefully I could get some sort of an answer from here before I cause damage to the garden. "

3850,do indoor plants produce carbon dioxide in night?,"I have some in door plants such as Areca, peace lily and Yucca, some of them are in my bedroom as well. I know these plants produce Oxygen and remove toxins... but what about in night? do they release carbon dioxide or similar? is it safe to put them in bed room? "
3851,Are there bulbs that produce only leaves?,"Are there plants with bulbs that only produce leaves, no flowers? If I wanted to look up such plants, what should I search for? e.g. botanical term, name of plant family - whatever makes sense.  Background: I found some bulbs in my garden that i didn't think I'd seen flower. I put them in a pot to keep an eye on them and see what they are but they have gone through two years without producing any stalk or flower. They produce a lot of lush leaves so I thought they might be grown for foliage, but then what is the reproduction strategy of the plant? "
3852,Why do my eggplants have plenty of flowers but no fruit?,"I have six or seven eggplant plants that are growing marvelously. They have been in the ground for about 3-4 months and are each about a foot, foot and a half tall. They all have plenty of purple flowers but I have had no fruit yet. Why? Is it:   Seasonal - I'm in Brisbane, Australia and we are only just now coming to the end of Winter, start of Spring. User error - do I need to be hand-pollinating these babies? Nutritional - a lack of food?  "
3853,How useful/reliable is the Parrot Flower Power?,"Has anyone used a Parrot Power wireless plant monitor, is it worth the money or is it just a gimmick or fad that I should let pass? Are there any other products similar to this type of Internet of Things gadget that are also inexpensive?      Parrot Flower Power  Any information on whether it is durable or not is appreciated too, I would be interested to drive one into the soil outside next to my fruit trees but I do not want something that will break the first time I forget it and a morning dew turns the circuits to rust.  Also technologically is it difficult to use or intuitive? "
3854,Can I raise a bush up by pushing dirt under it?,"I have some blueberry bushes. Some were just planted two weeks ago, and others are two years old.  However, they aren't draining as well as I'd like during heavy rains, and had some standing water around them.  Knowing that blueberry bushes are shallow-rooted, can I reach below their roots with a shovel, leverage the bushes higher with the shovel, and push extra material (potting soil or rotting fruit) underneath to elevate the bushes another inch or two?  (To clarify: Physically, I can do this easily. What I'm asking is, would it damage the plant, since it'd like semi-disturb its roots?) "
3855,Why are the leaves of my orchid turning brown?,"My orchid's leaves have turned into a reddish/brown color recently. Is it receiving too much direct sun (spring has started here, but is was also in this location last summer and had no problems) or is something else going on?  The only pictures of ""burned"" leaves I could find had a more yellow color than mine.  The leaves were a bright-green color in the past (like the color in the center of the leaves). It is normally in front of a south/west facing window. It has been flowering for quite a while now.    Update in June: The newer leaves have turned back to green. New leaves are appearing. Fertilizing definitely helped. Here's a picture of how it looks now:     Source "
3856,"When removing a tree branch, should I paint the exposed part of the tree?","I am working on cleaning up my yard, and that means removing some lower branches.  I've heard removing at the node is important, so I am doing that.  I've seen other trees that have been painted at the removal point.  I'm guessing this seals the tree, helping prevent rotting.  Is painting or sealing the removal point necessary?  Is it detrimental?  Is there a specific product for the job or is paint the right thing? "
3857,"What is wrong with my trees? The bark on one side is cracking, splitting, and peeling off","I had 5 trees in the strip between my sidewalk and the street.   Last year the bark on one of them started to peel (and was exasperated by some kids physically peeling it off). In the fall, it snapped and fell over about 2 feet above the ground during a wind storm.  Now the other four are also peeling.  The odd thing is that for all of them it's only happening on the west facing side (that faces the street). The east side seems perfectly fine.  I believe they are all some sort of maple trees. This doesn't seem to be healthy at all. Is there a way to save these trees? Any idea what might be causing this?  Trees are located in Utah, Zone 7a.

3858,Can I cut the top off a drooping aloe plant?,"I inherited this horrible aloe plant from an old roommate. It was living in a tall, skinny Tupperware in a dark corner of the kitchen, where it got knocked over and stepped on more than once. From reading around, I gather it grew tall like this because of low light? I put it in a bigger pot, transplanted one of its several babies, and put it in a sunny windowsill. I've read that it's possible to cut the top off a plant like this and propagate it. My question is this: what would happen to the bottom part if I did that? Would it survive? Would it grow to not be horrifically ugly?   "
3859,Is there a risk of rot with plastic lining in a raised garden bed?,I'm considering lining the walls (not the bottom) of my soon to be raised garden bed with some heavy/medium duty plastic. I've read that this helps the wood last longer by preventing contact with the moist soil.   My one concern is that if water/moisture of some kind got between the wood and the lining. Wouldn't this be pretty bad?  Is there any risk of lining the walls of my garden be with plastic? 
3860,Is it true that some plants can reduce air pollution?,"I'm six weeks pregnant and I live in a 7th floor apartment in Mumbai, India. My apartment complex is on a busy road with 24/7 traffic and traffic jams in the morning and evening. I'm worried about the developmental neurotoxins from automobile emissions.  In my house, the fan exhausts in the kitchen and bathroom are open to the outside so outdoor air readily flows into the house. I was reading that NASA has done some research on indoor plants which can reduce air pollution. I was wondering if someone could recommend plants that are 1) easy to grow (I'm a novice gardener), and 2) removes the pollutants found in automobile exhaust?  What types and how many plants should I buy?  "
3861,What are these egg looking things on my rosemary?,"I don't think this should be part of my other question, but if it should be, let me know.  This is the same rosemary plant that I mentioned in my other question, and as I noted, it was improving. After all the ladybugs left, I sprayed it down with neem as stormy suggested. I was fooling around with my new magnifier when I noticed that there were egg-like spheres on the bottom of my rosemary leaves. Should I be concerned? Do I need to do anything more?    Next to ruler for scale:   Front of leaf:  "
3862,Sprouting: sprouting seeds vs. beans from grocery store,I came across an article about sprouting and I found it interesting and decided to give it a try. I bought specialized sprouting seeds and my girlfriend asked me why I was buying such seeds when she could just get much more beans for cheaper at grocery store and make them germinate. She actually challenged me and bought a package of beans and she's going to grow them... I didn't know what to reply to her! Is she right? What advantages have those seeds over what you can get in grocery store? Are they as nutritious? 
3863,Are new caterpillar eggs added daily to a brassica that's already under attack?,"I've got a few broccoli plants which are under attack from caterpillars. They aren't currently netted.  I manually ""weeded"" all the caterpillars off the most distressed plant (and some of the other plants nearby) and figured that as long as I repeated the exercise fairly regularly I'd be able to save the crop.  So, a few days (and many squished caterpillars later) I'm not sure this is a winnable battle. There are probably slightly fewer caterpillars on each sweep but they're nothing like eradicated. And I realise I know almost nothing about my foe.  Also I'm wondering .. are the butterflies laying new eggs daily? Or are eggs laid long ago simply reaching hatching point? If the former, I should try netting (even now at this late stage). If the latter, there's no point.  Also, one plant is far and away under the most attack. The other plants much less so. How come? If hordes of butterflies are visiting my brassicas on an ongoing basis then surely they'd move onto the healthier looking plants wouldn't they?  Actually, this question is less about saving this particular crop on this occasion and more about educating myself about my enemy. "
3864,Can you eat lettuce that your dog pees on,"I planted some leafy greens on a space of dirt where my dog likes to pee and poo. She has almost certainly pee/pooed on the lettuce, or near  the lettuce, a couple of times.   The plant was perpetual spinach. Can I eat it, given that I wash it? Can I eat it if I boil it? Can I eat any plants that are in a space that my dog pees/poos on? The spinach is doing quite well. "
3865,How to encourage new branch growth in a peach tree?,"I have a white peach tree that I planted about two years ago. Last year, I found that the tree had many little dead branches so I pruned them off. After pruning, the tree now has only several long thin branches left. Then, this spring, I wished that I would see the growth of more new branches and leaves. But, there is no sign of new twigs coming out either from the trunk and the existing branches and the leaves are coming out only from the tip of the branches (not from the middle part).   Does this tree look OK? Is there anything I can do to make the tree grow more branches and leaves?   "
3866,How do I prune boxwoods to control for boxwood leaf miner?,"Our boxwoods have a moderate infestation of boxwood leaf miners. Sources recommend pruning to help manage them, and mention that you should cut at a certain time in the pest's lifecycle. But they don't give detailed info on how much to remove or the timing outside Missouri.    How do I know when I should prune in my area? How much should I remove? And what should I do with the debris after pruning?  "
3867,"Growing Cape Gooseberries in Brisbane, Australia","For entirely irrational reasons (maybe because gooseberries hard to get here), I bought a Cape gooseberry seedling today.  Where I live in Brisbane, however, is not your typical cool climate for gooseberries!  Instead, it's a humid subtropical climate, with about 10-20&deg;C in winter and 20-30&deg;C in summer. No frost or snow in Winter and up to 40&deg;C in Summer.  With this in mind, what sort of strategy should I employ to get the best out of this plant? Anyone grown one in a similar climate elsewhere?

3868,How to stimulate recently-planted grass sod to send up new shoots,"Well, it's September here in Texas and still in the high 90s and low 100s.  About 2 months ago a landscaper friend gave me about 2 palettes of Bermuda Celebration sod and 2 palettes of St. Augustine sod.  The St. Augustine was green but the Bermuda was leftover from a job and pretty much yellow.  So I've watered both faithfully (no fertilizer so far), and the St. Augustine has gotten bright green and green shoots have popped out of the Bermuda thatch (it's starting to look lawn-like finally), but I'm wanting both to fill in the areas that have no shoots, i.e. ""thicken up"".  I just cut the St. Augustine to 3"" and the Bermuda to about 2 1/4"".  So two questions: 1) Can someone help me to understand what is happening at this point?  My understanding is that now after mowing the roots are more than the top greenery (shoots), and my thought is that that would push the rhizomes to shoot up in new places.  Is this correct or is there another thing that will cause new shoots 2) what else can I do at this time of year, including fertilizer or topsoil, to increase the shoot locations (in other word thicken it)?  Thanks! "
3869,Tomato plant discolored and dried out,"I have a home garden with tomatoes and peppers.  The peppers grow great every year, but often the tomatoes end up discolored with dried out leaves.    I recently did a Manutec pH test on the soil and it came up as 8, so I added some sulfur to the soil around the tomatoes.  If this is the issue, how long would it take the sulfur to take effect?  Does anyone have other ideas about what the problem could be?  I am in Australia (Southern hemisphere), so it is the middle of summer and the tomatoes should be ready for picking in February.   "
3870,How can I tell the difference between male and female trees?,How do you know what a male tree looks like from the female? Is it because of the leaves that fall or the ones that have more pollen?  Please help me to understand if there is such a thing. 
3871,"How important is water type to carnivorous plants, really?","How important is it to not use tap water for carnivorous plants? e.g. is it a guideline or a hard rule?  I have seen several answers on here saying not to, but I have had a venus fly trap for 3-4 years so far and have only used tap water and it seems happy and healthy with lots of traps, it produces a flower stalk every year with boring flowers on it and eats lots of flies. I have another three carnivorous plants that I don't know the names of that I have only had 2 years, but they also seem healthy. This seems to contradict the advice.  Also, none of the plant labels or instructions that came with them mention this tap water issue, and this company seems to be the only one supplying any of the garden shops with carnivorous plants (although that is not a guarantee that they know what they are doing).  Should I expect them to keel over sometime soon, or is the fact they have survived this long evidence of the tap water being ok (not all tap water is the same after all, maybe ours is less bad??) "
3872,Junipers and Fertilizer times and Nitrogen,"Reading around the web, many say the exact opposite of another 'expert'.  Specifically pertaining to Junipers, I'm reading don't use nitrogen or use high fertilizers high in nitrogen.  When is the best time to fertilize and what fertilizer do you recommend?   They are all potted junipers I have 7 Junipers, 20l x3, and the rest in small pots. One, potted in a cascade pot is almost completely brown Another has brown at tips   The youngest 2 are suffering the most They were all repotted 14 months ago and have been doing well until a few months ago.    Soil used. 3 parts:  A general potting mix strained to remove fine particles and sand. Organic including pine bark left 1 part Vermaculite and Leca add Bone meal  add Seaweed add multicote slow release  weather here is not the best. - Strong winds. average 20km gusts 30km - Our summers are hot 28c + - we have moved into autumn and it averages 24c  They are positioned outside on benches. They receive partial to full sun.  Focusing on the two unhealthy junipers.  I forget the exact species, but its blue crawling variety. The second is marketed here as Gold Coast  Watering. I cant explain, but I sense when it needs it, the way the tree and soil is looking on the surface.  Since the wind and sun dry the pots out fairly quickly, it tends to be every day when at its worst or 4 days when its calmer.  The scales seem to thin when under watered (This is probably not factual) and droop when rounded, when it gets too much. Once again, not science.  Its worked for years and they are healthy trees except for the two.  Thee crawler is potted in a cascade but is completely brown except for odd tips. I worry about the cascade pots for air pockets so I tap the pot and water it well often. I have tried a number of things, including liquid fertilizer 6 months ago, but nothing is perking this tree up. Should I repot? Would another bout of liquid fertilizer rich in nitrogen help this tree? Should I pit it in shade..  the other has brown tips (the opposite) to the crawler. Its potted in a forest with Natasja Ficus. Its a shallow pot but the roots have lots of horizontal space. All the other trees are doing well in the same planting. "
3873,Yellowing and falling of lime tree leaves,"Following this question, I have re-potted my key lime tree into a bigger pot, changed the soil (using the ""best"" potting soil I could find around, i.e. one that does not hold water), and stopped using the liquid plant food I was adding to the water.   As before, I make sure to only water the plant when the soil looks dry (one or twice a week).  However, some of the leaves have recently been slightly curled (as one can see on the top left corner of the photo at the bottom of the post; and, more concerning, this morning when I arrived in my office I noticed that one of the leaves had fallen and was almost entirely yellow.    Being quite attached to the plants I have, this got me worried: should I be concerned? What am I doing wrong?   "
3874,Houseplants keep getting infections,"Over the past year we've tried to grow several small houseplants in our apartment, but every one of them has succumbed to an infection of some sort. For what it's worth, we keep our house spotless, so it's not like there's (visible) mold growing anywhere that could be a vector. Here are some examples of our casualties:   Spruce bonsai: spruce mites Aloe: white mold (unsure what kind) Amaryllis: bulb rot (red, not sure exactly what kind), and Southern Blight Heart-leaf philodendron: Southern Blight   All plants were watered exactly as instructed, most kept in draining pots. They were also either in a location with plenty of sunlight, or were supplemented with a grow-lamp like this one. I really want some kind of plants in here, but I don't want to spend the time and effort if they're just going to get infected again. So my question is two-fold:   Is there possibly a single reason why all these infections are happening (and what can I do about it, if anything)? Are there any houseplants that would be resistant to these types of infections which would be safer to try? Or growing/care techniques to fight infection?   Edit based on comments:  None of these plants were ever outdoors (aside from transporting them from their origin store or house). Aloe and spruce were watered 1-2 times per week based on soil dryness. Philodendron was watered 2-3 times per week based on soil dryness. Plants were watered until it began to flush out of the drain. Amaryllis was kept in a large glass vase with pebbles and water filled to cover the bulb, water was changed once per week and the pebbles were washed, damaged parts of the bulb removed when the red rot started showing, Southern Blight-like mold/symptoms started showing above the water line towards the end. All others were kept in their original potting soil. I didn't have any of the infections lab-tested, but the mites were easy to identify and the Southern Blight I'm 90% sure about based on appearance/symptoms and that it's endemic to my area. "
3875,How hazardous is Melianthus (honey bush)?,"Is Melianthus actually too poisonous to keep in a home garden? I see it all over the place, and I understand that it should not be eaten, but is touching the plant hazardous as well?  Rationale: I have a large Melianthus and small children. Should I rip it up?   "
3876,"Raised bed on tile floor, covered veranda?","We live in an apartment with a huge veranda. I'd like to build a simple raised bed out there to grow some herbs and a few veggies (tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers).   If I put in a layer of gravel at the bottom, I believe drainage will not be an issue, but should I build some sort of a drainage chute to take the water to the gutter? I don't really want it seeping all over the veranda where we eat dinner, the kids play, etc.  I'll also have to water the bed myself since the veranda is covered by a roof (high enough that the veranda gets plenty of early morning and late afternoon sun). Will there be any problems or a benefits to that?  The veranda is approx. 50m2 (which I believe is around 500ft2) and the floor is concrete with porcelain tiles on top. I was thinking of building just a small bed, around 1x3 metres or something like that. I'm flexible. Depending on the positioning, it can either get direct sunlight from around 8am-11am, or from around 3pm to 6pm. Both times the sun is low (rising or setting).  I'm in the southern hemisphere, ""Yearly temperatures average between 9 and 35 °C (48 and 95 °F).

3879,"Philodendron Imperial Red: What could be causing ""burn spots"" on leaves?","I have been slowly watching spots appear on the new leaves of my philodendron.   They are small, brown and dry (similar in look to leaf tips when under/over watered). They don't appear on the leaves that the plant had when I originally bought it.  I keep the plant in a window (maybe too bright? I have since pulled it away from my the window sill) and water it when the top layer of soil is dry to the touch (about a 1/2"" down). It is planted in a mixture of soil and mulch, with very good drainage.   I've done a bit of internet searching, (and am now petrified that it's a bacterial issue) but I'm at a loss as to what could be causing this! Has anyone had a similar problem?

3882,What happened to my Mass Cane?,Not putting in much thought I moved my plants closer to a light source over the weekend and as you can see in the pictures some tips turned black.  Did it get burned? Is it dying? What am I supposed to do? Can I cut the tips off?       UPDATE: I have cut the dead parts and in doing so I realized that there are two plants in this pot and only one has this issue. Can it be that this might have happened when I inserted the prong to test the water level one day??  Will this get cured or should I cut of the affected one? I have added a Picture that I took last night. 
3883,What are the long term effects of adding iron oxide pigments to soil?,"Iron oxide (Pigment Black 11) is a intense black non toxic and very cheap pigment.  I think I have read somewhere that soil from shops is sometimes pigmented with iron oxide because it sells better. But I could not find a reference any more.  Some plants need different soil (some with more and less humus content) in my garden and the surface looks very blotchy at the moment and I wonder   what are the long term effects of iron oxide pigments in soil?   Will plants absorb the pigment and get darker too? Will it react with rain or natural fertiliser? Where can I find studies on the consequences of iron oxide pigments on the nutritiousness of vegetables and fruits?   According to instinct I expect nothing good from pigments in soil, but I could not find a reliable statement. Please support your answer with references. "
3884,What’s the best way to remove 2-4 inches of large gravel from backyard?,"New home owner.  After moving in I noticed the previous owner had laid down some gravel in a portion of my backyard so he could store a boat.  Approx 15ft x 30ft.  It’s been completely taken over by weeds and grass so much you can only see the gravel in spots, but can see a clear line of where it ends compared to rest of yard.    We’d like to remove it and re-seed with new grass.  I’ve looked at soil cutters, tillers and trenchers but don’t think any of those are designed for this particular project.    Gravel varies in size from golf ball to baseball size.  Seems to be only the top 2-4 inches.  Just curious what’s the easiest, quickest or most cost effective way to do this?  Should I just remove all the top soil and replace?  Is a bobcat or some kind of front loader the best to use to remove all the rubble?   "
3885,Is this lawn fungus?,"  I'm having trouble with my lawn.  I know the picture is hard to see, but in the circles are yellow-ish grass.  This was green two weeks ago.  Close up it looks like yellow dead grass.  A month ago I applied a product that was supposed to get rid of clover.  It is all over my yard.  But this seems like dead grass.  Fungus?  Grubs?  Something else?  (The section in the square is a patch that, no matter what I do, will not grow grass.)  EDIT: Thanks to ""stormy""'s reply I went out for a closer look   "
3886,Should I cut the top of my schefflera?,"  I have this schefflera which is growing pretty well. When I got it a year ago it was half this size, and I don't fertilize much. But I don't want it to become too high. I'd like it to grow lateral stems instead of just one long stem reaching for the ceiling.   I read that in order to split the main stem and make new branches, I should cut the plant at the top, juste below the most recent growths. So my questions are:   Do you think I can do this now or should I wait some more? Where exactly should I cut if I want to maximize the probability of making new branches?   If this helps, here is a picture of the top of the plant. As you can see, there is a group of three new growths within 1cm. The next one is about 1cm below.   "
3887,Harvesting Broccoli,"I am growing some late season broccoli in my backyard in a raised bed.  How do I decide the right time to harvest the broccoli?  Are there any visual clues I can use?  I can't use the time from planting because I don't remember when I planted and given that I planted them late in the season, I think it has taken longer than normal to produce broccoli. "
3888,Is this an undesirable grass or a weed?,I have some patchy weird grass or weeds growing on my lawn. You can see in a few places in the images below:  Picture 1: you can see the longer wider grass blades scattered here. What is this? A broadleaf weed or a grass that I just don't want? How do I get rid of it?   Picture 2: it looks like I have some fine fescue (right?) with some similar wide blade grass/weeds? How do I get rid of the larger grass/weeds? It's ugly and undesirable.   Picture 3: you can see it a bit better here. I think my desirable lawn here is a bit of fine fescue and maybe some KBG (the slightly discolored + green blades at the bottom of the picture?). Does that seem right? What about that nasty ugly clump near the top of the picture? Broadleaf weed or undesirable grass? Is it the same as pictures 1 + 2? I think so. How do I get rid of these?  
3889,Why is my Acer's new growth wilting?,  My Acer has started to wilt. I'm confused as it's well looked after. Could it be because it has been so mild for the past few weeks and now very windy and cold? It has good drainage as I put stones in the pot before we planted it.  Can I save my favourite garden plant?

I will be using an organic nutrient solution (AN Iguana Grow) as well.  I have ordered some certified organic seeds, and on the website it listed the maturity days.  For instance, the Gandhi Butterhead lettuce says ""Matures in 70 days. (open pollinated seeds)""  Is that 70 days from seed to finish?

I want to try to grow the following plants from seeds:   lettuce spinach carrots kale broccoli   My questions are - how far apart should I place each of these plants, and how many seeds per hole should I use? Also, is there anything else I should watch out for or avoid?  Thanks for your help, and happy gardening! "
3892,New fig trees seemed dead; now sprouting from the base. Any special treatment?,"We planted two Chicago Hardy fig trees here in DC last fall, but we planted them a bit late, and had an early freeze and a cold winter overall. They were each a single stalk of about 18-24"" (45-60 cm) and had several leaves, which fell off when the cold came.  The leaves didn't come back through the spring, and we thought they hadn't survived the winter, but a week or two ago we noticed that each had new sprouts growing from the base of the main stalk, so it seems that the roots survived after all!  I assume the previous stalks will die off, but should I do anything special at this point to ensure the sprouts grow correctly? One of the plants has two or three sprouts growing out of the ground several inches apart; should I snip all but the biggest so the plant focuses its growth on one main trunk? Do I need to do any trimming or clip any leaves to ensure the stalk grows tall/straight enough?   "
3893,How do you attract and keep worms in your garden?,"I have seen worm farms for sale down at the hardware store but have always been discouraged by the price. I know the benefits of using worm poop/tea on your garden, but I'm wondering whether it is actually just better to encourage worms into your soil naturally.  What are the benefits of using a worm farm over encouraging them naturally?  What can you do to attract worms into your garden?  And how do you keep them? "
3894,House plant watering habit,"I've been attempting to have house plants for the last year or two, and have difficulty with getting watering right.  Particularly, I've found that I consistently end up with my plants getting too dry. i.e. My herbs are visibly wilting (and recover v. quickly we watered), and the soil is dry enough that it has pulled away from the side of the pot, and/or pooring water onto the soil leads to it visibly not being absorbed, but just running off large portions of the soil.  Given that this happens a lot, I then find it hard to re-hydrate the soil.  As a result, for the last 3-4 months I've been trying a diferent approach of ""poor 'some' water in every now and then.  ...  I water each of my plants ~ every 7-10 days. In general, by that time the soil is entirely dry to the touch at the surface, and the herbs may have just started to wilt if it's been relativley hot.  I water the plant by taking it to a sink and completely drenching it: Running water gently into the pot for a minute or two, letting it sit in the sink to drain out for 5 minutes, then repeating a couple of times (so that the water is really permeating fully through out the soil, since I observe that dry soil is relatively hydrophobic). Then I sit it in its saucer by the sink for half an hour or so, emptying the saucer every 5-10 minutes, until there's absolutely no water leaving the pot. Then I put it back by the window.  It seems to be working pretty well so far, the various plants that I've been treating like this have been growing very happily on my North-West facing windowsill.    Question:  Is this watering pattern OK? What issues might it have, and what problems might those issues cause? Are there better ways to handle watering plants given that I'm moderately forgetful and thus will definitely allow the plants to dry out at some point. "
3895,Which grasses should I keep in this terribly overgrown lawn?,"I have moved to a property where the lawn has not been cut for (according to neighbours) 2 years, and the grasses are now about 2 feet high with seeds. I would like some advice about which ones to keep and which ones to remove.   This one seems the easiest place to start:   It is very thick and coarse and has tough seeds which do not fall off easily. After cutting it grows back very quickly. The cut patches seem to be raised above the surrounding areas.   This is what it looks like a few days after cutting:   I guess I should remove these (dig them out)? They appear in small clumps all over the lawn.  This one is finer, though almost as tall as the coarse one, and the seeds are quite soft and fall off easily:   After cutting, they seem a bit coarse but do not seem unpleasant. So should I save these and maybe harvest the seeds to sow on the bare/thin patches ?  And then there is this one, which is very fine and about half the height of the other two:   I'm guessing that this is the ""best"" lawn grass, as it is so fine and wispy, so should I save these and harvest the seeds for sowing ?  I estimate that there is about 10% of the first one, 60% of the 2nd one, and 30% of the 3rd one.   If I harvest the 2nd and 3rd one for sowing the bare/thin patches, should I use a mixture of them, or maybe just stick with the 3rd one? "
3896,How can I make permeable landscaping cloth drain better?,"I got some synthetic grass for the dogs to play on. We put down landscaping cloth which is black with blue lines about every foot. The cloth was laid down, but we noticed that the dog pee didn't drain through it.  How is this ""permeable"".  What should I do to this cloth before I put the synthetic grass on top of it?  Underneath the cloth is soil, and the whole yard slopes about 30 degrees downhill right up against our house.  Will be a BIG problem when rain comes...should we aerate the cloth? Please advise.  "
3897,Why is my Peace lily dying?,"  Help! My peace lily is dying. Can anyone please tell me what's wrong with it? I just don't understand why the leaves continue to darken around the edge and then fall off. I only water it once a week. I let the water sit out a day or two before watering. What could be causing this?    Thank you for the welcome. I have not changed anything with the plant. I've been watering it the same way since I have gotten it. I received the plant at my grandmother's funeral about 9 months ago.   The pot is not a self watering pot. I water it myself once a week. I water the plant every Monday. The plant usually began to wilt a little before watering it.  I guess I will take the plant out of the pot and replant it to see if it's root rot.       Here's my other peace lily. It isn't in as bad of shape but it's not doing well either. I just trimmed all the dead leaves off it last week and I woke up today to more dead leaves. The tip of brand new leafs brown. Then on other leaves they turn brown and it's like it eats the leaf until I have to cut it. New leaves are growing but I'm constantly cutting off the dead ones.  Do you guys think a smaller pot would help? As far as the pot they are in now goes, the bottom part of the pot is for extra water to go into if there's any. You can also water the plant by putting the water in the bottom part of the pot and the Plant should suck the water up.  However I water from the top and leave the bottom attached incase I ever over water there not a mess.  I'll attach more photos of my other plant    Here's another photo of the leaf yellowing and browning.  "
3898,What should I be doing one month out to prepare garden beds for spring?,"Woo-hoo! Starting to get excited... it will soon be spring again and looking ready to growing some good food.  Our spring begins in September which is about 5 weeks away so I am interested in finding out what I should be doing to my vegetable beds to prepare for planting in spring?  We have quite mild winters and I am in Zone 4. I can pretty much clear out the beds completely if necessary as I only have a minimal amount of carrots / radishes occupying beds and some beans which will need to be left, but won't be in the way.   Do I need to do anything to aerate the soil? What type (organic only) and how much fertiliser should I be adding? Should I start occasionally watering the beds? As the beds are getting dried out as we have relatively low rainfall.  "
3899,My lemon tree in pot has curled leaves,"I live in Redwood city California. We bought this small lemon tree a year ago. About few weeks ago, it started flowering and new leaves coming. But then the new leaves started to curl. I thought it was lack of water, so I watered it more. But now the leaves are turning brown and dropping. Any ideas on what could be going on. I used to water it once a week, is that too little? Should I fertilize it now?   The plant is placed in a very sunny spot. We have been getting a lot of rain, but it is a sheltered spot.    "
3900,"Why does my tree have splitting bark, dripping sap, and dead branches?","Our builder planted this tree, and I have no idea what kind it is. The bark seems to split and a lot of sap runs out of the tree.  Since I don't know what kind of tree this is, I haven't been able to find out if this is normal or not.  A lot of the branches have been dying as you can tell from the pic.  It also appears that they planted it in a burlap sack. I only staked the tree because it is really windy here in Oklahoma City and I thought the root ball was moving around a little too much.   Here are my questions:   Can anyone id the tree from the pics?  What should I do with all the dead branches? Cut them off or leave them as is? Is the bark splitting off and sap leaking a normal behavior of this tree, or is it needing something from me?   Let me know if you need more info!     "
3901,How can I keep snails off my Day Lilies?,"I have never had a problem with snails, but since planting a large swathe of day lilies I have found between twenty and fifty snails a day in that patch. I have been disposing of every one, to no avail.   Are day lilies especially tasty to snails? Is there something I should be doing to keep them off?  "
3902,Aphids in my Fuchsia,"Now, I am seeing Aphids in my indoor Fuchsia. Previously I lost my Petunia and Bleeding heart for this reason.  I have initially removed them using Sellotapes and then I sprayed soap water.  Is that a good way to remove Aphids?  Any more suggestions in How I can prevent any more attacks? Is it because I keep them indoors?  Thanks! "
3903,Advice on growing Naranjilla (Solanum quitonense)?,"I have been trying to transform a previously ornamental garden into a productive but still attractive one. I've used citrus and guavas for hedging, lemongrass for borders etc. One final niche I'm looking to fill is an attractive shade tolerant shrub to fill in some small beds around the base of a larger tree. This is currently occupied by agapanthus. My climate is temperate (I am in Sydney, close enough to the coast to not get frost).  I am considering replacing the agapanthus with Naranjilla (Solanum quitonense), a perennial shrub of Andean origin I have been reading about. Can anyone offer any advice about growing these and whether they will cope in my climate? Can they be kept to a maximum height of around 1 metre and still give a good crop? Does anyone have an alternative suggestions for filling this shady niche with a suitably attractive edible plant? "
3904,Dying French Lilac,"I live in South East Tennessee. About 7 years ago I planted two Lilac bushes in my front yard. One is the regular purple kind, the other is called a French Lilac.  The purple one started to get too congested in the middle, so I cut out all the middle branches that looked dead. I also started getting Kudzu growing around it. This year it is doing better.    The French Lilac looks like half of it is dead and I don't know what to do. I planted both of these bushes the same year, but one is huge and the other is only half as tall as it was when I planted it. Maybe it is supposed to be that way?    I cut some of the branches down and the sucklings at the bottom. Now what?  It is planted in what became a low spot in my yard after having my yard dug up to have pipes from house to sewer replaced. They just filled in the yard and planted grass seed. It is no longer level. Could it be the drainage?  There is a greenish white spot where the stem meets the tree.    "
3905,Dealing with Hydrangea with dark green flower tips and wilting leaves,"I had a pot of hydrangeas for a few months which I keep outside. I water them twice a day: in the morning and in the early/late evening. They receive little to no direct sunlight - which according to multiple internet sources is perfect.    The flowers have had these dark green tips for some time. Many of the leaves are also wilted from the middle towards the tips. Also note the brown steam, though I am assuming that this is normal?  Perhaps I am over-watering them; however, I used to also water them (but a lesser amount) and was told by a gardener that they need a lot more water (they were quite dry).  What is wrong with my flowers?     "
3906,Strange things in my purchased manure / algae / compost-mix - unusable?,"Three months ago I bought an (20kg pack) organic compost mix of (horse-)manure/algae/compost. In addition it states ""naturally moist"". I used some part of it and I put it, loosely closed, in a dry but badly temperature-isolated place. We had some days of 35 C during the last weeks and all in all it was around 22 C during that period.  Today I wanted to use some more of it and when I opened it I found strange things inside:   White stripe-like threads of 5mm diameter and 10 - 30cm length  The top-level has become somewhat white/brown and dry. A slug   I assume that due to moisture and hot weather things have gone their way and mushrooms and/or whatever else has come to life. Is this bad? Can I still use it? If not, what should I do with it? "
3907,Bag worm infestation on small pine trees,I noticed that some of my small pine trees (4 ft.) started turning brown and upon closer inspection I noticed 100's of bag worms all over the trees. I spent quite a bit of time pulling off the bags. My questions are:   If I just throw them on the ground will they die or do I need to do more to make sure the bugs in the current bags don't come back? What is the best insecticide or other method to keep these bugs from coming back?    
3908,Output of Septic tank as fertiliser,"I have a septic tank with multiple chambers, the output of which is then pushed into a field (by design).   As I'm new to living rurally, I asked a whole bunch of questions to the people who came to service the tank.  I'm not sure there answers make sense, and I'm still a bit confused.  Can anyone advise how it is appropriate to use the output of the septic system - I was told that its great for fruit trees, but bad for things like tomatoes, zucchini etc - even if applied only to the roots - a claim I'm a bit skeptical of. (The reason for my skepticism stems in part from reading I did relating to ""The Martian"", and apparently growing potatoes in human waste is viable).  I was also told that it is toxic to people (which makes sense), but would not affect my goats or sheep (which doesn't make much sense to me, but I believe is probably correct) - Does anyone know the ins-and-outs here ?  I'm contemplating laying a new line parallel to the existing one and using it to continuously feed a line of trees - Apples, Lemons, Figs, fejoas and stone fruit.  Is this a good idea ? "
3909,What is the best growing temperatures for an avocado plant?,"I live in a very warm climate (Phoenix AZ) and I was wondering what the best growing conditions (temperatures) are for an avocado plant?  Are the extreme heat summers here to much for an avocado?  We can also get about 4 or 5 nights out of the year where it falls to around freezing, will this be difficult on an avocado tree also? "
3910,What is this mold/fungus?,  Is it harmful? What should I do about it?  It was undoubtedly caused by the excess water on the surface from the drippers. Those are now off.

3912,How fast do banana plants grow?,"Last fall I picked up half a large banana plant corm from the refuse pile at the local gardens, planted it in a 12"" pot with loamy soil, and stuck it in my growth chamber for months of benign neglect. Now (mid january, -20°C outside) I've noticed suckers coming up around the edge of the corm. Perhaps I watered it too much? The suckers are now 5 to 6 inches (15 cm) tall, and I'm wondering how big a problem I have on my hands. Will these things reach 4 feet in a month? That's too tall for the growth room. Is it time to transplant? Will that slow growth, or should I just clip these early risers, and hope for more shoots come April? "
3913,Saving sun-scorched succulents,"I recently moved several small potted succulents from partial shade to full sun, which proved catastrophic for many of them.  Specific genera among the casualties:   Echeveria / Graptopetalum Faucaria Sedum Sempervivum   Can these plants regrow from the roots if the aboveground structures have died?  What can be done to maximize their survival chances? "

3915,why has my elephant ear suddenly turned yellow?,"One of my three elephant ears on my deck in Brooklyn(only a mile from Stack Exchange HQ) has suddenly turned yellow.  I had some yellowing on it's sibling earlier in the year, which I diagnosed as excessive water and corrected. The elephant ears are originally from Costa Rica according to the nursery I purchased them from.   However, the plant in the picture was growing fast and green until 3 days ago when I practically bleached.  We had a very wet week with thunder showers, then much high temperatures and more sun. So I would diagnose it as too much sun, except its neighbor is green and happy.  there are two environment differences between the two elephant ears: - different pots so slightly different soil and drainage - the green elephant ear gets more shade from the yellow elephant ear, and a royal palm.    is the yellowing an absence of chlorophyll? If so, how does excessive sun reduce chlorophyll? would excessive sun yellow the elephant ear in a few days?   Thanks  Jeff     "
3916,How should I take care of my new Areca Palm?,"I just received my new Areca Palm. It was delivered to me in New York via UPS from Florida. Since Florida is more than a little warmer than here, my question is how to take care of this so it gets well established in my home with the least shock. Should I re-pot or wait for a couple of days for it to get over the climate change and the shipping? By the way I have no clue how healthy this plant is, as of now I’m still at work and my wife just told me it arrived. I'm so excited :)   As always I will update with Pic once I get home.  Update 1:  The plant came nicely packaged however, there is this black stuff all over the plant see pix(1,2,6) and this yellow looking (looks waxy) stuff in pic(3). Don’t know if it’s the way the plant grows normally, if it's a disease or if this is some kind of infestation?  Other than the snail in pic(7) I have also seen a Millipede worm in the dirt and gave it a lil spray of Bayer Advanced Natria Insect, Disease &amp; Mite Control. It then disappeared in the dirt hope this doesn’t infest this plant or my other plants in my home. I just got neem oil should I rather use that next time? What should I do with the leafs as in pic(4,5)? Also my home is 30% humid should I get a cool air humidifier for my plants?  Update 2:  24hr from when I got this palm some fronds started to get dry didn't turn yellow or brown just dried out and crisp.  My apartment is always been on the dry side and thought that this might be the cause of the problem. So I got a humidity tester. my apartment was 21% I got a 2 humidifiers and and now its a comfortable 45% however my palm is still in the same condition.  I added the last couple pix i took last night. Please let me know whats wrong here?   click any image for full size                  "
3917,Harvesting wrinkled jalapeños,"After returning home from vacation I found many of my jalapeños to be wrinkled and shriveled up. I suspect they are a couple of weeks past ripe, though I'm new to gardening so I don't know. Is it safe to dry them and use them in recipes? Or maybe just the seeds? Or should I just put them all in the trash? "
3918,Best tool for underground lawn sprinkler system head removal?,"My lawn has an underground sprinkler system. Many of the heads are old, leaking, and hard to adjust. So I've been swapping them with Rainbird 5000 series heads. They look like this:    Here's the thing. These things are impossible to dig up by hand. I spent 3 hours last night replacing 3 of these. They just screw off of the valve beneath them, counter clockwise, but can be a little stiff. I had to use one of those neat grippy jar opener things to get the 3 off, and my hands are now trashed.  The head, as you can see in the picture, has a texture. There must be some wrench or tool that works to quickly grip and twist these things off, without having to dig like crazy all around them in the yard (destroying the lawn in the process).  What tool would work for this? What tool is best for this? "
3919,PC controlled irrigation system,"I am investigating the use of a PC to control my yard irrigation system. The research that I've done has only revealed one system with the (unfortunate) name of Irritrol.  Have you used your PC to control your yard irrigation system? If so, how did you do it?  I am considering hobbling something together with an X10 controller and writing some software to control it but don't want to dive into that if it's already been done... "
3920,Tips for raising a Ginkgo from a seed?,"This will be my first post; hopefully I included enough information from the get-go. Not sure if I'm asking too much for one question, but I assume growing a plant may require a couple paragraphs at most.  We're in North Carolina. Summers are hot (usually 85 - 95°F/ 29-35°C) and humid. Winters dip below freezing at night, but not by much - we rarely have to turn the water off and such.  One or two years ago, we planted some ginkgo seeds in a pot outside, and of the 5-6, one took root and became a baby plant. I was not present for the vast majority of its life, and no one brought it inside for the winter. It died. However, I know how cool gingko trees can be, and the seeds were inexpensive so we're going to try again. This time, I want the sapling to make it, and at the very least I want to provide instructions for its care even if I cannot physically be there all the time.  My questions, then, shall be:  1. Starting from the seed stage, what exactly do I need to do in order to ensure its survival during the critical beginning stages? (i.e. amount of water, how many seeds to a pot, size &amp; type of pot, houseplant beginnings or outside, amount of sunlight, special soils, etc.)   2. Once its reached sapling stage, how can I improve its quality of life? (i.e. when to move it out of a pot and outside, what temperatures to look out for that may kill it once its outside, does its watering regimen stay the same, potential pests, etc.)   Thanks! "
3921,How can I propagate Pachira?,"I'm trying to save an indoor potted Pachira (probably P. glabra, ""Money Tree"") that has become ""leggy"" from years decades of mistreatment. I'd like to take a cutting and start a new tree.  A few sites suggest rooting hormone (e.g., this one) but others (e.g., this one) seem to suggest that it's not absolutely necessary. I'd like to avoid the rooting hormone (most practically because I haven't got any handy...) but I'll do so if necessary. I've only got a couple candidate stalks to work with.  I had hoped it would root/propagate easily in the fashion of Schefflera, since it seems to have superficial resemblance, but seems to have no relation.  I have propagated many plants before in this way (so I have some experience), but never Pachira, so I'm most interested in suggestions particular to this plant. Must I use rooting hormone, or will it sprout on its own -- or perhaps in a jar with a rooting Schefflera? What other techniques might I use to ensure success? E.g., let it dry, where to cut relative to a node, etc. "
3922,How often should I loosen soil?,"I was about this ask this question in a comment from a different question of mine, but I thought it deserved its own question since it may help a fellow novice gardener.  How often should I loosen the soil in a vegetable garden?  Do I want to loosen it deeply (12"" to 24"") before planting?  Should I loosen it at all after planting?  Should I do it in the Autumn once the plants have died to get ready for next year?  Or should I simply do it a week or two before planting? "
3923,Why do many landscapers put gravel around the base of buildings?,"Where I live, I've noticed many buildings have a stone/gravel barrier between the building foundation and the lawn or flower bed. Why is this? Does it prevent insect or pest infiltration of the structure?     "
3924,"Over 1 month, lawn hasn't come out of (what I assume is) dormancy. Is it dead?","About a month ago I asked this question about my lawn. To summarize, I just had this house built, so the grass was only put in a few months ago and the sprinklers did not turn on for 1 week last month. The suggestions I got all said to just keep watering it and it should come back in a few weeks. It's been over a month now and I see very little improvement to the grass. This is what it looks like now.      I also applied this plant food after a suggestion from the original landscape company and I have not cut the grass at all. Is there anything else I can do to get my lawn back or do I need to cut my losses?  EDIT: To add to the information above; the grass was sod when it was put in a few months ago. Do I need to hire a landscaping company to tear it all out and re-apply sod? What are my options? "
3925,What is eating my ivy?,"Something is eating the ivy that covers a wall of my house. Is it a disease or is there something hiding that eats the leaves? And what can I do to heal my ivy?

3926,What plant is this and how do I save it?,"I've recently found this plant, which was already dying, maybe due to low temperatures, too much or too less water, poor soil...    Firstly, I'd like to know its name, in order to learn how to take care of it and how to reproduce it. My idea is, if possible, cut the upper part, which is still green, and make it grow apart. Lower leafs are almost dead, and they're not going to live anymore. Would this work? Should I put it first in water and maybe use some hormones? "

It's been under attack from aphids and ants and we have been having some extremely hot weather.

When I got home and started preparing said cilantro, I found a twig of something that is definitely not cilantro. I don't know if that was what caused the earlier itching, as I managed to not touch it.  Could it be some kind of nettle? How could it make its way into commercial cilantro?   "

3931,What are some recommendations for planting garage rooftop window boxes?,"The situation: There’s a double garage (precast concrete) with a flat roof of roughly 30 m² (approx. 320 sq ft), and it’s unused space. I often thought about putting anything alive up there (preferably of the kingdom Plantae), the one downside being the necessity of a ladder to look after whatever’s up there.  Regarding weather: While the garage finds itself located…   in temperate climate (hardiness zone 8a), … it’s frequently overcast and drizzly, with 16 rainy days per month all year and… 4-6 sunshine hours daily between May and September with… average temperatures ranging from 8-18°C (46-64°F) in May and 13-24°C (55-75°F) in July.   Now I look for specific recommendations to plant greenery atop the garage. Suitable candidates will have to adhere to some considerations:   I don’t want to put tons of soil or raised beds on it (excess floor load, max. 200 kg/m² ≈ 370 lbs/sq yd), so I figured window boxes (with drainage) would do nicely. They’re easy to provide, align and (re)move. Plants will have to endure full sun, storm, heavy rain or even hail. While these conditions do apply to the garden below, exposure is literally elevated and the surface might get a lot hotter (tar paper). Building a canopy for shelter is too expensive yet manageable if required. Since there are no stairs, plants shouldn’t need to be tended to permanently. Some climbing is okay though, like checking every few days or so. Are there any robust crop plants that thrive in window boxes (i.e. limited width and depth)? Alternatively, what ornamental plants make sense on a garage roof?   To be clear: I do not intend to permanently vegetate the entire roof area. It should be limited to a few planters during the growing season. I think it’s a bit different from a “typical” rooftop garden, which is a regular garden on top of a building. "
3932,Are the white sections on my bean plant's leaves caused by white flies?,"I have been planting a few beans in my backyard, in a pot. The plants sprout well and start growing well.

Are these both the same problem? How do I get rid of them?    "
3933,Identify deciduous shrub with small red berries and small leaves,"I live in London, UK and have had this shrub in my garden since I moved in 2 years ago. It looks like it has been shaped/pruned.      Two years ago, there were tiny green leaves which turned red in autumn. And the plant sets tiny berries. Last year, the plant didn't have as many leaves (probably 10% of the year before) and there is only 1 berry that I can spot on the plant now.    Can someone identify the plant for me please? And why it may have a lesser leaf + berry flush? "
3934,Chrysanthimum-based pesticide killed my young plants,"Recently, a pesticide that I used to treat a number of my young plants killed everything I applied it to. I applied it in accordance with the directions, and the brand is well-reviewed on Amazon, but that didn't stop my melons, tomatoes, okra, and bottle gourds from deforming and slowly dying.  Thankfully, I only treated my first crop of the season, and by now, I have a whole second generation of plants fruiting, but that doesn't stop it from being a huge bummer and a great material lesson.  I know some oil-based pesticides can cause stress, and it's my own fault for not testing this new treatment on a smaller population first, but I'm wondering if anyone else had any experience with this, and what steps I can take to keep this from happening again. Should I apply pesticide to older plants only? If so, how can I protect my younger plants in a more gentle fashion in a bug-rich environment? I'm also (of course) VERY open to recommendations for other organic or at least naturally sources pesticide options. "
3935,plant bottom watering system,"I'm going to automate the bottom watering process (reservoir and wick method). This design should uses a water float valve instead of a timer.  What is the best way to do this?  Here are two methods:  Use a full-pressure water float value and use one of those steel covered hoses made for the washer/dryer.  Connect that to a float value in an enclosure.  The water will be siphoned off to all the plant sitting at the same water level as the float valve.  The washer dryer hoses can come with a safety cut-off if the water flows too quickly.  A small defect however could cause the system to loose a lot of water.  Another method might use a pressure regulator that will sit under constant pressure and work when the water is not flowing.  In other words, it will be hooked up to the outdoor faucet and be connected to a small low pressure tube.   So, the pressure can't build up when the water is off (some models say they only work when the water is flowing).  This should probably go down 10 PSI or lower.  The slower the better, a slow constant flow could feed many plants.  If the float valved jammed, water loss would be at a minimum.  This is a 10PSI preset unit for the dipper irrigation  (less than 10 dollars).  The problem was it had to be hooked up after the timer.  I'm not using a timer, I'm using a water float value.    Any other suggestions? "
3936,What is this white speck on the leaf of my plant?,  I found these tiny white web-like spots on many leaves of my plant. What are these specks? And what should I do with them?   Ignore them? Wash/Wipe them away with water? Pluck the infected leaves?   The plant is Holy Basil. 
3937,How do I get rid of mice without hurting the birds that might feed on them?,"I live in the country, so I've got mice that like to come into the house when the weather gets cold. The mice have learned to avoid the traps that I put inside the house, so I need to step up to something stronger. My first thought is to get some blocks of mouse poison and put a dozen of them all around the outside of the house, but I'm hesitant to do that, because I don't want to harm any birds that might feed on the mice.   Is there any mouse poison that I can use outside the house, that won't hurt any birds that feed on poisoned mice? Or is there a non-lethal alternative that I'm missing? "
3938,"Should I transfer a growing potted blueberry bush to a bigger pot, or into the ground?","I have a blueberry bush in a smallish pot.  It was given to us a couple of summers ago, and we put it in the only available pot we had at the time.    This year, we've had a pretty good yield from it, considering its size.  The fact that we now have a one-year-old daughter who loves blueberries means that we're thinking about putting the blueberry bush either in a larger pot, or planting it out in the border between a small apple tree and a small cherry tree.  So my question is - should we transfer it to a large pot, or put it in the soil?  It's a clay soil, if that helps.  If so, when is the best time to do it?  I'm in the UK.  "
3939,I need help deciding on what tree to plant in my backyard,"I would like to plant a tree in my backyard next to my house. I initially thought a big tree that throws the leaves would be a good idea but now i am worried about how would that affect my house and the surroundings.  I have a 7x7m backyard having 6x6m soil in the middle.  It's surrounded by 1 meter wide concrete and next to it it's my house.   I would like to create shade for a table and some chairs but I don't want my house to be in danger in the next 10 years.  I don't want a tree that produces fruits or attracts bees or any other insect.  I don't care if it throws the leaves or keep them for the winter.  I need to have hard wood so it won't create any damage to the cars or the house.   How can I choose the right tree for my place? Can you give me any tree suggestions? Is there any any DB that can provide me with these information?    Location  Corfu/Greece, Close to sea (approximately 4km) about 100 sea level.  Surrounding trees   Olives Citrus trees Chestnut Walnuts More olive trees (Olive trees in Corfu)   Image   "
3940,Does Pachysandra cause algae to grow on the concrete foundation of my house?,"I live in Massachusetts and have a swath of pachysandra approximately twelve inches wide growing against the foundation around my house. It's healthy and produced a lot of pretty, sweet-smelling flowers throughout the summer.   We recently trimmed a section and, as you can see, there's a green substance on the concrete that looks like algae. Is the pachysandra causing that? Is the algae dangerous to the concrete? If so, is trimming the plant enough or do we actually have to dig it up? One of the reasons we like it is because it hides the ugly foundation, so I'll leave it unless advised otherwise.    "
3941,How much growth should I expect from my pecan tree?,"We bought a pecan tree that is basically a 2' tall stick right now. It was planted in an opening with other trees and should get about 75% of available daylight.   How many years would you think it should take for it to start producing? How much taller will it get each year once it has established itself? Also, what can I do to help it along? "
3942,Can strawberries be grown year-round indoors?,Are there particular varieties that are best suited for indoor growing?  Will the plant die after producing fruit after x amount of harvests?  Are particular lighting schedules required to produce fruit?  Temperatures will be regulated as well. 
3943,"Is a virus, or something else, causing my tomato leaves to become shriveled, yellow and wrinkled?","Information:   two tomato plants - one is some kind of a plum tomato, and the other is a black tomato. the plum tomato's seed was taken from a freshly cut plum tomato (which was bought at the supermarket). the plum tomato was planted and grown indoors until it was about a month old, at which time it was taken outside. the plum tomato seemed to be doing great, until it was moved outside. the black tomato's seed was taken from a bag of seeds imported from eastern Europe. the black tomato was planted and grown outdoors. both tomato plants grow in a ready-made soil bought from a nursery, in a spacious plastic container. They're both located at a sunny spot, though near buildings blocks some of the sun, so they get about 4-6 hours of direct daily sunlight.   The issue:   since being taken outside, the plum tomato exhibits yellowing of leaves, drying and falling off of leaves (especially leaves which were in direct sunlight) and is overall sick-looking. the black tomato seemed to be OK up until now, when it has started to show similar symptoms.   The plum tomato:     The black tomato:    I'm suspecting this might be a virus, or a fungal infection of some sort, like the Fusarium wilt or Verticillium wilt, but I'm not sure.  How should I treat them?  Also, is it possible that the infection got into the soil and will affect plants that will be planted instead? "
3944,Why are my avocado's leaves drying out from the edges?,"I recently moved into a house in the South SF Bay Area in California, with three large avocado trees. I've noticed that the leaves on one of these trees is drying out from the edges:    Here's another photo, this time from further out to give you an idea of the extent of the damage:    In fall it produced smaller fruit than I'd expect, and the other trees on the property did pretty well.  Am I under-watering the tree? What's going on here? "
3945,What are these plants growing on my lawn?,I have these leaves sprouting all over my lawn and property. What is it? Should I be worried?  NOTE: This is in Wisconsin.   
3946,Can I measure chemical elements in soil myself?,"What sort of equipment would one need to ensure that plant soil contains the right concentration of the 13 mineral nutrients necessary for plant growth? Specifically, can this be measured in real-time without involving sending samples to a lab?  As far I understand, it's vital that all the following elements are present: nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, boron, copper, iron, chloride, manganese, molybdenum and zinc.  It seems like simply measuring pH gives only a rough estimate and is not a very precise indicator of the various element levels.  "
3947,Aloe leaf has discoloration,"I am new to caring for Aloe. I have a plant with a leaf that has brown discoloration. The leaf has started to curl around the spot, almost like it is damaged.  Does anyone know what the likely cause of this is? Do you think I should remove the leaf from the plant?     "
3948,Kiwi Actinidia arguta Issai black spots / patches on younger leaves,I bought 2 mini kiwi plants (Actinidia arguta Issai) online. It was delivered from Netherlands in case that matters. They are growing well except for black spots that seem to be spreading a little lately.  It doesn't really look like fungus and I can't find any other mention of this type of symptom. It has been unusually dry and warm for the last few weeks here in Ireland so fungus seem particularly unlikely. Unlike fungus the black areas aren't really spots but rather small section of the leave between small veins. It affect mostly smaller but not the smallest leaves.  One plant is still in a pot and one is in the ground with different soils and even uncomposted waste buried beneath. They both have the same issue. I see no pests except for a few small shield bugs or at least something that looks like it. Could shields bugs cause this? What else could it be?    
3949,"Should I remove brown, cap-shaped Birch Polypore mushrooms from my tree?","I learned from this question that my birch tree is infested with Birch Polypore  mushrooms. For two reasons, I'm wondering if I should remove them.  First, even though they grow because the tree is diseased, they also cause further decay. Would removal slow down the rate at which the tree dies?             Second, do the mushroom bodies release spores or any other substance capable of causing damage to nearby birches which currently seem healthy? "
3950,Is it possible to avoid rain making my flowers and decorations look muddy?,"I think this photo tells the story much better than words:    However, I will try words as well: It rained today, and earlier in the week, at times heavily.  As each rain drop landed within the flower box next to my front porch, it splashed a little.  When the rain drops were larger and falling more furiously, those splashes caused the topsoil to become a splatter of mud.  Now, as the sun is coming back out and drying things off, all of the things that should be looking pretty instead look muddy.  The dragon-fly on the ""Welcome"" rock, the stem of the solar light, even the lower leaves of the plants, all have a splotchy gray-brown film upon them.  Later, I will need to go back out and rinse things off with a more gentle flow of water.  Is there anything I can do to prevent this?  Any sort of ground cover, for example, or other tricks?    EDIT: In response to a comment, here is another photo (from a year ago) showing a wider perspective.  Total size is roughly 21"" by 36"".  The red rectangle shows about the area you see in the photo above.   "
3951,Accidentally mowed poison ivy plant. Can I clean the grass?,"So we forgot one small PI plant in the backyard and it got mown over. I see plenty of info on washing equipment with dawn soap and water, but what can I do about the contaminated yard?? I ask because we have a toddler who plays back there, so this is pretty important to me. If I sprayed water/soap mix on the grass to get the oils to wash down into the dirt, would that work? Would it kill the grass? "
3952,What is this plant? (sweet potato?),"A long while ago, I planted what I'm pretty sure was the head of a sweet potato that started growing.  The plant is still small but growing, and it has some small fruit-beginning (all green, but one which is red), but it really doesn't seems like it's going to be a sweet potato or something similar. It looks more like a tiny cherry tomato.  So, is it a sweet potato plant, or something else jumped into my pot? If so, what it is?         "
3953,Perlite causing tip burn in spider plant?,I've recently repotted my spider plant (chlorophytum comosum) to a slightly bigger pot with better drainage. I potted it in a mix of normal potting soil and perlite to aid drainage. I recently noticed that some of the tips in the lowest leaves have burnt. This is something that hadn't happened before.   My questions:   Could the perlite in the new mix have caused this? Should I repot the plant into fresh soil? Is this condition a threat to the health of my plant?   I have uploaded an album on Imgur with the pictures: [website]
3954,Is my cucumber bitten?,This is the first time I am growing cucumbers. I have really little knowledge when it comes to cucumbers.   I have noticed that there is a small spot in my cucumber. Can it be that a beetle or another insect has injected the “bitter” juice into it? Or is it just a cucumber thorn come off? Please help...... Thanks! 
3955,Should I rototill compost into existing barren soil before planting drought-hardy grass?,"I've had 2"" of composted manure added to my desert front yard (New Mexico, zone 7a) to serve as new topsoil after having someone with a bobcat and a dump truck to haul off the gravel and plastic sheeting that was previously there. I'm planning to plant Buffalo grass, Curly Mesquite grass, or some kind of prairie grass mix this spring, but before I do that, should I rototill the compost into the existing soil? Or just plant right in the compost itself? I worry that if I rototill, ancient weed seeds that were covered by the plastic and gravel for decades will be brought to the surface, but if I don't, the grass roots won't see any need to spread deeper than the 2"" of compost, inhibiting its drought resistance. The existing soil is heavy clay. "
3956,Getting rid of spikey ball weeds,"There is a weed in my backyard that generates little brown balls with spikes on them.  The balls are probably less than 1cm in diameter.  See picture.   Here are my questions: 1) What is the name of it?  2) How do I get rid of it? {What are the recommended sprays or chemicals?}  3) Need sprays that are not harmful to dogs or cats.  The little balls are getting into the fur of dogs (including their paws) and the plush toys.  FYI:  This plant is growing in: U.S.A, Southern California in the foothills of the Santa Ana mountain range (south Orange County). "
3957,Replanting from a hanging planter,"I have a large pot that sits on top of a pillar, so I wanted to buy some flowers that would hang over the edges of it. We ended up buying a hanging arrangement of calibrachoa. Now I'm wondering if I'm better off trying to transplant the flowers from the hanger into the pot, or if I should simply remove the hanging apparatus and place the bowl on top of the pot. If you do recommend that I transplant them, do you have suggestions on how to do that effectively? The hanging bowl is about twelve inches in diameter, and the pot is about eighteen inches in diameter. "
3958,Can I target grass burrs & clover without killing wildflowers?,"My lawn is a mix of St. Augustine and Bermuda grass. I'm in central Texas.  Last season, I sowed wildflowers and really enjoyed the results. I'd like to do the same next season, but I really need to control the grass burrs and clover. The clover I have spreads out and smothers the other plants, and the burrs are bad for little bare feet. I'm not quite so worried about other weeds, though.  Is there any herbicide that I can use that will specifically kill or prevent sand burrs and carpet burrs, without killing or preventing wildflowers (or the lawn, for that matter)?  Same question for clover. Is there an herbicide that will target primarily clover, without killing off other things? "
3959,What columnar cactus species I should select as a rootstock for a Rhipsalis standard?,"I want to make a standard(1) with scions from a Rhipsalis pilocarpa, or mistletoe cactus. I need a rootstock that:   Is columnar Is unbranched Has good longevity (at least 20 years) Can adapt to high humidity and light shade Has a slim, clean, stem at least 3' long   Stem rigidity is optional, because the plant would be staked at about 3' (by the graft union). I will be side grafting.   I have been considering using a freshly rooted Selenicereus cutting as the rootstock. Is that a good choice? If so/no, what other options do I have?  (1) Standard in this context means 'tree form', as a standard rose bush. This term is used with plants that do not naturally grow in tree form, trained to one single stem, or 'trunk', resembling a tree, although smaller in size. "
3960,What fungus is this? (Peruvian amazon fungi),I found what I think is a fungus (Ascomycetes division?) in the Peruvian rainforest the first week of August. Does anybody know at least the common name/genus of it?  Thank you so much!      
3961,Is there any merit to my wacky idea to grow a Purslane lawn?,"I have this wacky idea to plant Purslane instead of grass in my desert yard (zone 7a, 9 inches of rain annually). I'm not keen on having high-maintenance turf; the only grass in the running against the Purslane idea is Curly Mesquite grass, which I've read can grow on 5 inches. But I like the idea of Purslane instead because since it's a weed, it will more or less grow on its own, and it's edible! I think it's delicious and love the idea of being able to graze on my own lawn. The seeds are also available dirt cheap.  But Purslane is an annual and I worry about how the yard will look after it dies and before it re-grows the next year. Is this a legitimate worry? And if I carpet a whole area with it, will it reliably re-seed itself for the next year? "
3962,How to prune a cherry tree that was left alone since being planted,"I recently moved into a house with lots of horticultural learning opportunities :)  This semi-dwarf cherry was planted at least two years ago and (as far as I can tell) has never been pruned.  The picture shows two different angles. For scale, the lowest branches are about knee level:    My goal is to have it eventually develop into a healthy, fruit-bearing, backyard-type tree.  I don't need to get a harvest any time soon.  How should I proceed to get this tree into shape?  I've done a lot of reading, but haven't actually done any tree pruning.  Also, when should I do this initial pruning? "
3963,House plants - What and how,"I have received these four plants as a gift and have no idea how to take care of them. I have no experience with plants. The delivery lady from the shop said that they need light but not direct sunlight, which means what exactly? Also how often do I water and do I need to give any plant food?  Thanks   "
3964,Identification of trailing violet with red bloom,"I have a trailing, vigorous growing violet (I have been told) with  red bloom and variegated leaves. I do not have a pic of the bloom. Is it possible to id it? How do I post a pic of it? "
3965,How to start over-pachysandra decimated,"I had a beautiful, thick, well established patch of pachysandra in my yard that is now decimated. To put it mildly, I don't have a green thumb and since I have a full time job and three young kids I also tend to neglect my yard/plants. I do, however, have enough sense to notice if something isn't quite right, and I will admit that I noticed the pachysandra was a little leggy last summer/fall. By that I mean there were several plants that ""stuck their necks out"" above the rest. They were lighter green/yellowish than the rest. I didn't make much of it.  Anyway, this spring after the snow melted the pachysandra is 95% gone. As in, not there AT ALL. The few stragglers left are sickly looking-the leaves have brown, shriveled, dry tips and there are only a few of those at the very top of the plant. The stems are long and bare. We didn't have a worse winter this year than last. We did have a late snow storm (April) for our region (Southeast New England) but the pachysandra was like this before that.   From the research I've done I think it might have been blight. How can I tell since I don't have many plants and of the survivors there is so little foliage to examine? I'm thinking it doesn't matter; I am probably going to have to start over with new pachysandra plants or perhaps some other ground cover. In either scenario, is there something I should do to prepare the area (in case it was a fungus or some other pathogen?)         "
3966,Mice eating sown grass seed,"I've been having trouble re-planting a bare patch of lawn at the back of my small garden. I was wondering if birds had been raiding the seeds (and I have bought some plastic netting ready for next attempt), but just a few hours ago at dusk, I spotted a mouse hopping out into the sown patch and helping itself. The mouse came back about 30 seconds after being scared off - so it clearly found getting into the garden for the seeds worthwhile.  The garden backs onto a small woodland area, and I don't think I can realistically mouse-proof entry to the garden physically (e.g. with wire mesh).  I don't want to bait or poison any mice. First I don't like the idea, also these are just wild mice, just taking an opportunity to fill up from my garden, they aren't an infestation, there are none in the house.  It is not a huge area, I have about 4 square metres of lawn to return from bare mud to grassy. Overall the garden is also small - just 5 metres by 5 metres.  What is my best option to get a green patch on the lawn?      Ideas I have considered:  I have read that peppermint oil is repellent to mice, but will putting a line of it or something similar along the back fence be effective? Is there any other way to mouse-proof my grass seed in the garden long enough for it to sprout before being eaten?   Alternatively, I may be better off pre-germinating the grass somewhere mouse-proof and spreading it out after a certain time as in this question: Will pre-germinating grass seed produce a green lawn in less time than just seeding and watering properly? - if so, how long is good enough to not be interesting to the mouse? "
3967,What are the differences that can be apparent between vines and creepers?,"The terms 'vines' and 'creepers' are used frequently in plant descriptions. They both have flexible growth and cannot support themselves in an upright habit.  A simple image search brings almost identical results. (vines and creepers) And from here:     All creepers are vines, but not all vines are creepers.   Are there any major differences that can be apparent between vines and creepers? What are they? "
3968,Putting fruit tree branches in compost,"I just started composting. In addition to putting lawn clippings, kitchen waste and dry leaves what else can I put in?  Is it okay to put branches of trees (fruit, olive, etc) in the compost? "
3969,Seeds That Grow in Decomposing Scraps,"Are there any seeds that will tolerate growing in decomposing scraps of food? My city collects organic waste, but I thought I'd try to put it to use myself. I have a can of sweetened red bean paste that's growing aggressive fuzzy gray mold and there is a population of fruit flies trapped inside under the cling wrap. Currently, I put the can on my windowsill for observation. Is there a possibility to grow any plant in there? I'm worried about the seeds germinating but then the mold chokes out the seedling. "
3970,Identify striped bug on plants: safe or suspect?,"New to gardening, many species are unknown to me. This one (and many of its friends) with nice metallic colored stripes just apppear on my lavender, rosemary and slightly less on honeysuckle.     What is its name? It looks (to me) like a Rosemary beetle, or Chrysolina americana. Is it harmless to the plants? If not, what actions should I take (preferably without heavy chemicals): handpicking? I sometimes use black soap spray on ants for instance.  "
3971,How much space between trees?,"Is there a recommended spacing when planting new trees so they do not interfere with each other's growth? I want to group a number of the same tree species together as densely as possible while still allowing sufficient sun so they grow almost as if each tree were alone in a field. Essentially, I do not want to create a forest of trunks with leaves only at the top.  Is there simple rule or formula for this? As a made up example: Minimum distance between trees should be 1.5 times the expected height or 2 times the expected crown spread (whichever is larger) for typical trees in the species.  If there is not a general rule of thumb for all species, I would appreciate recommendations for spacing between white dogwoods. "
3972,Remedy poorly positioned black plastic edging,"I had 5"", contractor grade, black, plastic edging installed but there are parts where it's exposed above the lip and some gaps behind it.   I pulled old plastic and removed brick to create the trench and it wasn't always even and the guy I hired I suspect cut corners a bit toward the end of the job because he was tired (human nature and nothing I can't fix).     What can I put behind the edging where there are gaps, more dirt, more gravel, or just leave it?  For the places where the edging is too high, it's staked.  Do I need to do anything?   I suppose my options are to leave it, mound up to it with dirt, move it downward by digging everything out and restaking it, or soak it with water and see if I can push it down.  My only concern with it being up too high is that I don't know how it will behave in the winter when things start freezing.  So, more concisely:   How do I fill gaps in edging on the yard side? What should I do if my plastic edging is too high?  "
3973,bright spots on tomato leaves - illness or just to much watering?,"I've transplanted tomatoes into the bigger pot. I am keeping the plants in the green house. My growing ritual is somewhat unusual, but I am determined to give it a try. When transplanted I cut the main stem and plant them 25cm deep.   After 10 days, i noticed some whitish-yellow spots on the leaves. See images below. I am wondering, what is this? I haven't found exact match of such leaves on google, but it look similar to oedema or leaf mold. Do you know what is wrong with my tomatoes? Besides this spots, the plant looks great and has lots of new growings.       Here are some more images: [website]UPDATE after a week: The plant is doing just fine. Very few of the spots turned into holes, the others remain the same size and shape.  "
3974,Is this a sign of some disease or insect damage? (Piel De Sapo plant),"I tried doing some research into what might be causing the damage, as the vine is also damaged slightly. I looked around the rest of my garden and the winter melon and hairy melons are growing perfectly. The pumpkins are also growing without a problem, so I am at a loss to why the Piel De Sapo is growing at a sub-par level.  I believe it is some disease but I haven't had any experience with growing this type of melon. There isn't much information online  I'm growing this in Sydney, from a melon I bought at Costco Australia.        Any ideas? Or is this just basic insect damage? If it is insect damage, then does anyone have any ideas on what I can use to deter these insects? "
3975,How to tell if I have multiple seedlings/when to remove secondary seedlings?,"So I asked a question here about planting in a raised container a few weeks ago, and now I have some small seedlings!  I planted a couple seeds per hole, and it seems that in some cases, multiple plants have emerged from the same hole in the soil.  My questions are:    How can I tell whether I just have multiple sprouts from one seed or if I have multiple plants growing in the same spot? If I do have multiple plants, when should I cut off the secondary (smaller) plant?   Here are a few pics of what I have so far:     Source "
3976,Best time to harvesting blue vates kale,I am growing kale and this is the first year. It is the blue vates variety. My question is when and how to harvest. Days to maturity is 65 days (and it has been 65 days since I started the seeds indoors) but I don't think the plant has matured. I started with indoor seeds and slowly migrated them to 4 inch pots and last week to my raised bed. Any guidance on how and when to harvest?  Should I wait for the plant to fully develop and then remove it in it's entirety?  Should I be taking older leaves off and use them and if so how do I ensure that the new growth is not impacted.   
3977,How tall will this Magnolia stellata grow?,"I have bought a Magnolia stellata that has a height of 27 inches (70 cm) above ground and a root system 8 inches deep (20 cm). It looked like it was newly potted, so I went home and checked the roots. From what it looks like, the roots have been cut to fit the small pot. Based on this information, can you tell what is the maximum height this plant will reach?   "
3978,How should I care for this Succulent?,I bought this plant over two weeks ago. What is its name? How should I take care of it?  
3979,Could I use fleece covering over blackcurrant plant in England all year round?,"I want to give my new redcurrant plant the absolute best chance of not being attacked or infested with insects, so I have the idea to put a warming cap/fleece cover on the plant to keep insects and birds out. In England there isn't a huge amount of sun, but a good amount during spring/summer. Could the plant suffer or get too hot from using the fleece covering during spring and summer? Or would it be fine? It is fleece so it is breathable and not plastic.  The kind of fleece I would be using is this, it's not the thick clothing type fleece if that's what you were thinking - is this the row cloth you were talking about? Since this is what I've got, will this be ok? if you understand what I was referring to now?     I'm not sure insects it would be since there are none right now, but I've struggled with these green aphids/black fly type insects on my wild strawberry plants I've also had in pots, and I'm worried that they'll decide to live on and infest the redcurrant plant. I'm also in general just worried about any kind of insect or worm deciding to make the berries their home, since several months ago at a completely different house I saw how easily worms infested a huge blackberry bush at another house in the town where I live.  I do not know regarding white pines unfortunately. There are pine trees in this town but not close to my garden.   thank you @Ecnerwal - I also heard about that but thought while it's not fruiting, the covering could be ok. Or would it be detrimental to the production of berries/pollinating even when its not fruiting? "
3980,Are white stuff on avocado root a disease?,  Are this white stuff in the avocado roots any illness of the plant?  Should I do anything about it? 
3981,Do I need to remove all of the small unknown roots from my raised bed?,"Last year, I built three raised beds and they were quite successful.  But, at the end of the season when I cleaned them out, I noticed small, thin roots growing throughout, which, I assume, are coming from my neighbors fir trees that are on the other side of my fence.  This week, I dug out all of the soil from one of the boxes and placed a barrier between the ground and the box (I realize this might only be a fix for a season or two).  I want to shovel the soil back in, but my question is, do I have to remove all the small roots? I am removing as many by hand as possible, but some are so small and singular, I'm not sure what to do.  Is it okay to leave them in there? "
3982,Understanding the flowering of strawberries,"When I moved into my house last year I found a bed of (unmaintained) strawberries which despite that were fruiting quite well. This spring I cleaned up and dug out all of them and removed weeds. Then I replanted them randomly into the same bed and because they were so many into 3 other beds close by.   All of them worked and they produced quite a lot of fruits in the first round. Now the second round has started and the plants on the original bed are fruiting very nicely. On the other 3 beds only very few plants are flowering again, but they build a lot of huge leaves and daughter plants.   1) Is the creation of daughters and fruits exclusive? (I have one plant which flowers and has daughters (which themselves are flowering) out of 40 plants).  2) I put some compost tea on them once a month for three months just to see what happens. What (else) can I do to encourage flowering? This year or next year?  Update: I forgot the add in my original question that when I replanted them I haven't put anything into the soil: no compost, no fertilizer, no manure. I wanted to see what happens, gather conclusions what to do with the soil next time. Hence my question. Thanks for the ideas so far. "
3983,Can dragon fruit get scale?,"I think that my dragon fruit has scale. This is my first encounter with scale so I want to check first. I assume that any plant can get scale. When researching it I never saw it mentioned on cacti so I was surprised when I saw it on the dragon fruit. Is this scale? If not, what is it?  Location: Phoenix, Arizona       "
3984,How long until I can over-plant grass seed after spraying Weed b Gon,"I have 5 acres of backyard that used to be farmland.  I planted grass, but I think I used the wrong kind, as it doesn't seem to be spreading.  Now ~5 years later, the yard looks decent, but the grass is fairly thin and the weeds (dandelions mostly) are starting to get heavy.  So I sprayed Weed B Gon on it, and now want to over-plant grass seed.  I'm not concerned about getting it perfect.  If 10% of the seed I put down comes up and starts to spread over the years, I'd consider that a win.  Every amount above that certainly welcome, but...  I just sprayed today, and it's supposed to rain in 2 days (and a few days in a row).  I was hoping I could toss down the grass seed tomorrow before rain, but I wasn't sure if that's too soon, or if it matters with this particular chemical.  Can I over-plant grass seed a day after spraying Ortho Weed B Gon? If not, how long do I need to wait (and why)? "
3985,Ginkgo Biloba growth rate,"For years I dream to plant a Ginkgo Biloba. And the other day I found two ones in a shop.   The first one was really cheap, but really little with its head having been cut off... it was something like 20 cm high, with a little note evaluating its height after ten years: 60 cm.  The other one, much more expensive, really good looking, (but costing something like 160 euros) was already circa 60 cm high.  Does the Ginkgo Biloba growth rate is really that slow ? Do you think it's the fact that the first one had its head cut off ?  So... if a plant one from a seed, how much time would it take to be 1 meter old ? (It's for my blaconny, I don't have a garden) "
3986,Do Citrus potted plants need acidic soil,"Does Citrus Plants growing in pots, need slightly acidic soil?  I am thinking of the jasmine plant that requires, 1 teaspoon of vinegar, mixed with water, approx every 15 days, particularly during flowering season.  Should I do the same for other plants like Tangerines or lemons and give them doses of vinegar, periodically? "
3987,How can I get rid of weeds in my garden?,"Obviously it is my first time gardening and I have weeds taller than my tomato, pepper, basil and mint plants. Is there any chemical I can use without hurting my plants or any solution?  Also it has been a month or so. I can see tomatoes now but pepper plants are just getting taller but I don't see much pepper so far, is this normal? I have cayenne, jalapenos, garden salsa and bell pepper. I see two cayenne getting red and one garden salsa getting red.       "
3988,Avocado Transplanting and tap root,"I am planning on purchasing an avocado tree (grown from seed) online, as the seller has agreed to provide me with a cutting from his mature, fruit bearing plant, and I want to experiment with grafting.    Unfortunately the avo trees  (I think they are 1 or 2 years old) I'm purchasing are already in the ground - so they need to be dug up as well.   [ I expect the trees to be very cheap, so it doesn't really matter if I fail, but I'd like to get as much right as possible ]  Questions -   I understand that avocado trees have sensitive roots.  Are there any tips for relocating an avocado which is already in the ground ? Do avocados have tap roots, and if so, how far down would they typically  go ?  (I've heard and read a lot of conflicting information here)  "
3989,Can I use red clay bricks for an organic veggie raised bed? What about mortar?,I am trying to find an inexpensive but attractive way to put a raised bed in that will be used for an organic veggie garden.  It sounds as if clay bricks are OK if they haven't been in a fireplace.  What about the mortar?  What do I need to look for? 
3990,Best Retaining wall solution adjacent to fence,"Wall 24 inches in height.  Want to minimize gap between fence and wall  Contractor wants to nail 2x12s against the fence to create the small retaining wall. I don't like that because of the load on the fence, what todo when the fence has to be replaced or post, rotting problems. It does minimize the footprint of the ""wall"" though.  I was thinking small gabion cages, which would end up mostly buried. Most that I have found are 12+ inches wide.   Probably best is to replace fence bottom with retaining wall but don't want to spend the extra money.   Are there any other better solutions? Or anything to keep in mind?  Pacific Northwest area Fence has been standing for about 6 years as is.    "
3991,What causes mildew on plants and how to prevent it?,"Whats the best/cheapest/natural (3 separate questions or 1?) way to control mildew on plants?  We have a lot of roses that had not been nurtured for years, and they are really struggling with mildew (black, white, yellow, you name it these roses got it).   I'm also getting a small garden started and noticed white mildew showing up on my pumpkin leaves.  Will the same solution work for many different types of plants and mildew, or will I need to trouble shoot each case individually? "
3992,Could you tell me of what four species these seedlings belong to?,"I have been trying to germinate seeds from a mixed packet of tree/bush seeds:   Holly,  Rowan,  Alder Buckthorn  and Dogrose.    Only these two seeds have been germinating nicely and becoming seedlings. I'm curious which of the four it is, could anyone tell me please? Or is it too early to tell?          "
3993,How to replace lawn with wildflowers?,"We've got a lot of lawn that we don't use (maybe 150x35') and I don't love mowing.  (Last year we let this area grow out into 24"" tall grasses.)  I like the idea of getting a bunch of wildflower mix and just turning that land over to some self-seeding annuals, but how would that work?  I've read some articles that say I would need to till the soil before planting wildflower seeds.  Using a walk-behind tiller over that area sounds exhausting (I did exactly that on our nearby 50x30' garden).  If tilling is necessary, are there any ways to make that easier on myself?  Is the goal of tilling to remove the root system of the grass &amp; weeds, or just to provide enough space for the wildflowers to get a start?  I've noticed the golf course on my way to work has torched a large space - presumably to prep the site for new grass or something.  Could I do the same?  In short, what are my options?  Has anyone done this before?  Edit: answering some questions:   I haven't set a budget, but I would like to keep the entire cost under [tex]250) we're in northern Vermont on the warmer end of zone 3, nearly 4 our soil is silty clay loam - we live on the sides of an old river valley our aesthetic preferences run toward the organic side - we don't need to have everything neat &amp; trim &amp; tidy.  "
3994,Citrus treatment for scale bugs and whether fruit is edible,"I have some citrus trees with scale bugs, they are kept as house plants and live outside during the warmer months.  They've been sprayed (regrettably) with a pretty nasty pesticide.  It's called Bug Clear Ultra and Acetamiprid is listed as being the chemical.  (I don't want to use that spray again, but used it under duress).  My question is whether the fruits are edible given they've been sprayed with nasty chemicals (Acetamiprid).  Having read the container again (see picture), it gives a guide to 'latest application before harvest', which is some help.  Though further reading info provided by the University of Hertfordshire reveals that this is a neonicotinoid and that it can cause skin irritation (scroll to the bottom of the link for a summary of this).  I'm still rather unsure whether I can use the fruit or whether it could possibly be harmful.  I'll try out the organic methods next time (mentioned in the RHS link I've provided), does anyone have successful experience of using organic treatments?  EDIT - to add detail following Bamboo's points   While fruitlets were present? Yes. While the flowers were there? Yes. Second, can you add a photo showing the extent of the scale infestation, or say whether it is on the leaves as well as on the wood.  I don't have a photo of this yet, but there are still scale insects on the leaves.  I noticed found one or two on new leaves as well, although I believe I sprayed at the right time; I read somewhere that there is a most effective time to spray, according to the beasties' lifecycle.  Perhaps the treatment isn't 100% effective in any case.      "
3995,How to sterilise soil?,"I am planning to do some indoor gardening. I've build some containers large enough to host 1200kg of soil.   I am gonna use the soil form the garden and forest, but I  would like to sterilise it first. I am not interested in commercially available sterilised soil.  Firstly, when is soil considered sterilised? By which I mean to what temperature must be heated and how long must stay at that T.  Secondly, what procedure do you recommend? I am actually dealing with large amount of soil, so I am wondering if there are any commercially available products for that kind of work and   Thirdly, how it is done on industrial scale? "
3996,Fig tree languishing after 2 years - how to reinvigorate?,"I have a fig tree which was planted two years ago next to a wall.  The soil-side of the wall faces north, the sunny pavement side face south, so it provides plenty of heat.  The sun can shine on the tree itself too.  So I don't think light is an issue.  How can I best improve the soil?  Perhaps moisture retention is an issue too?     "
3997,White spots on rose leaves,I have a rose. I have noticed that some of the leaves have got white dots and do not look healthy. There are also strings between some of them (similar to spider webs). I also noticed some small flies around my rose a few weeks ago.  Can someone explain what is going on and what I should do? What can I do to avoid a similar situation in the future?  Here are some pictures:  Click any image for full size     Update:    The white spots seem to be inside the leaves. The leaf on top is washed with warm water and there are still the white spots.    There are moving black creatures under the leaves. There are also things that look like eggs/larvae.  Update 2:    
3998,Growing in barrel planters,"I need some help.  I set up two half barrel planters this spring, filled with nice bagged soil from Lowe's, but have had no luck growing plants from seed after about two months.  I think my issues are twofold - I have read that barrel planters dry out very easily (making it hard to get seeds to germinate and then grow for those that do), and I have seen a number of sparrows peck at the dirt (could they be eating seeds and shoots?).  It seems like it should be easier to grow in the easier planter than in the ground.  What am I doing wrong, and how do I make it better?  Regarding plants, I seeded poppies and two types of lettuce. "
3999,Plants growing between the pavers next to rain drainage,"Plants (and not just weeds) grew between the tiles and pavers of my balcony next to the rain drainage. They may cause damage to the ground (and ceiling of the person living underneath me) so how do I remove them? which tools do I need and what's the easiest way?   They've been there for long and apparently their roots extend deep down. If it is too much hassle,  how can I at least remove the ones appearing on the surface for now and worry about the rest later? Below is a picture . "
4000,"Why do I have brown ""jelly"" and rotten smell inside my healthy looking tomatoes?","I have about 30 tomato plants of several varieties, all hybrid except for one heirloom. Every single tomato plant is having the same issue but my peppers, eggplant, green beans, and cucumbers are fine even though they are planted in the same area.  The plants looking healthy and beautiful and are producing a ton of healthy looking fruit that seemed to ripen just fine until I cut one open and the smell was awful. Inside the liquid/goo you find in a normal tomato that is normally clear, is brown.  It's in every fruit I've cut open and doesn't matter if it's green or fully ripe.  Some of the fruit I let sit inside and ripen on the counter developed black rot spots that are soft and squishy and began growing mold.  A neighborhood farmer told me to try adding epsom salt to the soil because it could be a magnesium deficiency but he wasn't sure what it was. I haven't added anything to the soil except for lime back in December. This is also the first year I am growing in this soil, I put down wood chips last year and covered it with a tarp to kill back the grass and allow some of the chips to break down. When I had the soil tested everything was fine as far as PH and NPK (part of why I didn't add anything).  Could this be a type of mold or fungus? If this can't be identified here should I send a sample to a lab for testing?  I just added epsom salt and some fertilizer and a bit of calcium nitrate. If it is a deficiency that is causing the issue the fruit that is currently on the plant can't be corrected, right? I just want to know before I go pulling all the fruit off and tossing it.  Thank you in advance for any help you guys can provide!           "
4001,Hydroponic feeding times and scheduals,"I am having some weird readings that do not strictly go against what I have researched but seems I may be missing something.  I am growing Tomatoes and cucumbers along with one small chilli plant.  At the beginning of the week I start a new cycle and change my water out add new nutrients and adjust my PH.  The PH drops continuously for 4 days while I keep topping it up every 3 hours or so.  I am using RO water and while the nutrients themselves don't seem to bring down the PH I think it is the plants reacting to them that causes the PH to drop for a while.  On the 4th day it stabilizes, and all is happy.  I add water when its needed to top off my tank to the normal level. But the EC does not really drop to anything below 2 within a week.  My question is this :  By the end of the week do I need to add more nutrients if my EC reading is still around 2.4 ? ( The nutrients apparently should be added each week, but I think this may be excessive )  I want to know because each time I add nutrients ( and do a new complete water change ) I have to go through 4 days of stressing about PH levels all the time.  In short, how long can I leave the same nutrients in my system for ?  If the reading of my EC stays above a certain level can I just keep using them until it reaches around 1.7 then change the water and add new nutrients ?  Sorry if this seems like a basica question but I'm scratching my head to figure out if its worth doing the new nutrient additions so often if the plants are not taking up them in that time frame.  I understand that you should drain and start with new water every week or 2 but that wouldn't be needed if I was using the same nutrients and not adding anything more ? I have not been able to find anywhere that says how long you can keep your nutrients working for you in the same batch.  Thanks for the input. "
4002,What is this big plant with long skinny green leaves?,"I have this large plant that I have owned for over 2 years. What is it? can I have the common name as well as Latin name, thank you.  I am in northern Europe but that probably doesn't matter since it's an indoor plant. Here are a few photos:   Also is it normal for it to have brown spots on some of the leaves, as well as brown the the edges of the leaves?     "

4004,What chemicals react with greenhouse plastic and cause it to turn white?,"I have a small PVC hoop house that I built last winter and plan on using again this winter. I found out first hand, then read about it later on, that the plastic used for greenhouses will react with PVC and turn white. Since I've already invested in the PVC, and it's a much cheaper alternative to metal pipe, I'm trying to come up with a way to isolate the plastic from touching the PVC.  The options I've come up with so far are to use some type of tape (felt, electrical, clear duct tape etc.) and apply it to the outside of the hoops where they come in contact with the plastic. My purlins are attached on the inside of the hoops so I don't need to worry about them. The felt shouldn't react since I've seen this sold on greenhouse supply websites for just this reason, but what about the tape? Are there any other low-cost options I'm missing?  The design is changing a bit the second time around, but this is what it looks like from the inside. As you can see very little PVC actually comes into contact with the plastic covering. The plastic I used was from Green-Tek which I think is really Dura-Film Super 4 from AT Films and it's what I plan on using again this year.   "

4006,Can a raised vegetable garden co-exist with nearby fruit trees?,"I am putting in new raised beds for a vegetable garden. The beds will be 40cm (16 inches) high. The beds will line the length of a fence and I am planning to put a row of fruit trees (possibly blueberries and passionfruit) between the beds and the fence.  In order to try and prevent the tree roots from colonising the vegetable beds and stealing all the water and nutrients, I am planning on laying porous weed matting underneath the raised beds. My theory is that will keep the tree roots away from the vegetable soil but still allow drainage.  However, I have received strong advice from a family member that this isn't sufficient and that the trees will still suck the vegetable beds dry. Basically I've been told that you can't put fruit trees anywhere near vegetable beds if you want the vegetables to thrive.   Is this correct? Is there any way to make this work? If so I've considered some even more drastic measures such as hammering in sheet metal vertically down the back of the vegetable beds to keep the tree roots from growing in under the beds (they could happily grow the other way into the neighbours place as they don't have anything growing along that fence). Would this work? "
4007,Starting shallot advice,"OK, I have been attempting to get a shallot bed going the last couple years.  I chose to go with seeds, but really have had little luck.  If I start inside I have had little luck transplanting.  I may have not allowed them to get large enough, but I think the bigger issue was weather conditions that tend to go rapidly between cold/wet to hot/dry with drying winds.    I have attempted direct sow, but with very low germination rates.  Those have lived, and I am now up to about 10 live shallots, From about 400 seeds over two years.  My definition of very low germination, two years and still I will not have enough to harvest for table and still have sets to replant to really get a bed established.  What I am dealing with for background:  USDA zone 3, very cold winters, short growing season, and rapid changes from winter to hot dry summer.  At this point, I obviously would have been better off starting two years ago buying sets or even live plants, but now, I want to get the bed going in earnest next year with enough success that I can harvest and use and still have plenty left for ongoing, so I am looking for advise/thoughts on options.  I am thinking I could either try earlier with indoor starts, maybe 12 weeks before last frost dates and hope for transplant survival with bigger plants, or should I try starting seeds now in pots and try to get them to single set size and harvest those in fall to get them a cold rest period and plant in spring, or is there another, better option.  (No, none of the other gardeners I know raise shallots and have spare sets to share.  When I asked, they are more than eager for me to share with them though as when they have tried they had similar results.)  Am I way off base with either approach and is there a better option I am overlooking?  Also, in starting from seed, is it better to tight pack and start as a bunch then separate at transplant as nurseries do with onion starts, or give them room? "
4008,How to keep my lawn dry leading up to my wedding?,I'm having a wedding in my backyard a week from now. It's looking like its going to rain during the week and I'm worried about my lawn turning into a swamp. We have a tent for the wedding so we can handle some rain during the actual wedding but I'm worried about the week leading up to it.   I can work from home during the week leading up to it so I can do as needed tarping if that's reasonable (I'm thinking like a baseball grounds crew). Is that a good idea? Is there a better way to keep my lawn dry leading up to the big day?    
4009,Maintenance of oleander plants?,I have a few oleanders and was wondering what I should be doing to keep the plant in its best condition?  All I do is feed it compost once or twice a year.  Anything else?

Coconut Tree  Teak Tree  Lemon Tree  Jack Fruit Tree   Do you recommend any trees (Hot climate - India) that will not damage the house foundation but will give sun shade along with other benefits? 
4011,How do you stop rabbits from eating your lawn?,I'm experimenting with a patch of new lawn (different grass type) in the middle of my existing lawn but it must taste pretty good because the desert cotton tail rabbits are eating all the new shoots.  After reading this question's accepted answer: How do I prevent critters from chewing my sprinkler system? I had the idea that I could spray the grass with some chilli pepper oil.  Questions: 1. Will the chilli pepper oil damage grass when sprayed on it? 2. How do you prevent rabbits from eating your grass? 
4012,My 14' weeping willow tree's pruned main branch is growing off center,"I pruned the main branch of my (7') weeping willow tree last year too low (I'm guessing) and now the main branch is about 3-5"" off center. The tree is now about 12-14' high.   Is this a problem? If so, how do I correct it?   "
4013,What useful things can I use shredded branches for?,"I will be carrying out some heavy pruning of some over grown trees (mixture of deciduous, fruit and a few conifers) over the next few months.   I am already planning to save some of the thicker, straighter sections for woodwork, sculpture and log fires, most of the thinner stuff will probably end up going through a shredder.  I've read here that it can take a long time for the wood to decompose.   So My question is, what beneficial use could I put a substantial amount of chipped wood to? Mulch? Bottom layer of raised beds perhaps? "
4014,Young maple tree with no growth on top shoots,"I have a maple tree I planted maybe 2 years ago.

4015,"Why do plants root when placed in water, but die in standing water","A lot of plants need well drained soil. They're said to not like getting their feet wet. The explanation given is that the roots need oxygen; they will rot and die if they're in standing water for too long.  But a lot of the same plants will root if you take a cutting and place it in water for long enough.  An example of this is kiwi vines. They require well drained soil. But their cuttings will root if you put them in a cup of water for a few weeks. I'm doing this right now (for the first time); mine have just began growing roots.  I've also grown a sweet potato in a coffee cup filled with water.  So, why does this work? Why don't cuttings drown instead of grow roots? Why do the roots continue to grow instead of immediately rotting and dying, since they don't have any oxygen? "
4016,What causes crinkled bean leaves?,I would like to know what causes the leaves to be crinkled and then the whole plant dies. I planted a bean seed in this soil before and the leaves gradually became crinkled and died. I thought that's because I watered it too much and due to the lack of nitrogen fertilizer.  I mixed the soil with sand to make good ventilation and I made holes in the bottom of the jar so that the excess water leaks. I planted another seed but the leaves became crinkled again. I thought it's due to lack of fertilizers so I put too much Azote fertilizer. It finally died because of crinkled leaves and too much fertilizer.  I changed the type of beans. I brought a type that has smaller seeds which I think it's planted locally in Egypt. The leaves are also crinkled as you can see in the picture. Is that normal or Is it going to die? What's the cause of the crinkled leaves? Is it a virus or lack of a specific nutrient or what?  I spend months doing my own trial and error but didn't work.

4018,Foliage Plant identification and help with yellow spotting on leaves,"Can you please help me with two (related) things? Firstly, can anyone tell me what the non-ivy plant in the picture is? I got it at a local supermarket for Christmas a couple of years back, and it just said 'Christmas basket' with no description of the contents.     Secondly, can someone help me with diagnosing the leaf spotting?   It has been sitting over the kitchen hob for the better part of the last two years, and when it initially appeared a couple of months back, I assumed it was just steam/hot oil spraying onto and damaging the leaves. However, it's spreading to leaves which are not close to the hob, and it really looks more like a disease than mechanical damage. I'd google it, if I knew the name of the plant... hence the double question!  Thanks! "

4020,New grape vine health,"At the end of Spring I planted a grape vine along our trellis/fence. In the early summer, it grew about 6 inches and got a ton of leaves (and even some tiny little grapes). In the past month though, it has been getting more and more brown spots, as visible in the picture. It also hasn't grown noticeably in the past month.  There are a few environmental factors that may be at play here:   It has been very hot. We have had a few weeks in the 90s all week and I don't think the high has been below 85 all month. We've been light on rain. We have had a few storms, not not as frequent as usual. I have tried to compensate with more water though. Our soil is garbage (outside of Denver, CO). I did follow the instructions and dig a hole about twice as big around and about 6 inches deeper than the root bundle and filled it in with high-quality planting soil.   My questions are:   Does this plant look dangerously unhealthy? Is there anything else I can do to help it? Did I make a bad choice planting grapes in this environment?    "
4021,Lemons losing all leaves,"I've been trying to grow some lemon trees from seeds. Everything went mostly fine: out of a dozen germinated seeds I got 5 seemingly strong &amp; healthy saplings growing. These are the saplings after about half a year:   However, after a few more months they started to gradually lose all their leaves. This is how they look now:    Presumably, some of them are almost dead by now. I initially thought that temperature might be the problem, but I'm not so sure about it now: weeks of warm (+20°C - +25°C) weather didn't stop the leaves from falling off. So, my main ideas for what caused this are:   Hard water. I used water from a regular tap, which might have too much minerals in it. You may see some sediments on the soil. The most sediment appears to be on the soil with the most up-to-day healthy plant, - presumably it got less minerals dissolved inside the soil. Bad soil. I used some general soil from local gardening market, nothing special. Bad lighting conditions. I have one table lamp (something like the one on the picture below) lighting the lemons directly from above, roughly 16 hours a day.     So, my questions are:   What is the most probable cause of the saplings losing their leaves? How to prevent this in future? Is there any chance I could save the two saplings that still have some leaves on them and haven't dried out yet?  "
4022,Phalaenopsis Orchid identification - purple veins,"Like the title says - can you help me identify this orchid? It's a phalaenopsis, but what hybrid exactly? (I'm looking for a recognised hybrid name, not a flower shop generic one)    A ""little"" bit of research led me to several guesses, amongst which Brother Stripes or Chih Shang's stripes (is the only difference between the two the 'broadness' of Chich Shang?), New stripes, Taisuco stripe, and the Sogo Tyler. There are so many similar varieties, and I can't believe that they can be so similar yet considered different hybrids. But I'm new to orchids, so maybe this is normal? Or these are different names for the same thing (like 'Bee Sting' is florists' name for 'Chiada Francis Picotee'?) "
4023,Am I on the right path to growing these Oyster Mushrooms properly?,"I started collecting coffee grounds over a week, kept it moist. Before adding the starter, I microwaved the damp coffee grounds in the hope of killing off anything dormant.   After adding the starter and letting it sit in a basement it now looks like this.     I then took an egg carton and old newsprint, dampened them, and again microwaved in for a few minutes to sterilize. I then mixed a bit of the starter in (see smaller container). The smaller container has some cut outs on the side.     This is all a pilot run for me to see what happens. It's all happening in a darkened basement outside of my living space.   My question is am I doing anything obviously wrong or unsafe? Is microwaving wet material before use sufficient enough to preserve the purity of the feed (coffee grounds for the starter and paperboard for the mushroom development)?

4025,Big Max Shed Foundation,"I have a 7 x 7 big max resin shed, resin floor.  I'm putting in the corner of my yard for about year until we do some serious landscaping then it will be moved to a new location.  What should I use for foundation?  I was thinking 2-3 inches of gravel then 0.5 inch piece of treated ply wood.  Thoughts? "
4026,"Some of my bush beans are light green, is this a problem?","  In the picture you can see five Romano bush bean plants in my raised bed.  These are all exactly the same variety; in fact, they came out of the same six-pack of seedlings from the nursery.  Yet, four of them have bright green leaves, one has dark green leaves, and one has some of both.  What's going on here?  All of the plants appear healthy.  All of them are currently starting to fruit.  They get the same sun, give or take a little during the ""dappling"" part of the morning.  None of the leaves are turning yellow.  Possibilities I can think of:   Chlorosis, and I need to add iron to the soil Needs fertilizer, particularly nitrogen Overwatering (they're on the same soaker hose, but it could be delivering more/less water to specific spots) Underwatering (same) Pests attacking the roots something else It's not a problem, ignore it, bean plants are like that.   So, thoughts? "
4027,Leveling a yard and laying sod,"When I bought my house ~3 years ago, the backyard was being watered by hand even though it has a sprinkler system. The sprinklers had no supply line.  EDIT: What I mean is, the supply line delivers no water. The stop &amp; waste in the front turns on the water for the sprinklers in the front yard, but the back doesn't get water. It could be a missing shutoff (which I've tried like the dickens to find) or a broken line under the driveway so it was just disconnected. Either way, the supply line runs under lots of concrete, so my best option is just to run a new line.  Fast forward to now, my backyard is a layer of weeds, holes dug by my dog and piles of dirt. There is also a roughly 2x2 foot pad of concrete in the middle of the yard I want to remove. The sprinklers run throughout the yard are still usable.  I have sprayed the yard once with roundup killing all the weeds. That leaves me with a very uneven yard w/ sprinklers in it and a lot of dead weeds.  I'm not sure what my best options are from here. Should I pull/dig out the dead weeds, or would leaving them in place while leveling be an ok option. The soil where I live is very rocky so any type of digging is always a huge pain. What is the best type of tool I should rent to get this job done as easily as I can? I was thinking of using a bobcat. (Renting from Ace Rents or Timp Rental).  Caveats are:   I don't want to destroy the sprinkler system already in the ground. I would like to get rid of the 2x2' concrete pad.   I have called 811 a had the utilities marked. Nothing obstructing us there.  After I've leveled the ground, is there anything special I need to do to prepare for sod? Any special care after it's been laid?  I originally was thinking I would rototill the yard (as suggested reading Can my lawn be saved or is it time to dig it up and re-sod?) but I don't want to destroy my sprinklers.  I currently have a chain link fence between my yard and the neighbors yard on the side with the other 3 side surrounded by concrete. The neighbors yard is not well taken care of and I worry about weeds coming over from there. I would like to put in a concrete strip and a new fence then roughly 3 feet of veggie garden space along the length of that side plus another concrete strip to separate it from the grass.  I've resigned myself to the fact that I'm not going to get it done before winter, so at this point I need a plan of attack for ASAP after thaw in the spring. "
4028,Transplanting Jack in the Pulpit,I came across a jack in the pulpit in the woods of a local park. Sitting there all by itself. The park is heavily hunted for all sorts of stuff and I want to save this thing. When and how would be the best time and way to transplant this to our land about an hour and a half south of here? How fast do these spread? 
4029,"Why are my tomato leaves turning yellow, with brown spots?","This is my first season trying to grow tomatoes. I bought three different types (cherry, heirloom,  and super sweet),  and planted them in a large pot on my porch. They seem to be getting a lot of sunshine, and the soil is mildly moist. They're starting to develop yellow leaves with brown spots and some of the smaller branches are dying.   Do they need Epsom salt or are they getting too much water? Do I need to move them to their own pots? "
4030,"How long does Copper sulfate pentahydrate persist in the soil, after application?","In particular, I am interested in it's effects after it has been applied and the roots affected have been largely removed.  Does it break down over time, and if so what is the time frame?  What will happen if something else is planted where roots treated with this root killer where at previously?   If there are ill effects, is there anything that can be done such as the application of water to dilute the remaining chemical?  Everything I have read says very little about this, and is even somewhat contradictory, e.g. ""copper sulfate can be used as an algae and fungus killer and kills some plants but also can be used as fertilizer.""

4031,Why are my Ginkgo Tree leaves yellowing after transplant?,"I transplanted a 7 ft Ginkgo Tree within the same zone 1 month ago.  We dug a 5' diameter hole, approximately 3' deep to make sure it had ample space to grow.  We did not bury any more of the tree than it had prior.  We have been watering well.  Some of the leaves are starting to yellow.    Is it possible that we did damage in digging it up?  It was difficult to get out of the ground.  Is there a solution? "

4034,How to cure burns in perennial flowering plant's due to dose of excess urea?,"I had planted few stone apple plants(perrineal, flowering and mid summer fruiting trees) in plants. Due to insect larvae most of leaves were eaten. So I put in handsome amounts of Urea, Diammonium phosphate, and Potassium Chloride in the pots in the topmost layer in dry form in order to save the remaining plants( I didn't use insecticides as I didn't want to contaminate the plant). To my amazement the plants which had few leaves remaining started to show leaf burns and plants dried up. Question is what causes burns due to access urea, though urea is required by 'all' plants, and is there a way to cure such burns if detected early? I had earlier put good amounts of urea in seasonal crop/grain plants, but most of them flourished. What could be the reason? "
4035,Can salt be used to control weeds permanently?,I was reading over here that salt can be used to control weeds in paved areas?   Is salt an effective way to kill all (or most) plant types? Is it a permanent solution? Will using salt affect ground water (I have a bore) and nearby gardens?  
4036,Are any plants tough enough to live on the surface of a driveway?,"A lot of driveways around here are two-thirds planted with two hard wheel tracks made of cement blocks or cobblestones. I like the permeability and decoration that goes into them. Our off-street parking space has access only from the side, therefore there is no direct path in and out, rather it's a parallel-parking situation.  Are there grasses that might put up with a car tire occasionally crossing over? I know plants don't generally like to be driven over, but there must be some that are more tolerant or resilient than the rest, probably flexible ones  that can lie flat and stand back up.  I'm interested in planting inside some kind of rows or matrix of hard material over which car tires would pass. Keeping the loose earth just below the driving surface might prevent a mud bath. Is this scheme viable?   My location is San Francisco, California. "
4037,What could be wrong with this leaf blower?,"A little over a year ago, after complaining about the amount of cord I had to use with our electric leaf blower I was gifted an inexpensive gas blower. A Ryobi 150 mph 400 CFM Gas Blower Vac from home depot to be precise. It probably wouldn't have been the one I would've chose, but hey. Complaining about gifts is never a good idea.  I mixed up some gas for the two stroke engine, but admittedly I did eyeball it. It started right up, and worked great. I used it for the next 30 minutes or so until it ran out of gas. At this point I needed to buy some new gas. I mixed up this next batch very carefully, and about two weeks later I went to use it again. It would not start, didn't start. Its a year later and If I was going to return it I should've done it months ago.   I'd like to get it started, but have little experience with trouble shooting small engines. I am a computer programmer, not a lawn care specialist. But, I'd love to learn. And I do have an internet connection. I am a bit stumped. Where should I begin. What could be wrong?  note: looking at the reviews online this 'not starting' or tough to start seems to be a common problem.  "
4038,Can my tomato plant move indoors?,"I have a potted tomato plant on my porch. The temperature is starting to drop as we move into fall; will it adapt well to being an indoor plant? My windows don't get a ton of sun I'm afraid. The plant is about four feet tall, of the variety ""Watermelon Beefsteak"".

4040,How effective is cow's blood as a deer deterent?,"In reading this thread I was curious about something I was told a while ago. A friend of mine said he was having issues with deer eating all of his plants. He said he was given advice to utilize dried cow's blood. To just sprinkle it onto the grass and it would deter the deer from coming onto his property. He said it worked well for him. He said a side benefit was that it fertilized his lawn, or at least made the grass very dark green in the process.  My question is, does this really work? If so, how long can you expect it to last? And lastly, is there any known reason for why this works? "
4041,How to keep a detached strawberry runner alive,"I acquired a strawberry runner seperated from the main plant.  By the time I got home it looked quite withered and dying. Since I couldn't plant it right away, I put it in a glass of water overnight. By morning it looked a lot better. Later that day I planted the runner in a pot of dirt and watered it every day.  But it seems to be getting worse everyday, it's a few days later now and it's looking withered and dying again.  What can I do to save it? Would it be better to put it back into a glass of water as that seemed to help?   The runner did have some very short roots, perhaps 1cm long, when I planted it. "
4042,What is wrong with my ponytail palm?,"I have a ponytail palm on my office desk, which I love.    I've noticed the leaves are brown at the tip and quite tightly bunched together. They don’t sit as beautifully as in the pictures of other ponytail palms I find on the internet.  I am careful not to water too much (about once every 2 weeks seems to be the general advice). My office, unfortunately, does not get a lot of natural light and I am worried that perhaps the plant is dying due to the low light conditions.  This post suggests that the problem could be due to low humidity.  In short, can anyone tell me definitively if my plant is healthy? Should I buy a grow lamp? What can I do about low humidity? "
4043,Testing for nitrogen after applying blood meal?,"In preparation for refreshing a garden box for a winter season, I tested for nutrients and found it was very low in nitrogen.  I added more soil and amendment (for other reasons -- neither has many nutrients) as well as blood meal (to add nitrogen).  If I were to test it again for nitrogen, should I expect it to be improved?  I did test again and it showed almost no nitrogen -- much less than before.  But is that just because the nitrogen in the blood meal takes time to become available?  Or could it be I've done something wrong? "
4044,How can I help my young mulberry tree grow a thicker stem?,"I have my young mulberry tree, which is a little more than a year old. I grew it from a seed, and have it indoors in a large pot at the moment.  It is growing tall and thin, it even needs a stick to support its weight, so my question is:   How do I make my tree develop a thick stem?  Is pruning the right way?  Also, as you can see at the photo, is has developed two long branches from the short stem. Should I remove the youngest of them? Or some of the shoots?  I have no experience in growing and pruning trees so all advice will be helpfull.  I live in Gothenburg, Sweden.   "

4047,Do soil nutrients travel to the surface?,"I've built four additional raised beds for my garden, and put a lot of tree branches and cow manure at the bottom.  The problem is, the beds are two feet deep (24"" sides, I mean), and I had intended on filling them to within 4 inches of the top with soil (with woodchips on top).  Basically, if I have eight inches of soil on top of the tree branches, and if whatever I plant in the beds don't have roots that reach that deep, do the shallow rooted plants still benefit from the nutrients?  Or should I churn up the beds in three years to bring the nutrients to the surface?  (A quick google shows that tomato plant roots go 12+ inches, so I probably don't have anything to worry about, but am still curious. Also, I'll be sure to put good material in the upper eight inches, not just soil.) "
4048,How do I change this to a butterfly garden?,"My front yard has 2 flower beds. One small one is a rain garden with Turk's cap connected to the down spout from a roof gutter. The larger one has two rose bushes, 2 salvias, 1 dying dwarf Mexican petunia and shrubs. I live in USDA zone 9 or 9b.   What do I need to plant to attract butterflies? Will it get too crowded? Are butterfly attracting plants drought resistant?  Found this online:     In Southeast Texas, butterflies (Scientific Order: Lepidoptera) can be   seen almost year round. From swallowtails to monarchs, these   butterflies dance about our gardens in a visual symphony that is   joyful to watch. The life cycle of a butterfly occurs in four stages:   egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis) and adult (butterfly).      What you may not know is that butterfly larvae (the caterpillars) are   tied to specific host plants and they have definite preferences. A   host plant is where adult butterflies lay their eggs. When the larvae   hatch, they begin eating the leaves of the host plant. This food   source enables them to grow, pupate and then become butterflies.   Without it, the cycle stops. Adult butterflies need nectar to survive   and they get it from a variety of flowers in bloom throughout the   year. So if you want to see more butterflies in your neighborhood and   garden, your habitat should support the needs of butterflies during   all four stages of their life cycle.     "

4052,"Can I allow a pine tree to share root space with a group of birch trees? If not, which should I cut down?","I have a group of birch trees, with a pine growing in the midst of them, in my front yard.  My friend is telling me the pine must be cut down to save the birches. I see her concern, however: I think the entire arrangement is pretty; the pine looks healthy; I don't like to kill anything; and tree removal in Massachusetts is very expensive. I'd prefer to leave it alone, or, if anything, take down the birch directly to the right of the pine (see the third picture below), as it's leaning over the driveway.  This view is from the road.    This is a side view from the driveway.    The roots of the pine, on the left, are virtually tucked under the birch on the right,     and are also encroaching on another birch to the left.     Is cutting one of the trees down strongly recommended? If so, which?  "
4053,Is it ok to leave landscape fabric exposed in an area without plants and foot traffic?,"We're thinking of paving the area under our second-story deck but aren't budgeting for it until next year at the earliest.  The area, which is roughly 30 feet by 10 feet, has black lava rock partially covering it right now - because of price and general lack of availability where I live, I've been slowly moving it to the front of the house where the lava rock there was thinning out.  I'm tempted to remove the rest of the rocks under the deck, smooth out the dirt, and cover it up with landscaping fabric to make it easier to deal with weeds in that space in this coming summer.  Because we may pave over this next year, I don't want to deal with the expense and hassle of putting a bunch of mulch down on top of this area.  Would it be a bad idea to leave the fabric exposed like that, knowing that it's out of the way of foot traffic and otherwise isn't being used for plants?  I've seen all sorts of mixed reviews on using landscape fabric, though.  Is there a cheaper way to temporarily deal with this, perhaps leaving things as they are for now and occasionally using a weed control spray?  Here's a photo of the area I'm dealing with:   "
4054,Rat proofing compost bin but allowing worms in,"I've found a rat this morning in my compost bin :-(. It burrowed into in.  It's a small compost bin with solid plastic sides, a lid with an open bottom. In retrospect it was a potential rat haven. It was next to a fence and I was storing paper behind it (a.k.a a lovely rat home). I've moved it about 2 feet away from the fence and got rid of the paper. Is there anything else I can do? I want to keep the bottom at least partially on the ground to let the worms in. I was thinking of digging a hole about 30 cm down and putting the bin into that. Will rats dig down that deep?  Anyway - all answers gratefully received "

4057,Newly Planted Autumn Blaze Appears to Be Dying,"Planted our Autumn Blaze about 10 days ago in central NC (clay soil).  Normally this time of the year we'd be seeing the start of fall, but we've had an abnormally hot and dry run of 90 degree days and no rain for 2+ weeks (and none in the forecast for another week or two).  While the Prairiefire Crabapple we planted nearby at the same time is thriving, our Autumn Blaze appears to be dying.  It's drooped considerably and the top has turned brown.  We're watering for a few minutes in the early morning.  Despite the heat and dryness and only watering for a bit, the soil around it appears to be wet at all times. We tried skipping a day or two of watering with no difference.  Any ideas?  Are we underwatering?  Overwatering?  Soil too compact?  Is this just transplant shock?       "

4060,Watering a new tree in the middle of new sod,"The landscapers planted a new tree (1 1/2 diameter) in the middle of the sod they also installed. They have the yard set to be watered 3x daily for half an hour at a time (the sprinkler heads are the low-flow Hunter rotator ones).  Is this too much water for the tree? If I tone back the water on the sod will that be too little water for the lawn? Do I need to give the tree a deep watering at some point?  One suggestion I have found is to remove the sod in a 6' ring around the tree -- but doesn't that ignore the fact that there is still water going to that area, and probably even more water to the tree since there's no sod to soak it up?  Edit: Some more information - Yard is in Colorado (very dry, has been in the 80s), with Colorado's typical clayey soil. The tree is a Box Elder. "

I was thinking of setting de long and narrow plastic sheet below the edge of the roof, curving the top of this sheet away from the roof, so as to entice the wisteria branches to reach in the air and away from the building.  What do you think ?  Could this do the trick to protect the roof from wisteria invasion ?  Any trick for stunting growth or pruning ? "
4062,Best wavelength mix for an indoor LED grow light,"I want to grow basil. A lot of it. Unfortunately the winter is coming, and my plants won't be able to survive outdoors. Beeing an electronics engineer, i decided to DIY an indoor growbox, so that in one device i can integrate timers, sensors, an efficient LED driver and so on.   I've started reading papers about mixes of wavelength for basil growth. While everyone seems to agree that adding some wavelenghts other than the blue and red (from the absorption peaks of Chlorophyll) can be beneficial for the plant, nobody seems able to agree on the extra wavelengths Somebody says green, other papers say yellow, or far red/near infrared, or UV, some others mention the white LEDs (even though the spectrum of white LEDs is not very white).   So i'm left with some questions:  Is the light mix dependent on the specific plant i'm trying to grow, or can i just look for generic information? Does anybody have more meaningful informations on the wavelength mix or some reputable sources where i can look?    My sources for now:    [website][website][website][website]"
4063,How to tame a Pyracantha,"I have an old house (built in the 50s) on a large lot (~ 1/2 acre) that was previously owned by some older folks that didn't keep up with the landscaping very well.  I've been slowly trying to get it in order, and while I have a ways to go, my current issue is with a monstrous pyracantha hedge. The back of the lot slopes down quite a ways to a street about 20 ft below.   The pyracantha covers most of that hillside. It's grown significantly in to the back yard area as well.  What are some effective ways of trimming this beast back? I've used loppers, sheers, and a hedge trimmer.   The loppers and sheers works alright, if a bit slow. The hedge trimmer wasn't that effective as many of the branches are a bit too thick. Any advice on understanding how far back I can go?     I'm OK with sacrificing the look of the hedge as I'm guessing this thing has encroached quite a bit in to the yard space (At least a few feet, probably 6+).   Also, any good advice on how to dispose of all this material? I have a chipper, which I have used in the past, but it's even slower than cutting because of how hard it is to handle the branches. For those unaware, pyracantha is also known as firethorn, and for good reason. It has huge needle like thorns that go through just about everything. I've found that using rose gauntlets and going slow I can mostly avoid getting stuck. Mostly.  "
4064,Light Green Grass patches?,I am trying to figure out what these light patches of grass in my lawn are? and how to get rid of them?

4065,Kale leaves turning yellow in hydroponic system,"I planted kale using hydroponic method. I planted them in September 7th, 2019 and now they're 41 days old. I put them in hydroponic system when they're 21 days old and have two leaves, with nutrition concentration at 0.5 mS/cm and pH 6.8. After three days, the leaves edge turned gray, it looked like burnt. I thought it was because the electrical conductivity quite high for the kale (around 2-3 mS/cm) and I didn't give any treatment, including trying to lower the nutrition concentration. But three days later the leaves turned green and looked normal.  When the kale turned 34 days old, I noticed some of the kale leaves turned light green. From the leaves turned green until that moment, the electrical conductivity was around 1.68 - 3 mS/cm and pH 6.0 - 6.5. I didn't give any treatment because I thought the nutrition concentration was quite high and there's no sign of pests. The pipes inside quite dirty with moss. By the way I alternate the hydroponic holes with romaine lettuce at that time. I thought they would grow fine and not lack of sun lights because the kale plants not tall enough.     Today (October 17th, 2019) I noticed some of the kale leaves have turned yellow.     The older leaves turned yellow. Then I found kale plant which leaves turn yellow, and have brown spots like this picture below.    My questions are:   What cause the kale leaves turn yellow like the last picture? I can't find the similar problems online and I'm still confused wether it's lack of nutrition in general or lack of specific nutrient constituent, or they compete with romaine lettuces in absorbing nutrition, or there are other aspects I miss. Do moss inside the pipes affect the kale's nutrient absorption? For those who have grown kale with hydroponic method, what's the optimum nutrition concentration (ppm) or electrical conductivity (mS/cm) and pH for kale growth and development?  "
4066,Why are the leaves of my Peace Lily wilted and black?,"I recently bought a flowering house plant. I may have watered it too much, me thinks. Since my apartment gets little natural light, I put it outside on the patio the other day in direct sunlight, only for a couple hours. When I returned, my plant which was once dark green, had black, wilted leaves. Did the sun kill it? Or did the water? Usually, I give it indirect sunlight, so that seems to be the culprit.       "
4067,Second opinion: Arborist says tree needs to go,"I just had an arborist look at a red maple with a long bark split in my yard. His diagnosis was that it was struck by lightning (there was a close lightning strike a few months ago) and the tree needs to come down.  The tree is approx 40-50 ft tall and roughly a 30"" diameter. Not a giant, but no sapling for sure! Exact measurements coming.  The bark is split but the wood underneath is solid.  The tree is roughly between my house and my neighbor. It can fall in the back yard and hit nothing, any other direction and there will be structural damage.  Wife got some pictures, there is clearly something wrong with the tree. Here is a far shot, closeups of the crack coming soon:   I was not overly impressed with the arborist. I have a second estimate scheduled. What questions do I need to be asking the expert?   I am considering keeping this tree for firewood. Seems daft to cut it down and haul it off only to turn around and buy a face cord later. Is this something that the pros will usually facilitate? I can handle stacking and splitting, but I need the tree sectioned.  Following up 8 months after the original post: The tree was stone dead this spring. One lonely branch had some green on it but it was clear it was done for. The bark had sloughed off the entire main trunk and was falling off in other places. I had it removed by a second local arborist. This is the place I called for a second opinion last fall. They were charging more than other places, but they gave good advice and were clearly more professional and capable than some dude with a saw and a chipper. "
4068,How to handle potted Japanese Maples for fall and winter,"I have several larger potted plants and trees i usually bury in my garden box for the winter.  I root a few clipping from a Japanese maple, got about 6 plants in 6 inch pots. The 2 biggest are near 8 inch tall. Smaller ones are still struggling to grow new stems, but made it thru the summer temps. So they are trying to take hold.  but now fall approaches, with the first freeze coming soon, mid-atlantic.  Should i bring them in for the winter, maybe place near the window with my house plants? Or bury them in the garden box for the winter? Or any other ideas?  Thanks "
4069,How can I find out what's eating my chilli plants?,"I'm in Sydney, Australia. I live in an apartment 3 stories off the ground floor.   My chilli plants are in pots on my balcony.  Recently (last 2 weeks) I have noticed that something is eating the leaves of one of the chilli plants. I have not done any sleuthing at night yet. Today is a Saturday and I have not seen any further damage during the day.  The pot with the most damage looks to be surrounded by droppings of the culprit. What could it be?  Update: I went out in the evening with a torch and yep, it was 2 fat caterpillars. I thought I had checked the plant during the day, but I guess I wasn't thorough enough. I checked a few more times during the night and no more turned up. A lot of damage for just 2 caterpillars!     "
4070,Should I start seeds early indoors in my zone?,"I am a pretty new gardener, this would be my second year. This year I tried starting a lot of hot peppers and eggplants, a lot of the peppers died before showing the first true leaves, lot of eggplants survived, but they are growing really slow, only the tomatoes seem like they are growing well.  I was wondering if it's because I started too early. But I did some googling and saw that for peppers and eggplants they should be started 8 weeks before the last front and I started them probably 2-3 weeks before last frost.  My main concern is that while some days it's nice and warm above 70f/20c, there are still days that it's below 50f/10c during the day and can reach 40f/5c at night, and this is after the last frost (spring is starting tomorrow).  The seedlings go outside under direct sunlight during the day (unless its a very hot day and I move them under the partial shade of a tree after a few hours, or if it's cold outside or too windy I keep them close to a window indoors).  During the night I keep them inside. The temp in the house rarely goes below 60f/15c, unless it was a really cold day and I wasn't home with the fireplace burning, then it could reach 50f/10c. I give them all the same amount of water and light at the same time and protect them from the wind.  I tried two starting methods, paper towel and then moving them to litte 330c pots, and soil cubes. Didn't seem to make any difference.  This is the climate where I live.    This is the soil temperature for the last few days, I am monitoring them to see when it would be good to sow some zucchinis directly outside. The temperature probe is buried about 2-2.5cms, received direct sunlight until probably 1PM then partial shade.  I feel like since I don't have a place with constant optimal temperature for seedlings (I only have an incubator for germinating seeds) and considering the growing season here is pretty long, I would do better starting the seeds later than I am doing it. Like when temps are more stable above 50f/10c.  Should I ignore the suggested starting dates I find online and wait for good stable weather or is it something else I am doing wrong that's killed my seedlings? "
4071,Succulent leaves dying,"I've had a succulent that I've propagated from a single cutting into several pots. Initially they were taking quite well but have recently had leaves roll-up and shrivel/die. Leaves are generally from lower down in the plant.     I initially thought that this might've been due to overwatering, but I've let the soil dry out for two different two-week periods and this hasn't seemed to have any effect.  Other things to note, soil might be a bit compact? I don't think that's the case but find that photo below. The soil is of the prepackaged succulent/cactus type.    As well, I'm in Canada and we're entering winter so perhaps this is dormancy related? I don't think this happened last winter though...  Thanks for taking the time to look at this! "
4072,Identify this succulent/echevaria?,"Can anyone precisely identify this plant?    The pot just says ""Echeveria."" As you can see there are cat-tooth marks on the plant, but I had left it out because I thought echeveria to be non-toxic to pets. However, my cat is now sick and I am working with the vet to identify possible causes. Does anyone know the precise identity of this plant? Is it a danger to cats? (I have moved the plant out of the way for the time being.) "
4073,Why do turf winterguard (applied late fall) fertilizers have no “P” (phosphorous)?,A leading brand's fall food is 32-0-10.   As I understand it “P” helps roots grow. The fertilizers say they help grow deep roots.   So at first glance seems odd to exclude this macro.   My hypothesis is that phosphorus is mainly helpful at germination and early stages? So if your just feeding your mature lawn no need for this. Plus it's applied generally when temperatures are too low for germination. And we don't want phosphorus to not get absorbed and run into waterways?  Am I correct? 
4074,Burnt oak leaves as a fertilizer?,"I smelled burning the other day and asked my neighbor what they were burning. (We had just had a skirmish with a hurricane and most of the debris was gone) Anyway,  her response was she was burning up the leaves and going to use on her flower beds. I mulch my oak leaves and use them in my garden, flower, vegetable,  and on lawn patches that need help.  Are burnt Oak leaves a good fertilizer? I have never heard that use. Anyone ever heard of this?  We are in SC and have a combination of white oak and what we call scrub oaks in our neighborhood.  Thank you  "
4075,Curious to know why over-watering leads to root-rot yet the same plant can be grown in water?,"I bought a few pothos plants from home depot last summer, and from my investigation, it seemed they all died from root rot. I tried every thing I could to save them but they just would not stop. But at my work place, there is a pothos plant, set in a bottle of water, on the window pane in the kitchen that seems to be doing so well, even with no one really in charge of caring for it? There are a couple of those around the office and every now and then someone maybe changes the water and puts them back, and they don't die.How come? "
4076,Tomato plants longevity,"I started tomato plants outside but we had a scorching summer.  I have finally gotten them healthy but it is the end of the growing season.  The question is can I take my plants into my greenhouse and hope for a new crop in the spring? They are about 3 feet tall. I have black cherry tomato and purple prince. Also, will they produce fruit once they are in the greenhouse and I replicate more mild temperatures?  Thanks "
4077,Why is my basil plant oozing brown sap?,"My indoor basil plant has been forming these brown beads on the bottom of leaves and on stems. I think it might be sap that's been oozing out that's turned brown / hardens when exposed to air.   In the photo, you can see:   the brown bumps on the stem (center)  the brown bumps / sap on the underside of a leaf (right) sap (before it turns brown) on a leaf (bottom)   I also notced that a lot of the green leaves have tiny yellow/white specks (you can see it in the leaf at the top of the photo)  I've checked, and I can't see any visible insects / parasites.  Does anybody have any ideas what's going on? What should I do?   "
4078,Treat Grubs this late in fall? (Maryland),"I've read conflicting things about whether you should apply Grub control products in Fall. It's likely insecticide companies trying to sell more insecticide.  I'm sure the spring is a better time to prevent grubs. But, that's not my situation.    It's Mid-October you've invested a lot in a fall overseeding/watering... the cost of failure is high. You just found a Grub... Do you treat it or wait till spring?  Questions:   How long will grubs continue to eat my roots?    Are the chemicals in Grub Ex going to have a long term negative effect on my soil? Besides the wasted $15 to cover my lawn, any reason to not    do it.   ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:  I'm near Baltimore, MD.  Tall Fescue.  Did an overseeding... have spent a small fortune on water the past month (have had no rain)... was carefully hand raking an area of my lawn where no grass seed was growing to give it one last try for the year and found a Grub. Honestly, I feel like i've used a lot of water... and the idea of putting more seed down in the spring potentially and having to repeat daily waterings again makes me sad.  So, I'd rather burn $15 now then use a lot of water in the spring to fill these spots. "
4079,Dendrobium nobile: How and when to cut and pot new plant (keiki) from mother?,"I have a (slightly neglected) dendrobium nobile that has started to grow new plants at the top of two old stalks. One is staring to show roots (see picture below), the other is still a bit smaller.     While I have seen this phenomenon with phalenopsis orchids, it's new to me with a dendrobium nobile.  So what's next? Should I    cut off the baby plant (keiki?) and put it in its own pot? (now? once it has more roots?) bend the mother stalk down, let the new plant take root in a second container and cut then?  do something else?  "
4080,How to overwinter potted cuttings from an Abelia?,"In early June and in late August I took cuttings from an Abelia (not exactly sure which species it is, it flowers from Mai/June until November in white).  As the how-to I found described, I potted them (several of them in one pot, see image below) and waited... About 1/3 seem to have rooted and new shoots have appeared, 2 of them even start to flower.  I kept the pot outside all the time with no cover whatsoever, I watered regularly.  Now that there are cold nights and ultimately mister frost will turn up, what should I do to protect them? I assume that being in a pot will freeze and thus kill the roots much easier than when being in the ground.  Would it be a possibility to keep the cuttings inside thus disturbing the cycle of seasons?  I see 3 possibilities:   Repot them in a bigger pot, might reduce the impact of freezing: I don't want to touch the roots, I assume that they are very fragile. Plant them into the garden: same problem as in 1) plus I haven't got the spot yet. Keep the pot inside: I don't have an 'inside' which I judge adequate. It would be either to hot or too dark.     "
4081,Do ants eat scale on lime trees?,"Location: Pietermaritzburg, South Africa When: Feb 2015 (summer in Southern Hemisphere)  A couple of questions.  First: Is this Scale in the first photo? If so, what type? If not what is it?  Second: It appears that on some leaves (second photo) ants are turning the scale to mash potatoes. If this is the case then is this sufficient control for the scale or does it need more attention to keep the tree healthy?     "
4082,Growing Mint. Do I need to keep the sol moist all the time?,"I got a mint herb in a pretty dried state so very few of the leaves are left. I planted it in a pot, and I think the plant has rooted.    I searched few stuff online about mint and found that it is a runner plant, something I like; But I couldn't figure few thigns:   Is it a good idea to plant it in a pot? If yes, should it be bigger than this or this is fine? Do I need to keep the soil soggy/wet or just damp? And should I let the soil dry out in-between watering? Full sun or shade?  "
4083,Should I cover my germinated lettuce seeds?,"I tried germinating lettuce outdoors and had a poor germination rate. Then I read somewhere that they may need light to germinate (I had buried them).  I grabbed a container with sifted compost I had lying around, watered it and threw some seed without covering them. I left it under the shade of a tree, with some sunlight but not direct.  Now, 3 or 4 days later, a few already have cotyledons so I need to expose them to more light so they wont get leggy. But the rest all have a radicle showing, and I am worried that more light may damage them.  Since most already germinated and have a radicle out, can I cover them with more soil? or more light wont damage them? "
4084,Soil chemistry problem -- too high conductivity,"I'm a tree farmer near Edmonton, Alberta.  My entire operation is in pots ranging from 100 ml to 40 liters  I just got a new load of compost from City of Edmonton.  I performed the following test:  Packed a pot solidly with compost to a level similar to what I use transplanting.  Applied 1 inch of water, waited for it to drain, and added about another inch. (1 liter of water total for a 3 liter pot.)  Let it sit over night.  Applied half a liter of water.    Collected the first leachate out of the bottom of the pot.  This according to one paper published out of U. Florida gives a consistent approximation of the saturated paste method, with a lot less work.  Measured the electrical conductivity.  10.8 mS/cm .  My water is moderately high, at about .7 mS/cm  Made up a batch of my standard soil mix which is compost, field soil, peat moss  in roughly even proportions.  5.8 mS/cm  Tested the soil in an old potted plant.  1.2 mS/cm  I'm using an Oakton PCS tester.  New batteries.  Temperatures have been about 7 C, but I'm assuming that the meter corrects for this.  (If it doesn't then the readings are going to be even higher.)  My understanding is that 1.5 mS/cm will start showing problems with a lot of plants, and anything over 4 is a death sentence for anything but a halophyte.  Can I wash this compost?  Spread it out in a 2 foot thick pile, and set a sprinkler to put several feet of water through it?  I am asking this question also on National Gardening Assoc. forum and on UBC botany forum. "
4085,Rubber plant dying need help,!  Need advice. It started with leaves drooping. As you can see there are 3 stems. Only one seems to be drooping.

4087,What is the proper way to prune a pear tree?,"I have a pear tree which I planted about ten years ago. It has done relatively well. It produces fruit on a yearly basis (I don't know if I'd call them exactly edible, but it does produce). The tree at this time has started to reach skyward, which I understand is bad for producing fruit. My questions are:   How should you go about pruning the pear tree so as not to cause permanent damage? What time of year should I prune it? Are there any drawbacks from pruning?  "

4089,"Need short details about perlite, Vermicompost, bone meal and such","I am not looking for definitions or such, but a quick rundown of what is better for soil aeration and drainage? I will need to purchase a few stuff depending on what they do. I already got vermiculite and it's not good for water drainage and succulents.  Coco peat: retains water but improves drainage, right?   Vermiculite: retains water and improves drainage?  Organic matter: Improves aeration and drainage?  Perlite: Aeration and drainage? Perfect for Succulents?   Bone meal?  Vermicompost?  What combination should I use for succulents? I am thinking of organic matter with soil and perlite. What about bone meal and vermicompost? Should I also add them?  I have few succulents and more ""normal"" plants. So I am confused what I should get, cause I have limitations on what I can buy.   I won't mind if this question gets closed being too broad. Thanks, anyway. "
4090,How to safely keep plants in greenhouse at low temperatures,"I'm a 2nd year gardener and am just now building a small 6x9' greenhouse onto the side of a shed.  I've got some indoor starts that are beginning to take up a lot of space (my okra is ~9"" tall!), and I'm anxious to start using the greenhouse.  But I really don't know anything about a greenhouse environment and I'm concerned about killing all my starts - up til now they've been spoiled in my diy indoor greenhouse.  My question is how to avoid killing plants when I move them out of the house?  I'm particularly curious about:   What are the lowest temperatures that I can safely keep plants at? How much wiggle room do things like draped row-cover give me? Do the plants need to be hardened off as part of the transition? How can I learn which plants are more/less vulnerable to lower temperatures? Is there any good reading on this topic, online or otherwise?   I live in northern Vermont and our last frost days is around mid-May.  I don't have any heat source or electricity in the greenhouse - though I could run an extension cord out there if it's really necessary.  This isn't a particularly insulated greenhouse; it's airtight, but there's a lot of single-pane glass. "

4092,How can I mitigate azalea lacebug infestation without harming bees?,I have several azaleas and some rhododendron that have become infested with lacebug. Some sites say to remove the plant and start over though this seems a bit draconian to me.   One suggestion was to use a soil drench with imidacloprid. Many commercial products use this but I'm rather worried about creating a toxic environment for bees. There is some debate over whether systemic use puts enough toxin in pollen to affect bees but I don't really want to risk this.  My questions:   Has anyone successfully rid themselves (or their plants) of lacebug? How? Any data on systemics and their role in CCD?  
4093,Indoor houseplant - stand up or flop over?,"I have what I think is a peperomia plant based on other searches here but my question is about if it's meant to be upright or grow more like a vine. Is the plant, as it grows, meant to ""flop over"" like in the photo here (House Plant With Round Waxy Leaves Identification) or stand up tall? Mine was very short until recently and has grown quite tall but I've also been propping up the stem as it seems too heavy and wants to topple over. I'm afraid of the stems breaking but the picture in the other post makes me think it will adjust to not being upright? Thoughts? "
4094,Goji Berry plants have not grown much over 2 years!,"My Goji Berry plants have only grown in the spring, when they have grown at all. I had some berries the first year, but not since. (Of course, they only fruit on new wood, but the plants are growing a few inches per year). The plants should be 6 foot tall and cascading over towards the ground, filling in that area.  I have done every possible thing I can think of, or that the nursery can think of. The selling nursery said any PH would be fine... However, the internet says slightly alkaline soil is needed. This is my ONLY IDEA re the problem... I do NOT know if this is accurate for my variety re PH needed. Note - the nursery says these plants don't like much water or fertilizer.  If it is that I need to raise the PH from approximately 5.75 to 7.0+, how do i do this?? Can I spread like over the surface where they are planted? How can I get results this year? Thanks! "
4095,Prepration when replacing lawn with new variety of grass,"I'm in Southern California. I'll be re-sodding a lawn that was/is primarily crab grass with either a fescue or Bermuda grass.   The current lawn has been dying due to lack of water. After I have this grass removed, is there any soil preparation I should do before putting the replacement sod down? I'm specifically concerned about mitigating future growth of the crab grass. If preparation requires time (like waiting for a herbicide to do its job), how long should this take before I can put the new sod in? Or can this just be managed through regular lawn care treatments after the re-sodding?  Correction: I was just informed that the existing grass is kikuyu (pennisetum clandestinum). It is not crab grass.  "

It occurred to me that perhaps i should have capped or disinfected root ends?  Soil is sandy, well drained, temperature is around 15c day, 0-2c night time (quebec). Bush seems to be ok after move but i am worried about infection.  Should i do something about root ends? "
4098,How are onions planted?,"From what I've read there seem to be two ways to plant onions - either put part of an onion in the ground, or leave one in the ground for two years and then plant the seed from the resulting flower. But I've also read that there is some system where something is planted once, harvested, and then replanted. What would be the point of that?  Since all of this looks counter intuitive to me, I was wondering if I understood correctly, and if so, what is the point of harvesting and then replanting?  (I was also wondering what would be the benefit (for the vegetable) of a vegetable growing a flower only in its second year. But that might warrant a separate question.) "
4099,What to use - seed grown citrus as rootstock?,"I have been growing a ""clementine tree"" from seed for about three years now and decided that I might want to experiment with some grafting onto it.  So, I went away to try and went way overboard (as is usual). I planted store bought citrus seeds from all of the following in addition to the single clementine plant.  I now have at least five seedlings of each below to experiment with:  1 Key lime seedlings  2 Kumquat seedlings (Nagami)  3 Blood orange seedlings  4 Lemon seedlings   I did not want to use grapefruit because of the much larger fruit and long maturation time.  My questions now mostly involve ""what kind"" to graft onto ""what kind"" for a reasonably good result. What kind might be best for the root stock? Can I graft three or four of these together successfully?  I was thinking Lemon/Key lime/Kumquat/clementine together etc. but, I then noticed how many differences there were between the seedlings (vigor, size, and speed of growth). I think I also read that Key limes and Kumquats grow true from seed and bear fruit sooner. Can anyone advise about potential best grafting combination(s)?  I live in the Northeast and will be growing potted plants indoors/outdoors as the seasons permit. "
4100,Brown needles on top layer of Picea glauca var. albertiana 'Conica' - sign of overwatering?,"I'm concerned about our Picea glauca var. albertiana 'Conica' that we keep on the balcony in a pot. We bought it sometime in spring this year and had it in the pot shown below for some time now. Throughout summer it looked good and grew several layers of new needles, however since the end of summer we've noticed that more and more brown needles occur at the outer layer rather than on the inside.   I found an answer that describes a similar sympton in which the user states     Overwatering results in root death. Then, with roots unable to move   water, the top shows the same symptoms as drought.   While from probing the soil with my finger I didn't get the impression that there is excessive moisture on the bottom, it might just be that it's already too much for this tree. As we've kept it near the edge of our balcony, I have the suspicion that it got too much rain water that wasn't able to drain quick enough in this arrangement.  Is root death the correct diagnosis here or are there other causes I should look into?    Can this spruce be saved? If so, how should we intervene?   "
4101,Potential drainage issue?,"I excavated the yard to build a stepping stone walkway. There's water collecting at the intersection of the walkway and the city's sidewalk.

(most of the exposed dirt is clay) If so, is there a way to remedy this?  Pics of the problem :     "
4102,How do you properly winterize a potted climbing rose?,"Earlier this year I planted two Tess of the D’urbervilles climbing roses in 20"" pots in my garden.  These roses grew to about 3' high this year and began wrapping around the trellis that I had setup for them.  Winter is now fast approaching, and although they are rated for zone 5, and I live at the border of 6a/6b (zip 15317), being in pots I worry for their safety.  Especially since the last 2 years we had extended periods of subzero temperatures.  Most articles I find online recommend various methods of winterizing that seem impractical.  As they are potted I can't realistically pile mulch around them.  As they are climbers and attached to the trellis I cannot move them inside (nor would I have room anyway).  I had considered using some of the same methods I use on my Windmill Palms (enclose them in plastic sheeting, wrap Christmas lights around them or lay a warming pad on them to run during the night), but I thought it made sense to see what the 'standard of care' was before committing to any of that.  How do others winterize potted roses that cannot be moved?  Also, is it even necessary with this variety in my area? "
4103,Polycarbonate multi-wall sheeting for a greenhouse,I am making a greenhouse from old aluminium beams designed to take 25mm multi-wall polycarbonate sheeting. Will a sheet thickness of 25mm leave in sufficient light? Or would I have to buy thinner sheets? I live on the South coast of Ireland. 
4104,Pine sawfly eradication once and for all,"I have a mature Mugo Pine that is looking rather haggard these days due to pine sawfly larvae chowing on it year after year. I first noticed them two summers ago. There were so many of them that I could hear them chewing whenever I was weeding around it (I didn't even know what the sound was the first few times I heard it-I thought I was going crazy!) I was able to identify them quickly enough and I had some Sevin in the garage so I used it. I normally try to avoid pesticides but the bush was seriously infested (75% covered, the other 25% eaten).  Because I know Sevin kills pretty much all bugs, I put a tarp down around the bush to direct the water/pesticide runoff down the driveway into the crushed stone and not into the garden soil. I had to repeat this 4 or 5 times that first summer to get rid of them all.   Last year, I tried to catch it early, and noticed what I discovered to be the eggs on many of the lower branches. I pruned as many as I could without disfiguring the bush. Then I repeated the Sevin applications each time I found some of the disgusting little buggers munching away. It was better last year, I only had to spot treat the bush instead of hosing the whole thing down. I did the same thing as last year with the tarp too, trying to be mindful of all the beneficial bugs that may be lurking under the bush.   This year, I again found the eggs all over the bottom branches of the bush. I cut a few more off but I really can't remove any more branches at this point. Between the sawflies, the heavy snow load these that two winters, and the pruning the poor thing is suffering. I am prepared to treat w/Sevin again but am thinking there must be something else I can do.    can I do something to prevent the eggs from hatching besides cutting the branch off and discarding it in the trash? Can I treat the soil somehow to kill the sawflies pupating there at the end of their feast?   I'd appreciate any suggestions because at this point (between this, my dead lawn, disappearing pachysandra and other problems I haven't posted yet) I'm ready to sell my house w/a fully landscaped 3/4 acre lot and get a condo. I can't keep up! "

4107,How do you clear an old neglected garden full of weeds and creepers for new landscaping/hardscaping,"We have bought a property in Melbourne requiring a complete overhaul of the front and rear garden. Every plant/tree/bulb is unwanted and hazardous to the future garden planned. Ivy Agapanthus Privet Bamboo (the spreading kind) Pepper trees Tabacco trees Jasmine A couple of other spindley creeping plants spotted all over the front lawn. One with a hint of red in the leaves A large leafed tropical looking plant with very long thick roots General weeds  We have about 12 months before the building reno is complete and the new garden could be planted. This gives us time to hopfully get the soil ready and cleared. With little knowledge of how to complete this task, l'm putting it out there to anyone with advice or know-how as to how we should approach it.  Is chemicals/herbicide the right choice? Is an excavator needed? Do you manually sift the soil? Do you need to remove/replace the topsoil? Is there a better time of year to start this? Do you need to turn the soil more than once to make sure it has all be removed?  I'm sure there is more to do than this, but these are the questions which spring to mind   (Pics to follow)  "
4108,What is this epiphytic cactus with small orange flowers along the stems?,Does anyone know the species of this epiphytic cactus? Even the genus would be a step forward. Could it be a Disocactus sp.?  The open flower is less than 2 cm (just under an inch) in diameter. The colours on the photo look pretty realistic.   
4109,What could be causing my top kakis' leaves to turn yellow and sick?,"These two kaki were planted last year, and I was thinking there were doing pretty good.   But as you'll see on the pictures, leaves are really light green, and the topmost ones show brown and black spots or cracks... What could be doing this? What should I do?   From what I understood, the pH of the soil is not very important for this plant ( mine is calcareous). And I see no issue at the ground level on the little trunk...  My guess is some mineral deficiency. Any clue welcome.  Kali leaves yellowing    Kali leaves yellowing "
4110,Should I prune this 3 year-old Tamarind tree fork?,"I have a 2.5 year old Tamarind in a container. It has what looks like a tree fork. I'm considering cutting the least straight one (it's the outer/right-leaning one on the picture). Even though the straighter trunk is not growing as well and is not as thick, at the moment. Is that the right course of action? What would happen if I left it as is?     "
4111,How to divide Plumeria?,"I have a Plumeria that went gangbusters this summer.  I want to divide the plant and do it all over again for next year.  I am seeking advice on where to take the cuttings.    For reference here is the plant....    In the next image, I am showing areas that I am considering for cuttings.  The red outlines show where I am certain I can take a cutting.  There are many more, but I am only showing a few in red.  How about the yellow areas?  Can you divide a Plumeria stem into several cuttings and propagate that way?   "
4112,Is it possible to irrigate a bonsai with a drip system?,I recently acquired a bonsai and am nervous about the danger of over- or under-watering. Is it possible/feasible/worthwhile to build some sort of drip system to keep the soil at a constant humidity? Or is the moistening/drying process necessary for the health of the tree? 
4113,Calculate maximal slope angle of tarrain above a retaining wall,"I want to build a retaining wall in my garden with stones like that   (I don't know the english word for it, in German it is called ""Pflanzsstein"").  I.e. something like this:    My problem is that all manufacturers I found so far, assume in their standard cases that the terrain above the wall is flat without slope, for example like this:    Taking this image as example (70 degree angle of the wall), the maximal height with flat terrain above the wall would be 2 meters.   Suppose my wall has only 1,5 meters and the terrain above it has a slope angle beta. How can I determine the maximal slope angle beta that works for this example?  Is there any free software which does the calculations for me in this and similar cases? "
4114,Which plants to grow in a closed terrarium?,"I have lots of long glass bottles(think Cappuccino bottles, but a little bigger). I would like to grow closed terrariums. Types of plants I want to avoid:   Plants that are easy to prune. I would love to grow succulents, but it might get hard to prune? I am not sure how important pruning is for closed terrariums, but I assume after a while, when the plant grows, it'll require pruning to prevent it from scrunching up in the bottle. Please advice me if I'm totally wrong. I live in a relatively dry/hot place. Hence, a plant that can live under those conditions would be nice.  I would like to avoid plants that shed leaves often. In the tutorials I read, dead lives can quickly dirty the pot. Hence, relatively sturdy plants would be nice.    Lastly, a nice bonus would be for plants to have nice foliage. In other words, something that looks a little more interesting than spinach leaves.   What are plants that at least come close to this type of criteria? "
4115,Is there a name for the tall reproductive grass stems?,"I noticed that not all grass stems seems to be used for reproduction.  When growing freely, it seems there are two heights of grass: there's the main ground-cover (stolon or tillers, maybe?), and there's the tall stems that distribute pollen and seed (looks kind of like wheat/grain/cereal, I guess). I don't know if it's a polymorphism or if perhaps the two are simply a generation apart. My question is, what are the taller, stronger, reproductive stems called?  Like the tall grass on the right, here. It's all tall compared to the mown lawn on the left, but you can see some is taller, and in this case kind of brown/yellow.    Here's a diagram. I thought maybe culm or meristem, but they appear refer to to be fairly localized segments.   "
4116,"Couple questions, feedback before a patio install project","I'm going to be installing a patio behind my house soon and have a couple questions.   Here are sketches of the area, plans, and photos of the area. I'm just outside Boston, so obviously the base is important, given water. [website]My open questions that I haven't resolved (there are a couple additional ones on the plan that I have my own answers to):  1) Do I need subterranean drainage like a french drain along  the south edge of the patio?   2) What about behind the small retaining wall (less than a foot above grade at its highest)?   3) From a aesthetic perspective, should the stone at the landing below the step to the southeast of the photo match the driveway (some kind of concrete paver or cobblestone) or the patio (some kind of bluestone).   4) Finally, am I missing or overlooking anything? There will be a whole other project for the front yard....   Thanks for any help, suggestions, or feedback! "
4117,How to look after a bougainvillea,I just bought this bougainvillea but I need help on how to take care of it.  Where should I plant it? How much sun and water does it need? And I dont know if it can survive the winter here because it goes down to -20°C. A friend told me that if I leave it in the container for 2-3 years I can plant it in the ground and it would survive the winter. Does that work?   
4118,My spider plant is dying,"A blade of  has turned yellow, and it looks as though another one has begun to transition. I'd like to stop this before the entire plant dies, but I don't understand what's happening.   Is my plant sick? Or is there some sort of mineral imbalance? Maybe I'm over-watering it?  "
4119,What is this powder-like substance on the leaves of my kiwi tree?,"I have a white powder-like substance on my kiwi tree. It always appears overnight and some leaves look like they were burned. I have washed the leaves several times, but it always comes back. What would be causing it? How can I help my tree?   I live in UK. The day temperatures are on average 12 °C, and the nights are 6 °C. I don't think this is caused by cold weather though.  Update 15/04/2017: The plant was put in standard soil mixed with standard compost, and a few drops of Baby Bio Citrus Food fertilizer, and wintered over in the garden. Four to five weeks ago I added two handfuls of GRO_SURE Farmyard Manure, and two weeks ago I added roughly one tablespoon of Vitax Q4 Fertilizer. Otherwise I haven't done anything else to the soil.   The bark chips were put on the top two weeks ago, they are J.Arthur Bower's Chips. I removed them yesterday (14/04/2017) and I have seen a little bit less of the white substance on the leaves, but the base of the plant has more.   Update 16/04/2017: Added some macro images.  I put the same bark chips on my apple tree, plum tree and gooseberry at the same time, but I haven't seen the same issue on those yet.  Click on all pictures for closer views.           Update 20/04/2017:  Two days ago I soaked the plant in a mixture of neem, water and washing up liquid, but it looks like there has been no effect on the plant. It looks worse.      "
4120,"Why are my houseplants dying off one by one? (Peace Lilly, Dracaena, English Ivy)","What is going on with the plants below? I can't post pictures of them all as I don't have enough rep on this particular site.  I use a hygrometer -which I thought was working fine- to time watering, and I've purposefully left them dry for days between watering. They are in a sunroom (bright, indirect light). It is still a forced air condition (heat, for the winter), but I've put them outside for the day after this started to see what would happen.   How can I diagnose? What other variables are needed? Will do anything!  Possibles, according to my thought process:   Pots are too small (time to repot) Noticed some tiny blue-ish bigs on the Dracaena.. hanging around the base of the stem.. Over watered Forced air somehow interferes with the balance of water between plant and soil.    Thanks for your help.     "
4121,Why do wettable sulphur manufacturers say never to use it within 30 days of an oil-based spray?,"And further:  1) what qualifies as an ""oil-based spray"" and at what amount?   2) does this warning still apply during the rainy season-- when the need for quick cycles of medicines is necessary?  (and yes, I've tried to ask manufacturers but to no avail). "
4122,Are Oak leaves good for making mulch?,"I live in southern Arizona and we have four varieties of Oaks here that lose their leaves in the springtime as opposed to the fall. I know one species is called Emory and another the Arizona White. What the other two are I am not sure.   Are these leaves good for mulch?   My neighbor says they have too much acid. He has a huge pile of them and nothing grows on top of them. The pile is about 20 x 20 feet and 6"" deep. It has been there for about 3 years undisturbed and there is very little mulch underneath.   Why? "
4123,Is this mycelium or does this shefflera has some kind disease on the roots?,"I have an indoor shefflera.    I noticed that it sometimes get sick so I checked the roots.  The roots were practically escaping the pot and I noticed a kind of white film everywhere.  What is growing on the roots?     Should I clean this up, maybe even cut the huge root that is outside of the soil?  Note, you see a lot of water because I just used a temporary plate to check the plant, the plant itself wasn't overwatered.  EDIT: Added picture of the real pots after comment.   "
4124,"Why are all my houseplants ""leggy""?","I have basically no experience of gardening.  I have a collection of plants on (what I think is) a relatively sunny northwest-facing window sill. I have basil, mint, geraniums and a chilli plant.  They all seem relatively healthy, but ALL of them are much 'leggier' than I would like/hope/expect.  The mint plant is a supermarket ""buy a living pot"" effort. The leaves that are left that are from the original plant are nice and big, but all the new growth (which has come off perpendicular to the original stems) is growing as very long, very thin stems with very small leaves. More akin to runners, than stems.  The basil is similar.  I would expect the geraniums, to look like this:    image source  That is to say, a dense bushy sort of effort, leaves growing fairly directly off the existing woody stems, staying quite contained. Long stalks growing for flower heads.  Instead, I'm getting a gangly sort of thing, with all the leaves on long (10-15cm) individual stalks, and the core stem growing fairly rapidly outwards.  When I was given the chilli plant (over Christmas) it was a single thick woody trunk (5-7mm diam) that went up and then split into a crown. It was basically bare leaves, but is now growing well. But it's mostly growing long new stems from the base - it's now looks like a set of ~4 plants grown in the same pot?  Normally, I'd look up ""how to care for &lt; plant >"", but given that I'm seeing the same sort of growth from all the plants, I'm wondering whether I'm doing something systematically wrong?  More info on the windowsill:  Facing almost dead northwest, in North London. It receives direct sun from about lunchtime through to sunset. I think my description of ""sunny"" is probably misleading: the window is large and not occluded at all, whereas the other windows in the flat open onto ""inset balconies"" and thus are fairly dark even when the sun is on that side of the flat. So I guess I think of that sill as being sunny by comparison?  (Click to enlarge)                                    Happy to provide further pictures if you can tell me what you need to see! "
4125,Can I kick rats out of the garden with a Euphorbia?,Today I heard that there is a Euphorbia which removes rats from vegetable gardens. Unfortunately I didn't get the specific name of the Euphorbia.  Do you know what kind of Euphorbia it could be (I would say something similar to E. lathyris)?  Do you have good experiences? 
4126,Developing new soil for gardening,"We recently purchased some land that is on the bench of the mountains covered in juniper trees and has a PH of between 7 and 8. We have cleared a good size area and I would like to amend the soil for a vegetable garden. I have read some interesting facts on Aluminum additives, sulfur, sulfate, epsom salt, a whole lot of blueberry info, and some random ideas for amendments. I have read that pine needles will lower the PH, and then later read that they won't if they're dried out and dead....and that it will take a long time. I have also read that lowering the PH is a waste of time and can't be done. However, I'm a firm believer in 'where there's a will, there's a way', and I don't give up easily.  So...my question is, how can I immediately amend the soil for planting basic garden vegetables in the next few weeks? We just plant the basic tomatoes, potatoes, corn, beans, peas, beets, onions, and squash. I realize each of those has their own PH happiness level, but if I can learn how to adjust the PH, I believe I can make happy plants....hopefully.   Also, how can I test the soil for nutrients? Since this soil has been more or less untouched since the dawn of time, would my nutrient level be high. There is some native grasses that grow, sage brush, and, of course, juniper trees.....lots and lots of juniper trees.   Any suggestions would be great! "
4127,How/if to transplant a 15' Catalpa?,"About 25 years ago three catalpa (Indian bean tree) seeds were planted in the Northern Hemisphere in a temperate climate. They came from the Southern Hemisphere and seem may have been from a Catalpa speciosa (""northern"") rather than a Catalpa bignonioides (""southern"").  Not really expected to grow, the three seeds were planted in close proximity. All thrived, so naturally one fared a lot better than the others, which were held back to different extents. About a decade ago the middle-sized one was transplanted as a 'stake' - about five feet of trunk, of diameter about 3½"". About five years ago the smallest was transplanted as a whole tree about 7' tall. Both have thrived since.   Image courtesy Jean-Pol GRANDMONT  The middle-sized one is now about 15' tall and is no longer suited to its location. When I was contemplating cutting it down a neighbour happened to mention he was intending to buy an established tree. He is amenable to a catalpa but without a mechanical aid (out of the question) the 15' tree can't be moved intact. Investigating other possibilities I have seen mention of root pruning. However this has been described as passé in the context of catalpas and the data from a controlled experiment (by the RHS, on beech trees planted 2005-2008) is ""yet to be analysed"".  The trunk of the 15' tree is around 4-4½"" so a root ball extending out to five times the trunk diameter is not practical here, though something like three times might be (for a root ball around 2' across).  Given success with the ""stake"" I am also contemplating top pruning back to about 10' and anything spreading more than about 3' – which would mean cutting off almost all the branches.  Worse, a time constraint means I cannot wait until Autumn and may have to attempt any surgery and transplanting just at the start of the growing season. I think the chances of success as slim (perhaps so slight even the attempt is not worth the bother) but should I ""give it a go"" anyway—and what can I do to improve the odds of success, if only by a small measure?    There is a vaguely similar question here: How to transplant this oak tree? but the tree is a different genus and about twice the height.  Transplantation, if it happens, has been put on hold since the prospective new location was not suitable. "
4128,grow beans downward without support. Anyone tried that?,"Today I ate some delicious beans and I had a strange thought. We usually grow beans with sticks to support their upward growth. How about reverse?  Has anyone placed bean plants on a balcony or something (plant it normally just like any other plant), and tried to grow them downward, kinda floating in the air, without any support for the stems? Did the plant grow and had fruit?  Google didn't find a single image of beans growing downward. Could be that my search term was bad. "
4129,Can air plants grow in closed terrariums?,"I have lots of air plants (Tillandsia) and I would like to place them in a closed terrarium. Will this type of plant survive the type of humidity and moisture that comes with a closed terrarium environment?  And can I just place this plant in some sand or can I place it in soil as well?  The reason I ask is because I'd like to place the air plant alongside some ferns inside the terrarium. Hence, if I could just place both plants on the same soil bed, it will be very convenient.  "
4130,My over 23 year old Mango tree wilted and cracks on barks. Verticillium wilt or Dieback?,"I have a quite old mango tree in my garden. It is been there before my birth and I'm 23 now.   We cut and prune the tree (not all of it) whenever it gets too big never had issue but only this time after pruning and cutting and a few weeks of successful twigs and green leaves growth, suddenly a couple of things started to happen that never happened before.   Red gum started coming out from bark Leaves completely wilted in weeks but not falling even now. I manually removed as much of the wilted leaves and twigs to remove burden from tree but a few are still up there as seen in images. Bark started cracking and there were some insects inside it. I put some pesticide and now I don't see them in the cracks but the tree is still ill.   I researched and figured it may be verticillium wilt or dieback disease or a mixture of both. What do you think it is after observing the images ? In all these years never got this don't know how my soil got infected that bad.  Tree has wilted before due to high temperature few times but all that time leaves fell, we watered it more and it became healthy again.  Here are some images   My last hope is this bud which had a few leaves a while ago though slowly dying but somehow it is still surviving even though it is at the bottom of tree.   Even after all this I have put some soil fertilizer, been watering and I saw this leaf growing just recently at the very bottom of tree where I have never seen a leaf before. What does this mean ? Is there still hope ?   Any help,info or observation is greatly appreciated.  Thanks "
4131,Tender fuchsias not coming back to life after overwintering,"I have a collection of fuchsias, which are marketed as non-hardy so I have overwintered them dormant by removing all the greenery, pruning them hard and keeping them in the shed. I am in the UK and the winter has been quite mild but with a few months of fairly hard frosts. I brought them out around the beginning of March and one had died, several others are growing back nicely with varying vigour, but two have yet to make any progress. I can see that there is green in the stems near the base of the plant and they have started to swell and slough off the old bark, so they are definitely alive, but there is no trace of a shoot on them. One of the planters is small enough to fit in my cold frame, so I've put it in there to give it a little extra warmth. So far, no good. There was actually a light, late frost a couple of days ago but the growing green plants don't seem to have been troubled.  Is there anything I can do to encourage them to sprout again? Are fuchsias particularly keyed to daytime temperatures, length of daylight, or something like that which will come around of its own accord? "
4132,Is it good or bad to have mushrooms growing in the soil of my fruit tree?,"As you can see I have mushrooms in my soil. Are they bad? Are they going to cause root rot in my plants? Also, are the mushrooms infectious through the air?  It's my testing soil. I plant different plants in here.   "

4134,Dealing with a large tree swamped by ivy,"On the boundary of our property are trees approaching 100 feet high. Some are badly infested with ivy to the extent the canopy is almost solid and the trunk and branches are twice their true size, blocking out a lot of light.   The ivy is as thick as my arm at ground level. Clearing it from the tree is not practical but would cutting it at the ground have any effect? Is there anything I could put on the cut ends that would get sucked up and poison the plant higher up?  "
4135,"What can I do with a large, old tree?","The house we recently moved into has a large tree that I believe to be a Tulip Poplar in the back yard.   It's 40-45 feet tall and the trunk is roughly 21 feet around (~6.7 feet across).  However, it was topped before we bought the house, and the trunk is covered with ivy for almost the entire height.  I don't know how old the tree is, but the house is about 90 years old.  Aside from one (large) side branch that appears dead, the remaining branches are growing leaves, but the arborist I've talked to (over the winter) said that they probably aren't enough to feed it.  The tree is close enough to the house that if it fell in our direction, it would cause serious damage, but it's also close enough to the edge of the property that if it fell in almost any other direction, it will ""just"" hit a parking lot.  As such, I have the following two questions:   Is the tree as much of goner as it seems? Or is it likely to be able to last for a while if left alone? If we do have the tree taken down, could I find someone who could benefit from that (other than via firewood or wood chips)?  Would there be anyone worth contacting to see if some of the wood would be useful to them?  Or should I just let the arborist who takes it down do whatever they choose with it?(For some far-fetched thoughts, might anyone be interested in turning some of it into one of those tree slices at nature museums which point out all the rings for historic events?  Or climate research?  Or is it practical to commission someone to make something out of the lumber?)     Finally, pictures!  (Click for full size)     "
4136,Why does my cherry tree have no branches?,"I bought a couple of dwarf cherry trees which I put in as a cordon at the edge of our garden.  They just consist of a single stem - which has been cut off at the top, with no side branches.  They've been in a couple of years so I would have expected them to form side branches by now, but they're just a pair of sticks, with huge clusters of leaves and cherry blossom tight to the main stem.  Why have they not grown branches?  I'm thinking next year I should rub off all of the buds except where I want them to grow branches, and maybe then they will sprout.  Alternatively should I cut the main stem above a bud in the direction I want them to grow?  Or do I just need to sit tight and be patient? "

At the end of the season I removed the plants since they had all dried up. This year, without planting seeds I have a couple of tomato plants that have germinated and are growing. Is it advisable to leave the plants and enjoy the produce or should I remove them?  I have other tomato plants that I germinated from seeds that I can replace with. Just trying to figure out if this ""wild"" tomato plant will be as productive as my seedling that I germinated. I am in the San Francisco / Bay Area  *** Update: This volunteer is growing like a weed. Starting to see flowers and hopefully tomatoes soon **  See picture.

It seems like the Plant does well for about a week after I will trim all the dead leaves off and then it's back to looking like this. The leaves turn brown, get crispy and shrivel up. Some of then will even yellow. Some of them have brown spots, that look like they have been eaten out of them. I don't understand what I'm doing wrong. I thought maybe it was getting to much light so I moved it to a room where it gets hardly no light. That hasn't helped. Iv watered it less.... that hasn't helped. Iv misted the leaves....that hasn't helped. Iv trimmed the dead off....that hasn't helped.  I'm afraid that it's dying and don't know why? "

Here are the holes:   And here's the bug:    It's about 3/4 cm long, with a narrow waist like a wasp (but not as long as a blue mud dauber), and iridescent blue. I'm pretty sure they burrowed in, because there's a little pile of what looks like sawdust underneath, and the fourth cane didn't have a hole (not did any when I bought them).  I'm in the mid-Atlantic USA.  What are these little beasts? How bad are they? What can I do about them? "
4144,rain barrel diverter for 6x6 downspout,"We are planting a garden at our preschool, including a rain barrel painted by the kids. The downspouts on the school are 6 inches by 6 inches.

4145,Can you bring citrus trees into quarantined states?,"According to the USDA here [website]This makes perfect sense.  I live in one of the quarantined states (Arizona) and I am having an email discussion with an online citrus tree vendor and he won't sell and ship me a citrus tree because of that restriction. However, that doesn't make any sense to me. Surely you would be allowed to ship INTO a quarantined area? (from an unquarantined  area.)  (I assume that the vendor is not in a quarantined state otherwise he would not be able to ship to anywhere in the country.)   Can anyone confirm if you can bring a citrus tree INTO a quarantined state? "
4146,Why would my goji berry plant in California get sick and full of aphids?,"I live in Los Angeles, California. I bought two goji berry plants on-line two years ago. The aphids already killed one. I thought it killed the other one but it grew back. I know that plants have defenses against bugs. The most logical explanation is it is sick. Maybe it doesn't have enough nutrients. So what would be the best way to make a goji berry plant healthy? I only had berries from it one time.   Now that May is coming I want a garden in my back yard, but with all those aphids attacking it will spill into my garden. I want to save it if I can. I was using Neem oil extract for the aphids. The leaves are all yellow, it is a mess. Should I just cut the leaves all off?  "
4147,Do fruit trees attract wasps? What can I do other than cutting/removing the tree?,"I have a fruit tree in my garden. I don't exactly know what tree it is but it is likely a cheery apple tree or similar to that. The size of the fruits is similar to a small plum. They are mostly green but could be yellow when ripe or with a little hint of red. In the summer, the ripe fruits fall from the tree into the garden and starting to rot. My questions are: 1) is this likely to attract wasps? 2) is this likely to attract wasps to nest in the tree? 3) What measures can i take to mitigate the risks of wasps other than cutting back the tree which I have done last year, but i can't afford to cut it every year.  Just to be clear, i am not even sure if there are wasps there yet. Am I worrying over nothing?    "
4148,Do just-repotted plants really need to wait for days before watering them? Why?,"I have read that for plants that have been just re-potted you have to wait some days. For the Aloe Vera in particular, I have seen some saying to wait for 2 days and others 2 weeks.   I just repotted it so that the soil was special for cactus as the previous one didn't drain properly and the tips were getting brown. The new soil looks dry after just one day, and I was supposed to water it just when the whole soil is dry.    Do I really have to wait more? For how long? Why? "
4149,Do mulberry hardwood cuttings (breaking buds) enjoy light?,"I took a hardwood mulberry cutting this winter. It's inside under a skylight and has grown some buds which (as well as already present buds) are now breaking into leaves. It might be just saved up energy in the stem though. I fear the leaves might suck the cutting dry. I keep the ground moist and mist the cutting whenever I'm home and see the hardwood has become a bit dry.  Now that leaves are forming, should I provide a  more powerful light source? Indirect, more direct or LED grow light to (hopefully) promote root growth?  I read a lot about how to start the cuttings but nothing about this stage. "
4150,Do succulents need to be kept out of the pot for some time before re-potting?,"Some people recommend to leave the plants, in particular the Aloe Vera, lying down out of the pot without soil in its roots for up to 3 days before re-potting. But  I always come to find some people contradicting what I have just learned.   So, is this right? Is this for all succulents? Is it just for the Aloe Vera or for all potted plants in general? What's the rationale behind that?  "
4151,Cap off tumbled bluestone wall,Last year I built a dry stacked tumble bluestone flowerbed.  It took me a long time to fit it all and it looks great but I ran out of time to work on it.  New year and I want to finish it off.  I've got about 39 feet of capping to do and it's cost prohibitive for me to spend 5 -800 for capping material.  It definitely needs something.   I thought about using a colored mortar or something Instead but I'm wondering what would work?  The bluestone isn't a uniform depth.  Any ideas? 
4152,How to chose the best seeds in Europe?,"I've watched a lot of youtube videos about gardening. I was paying particular attention to the plant and seed varieties. I noticed that a lot of seeds aren't sold in Europe. I don't know why that is, but I doubt there is any legal cause.  For example, I've heard wonderful things about tomato Boxcar Willie. When googled, I only found 1 europe based seller.   Is there a marketplace I am not aware of? How do you get seeds you heard of on the intrenet? "
4153,Hoya care - will it ever flower again?,"Oh, the things I have done to my mother-in-law's Hoya plant:   First, I watered it weekly. Neither the plant or the mother-in-law liked that.  Then I had the audacity to re-pot the root bound mess. I can't win with this plant.    It needs a level of neglect that is too much for me. Not ""has reached"", but legitimately wants to be neglected. Rumor has it that it will not flower for two years after being re-potted. What is your experience? Is this true?  So my question is this: Will it take my Hoya 2-years to bloom after being re-potted? Or will it be sooner???    "
4154,Is manure from farm animals acceptable for organic gardening?,"I've done a little brainstorming about organic gardening, and came to conclusion that your garden stops being organic the moment you add manure in it.   I am not some animal protector enthusiast or anything like that, but the stuff they put into chickens to grow fast and large, antibiotics and some other drugs doesn't seem organic to me. Main problem is that the drugs are secreted into feces. You can't use animal manure and derivatives of animal manure unless the animals eat clean. And those farms are really hard to find.  Is it possible to grow healthy plants without using manure, either directly or indirectly? What are my alternatives?  "
4155,How long do I need to stay off the lawn after applying weed killer?,"I have a 17 month old boy that loves to play outside.

4156,Difference between Espalier and Topiary,"I'm looking into decorative Topiary. In my studies I've come across a similar process called Espalier.  They're both shaped trees.  Here's my question: What is the difference between espalier and topiary? Is it plant species, shape or function? Obviously, I've wikied it and several difference are outlined:   Topiary is rounder Espalier is flat Topiary is perenial with thick leaves or nestles Espalier is usually a fruit tree   What if I had a round (or even animal shaped) fruit tree. Would that be topiary or espalier? "
4157,What's the best way to grow Crocosmia from seed?,"I collected seed from my Crocosmia (I believe ""Honey Angels"") and I'd like to see whether I can get healthy plants from them or not.  What are the right conditions to make them germinate? When do I start? If not now, how do I store the seeds, and how do I ""reactivate"" them later on? What type of soil? Those are some of the questions I have in my mind.   "
4158,Taking Care of my Orchid,"I was given an Orchid several years ago and just wanted some advice on if I am taking care of it properly and if it needs to be in a larger pot.  I am not much of a green thumb but this orchid has some significance so I would like to keep it well taken care of.  The orchid tag says Dan Airy Red Jumbo.  I am yet to see any flowers in 3+ years but it has been growing.  The leaves on the older stems have started to go off colour a bit and there is tons of roots sticking out everywhere.  I live in a tropical part of the world so we water it regularly and it stays out of direct sunlight.  Should I repot this into a large container, if so any soil type recommendations and fertiliser recommendations?  The current pot size is 100mm diameter at the top and 85mm high.  Any other recommendations on the general welfare / care taking of this orchid?  Thank you       "
4159,Tomato plants got black stems and the leaves dry out,"I was so proud of my tomato plants (grown from seeds), but now I'm worried that they have died...  Instead of having a usual French summer (with 30 C at least and dry weather) it is raining a lot and it is cold (18-20 C). Up to now (until last week or so) I was not worried because the tomatoes did well, a lot of flowers and some fruits were appearing. Then suddenly the stems became black, not only black dots and yellow leaves as described here but real areas. In addition the leaves have dried out.  Is there anything I can do? If not, what could I have done to avoid this situation beforehand? (""In gardening there is always a next year"")  Here are some pictures (click to enlarge).    "
4160,"Where to break off asparagus, when harvesting?","When harvesting asparagus, I keep hearing that you are supposed to ""break it off at ground level"" and that it snaps real easily. What precisely does that mean? Usually it snaps a half inch below or above ground level, and sometimes ain't as easy to snap as people make it sound.  It also leaves little stems there that seem to just die (wasting plant energy?) and occupy space where new shoots could come up, even a year or two later.  Instead, I find I can gently twist the the asparagus and they pop right out.  Here's what twisting them out looks like when harvested:    Does pulling the white part out damage the plant or reduce growth?  (I just cut the white off before eating or cooking it.) "
4161,What leaves should I feed worms?,"I know that in real life worms will eat both fresh and dry leaves at night or when it rains.  I am not putting earthworms in the soil yet but I will soon.  I am trying earthworms and  mix of old and new soil to improve the growth of my maples both in speed and duration.  The new soil has more nutrients than the old soil. Leaves and fruit and vegetable scraps will improve this more. But worms can turn leaves and food scraps into compost in their digestive systems.  So I think that maybe adding fruit and veggie scraps periodically to the soil will help both the worms and the trees. I am not all that worried about earthworms eating roots because it isn't a main part of their diet.  The ravine has maples, elms, and oaks. I am thinking that fresh leaves would be best but that means either one of these 3 things:  1) Pick leaves off trees(which I wouldn't do)  2) Wait for falling branches and then pick the leaves off(This I think would be best)  or  3) Wait for leaves to fall(that is until summer, fall, and the beginning of winter)  I am expecting to see maple seeds soon since the maple trees are getting their leaves and I always see seeds soon after I see leaves when it comes to maples.  So I was thinking of putting earthworms into the soil after I move the pot to on top of the hot tub(this area gets the most sunlight overall and the most rain so I don't have to water them as much during the first year and only really during dry parts of summer from then on. They also will produce the most nutrients for bark production and winter survival here) and plant a maple seed and give it a deep watering.  Then I figured that maybe once a week or once a month I will give food to the worms. Since they are true hermaphrodites I don't have to worry about telling male and female worms apart because regardless, I am going to get baby worms to aerate the soil even more and produce new soil faster.  Anyway, should I give them fresh leaves from this year off of fallen branches or dry leaves from last year's fall as a staple food(since I might not always have fruit and veggie scraps for worms)?  And how many worms do you think I should start with? I am thinking maybe 2-10 but I don't know for sure.  My pot is in the shape of a truncated cone and is about 1 foot wide at the base and 1.5-2 ft wide at the top in case you need those dimensions. It is also about 1.5-2 ft tall. "
4162,How much of a kale plant must be left when harvesting outer leaves?,"This is our first year growing kale and although it is not large enough to harvest yet, it has been growing rapidly during the last two hot weeks.  When it reaches a size that we are able to begin harvesting, how much can be harvested at a time? I've read that outer leaves can be removed, but can anyone recommend a limit of how much to take such that the plants continue growing and producing into the fall?  Will the kale's new growth occur in the center as with rhubarb? "
4163,Fungi or mold on top of soil in pots,"I've grown a tomatoes for over a month in pots. I used normal non-sterilized soil. A few days ago, I added fertilizer, and bam, some fungi or mold started to appear on top of soil.   Is this actually dangerous for the plant or humans? Should I just put some more soil on top of it or maybe dig it up?   Zoom in for detail:    "
4164,What are these stacked bulbs taking over my garden?,"There are a lot these bulbs so I don't know how I'm going to get them all out to grow anything else. I am in south-east England. Are they weeds or are all bulbous flowers? If it turns out they are flowers, could I just grow other stuff along side them? Or if they are weeds how do I remove them? I'm too impatient to wait to see what they grow into because I want to get planting stuff as soon as possible so any information would be great!       "
4165,What to do with strawberry plants planted in a soil with lot of nitrogen in it?,"When I planted my strawberry plants which I bought from Walmart into a 2.5' (Length) x 2.5' (Width) x 10"" (Depth) cedar planter, I filled ~5"" with top soil and then layered about an inch of steer manure and then topped it off with ~3"" of top soil. Its been more than a month and we are not seeing any fruit. The plants are really healthy with big leaves. But no fruits so far :(. Researching on the internet many say it could be because of high nitrogen in the soil. So my question is, what can I do now? Can I relocate the plants to the ground so that it will reduce the nitrogen content in the soil? And then transfer it back to the planter in mid-late fall (which is ~4-5 months away) with just top soil in the planter? "
4166,What's the environmentally safe way to get rid of worms that eat the vegetable plants?,"We have broccoli, kale and onion in one of our vegetable beds. Some tiny worms are eating the leaves of both broccoli and kale. My question is, what are some of the environmentally safe ways to protect the plants? Not just broccoli and kale but other plants too.  Are there any plants that act as bait for these worms so they will be attracted to those plants? I'm sure there are certain combinations of plants which protect each other. And there are some plants which attract bugs that attack certain plants. I would like to know these combinations. Does anyone know any of these techniques? "

How to choose Aloe Vera plants for consumption and smoothies? "
4170,Wood ash + forest soil or leaf compost + legumes. Is this the perfect soil?,"I am wondering if you can get all the necessary nutrients a plant needs my mixing wood ash with forest soil or leaf compost and growing legumes on top of it (and on top of that your actual plant you want to harvest)?  Based on my poor understanding of soil, you should get enough potassium and phosphorus and other trace elements the plant needs from the ash. Forest soil or leaf compost make sure there is lots of organic matter in the soil and cancel out the pH issues. Legumes, the ones that actually fixate more than nitrogen than they need it, make sure that the nitrogen levels are sufficient.   Am I missing something here or is this the perfect soil combo? "
4171,cultivating a cactus from cutting,"I've recently gotten a san pedro (Echinopsis pachanoi) cutting as a gift. I'm trying to take care of it as good as possible, but I'm not sure if I'm doing it the right way.  The situation is: the cutting has been properly dried after cutting it, to let the wound heal. The wound is dry, and little white roots were even starting to form. It's about 30 cm / 11 inches tall. I've planted it in a pot with relatively dry cactus soil, the cactus is about 5 cm / 2 inches deep (with supports to prevent it from falling over, and it has plenty of room to grow roots). I haven't watered it yet, because over here it's winter now and I heard that these types of cacti don't like to be watered in the winter (or they'll rot).  It is now in a safe place indoors, in its own pot. It doesn't receive a whole lot of sun (because it's winter and my windows face the north), but there's not a whole lot I can do about that unfortunately.  The problems are:   I'm kind of worried that the soil will become too dry (and that the microorganisms will die), but then again, I don't want the cactus to rot. So I'm kind of unsure what to do about that. The cactus is showing some discolorations (lighter green spots in its otherwise dark green skin. Some of the spots are swollen and kind of shiny, like bruises. Would this be damage from transportation, or is it sunburn or something else? Should I be worried and what can I do about it? As I said, the cactus is indoors, so it has to deal with my sleep/wake rhythm and my use of indoor lighting. Would this be detrimental to its health (i.e., could I be disturbing its day/night cycle by my use of artificial light)?   So those are my main questions. If you have any other suggestions/recommendations for taking care of my cactus, please let me know, I'm a total novice at taking care of cacti. Also, if you need to see pictures of it to know what I should do, let me know and I'll see if I can upload some. "
4172,How long should dyed brown landscape mulch keep its color?,"Question for you all out there.  We have a grey and white house and chose to have dark chocolate brown mulch placed around it with our landscaping bushes and flowers as contrast against the house.  This spring when the snow melted it is no longer chocolate brown and is instead white, grey, and light brown.  We just had it placed June 2016.  The mulch itself is still in good shape, just not the color.    My question is how long is the colored mulch color supposed to last?  We were told 2 years when placed.  So I am considering alternatives such as stone so there isn't as much upkeep, or suggestions on mulch that maintains its color.    What stone is out there that will have the contrast against our house? Here is a picture of the colors of our house.  The mulch I have is similar or a little darker than our garage doors.     We live in Northern Wisconsin.  The mulch is discolored on all sides of the house.   North, South, East, and West.  The mulch in the picture with the blacked out kiddos was a month old.  Here in the next picture it is 9 months old.  And yes, it does look like ground up pallets. I am sorry I don't have a closer one of when the mulch was brand new.    I am opposed to human poop mulch.  I am thinking about switching to stone.  I don't know...I guess I am open to options.  I want contrast with the house though.      house contrast "
4173,How to thicken grass,"I live in Massachusetts and I'm trying to get my grass greener. My grass has many spots that are thin and light green. Also, there are some spots about the size of a basketball that are just a big empty spot with nothing growing. Other spots are thicker and also a deeper green color which is what I want. In some spots I can see visibly a line of where different grasses are. Maybe the type of grass is different or it was seeded at a differne time with different seeds. I'm not sure. How can I get my spots that don't grow thick to grow thicker and greener? I've already applied Scotts® Turf Builder® Halts Crabgrass Preventer with Lawn Food about 3 weeks ago on about 11,000 square feet of lawn. I also dethatched before that. Do I need to just keep waiting and do my normal watering and mowing? Do I need to overseed? I read on the Scotts website in the reviews that there is only a 2% chance that overseeding on existing grass will do anything. Do I need to target specific seeds? So I need to apply a grub preventer? Most of my lawn faces east and gets a lot of light. Some of the lawn faces south as well and gets a lot of light too. The opposite side on the north does not and have a lot of spots of dark thick green grass and tons of moss. I'm asking because I moved into this new house so I have not cared for this lawn before.

4174,How can I remove or disperse clay soil stuck in/on grass,"I recently augured two holes in my yard for posts. I was not able to keep all the debris contained. I cleaned up what landed on a board I laid down and the large piles with a shovel. I raked up as much of the remainder as I could. There are still patches of heavy clay soil covering my grass. I admit my workmanship and planning was a bit sloppy, controlling the waste while digging would have been smarter.  I think the right tool for this job is a rake. I don't see how to scoop up such small quantities with a shovel without scalping the lawn.   How can I efficiently clean up this debris?

4178,Coral Bark Japanese Maple in Toronto,I just bought this for $130 from a nursery (reduced because it was the last year stock) This year's stock had greenish colors for bark an the leaves totally green. It is almost 9' long (the longest branch-did not fit in the picture)  Here are my questions: -is there anybody living in Toronto who has this tree ? -would it be a good idea to move it in a big pot and find the best spot for him for the rest of the year and then move it in a corner where it can sit for the winter wrapped and sheltered from wind and cold temperatures ? -for how long can you keep a tree like this in a big pot without crippling the tree's growth ? -is it practical to consider that at maturity I would still be able to wrap it in burlap?

4182,Raised bed soil repairing,"I moved into a new house where there was an aluminum raised bed. Let us call this bed A. I made a wooden bed 10inches deep. Let us call this bed B.   Bed A was there before I came and the soil looked bad, sandy, tough and full of cacti.   I filled bed B with 10 bags of expensive best organic raised bed soil (and just that - nothing else).  I planted same species of tomatoes, spinach, and peppers in both beds. It's been 2 months since planting.  To my surprise, bed A plants grew up to 3-4 feet and ready to bear fruit. On the other hand my bed B which I was proud of, the plants are only 10 inches high, leaves turning yellow and I feel like they'll die before bearing fruit.  Where did I go wrong? Is my bed B soil too lose and not holding much water? I live in desert area of south USA.  Is there something I can do to fix it now? That is by layering it with water holding materials like coconut coir etc.  Any help would be appreciated. Willing to provide more details if needed. "

We picked out some veggies for planting and on the back of some of them it reads like this:     In full sun, sow 4 to 5 seeds over a 12 inch tall and 2 feet across hill.    I have zero idea what that means. Does it mean to create a raised row in the garden 12 inches high and 2 feet across? What about length? What if my row is 10 feet long? Do I only put 4-5 seeds still?

4185,Holes in leaves and black specks on lower leaves,"I tried adding pictures but it isn't working. I have young zinnia plants that I started from seed about two months ago. They're just barely coming up on the point where they'll flower but suddenly I discovered a leaf with a gigantic hole. I freaked out, thinking it was a caterpillar! It should be noted this is my first little garden so I have basically no idea what could be happening! I contacted a friend who had me make an oil/soap/water mixture to spray on the plants. I wasn't able to ever find a caterpillar and am now convinced that's not the problem.   It has been about a week and all of the leaves on my poor baby plants are filled with holes. It seems to start as the leaf weakening and thinning out, then the holes develop where the thin portion was. Now just today I noticed some small black specs about the size of finely ground pepper on the lower leaves of the plants. So after some googling I thought it could either be some sort of fungus or maybe a very tiny pest? Does anyone have any ideas? I so badly want them to flower! Thanks to anyone who can help!  "
4186,To water or not to water a plant right before near frost temps in mid-Spring?,"Is a plant, whether in the ground or in a pot outside, more resistant to frost damage when it's soil is drier or freshly watered?   context: mid-Spring right as hardwood trees are budding. I'm mainly interested in potted young deciduous trees but would also appreciate learning what's best for other kinds of plants. It's raining a lot around this time so I figure the trees on the ground can handle a night of near freezing temps after being freshly watered. What's best for the potted trees though, to be watered or not to be watered (and dry from having minimal watering) right before a 0dC night? "
4187,Should we use glyphosate (or other non-ecological chemicals) in our gardens?,"European Union wanders if its going to allow glyphosate to be used inside its frontiers...     from the Guardian: If no new arrangement is found then the licence for glyphosate, a core ingredient in Monsanto’s $5bn-a-year Roundup brand, will expire at the end of June.   Here I read that the European Parliament adopted a resolution strongly opposing the Commission's proposal to reapprove the weedkiller glyphosate for use in Europe for 15 years.  This question is hugely controversial and there is so much money at stake! But if this product is discussed, it's must be based on some real ground that it's dangerous to use it.  You may guess where I want to go with this. But is there really a positive impact on the life and gardens of the many to use dangerous chemicals? Of course the very few benefit from it, and it could be very useful in some cases to uses powerful chemicals to feed us if we don't have any other choice.  My question relates only to small Sunday Gardeners. Do we benefit in the end with the use of chemicals in our gardens? Or shall we only grow what grows easily? If mushrooms or Aegopodium podagraria grow easier than rose in my garden, then what? "
4188,What is the cause of white spots on bean leaves and how to solve the problem?,"The leaves of my three bean plants are covered in these white spot; the rocket has the same problem, while the ivy and the avocado seem unaffected. These spots are located on the upper surface and they don't go away if I rub them.   I highly suspect that the cause is the grey fly in the picture below. I always found a dozen of them on each plant, especially on the lower surface of the leaf. They are 3mm long, grey, with black eyes and a pair of black spots on top of the thorax. They may have horizontal stripes, but given their size I'm not sure. According to my (attempted) research, they could be Psyllidae. Could they be the pest responsible of the damage?     The appearance of the lower surface makes me think that there could also be spider mites infesting my plants:    I was thinking of spraying a garlic infusion on the affected plants. Could it resolve the problem?   Location: Bologna, Italy. "

It's usually got some soil in it and occasionally gets a light tea color to it. Can that leftover water in the tray be poured into another pot to water a different plant?  Are there any exceptions/guidelines to this (e.g. not with allelopathic plants, or only for two pours/rounds before the leftover water should be poured onto the ground)? "
4190,How to care for/water Snake's Plant (Mother-In-Law Tongue Plant) indoor potted plant?,"I have several indoor potted Snake's plants. One pot has several kinds of plants in it, and is reasonably large - probably 16"" diameter. It is filled with Prayer plants, another plant (the name escapes me at the moment), and two varieties of Snake's Tongue. One of them looks like S. trifasciata (Snakeskin Plant), and the other one looks like S. trifasciata laurentii (Mother-in-Law's Tongue). I have had trouble knowing how to water the pot. The latter Snake's plant I mentioned loses leaves when they become soft and bend over. I lost about 18"" of one leaf to that, and it looks like I'm about to lose 4"" of another leaf due to that. The first variety mentioned doesn't seem to have that problem.  I don't remember when I fertilized it last, but it's been a while. The Prayer plant and the other plant variety don't seem to mind less water, they just don't grow as fast, and may drop a few leaves - usually nothing major. I usually let the soil get reasonably dry before watering it. The pot is a clay pot if it matters, and it is on the south side of a window facing east, so it gets plenty of light, it's just not direct through the window.  Am I over or under watering, or is there something else I am missing? "
4191,Why is my young fuyu persimmon tree struggling?,"I have a young fuyu persimmon tree that’s struggling quite a bit. It’s watered by a drip system connected to a Rachio controller. I checked the soil, and it doesn’t appear too dry. Am I watering it too little? Too much?  Some additional context that might matter: there used to be another tree near where this one is that we had removed due to oak root fungus. Our local nursery told us that persimmon trees are resistant though.  Also, note that there are some wood chips used as ground cover where this is planted.  I planted this tree late last Fall. It had lots of new growth in the spring, and looked like it was going to have a great summer. Now, it looks like it’s dying. :(   "
4192,How do I control the broadleaf weeds taking over my centipedegrass lawn?,"I have a lawn that was neglected for a long time - I've done a fair share of Weed-n-feed for a few months, but the weeds continue to prosper in the lawn.  I know the soil is great (rich, moist, black dirt), but the weeds seem to be really well-established.  In trying to weed a few I've found massive root systems going 8-12 inches into the dirt.  The little bit of grass I have is centipede, so many of the weed products can't be used on my lawn.  I'd like to keep centipede if possible - it grows well in my climate and I like the maintenance involved.  Where do I start?  Would I be better of spraying the entire effected area with round-up and starting over?   "
4193,Why would a Leyland cypress needles brown after 1 month transplant?,"I transplanted a ~7 foot tall leyland cypress two months ago (in May, I'm located in Maryland) and the needles began to brown after about 1 month. Browning started mostly near the bottom but now has moved up the tree. I've seen some sap too.  The new location is partial shade, it was mostly sun before transplanting. The tree was also planted a little deeper than before for fear of tipping over before the roots were re-established.  I thought maybe the browning was shock. But now I'm not sure. I also planted a newly purchased ~3 ft cypress near it and it is doing well.  Could the tree have been planted too deep? Any other suggestions? "
4194,How to differentiate between Portulacaria Afra and Crassula Ovata?,"The answers to this question have two different answers.   Someone believes here it is Crassula, most probably Crassula Ovata (""jade"" plant). But the other answer claims this is Portulacaria Afra a.k.a. Elephant Bush (funny name)   I would have thought the initial answer about Crassula was the right one, but now I see the picture of the other, Portulacaria, and I don't know what to think anymore.    here is Crassula Ovata(creds. to wikipedia):      and here is Portulacaria Afra (creds. to wikipedia):     Indeed from the initial question, leaves are very similar to both:    And wiki says it:     Similar in appearance to the unrelated ""jade plant""!   I recon flowers would help see which one it is. But if there's none? Any idea how we could differentiate them when they are not bearing flowers? "
4195,Why my tomato plants grows so slowly?,I've started growing a tomato plant a month ago and it is still pretty small. Around 7 cm high.  I grow it with a small fluorescent light ( T8 model ) in my basement.  Why is it growing so slow?   Is it the inadequate temperature? Too much / not enough light Inadequate water amount Too small/big pot size  
4196,What is an ideal amount and location for drainage holes in a plastic grow bag?,"I've seen this, but my question is about grow bags like these:   There are just 4 holes punched at the sides.     Questions: 1. Don't they need holes at the bottom too? I'm suspecting water might be pooling at the bottom, since the tomato plant's leaves are warping. 2. Since it's a plastic bag, would making more holes just make the bag tear apart easily? How to make holes safely? 3. An earthen pot allows breathability, so to simulate a similar effect for a grow bag, would it help to take a pin and poke tiny holes all over the sides of the bag? (not too many that it'd make the bag tear, but just enough to allow some aeration) "
4197,Thousands of tiny white eggs (?) on fig tree leaves - what are they? What to do?,"I'm in Long Island and have a fig tree in my yard. I added some top-soil to the base a week or so ago. I don't know if it is related, but yesterday I found that the leaves are infested with what look like thousands of tiny white eggs. See photos.  The eggs are only on the top side of the leaves, not much on the stems. They look too distinct to be powdery mildew (I think?)     "
4198,Basil leaves going white - why?,"A couple of weeks ago my basil plant on the window started to have some leaves withering and going black.   Initially, I thought that it was due to over-watering it and lowered the watering volume, but that didn't solve the problem.  Why could they have been turning white and withering like this? Especially only on some branches, but not all?   "
4199,crusher dust as summer mulch?,"Crusher dust = cracker dust = bluestone tailings etc. It's a cheaper and coarser basaltic crushed stone compared to bagged rockdust products. I got some into the soil in winter. Now I've got summer crops already started but wanted to add some more crusher dust. Can I use it successfully as a mulch, an inch or two, before digging it in after summer veggies finish? If it works as a mulch as well then I'd rather avoid the cost and inconvenience of straw etc mulches for the vegies. The main thing I'm looking for in a mulch is moisture retention and wettability, which is something organic mulches aren't that great for in my climate (Melbourne Australia). Anyone used crusher dust as mulch? "

4201,How to prevent bunnies eating my plants?,Bunnies are eating all my flowering  plants. Is there a repellent that works best with bunnies? or what can I do to prevent them from eating plants? 
4202,Nursing of chestnut sproutings indoors,I collected a bag of tame chestnuts when they fell in August. A few weeks later I found most of them had sprouted in the bag so I planted them in potting mix and they are progressing. The best result has come from suspending a nut over a jar with its root in the water. That one now has a green shoot growing upwards. My question is will the seedlings keep growing indoors through the winter so they will have a head start if/when I plant them next spring? If I keep a couple in a pot and bring them indoors for autumn and winter will they skip hibernation and keep growing?  
4203,Avocados from seed - inside house or polytunnel during germination?,"I've got a windowsill with a number of avocados growing from seed (I'm in Rural Auckland - so US Hardiness zone 9b, heading towards winter) - A couple of my plants have just started to poke out the top of the Avo (ie stems, not roots).  For now, am I better off leaving them inside my house, which would have a more constant temperature of around 18-24 degrees c, or putting it into my unheated polytunnel which will get warmer during the day, but much cooler at night.  I'd imagine 8c - 35c [ eventually going down much colder - I expect temperatures are a bit marginal in winter here ] and with greater humidity and probably more overall light ?      Also, if i'm moving them to the polytunnel can I transplant them now, or am I better to wait until they are 15cm's or so tall ? "
4204,When to Plant Avocado,"My avocado tree is about 4"" tall now with big bright green leaves. It is still suspended in water. I've read that I should wait for my seedling to reach 6"" in height, cut the leaves off, wait for them to grow back, and then plant it in soil. I don't see it gaining height any more, what should I do?  Should I go ahead and plant it in some potting soil?  Also, my tree looks like there are two trees coming from one pit. Is this normal?   "
4205,Maple Tree Typical Dormancy Requirements?,"To give a little bit of context, I'm looking to start growing bonsai trees indoor. I really like maple trees and I'm thinking of building an indoor growth enclosure(like a Grow Box) with artificial lighting(for those interested I'll be using driverless full spectrum grow LEDs), temperature control, etc. I know these plants require dormancy, and to avoid ""eternal summer"", which is fatal, some people use refrigerators to meet dormancy requirement. Guess it depends a lot on the type of maple tree, but my questions are the following :   What's the maximum temperature to meet dormancy requirements and ""simulate"" winter? How should I vary the light cycles during the year? What humidity percentage should I be working with? How should I vary the light cycles and temperature during the year?  "
4206,Schefflera Arboricola (Umbrella Tree) in bad shape :(,"I've had it for 7 years and in the last 2-3 months it has been losing all of its leaves. In an attempt to save what is left of it, I transplanted it today into a larger pot with fresh organic soil. i think, looking around online, i've overwatered it. also i had the top of the soil covered with rocks. When i removed them all to transplant, the soil was very moist. The last time a watered it was about 3 days ago. The tree (well mostly sticks at this point) is over 5 feet tall and the root system was very small. They didn't seem to be rotten. I've trimmed most of the branches down, with a few left that had healthy leaves. The base stems are still green when i scratched it (all the way up until the top 1/4)  Does my tree have any hope of rebounding?  Should I trim it down more?  I didn't water it when I transplanted it today, the soil was pretty moist already, should I?  It used to be a large beautiful tree. Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! I've had this tree for so long, i'd hate toss it! (I have pic but are unable to upload them yet) "
4207,Revive a dying lavender (for a dummy),"In my recent backyard (since 1.5 year), I have been clumsy (and lazy). This not so young lavender (Lavandula) was blooming last summer, and I neglected cutting the flowers at the right time. I just let it go. During Fall, I looked at garden for dummies' advices. I tried to pruning branches on ""green"" parts only, as suggested. And circled it by a wired to keep the shrub straight.  I understood dead branches  won't bloom again. I probably pruned too much, this is the present look. The front looks quite dead. It has a lot of rosemary bugs that I handpick, but I cannot blame them, honestly.     What should I do, and when  to revive the plant, and have it grow away from the bottom and not the back and  top only? Would one  suggest me to leave it a little time, and try for instance propagation by cuttings?  "
4208,Rio Dipladenia not making vines,"I have 2 diplandenia plants, one is making runners really well but the other is not, why?

4209,Pothos leaves turning yellow,I have many Pothos plants in my home most of them well settled. Four weeks ago I gave some Fertilizer to them(the kind of quantity I always gave) and watered them a little more for a week and than came to normal watering(once a week). Now after 3 weeks I see that all plants have one or two leaves becoming yellow every week. The remaining leaves look ok. Winter is also beginning to settle in here in India.   Do I need to worry about the cold and move all the plants indoors ?  Did the daily watering for a week hurt the plants ? Can they still recover ?   thanks 
4210,How do I recover from an over fertilized yard,"Last summer I decifded to create a lawn and brought in top soil and planted grass seed. After six weeks, I spread fertilizer and then my grass turned yellow. I didn't water as much as I think I should have and by the end of the summer, I had some very green streaky areas where it was obvious that water from the driveway was being directed down my sloping yard. I live in Alaska and there will be snow until late April or May. When spring finally arrives and the snow is gone I would like to be proactive in recovering the rest of the yard. Besides the obvious of adding some new seed and watering frequently, what else can I do? I'm wondering if adding lye or some other type of neutralizer would help. Any ideas?  "
4211,Spacing for semi dwarf cherry trees?,I have 2 semi dwarf cherry trees. One is a Rynbrandt and the other is a Blackyork. I've looked for information online about how far to space them and can't find a thing. My tags don't tell me either. Does anyone know how far apart these should be planted?  Also. would it be OK to plant them near apple trees or should they be put in a different area? 
4212,Is it better to pick herbs from the top or bottom of the plant?,I have a basil plant in my garden that has plenty of leaves. Should I pick the leaves/stems from the bottom of the tree or the top?  Does this apply to most herbs like cilantro or parsley? 
4213,Can anyone identify this rose?,"Can anyone identify this rose (photos below)? I'm wondering if it's a climbing rose or even a rambling rose. And does anyone know how I should care for it?  The stems are quite long and thin and don't have many shoots coming off of them, although this could be because it hasn't been pruned correctly for some years.  It produces white flowers that bloom once a year. The leaves come in clusters of 5. (I read this means it's not a rambling rose, but could be a climbing rose...)  We live in Sweden, where the summer temperature reaches about 25 Celcius and winters usually have several months of snow and are about -10 Celcius.  Thanks for any help!     "
4214,How do I care for Adenium Boehmianum?,"I've had my Adenium Boehmianum for almost, em!, maybe 4 years. I leave it in the most sunny place and water on this schedule:   summer - every week; spring/autumn - every fortnight; winter - once in a month.   It has leaves 3-4 months a year as it should, but I've never seen it bloom.  What I'm doing wrong? What is the right care scheme for Adenium Boehmianum? "
4215,How to remove small insects from broccoli?,"I'm growing up vegetables (without any chemical products) and among them broccoli. They are good, but they've a big problem: they're full of very small insects, and when I cook them, I find them in my dish. This isn't very nice.  How do you keep far away your dish these small boring insects?  How can I eat my broccoli without insects? they hid themselves within broccoli and don't go away even if I wash broccoli with flowing water, neither if I put them in water with salt... :( "
4216,How should we treat cracks in the stem of Aloe Veras?,"I received this damaged Aloe Vera about 5 days ago and I found help, here mainly, to determine the source of its problems. So everything was on track now, until I realized that it had  soil in between its leaves that I couldn't remove and I had the ""smart"" idea of using an air compressed can to clean it -pressing it half way. It worked like a charm with the first leaf. With the second I may have pressed pass beyond the half way and the whole burst of air did what it is supposed to do. You can imagine the whole soil explosion scene and the cleaning chore it led to.    The real problem, though, is that it blew up more than the soil itself. The leaves have been damaged down at the root level. See the vertical crack in the white part of the plant that circled the left and right leaves:     Also, I have realized that it already had a horizontal crack in the leaf/steam inside and above the part already mentioned that you can see clearer in this pic:     Seen the images and that I have just repotted it 3 days ago into a pot filled with special-for-cactus soil, do you think it can still be repaired? And if yes -hopefully- do I need to cut the two outer leaves (and then can I replant them)? Or what should I do?   More pics of it made 4 days ago - before repotting it:  Causes of pale-brown tips  Update (May 9):  The two bottom leaves are rotting at the stem, one of them has already fallen down -it is just supported by the pot- and the other is becoming brown at the stem so it will too... Is it better to remove the rest of the corresponding layer of stem (is a white part...)?        May 10, the leave in worst condition collapsed:     May 15, the entire plant collapsed. It stayed up for a couple of days after propelling it with a stick, but it seems it has definitively collapsed today and the stem is almost flat at the base, where the plant bent:      I guess at this point there's nothing to be done...

4217,What is this succulent's name?,"I bought this from theheartcompany at metrotown. But i do not know the name of it, any answers?  "
4218,How do I grow roses from seed?,"I'm starting with the assumption that roses can grow from seed, as that's how most plants reproduce.  I'm wanting to grow roses with rosehips, which handily contain seeds. I can try cuttings as well of course, but thought it would be interesting to grow them from seed since that's what people tend not to do.   I collected a whole lot of rose hips from various roses (and after having stored them over winter) got the seeds out, put them in seed raising mix, etc, like with my other types of seeds, and I don't think any of them grew. It is possible I have two seedlings from one of the rosehips, but I'm not 100% sure they're not a deceptive weed, partly because it took around two months for them to sprout, which is a long time (and I was tricked by a lot of promising-looking seedlings that turned out to be weeds).  So - what kind of conditions are needed for growing roses from seed, and what is a likely germination time? And do rose seedling look sufficiently similar to big roses to be able to identify them as such? "
4219,Do toxic mushrooms that grow near a plant affect its edible / poisonous traits?,"    Some facts:   I have some Basil growing in a pot, for the past 7-8 months, with some Thyme right next to it. Last week some mushrooms grew on the soil in-between them and under the Basil.   What I know:   These mushrooms are only the fruiting body of the underground Mycelium present in the soil, and probably came with the soil itself. Mushrooms feed on dead organic matter. These mushrooms probably grew due to high-moisture and convenient temperature - possibly caused by over-watering of the pot.   What I am not asking:  This question is not about the mushroom, its identification and / or classification. For the purposes of what I am asking - this is a toxic mushroom species.  What I am asking:  I am asking about the Basil plant (or the Thyme).  Assuming the mushrooms touched the Basil (or Thyme) leaves - can the Basil (or Thyme) still be consumed safely?  If not - is trimming the leaves that came in contact with the mushrooms, and getting rid of the mushroom safely safe, or should the whole plant be treated somehow? "
4220,I just planted a Paperwhite bulb and I broke the roots. Will it still grow?,"I planted it, indoors, about 2 days ago. I rotated it because I thought it was leaning. Then I heard a snap and realized i'd broken the roots. I didn't think roots would have already sprouted :(. Did I kill it? Or will it re-root itself?? "
4221,What can I do with rocks to encourage wildlife?,"Recently I was preparing an area for planting, so dug up a lot of rocks and stones. These are a variety of sizes and shapes, mostly between 5cm and 30cm. So now I have a large pile of rocks.  I would like to do something with these rocks, to benefit wildlife in my garden. So how should I arrange them? Better as one big pile, or several smaller piles? Or maybe build a dry stone wall, or other structure? And whereabouts in the garden should I put them?  And what sort of wildlife could it attract? Specifically in Scotland. "
4222,Is it normal for an Aloe vera to become spidery after blooming?,"My Aloe vera plant has bloomed.  It has gotten very ""spidery"", hanging out over the edges of the pot.  Some of the leaves down near the base have begun to dry up.  Someone told me they usually die after blooming.  Is there any truth in that? Is this spidery growth normal, can it be prevented or does it just happen in older Aloe vera plants? "
4223,Black Hills Spruce Leader Drooping and Brown,"I have a black hills spruce tree, about 8 feet tall. It was planted a year and a half ago. The leader has new growth at the top, but parts of it are drooping and browning (to about 1 foot down from the top). The rest of the tree looks healthy, no browning. Should I prune the leader?   UPDATE - I pruned the leader. Should I spray for insects? If so, any recommendations on when and what to spray?   "
4224,"Mint questions: identification resources, survival of cuttings, and safety","I received two unidentified types of mints and for some time have been wondering what they are. I included pictures of them below, but I also would like to learn to identify the different varieties myself rather than merely ask someone else each time. Does anyone know of a good resource to learn from?  Here are the pictures. The first mint flowered, but the too-tall stem fell over in a storm and much of the flower has since fallen away.      The second mint has yet to flower, but it's flourishing.     I've also seen other mint varieties around town and been left wondering what those are as well, so I would definitely like to learn to identify these myself in the future. I haven't tasted either yet because of my next question...  Are all varieties of mint safely edible? I recall hearing in the past that I should steer clear of catmint because it can cause irritability. That was for humans in general, but I specifically am on an antidepressant. I know I need to avoid St. John's wort for that reason, for example. Are any other varieties of mint potentially unsafe to eat? Do any others have possible side effects?  Lastly, I have a question on rhizomes and surviving the winter. My understanding of mint's strategy to survive the winter is that when the above-ground stems die off, the plant is essentially retreating into its rhizome, from which it will sprout again when the weather warms. I have a root cutting of lemon mint which has no rhizome, so I wonder if that means it won't be able to survive the winter. I live in central Pennsylvania on the very edge of zone 6b, almost 6a. Is my understanding correct?  Thank you, everyone, for your help! "
4225,"Ipomoea / Morning Glory leaves ""engraved"" with whitish, silvery patches","I hope you can help me identify the problem with these Ipomoeas (Morning Glory).  It's actually two varieties of seeds I sowed together:   Ipomoea Violacea (those with tinnier leaves, I'm not sure) Ipomoea Tricolor Heavenly Blue (those with larger, rounder leaves, I'm not sure).   As you can see from the pictures, some whitish, silvery patches are appearing on leaves.  I've already looked at the following similar questions...   What is happening to the leaves of my Ipomoea (Morning glory)? What is causing yellow leaves on my Morning Glory?   ...but I am not sure it's the same problem because in those questions it seems that the leaves became just decolored, while on mines it seems more that some of the leaf tissue  came off, and the lower layer of it became exposed (the patches).  Relevant facts:   I sawed the seeds approximately one month ago.  Plants have been taking 5-6 hours of direct sunlight and 4 hours of indirect sunlight a day. When plants' height was half of what it is now, there was an hailstorm, resulting in very few leaves being clearly broken/cut, but this seems to not have to do with the whitish patches, because they also started appearing on intact, unbroken leaves. However - I am not sure if this is important - when the hailstorm happened, the hail on the ground did not unfreeze immediately (it was at night). There is no trace of insects on the top face or bottom face of the leaves. Concerning watering, I've watered them every time I saw the ground become dry, so for the first two weeks, approximately once every 3-4 days. Then two weeks ago it got warmer, so I've started watering them more (once every 2 days). Then last week got even warmer so since then I've started watering them almost daily. These days maximum daytime temperature is 22° Celsius. At night it gets to 8-10° Celsius. The patches appeared initially only on some plants, and now more of them are showing the same thing, although not all of them.  It seems leaves are still growing, although slowly, and new leaflets are coming out. I used a universal soil and did not add anything to it.   Sorry if I made this question too long, but I tried to be as much detailed as I could. Please let me know if there is something I might have forgotten to include.  Thanks a lot in advance for your help!           "
4226,Why are mushroom appearing in my garden?,I never had mushrooms in my garden. But this year they appeared in a significant number. Why?  They appeared in the area where a large tree was removed last year. That area was generously watered this year (to support new plants). Could that be connected to the mushrooms? 
4227,American Holly tree trimming,"I have a few American Holly trees (I think that's what they are) that my landscaper cut all the way down, almost to the trunk. Is this how you would normally trim this tree? I don't think this was right but thought I would check here to make sure. My guess is that tear drop shape trim is the most you would ever want to do. I think they will look bare for a while, then like little green popsicles for a while longer, before ever looking like real trees again. Am I wrong? Pictured below are two of the trimmed trees. The crepe myrtle in the middle I am not worried about.    Here is what these trees used to look like:   "
4228,Is dyeing home-grown roses fundamentally different from store-bought?,"I have a Mme A. Meilland rose in the garden, and I'd like to dye some of the blooms from it. There are plenty of guides online for buying roses from a shop and dyeing them all sorts of colours, but I'm also aware that shop roses might be treated with hormones and other chemicals to encourage them to bloom, and I'm not sure if this would make a difference.  Is it just as easy to dye roses from the garden? Given that I can take cuttings whenever I want, can I get a better result by cutting the stem before it's fully bloomed? Will I need to take better care of the cut stems given that the plants are untreated? "
4229,Compost tea - any combination of ingredients not OK?,"I want to make compost tea for my tomatoes but was wondering if it is OK to add several ingredients at once or if there are any that shouldn't go together. Also, should I add more water for each ingredient or can I combine all into one 2 gallon jug?  Most of the recipes are for something like 2 tablespoons of ingredient to 2 gallons of water. So do I add another two gallons for each ingredient or can I add all to a single 2 gallon jug?  I assume the latter.  My plants are 2 months old and just starting to bloom.   These are the ingredients I have and might want to combine one or more at a time: worm castings, bat guano, humic acid, fish emulsion, seaweed granules and root enhancer. Not sure which of these are good together and if now is the right time for any or all of these. Thanks for any input! "

4231,Privacy Trees - Keeping alive,"I recently bought a property where I'll need around 340 feet of privacy trees. I'm planting around 35-40 Thuja Green Giants on the property line.  However, I'd like to get these trees in the ground soon - or during the fall.  We will not have a structure/water turned on to the house for some months.   What the chances that these trees will establish if I plant them during the fall? I'd like to get them established and growing upwards by the time we occupy the property.   About half the properties I see that try to grow privacy lines end up with mostly-dead trees. What is the main cause of this?   Further, is it possible to avoid this die-off without irrigation available, or is the best option (most likely) to wait until I have irrigation hooked up to insure establishment?  I'd appreciate any thoughts.   Edit The location is East Tennessee. The die-off is not uniform to the area. Those with established (well-draining) soil and homes seem to show the most success. Death seems to occur when Evergreens sit underwater, or have no access to regular water.  "
4232,What are these orange insects under the leaves of my mandevilla?,"First, I'll set the scene:  Location: South Florida  Temperature: 75°F - 85°F most days  Rain: Had been fairly dry until the last couple days  Affected plant: Mandevilla with yellow flowers    Story:  There usually isn't a day that goes by that I don't take a close look at my mandevilla (multiple) in order to guide the vines and such. So, I was surprised to notice this morning these little orange insects on the bottoms of a bunch of leaves that looked like the life was being sucked out of them.    I cut most of the leaves they'd infested and hit the rest of the plants with some high-pressure water to hopefully knock off some of the remaining insects and the little black specs (eggs?) that accompanied them.  After that, I sprayed a combo of water and Dawn soap around the affected areas.  What are these little guys, and what's the best way to keep them in check?     "
4233,"Mulch become soil, how many years till soil becomes too high that must be removed?","About 4 years ago, I put down 4 inch deep of wood chip mulch (cheapest kind bought at Home Depot), and then 1 inch every year after. I noticed lately, grass and weed have been growing much more than before. I suspect that the 4 inch of mulch is now only 2 inch, since the lower 2 inch had turned to soil.

4237,Should I leave or remove sand under a demolished brick walkway to allow grass to grow?,"I started demolishing an old brick walkway in my backyard and I found sand underneath about a good 3 inches worth of sand. My question is: If I leave the sand underneath and add about 2 inches of topsoil over the sand, will my grass grow on this top soil sitting on top of sand? Is it a bad idea to leave the sand down there? Should I remove it? "
4238,"Reviving some soil using fertilizer, how long to wait before planting?","I had a planter full of a nice soil mixture but let it go dormant and dry out for a year or two. Recently I have kept it around some other plants, exposed it to more light, and applied fertilizer (fish-based fertilizer then a couple of days later worm castings from kitchen scraps).  Can seeds be planted in that soil now without harm or are they better off being planted after the freshly-fertilized soil rests longer? If I should wait in between fertilizing and planting, how long?   The seeds I'm interested in planting for this soil are a mix of salad greens. The concern with planting the seeds too soon is that the fresh fertilization will somehow injure the seeds. "

4240,peace lilly is rotting from the heat (possible?)?,"I have a long-loved peace Lilly that has recently taken a turn for the worst. Some time ago, SE advised me that the pot it was in did not have appropriate drainage, and saved this very plant. It was very healthy from there on out, until this past couple of weeks.   I came home from a trip, and the plant was a little dry (According to the reader I use). I gave it a good watering, and it half perked, then sort of stopped. Then drooped. Then got brown and rotted. I've had to cut away the vast majority of it - hoping it can survive though!    Our water is hard, I sometimes use bottled water to balance this out. I wonder if not enough - judging by the crust on the pot. I also wonder abotu temperature; it was recently in the mid 40's degrees c (107-115F). Is that too much for this plant?   It is in indirect light, of roughly the brightness you see in the photo. It gets maybe 1 hour of direct light (through window) per day.  I'm concerend that if I pull it up to check the roots, it'll be game over.   Should I water this plant? The soil is still quite moist to the touch. What other diagnostics could I do? "
4241,What's the best way to overwinter carnivorous plants?,"The flies, fruit flies, mosquitoes, and moths are getting really annoying and the spiders in the house aren’t helping much, so we want to get some carnivorous plants to put around the house.  Our main concern is how to maintain them during the winter. They shouldn’t have too much trouble with the cold because the same ones grow wild in a bog in town, but there won’t be any bugs during the winter, so I’m not sure what they should/would eat.  I tried looking up information on wintering carnivorous plants, but didn’t find anything useful; most of it was just about temperature, not feeding.  How can we ensure that carnivorous plants survive through the winter? Should we feed them? If so, what and how often?  (I don’t know specifically which one(s) we would get until the stores get them in. Naturally, I’d like the usual Venus Fly Trap, but the varieties that grow wild here are Sarracenia purpurea, Sundews (Drosera rotundifolia, Drosera intermedia), and Utricularia, so I would think that they would be the ones most likely to be available and likely to survive here.) "
4242,Butternut yellow and fall off before blooming,"So far my Butternut squash plant was doing fine. The first two fruits turned black and fell off after blooming, which I think was because there was no male flower available. Now three more fruits bloomed and I supported pollination by hand and they are growing. However, the next small bumps, which I assume are to be female flowers, are turning yellow and then black, falling off even before blooming. What could be the cause of that ? I'm new to gardening and I'm wondering if I water incorrect or don't offer the right nourishments. The plant is located on a house flat roof in the city (8th floor) and it is my only Butternut squash plant. A Zucchini is right next to it. My neighbor has a Butternut plant too, which is located on the same roof.   There are some dead leaves beneath the still green ones in the center of the plant. Not sure if this is linked.       Edit: The gravel that you see is what the plants are planted in. It is a mix of brick debris, compost, sand and soil that was provided by the building's maintainer. I don't get the impression that it gets very hot during the day. My neighbor's squash is planted in the same substrate and I didn't see their fruits falling off. I used a 2-2-2 NPK fertilizer at first but 12 days ago was the first time that I used a 3-2-5 NP fertilizer (it says tomatato fertilizer that can be used for squash too). I used the amount that is described on the fertilizer for the Zucchini and Butternut plants together since they are very close to each other. But I guess you are suggesting that I need another fertilizer that has more P?  My watering habits are irregular. I sometimes water in the morning, but more often in the evening. I watered a bit less lately because it was raining sometimes but maybe the leaves are diverting the water? I have just been on the roof and removed all the dead leaves and took some more pictures. I saw two new dry leaves, so maybe I didn't water enough?  Also maybe it is worth adding that this happened to some of my zucchinis lately after I successfully harvested two big normal zucchinis already : [ Could be because of no male flower available, but I don't know.

4243,"My graduation rose is sprouting, help!","So its been about a month and a week since I got the single rose and the rose itself is dried I think, but on the stem three little baby stems are sprouting new leaves.  I've read up a bit about this topic but I have a question about what to do with the rose itself. I'm planning on leaving the stem in water, but since I got the rose from my school at graduation, I wanted to save it.  Is it possible for the stem to still grow if I cut the rose off?  Also any tips on how to care for it and how to get it to grow roots? I don't do a lot of gardening so suggestions that are simple and cheap would be great!  "
4244,Drinking Water Safe hose reel - what to look for?,"I've read this well-researched post Garden Hoses: how safe are they? But it focuses on hoses.  My question is about a hose reel. I've seen enough ""drinking water safe"" hoses (usually polyurethane and rubber), but I am yet to find a ""drinking water safe"" hose reel. On the contrary, any hose reel that is sold in US as well (I am in Canada), has the California Prop 65 warning. Those that don't have the warning are Canadian only, therefore they don't require a California warning.  So, with that in mind, what should I be looking for in a hose reel, to make sure it is ""drinking water safe""?   Are ""solid brass fittings"" automatically a no-no? (The ""drinking water safe"" hoses usually have chrome-plated brass fittings).   What about plastic connector fittings, like Gardena? Are they safe as long as they are PVC-free?  "
4245,Can anyone give advice related to growing an Ayurvedic Herb Garden?,"I'm currently growing a few herbs and spices in pots on my terrace using Natural/Organic gardening techniques. Turmeric, Basil (Tulsi), Lemon-Grass, Omum are few herbs.    I'd like to transition to growing Ayurvedic herbs on a larger scale in future in Southern India. The best thing is to ask people who've already got full-blown herb-farms.   What problems/solutions did you experience in real-life situations?   Do you need totally different techniques when going from a terrace garden to a farm?   Any pointers to people/websites/books/resources to help transition from being a weekend hobby terrace-gardener to growing herbs on a farm would be most welcome. "

4247,What preventative action should I take against Fruit Flies?,"I am in Sydney, NSW, Australia. This coming (arrived?) summer I have several fruit trees which will be bearing fruit for the first time. This includes a peach tree and nectarine (both of which already have masses of fruit about half the size of a golfball) and 5 different guava varieties, some of which are starting to flower at present.  In my particular area I don't know the extent of the fruit fly population, but it's a safe bet that they will be present to some extent. I have been keeping an eye on the peach and nectarine trees with no signs of infestation yet (as far as my untrained eye can tell).  Should I be taking a preventative measure right now, such as setting some baited traps? If an infestation takes hold, I'd like to use the most organicy remedy possible but I'm prepared to use pesticides to save the crop if there are no other options left. I'd much rather make a pre-emptive strike though, but I have no experience with growing fruit fly susceptible fruit trees. Any tips? "

4249,What type of irrigation system works best with blueberries?,"Several months ago I planted a row of blueberries in order to form an (edible) hedge. At the same time I installed an automatic watering system for these and the rest of my fruit trees and vegetable patches.  I used a variety of systems including mini sprinklers, drippers and soaker hoses for the different types of trees, shrubs and vegies. For the blueberries, I put in two drippers for each plant, one either side of the trunk about 20cm (8 inches) from the trunk and underneath a 1-2 inch layer of lucern mulch. The rationale for this was that since I will train these bushes to grow as a hedge, a dripper would work to sit under the hedge and apply water to the root zone, whereas a sprinkler would get blocked. I applied well rotted compost and acid loving plant poultry manure based pelleted fertiliser when planting, and added additional fertiliser 2 months after planting. The subsurface soil in my area is an acidic heavy clay, although the top 6-12 inches in the location of the blueberries is a more balanced imported garden soil. I am in Sydney, so we are currently in the middle of a hot, dry summer.  That is the background. My problem is that the blueberries are growing very slowly with little new growth and the tips (in some cases the 'tip' is up to half of the leaf) are showing a burnt reddish appearance and shrivel up and die. I found this question which appears to describe the same issue. One thing I noted is the suggestion to wet the entire root area. I also found on this site the comment      There is little lateral translocation of water and nutrients within the plant. This means that irrigation should moisten entire root zone, not just a portion.   Could my problem be that the use of two localise watering points means I am not getting water to the whole root zone? The worst case scenario would be that I'm over-watering some parts and under-watering others!  What would the optimal irrigation method for a blueberry hedge be? "
4250,Transplanting established Wisteria from pots to ground,"I have two Wisteria Brachybotrys, each growing in a 1200 litre tub, on either side of a gazebo.  They are young, purchased in the spring, but have already entwined the trellis walls and the roof of the gazebo.  They are each some 2.5m tall.  The location is southern England and the location is in full sun from mid-morning to dusk.  Looking to the future, I want to know how long these plants can sensibly be kept in these containers before becoming potbound. The RHS guidelines indicate that container growth is possible but don't indicate a timeline.    If the expected life in pots is only a few years, I would expect to try to transplant them into the ground.  To do this would require cutting the plants out of the trellis, which, if I must do, I would want to do soon, before they become too entwined.  This is something of the inverse of this earlier question  Should I leave these plants alone?  They're quite healthy and, given the size of the pots, transplanting them will be quite an exercise. "

4256,My habeneros have shrunk over winter!,"Since we don't get frosts, I kept my chillies over winter, replanted them into beds, and most have survived very successfully. I was excited to see them flower early in spring, however the fruits turned a ripe colour much quicker than they did in their first season, and the size of each fruit is only about 1/3 of the size of the summer crop.    I cut one of the fruit in half (please excuse my blurry picture), and it looks like there is a green 'pea' in the centre, where the seeds should be. The flesh still has some heat, but they taste bitter.    Should I pick and discard the dwarf fruit and hope that a better crop turns out later? It looks like my jalapenos are also turning out tiny, although my other chillies haven't started flowering yet.   Update  After picking off all the miniature chillies, about 2 to 3 weeks later, new flowers fruited and the fruit is again full-sized, albeit taking much longer (5-6 weeks) to fully ripen.  A similar thing happened to my jalapenos - I had tiny jalapenos which turned red within 2 weeks of the fruit first forming.  I would still be interested to know why this happens? Early spring cold snap? Nitrogen in the soil perhaps? "
4257,How am I supposed to attach wires in a traditional greenhouse?,"   I've been given this nice greenhouse.

4263,Ants and white/gray/brown spores all over my gardenia,"  I planted my gardenia four or five months ago.  I noticed, recently, that (a) growth has stunted, and (b) there are ants all over the plant (base, leaves, etc.).  There are also white little dots (spores?) on some of the leaves.  To help with the stunted growth, I've started fertilizing with a more-acidic fertilizer as opposed to the more general-use plant food I had been using.  Couple details about environment:   I live in South Florida It's rained 3-5 days a week for the last couple months Plant gets plenty of direct sunlight   So, a couple questions wrapped together:   What are the white dots, and how can I get rid of them? Are the ants all over the plant a bad thing, and, if so, how can I get rid of them without harming the plant?  "

4266,How should I handle tall grass patches in my lawn?,"I recently purchased a home in January. Now that it's Spring the grass is starting to come through. However, I've noticed a variety of grass patches of different colors and lengths before I mowed for the first time:   I assumed this was because I had waited too long to mow my lawn (truthfully, I did). However, after mowing for the first time I noticed these grass patches were yellowish:   After reading online it seems like if your grass is too yellow after mowing it means you cut it too low, but the rest of my lawn is perfectly fine, so that leads me to believe that this grass is something that shouldn't be there.  Should I dig these patches up and re-seed? If not, how should I deal with these? "

There is one nursery which grows and keeps everything inside a greenhouse all the time.

Is there a risk if those plants are planted outside directly? "
4270,What's wrong with my chili bush?,"I've had a chili bush I grew from seed for about a year now, and it's finally growing into something resembling an actual bush (rather than just a seedling) and it was going great until the last few weeks.  The new leaves are starting to kind of crinkle, and the most recent new shoots look as though they're dying entirely.  In spite of this it's bravely trying to grow a pepper on it!  But yeah - couldn't see any pests (other than the stupid things that ate the leaves further down the plant a month or so ago which are no longer affecting it) so am I looking at bacteria, fungus, virus, or deficiency here? Or something else?!  Location: Brisbane, Australia. It's late Summer here. Soil is clay, although clay breaker has been used occasionally on it, and the grass nearby has been fertilised recently.  Here's some pics in case it helps:     EDIT: Accepting diagnosis answers is tougher than I envisaged!  So, since originally posting this, I refertilized (herb/veggie fertilizer) which seemed to only very slightly help. Then, we had a cyclone, which dumped 150+mm of rain onto the soil, which also helped a bit, then I cleared the grass in a 50cm diameter circle away from the base, added weed control sheeting, topped with a little new soil, and fertilized with some stuff that had higher calcium concentrations in it than most fertilizer. Result is:    Doesn't look completely better, but seems a lot less unhappy. So it's really hard to tell which of the three things it was that made the most difference, and I won't really know unless the plant starts to get worse again. As it is, it seems like the new shoots are much less curled (but not completely flat) so... yeah. Here's a pic of the whole bush showing the base etc:    EDIT: Latest pics after drenching in eco oil and pyrethrum a week or so ago.  As of last week, this is what the worst affected parts of the plant were starting to look like:    I finally tried absolutely drenching the plant in eco oil and pyrethrum (both sides of all the leaves, all trunk/stem surfaces... to the point it was dripping liberally off onto the ground underneath it.) A week or so later, it started to look like it was throwing out new leaves and these weren't affected, so I trimmed off the older damaged foliage etc, and this is now the result:    It... certainly is very suggestive that it might have been a pest that was not easily seen... will wait to make sure it's still on the right track, but all things going well I'd say this will finally get a resolution in a few weeks or so... capsid guy is looking good so far :)  EDIT: update after a year of trying to nail this persistent sucker.  So my latest update to this is that none of the above appears to have made a lasting difference. After a lot of reading up and experimenting over the year I'm almost certain now that this is a virus, and I suspect it is spread by midges or similar. Spraying with white oil and pyrethrum not just on the chili bush but also on surrounding grass, plants, vegetation, and weed reservoirs appears to dramatically slow the spread of the disease from reaching new plants, but you need to keep applying the spray every two to four weeks or it wears off and the bugs come back, and then a few weeks later so does the curl.  If you give it fertilizer and make it generally happy with water and light and warmth etc it seems to be able to outgrow small infections reasonably well, but once it starts to get too infected you have to basically kill it and burn the bush to prevent spreads. The bush in the images above is now sadly cut off to the ground and burnt, though the stump has started to sprout some leaves so we'll see if the below-ground portion is okay or not.  The Bhut Jolokia and Butch T chili plants I also grow are also possibly to be affected by the virus, but not as strongly. "
4271,What are the disadvantages of using wood mulch as a cover?,"I see more and more wood mulch along the roads, around houses, etc.      At first thought it seemed a good thing to me, because it allows lots of life to grow around, while not releasing a lot of CO2 into the air -- apart from burning fumes which can be horrible to neighbours.  But are there disadvantages with this technique?   First thing which I think might be wrong, is if a large pile produces methane while decomposing. The greenhouse impact would then be a concern. Second, if I spread wood mulch around my salad greens in the garden, is it an issue for the edible properties of the little ones? Could it add too much sulphur to the soil for example? And would this make my vegetables inedible or toxic? I heard it could also be harmful to germinating seeds. Is this remotely true? Are there any other disadvantages you might think of?  "
4272,Can't bacteria enter the tree even after a proper prune cut?,"I am now aware of the 3 cut method of pruning the tree to avoid damaging the bark. I am at the brink of loosing a tree because of bad pruning and not noticing that.  Now this may sound a silly question but I can't understand this that when we cut the tree even using the 3 cut method, a proper cut. The circular area that is left wide open revealing the inside of the tree after a proper cut, can't the bacteria or other disease enter through that anyway ? Or people cover or use some chemical on that to avoid bacteria from entering from that area.  I mean like this circular open area after a proper cut    How can bacteria enter from a damaged bark but not from this ? "
4273,Why are mushrooms growing from the base of my potted avocado tree?,"My avocado tree was doing fine, until I noticed it begin to wilt, although her sister was doing fine.  I didn't know what fertilizers to give it first, but later I noticed mushrooms growing at its roots. They are what's making it wilt.

4274,Are yellow ladybugs a threat to tomato plants?,I have a tomato plant in a large planter. I spotted several yellow lady bugs on the leaves as I was pruning the plant. The plant seems to be doing very well in the fall so far.   I was a bit curious as to what they were. I've never seen yellow ladybugs. I also don't know much about insects. I did notice some of the leaves had holes in them. I presume that's from insects eating on my plant.  I did a quick google search which indicates that they might possibly be beneficial for tomato plants. I wanted to confirm this. Are yellow ladybugs helpful for tomato plants? Are they any different from regular red ladybugs?

4276,Should I be worried about this leaf residue?,"I recently bought a bonsai tree, and today I noticed a white residue on one of the leaves (see photo). Is this some kind of normal plant thing, or is it a disease or fungus that I need to deal with?  Some context in case it matters:   The tree sits in a window that gets a little bit of sunlight (best I could do), with a grow light hanging over it. I watered it five days ago and have checked the soil daily since, but it hasn't seemed dry enough to warrant further watering. (Could I have overwatered it on that one shot?) It's a fig tree of some kind.    "

4279,Advice on planting a bed of wildflowers on a hillside in zone 7?,"I know almost nothing about gardening and landscaping so I can really use some advice. In our backyard we had a hillside that was covered with ivy and weeds for years. I finally had it cleared this week and I plan to seed it with wildflower seeds in an effort to draw butterflies and hummingbirds. I haven't measured but I would guess it's about 50' long by 20' deep, and it faces south.  Right now the hillside is just muddy dirt. There's a bit of tree cover overhead, so about half of the hill will be partial shade, the other half will be full sun. The soil is dark brown so I assume it's good for planting.  So I have a few questions for anyone willing to help out:   how should I 'plant' the seeds? should I just toss them around and rake them in? when should I 'plant' the seeds? do they need to sit in the cold dirt for a few weeks to be 'activated'? or should I just plant them when I'm ready for them to grow (this spring)? I see on the website where I'm going to order the seeds, the various species have a 'spacing' - usually something like 18"". Does this mean I'm supposed to put down one seed per 18""? that seems strange, I want the hillside to be covered in wildflowers any suggestions on keeping the weeds and ivy from returning? it was cleared using hand tools so I suspect roots etc are waiting to regrow as soon as the weather warms up. the website I'm ordering from has flower seeds which I can purchase individually, but they also have pre-packaged bundles of various flowers. That seems nice but I was surprised to see the bundle I want (for attracting hummingbirds and butterflies) is 50% grass. Is this wild grass somehow beneficial? should I go for that, or just put down 100% flower seeds? any suggestions on types of wildflowers? Right now my list is:     Garden phlox (Phlox paniculata) Blanket flower (Gaillardia) cardinal flower (Lobelia cardinalis) Butterfly Weed (Asclepias tuberosa) Aster novae-angliae (New England Aster) Echinacea purpurea (Purple Coneflower)  Rudbeckia fulgida (Orange Coneflower)  Monarda didyma (Red Bee Balm)  Aquilegia canadensis (Wild Columbine)  Salvia coccinea (Scarlet Sage) Salvia farinacea (Blue Sage)    "

4281,Is painting a lawn/garden border a good idea?,"My lawn goes up to my garden bed with a concrete border between. I looks something like this.    But the plain concrete looks ... bad, just bad. I'm thinking about slapping a coat of paint on it, maybe a nice grey or brown colour.  The thing is, I often mow over it and use a mechanical edger. I think I would scratch up the paint. I don't know if scratched up paint work would look worse than unpainted concrete.  My questions are:   Will it get all scratched up if I mow and edge up to it?   If it does, will it look bad?   Does anyone have painted concrete garden borders?    How do they look when you mow over them?   "

4285,Sub-irrigation planter bucket setup,"After doing some research around sub-irrigation I think I've come up with a cheap method of creating a SIP pot (the 20L pails are expensive in Aus)   9.3L Bucket ~40cm length of 2"" Corrugated Drain Pipe  ~30cm length of 13mm rigid hose     The rigid hose will be trimmed and a short section used to provide the overfill drain (level with the top of the corrugated pipe, through the bucket wall), the remaining long section will be used to feed water into the drain pipe in the bottom.  The space in the centre of the corrugated pipe will be filled with gravel (slightly lower height than the drain pipe) and shade cloth layered over this.  A mix of 5-1-1 Pine bark - peat - perlite (with some fertilizer and lime depending on the plant) will fill the space above the shade cloth. The surface will probably be covered in straw mulch  Before I go plant 20-30 of these, I'd be keen to know;   Recommended amount of gravel? level with overfill pipe? half the height of the corrugated pipe (to allow more moisture wicking)? I'm also planning on using builder's plastic sheeting in the bottom of regular pots to block the drain holes, any recommendation as to whether just to line to above the water level, or the entire pot?  "
4286,When to harvest chilis? What happens if I don't? How can I store them?,"My last chili experiment was some 5 years ago, when the dried results started to use up. So I went to buy 2 chili plants (habanero &amp; jalapeno, both F1 hybrids) this European spring - and the results are overwhelming: I have some 15-20 Jalapeno fruits and 30-40 Habaneros still on the plants, all ripe as far as I can tell. This is far more than I expected or can use now, so my questions are:   Should I harvest them now? If I don't, will they start to rot? If I harvest them all, what's the best way to store them?   Apparently I prefer drying them up and making chili powder, but I can't remember how I dried them without them starting to rot. "
4287,How to kill existing ground cover and then replant,"I reside in Southern CA.  2 years ago I removed all the rock landscaping and planted African Daisy.  There now is a non-broadleaf reed that to my knowledge is a weed growing in the ground cover. I have a drip system installed and cannot use any garden tools to remove or dig up the reeds.  How can I quickly kill off all the vegetation and replant without time delay?  It is my understanding that RoundUp will not kill this reed.  The property is going to be sold soon.  I was considering just laying down a thick layer of bark and letting the next buyer select the plants of their choice.  Can bark be laid over the groundcover?    This is certainly a ""reed"".  There is a pond a couple miles from here.  Neighbors do not have it.  Previously I was watering 5 minutes daily with the drip system only.  The reed grows in wet or dry conditions.  Only about 10-15 plants are in this 20 by 40 ft. area; however it has destroyed the appearance of the yard.  The drip system layout prohibits simply temporarily removing the system to use a weed wacker.  I have previously had excellent luck with the African Daisy choking out weeds.  This is my first time the Daisy failed me.  Because the property will be sold in a few months I don't want to invest much money in the yard.  The yard will not sell the property.  At least by laying down the bark or mulch will not disturb the drip system and the next occupant can plant in amongst the bark.  Thank you for the comprehensive answer to resolve this problem.  Locating the drip system tubing that is above ground would be almost impossible.  The description of the reed is--fluffy round green top with definite seeds; tall stem; and a base of wide thick grass growing in a ball.  The stem is resistant to cutting.  Several weeks ago I used scissors to cut the ground cover within an inch or two from the ground hoping to hide the reed.  I am not satisfied with the appearance and felt the thick layer of bark would be more effective.  I also know that killing vegetation involves more then just spraying with a high strength Herbicide.  The ground must then be covered with plastic; then the waiting time for the vegetation to die and the soil to return to the proper PH for re-planting.  Soil additives are also needed.  I just don't have the time to wait for all of this.  African Daisy should not be cut because the plant self-levels itself yearly.  However, these plants are too young to self-level. "
4288,Why are my Freesias sprouting in the fall?,"I bought some Freesias in the spring last year and planted them in a wooden planter. All spring and summer, I didn't see any signs of life, even though they got watered regularly.  Then in the fall of last year, they started to grow.  They stayed green all winter, probably because (a) I had them on my porch, and (b) it was a mild winter here.  They flowered in the spring this year as expected, then died down.  It's now October and they're sprouting again!    We had cool and wet springs here both years, but the summers were very different: last year stayed cool for most of the summer, while this year was warm and the good weather lasted until early October.  Why would they be doing this?  Is there anything that I can do to get them on a normal ""grow in spring"" schedule?  And since I can't count on another mild winter, what can I do to protect them (the planter is a bit too big and outdoorsy to be taken indoors)? "
4289,Should I have added dead leaves directly to my garden?,With all the fallen leaves that were on our field I picked them up with my lawnmower with the pouch and them put that in my garden and worked the rototiller afterwards.

I'm just wondering how best to care for them over the winter? (in the UK midlands)  This RHS article doesn't mention pruning them back to the ground (or at all), so should I just leave them to look after themselves, or would some pruning protect and / or promote more growth next year?   Any other tips on keeping them happy and flowering would be appreciated.  Thanks, Ted "
4292,Fixing wheel tracks on lawn,"Ok, I had 60yo oak taken down on my back yard. Not sure how to do it properly without damage but guys drove bucket truck and:   Got stuck - there is 1+ft holes in a ground below topsoil While driving into yard and back left about 6 inch deep tracks in lawn. Bunch of holes left from chunks falling down.   I was fine with holes from falling limbs, not a biggie to fix but got really disappointed with those tracks. I have not clue how to fix it. It looks like this on a ground:    Those tracks go for long way (I have .7 acre and it is on backyard). I can imagine how local damages can be worked but long imprints from driving on it?

4295,Does a sprinkler system by a house attract termites?,"Does a sprinkler system by the foundation of a house attract subterranean termites up into the house?

4296,"When can bokashi be considered ""compost""?","Every now and then I come across an answer here that suggests ""adding a bit of compost"" to a plant - eg. for example to help it bounce back from an injury.  I'm composting using a bokashi bin in my kitchen which, when full, has its contents buried in a hole in the backyard.  Is this considered compost at the stage of burying? Or should it be left in the ground and then dug up after a certain time (how long?) before it could be safely added to a plant? "
4297,Can a newspaper layer underneath mulch be harmful to trees,"To help control weeds in garden beds between my plants I have put newspapers down on the ground and added a layer of mulch over this.   I have also done this where there are trees in the garden beds (an Autumn Blaze maple and a Japanese Lilac).  I am wondering if it was a good idea after all when it comes to the trees.   As well as making fertilizing more difficult, I'm afraid that the additional layer of newspaper will prevent some water and nutrients from going into the ground and may restrict oxygen going down to the roots.  Should I remove the newspaper layer? Could it be detrimental to the trees? "
4298,"To be effective, how long does Glyphosate weed killer need to be applied before it rains?",Yesterday I used around 3 litres (approximately 1 gallon) of glyphosate (generic Roundup) around my garden. It was in the evening around 6pm.   This morning I awoke to the sound of rain. Will the rain have diluted the glyphosate or will my weeds die?  To make this more generic:   To be 100% effective how long before rain should I poison?  
4299,Plausible explanation for abrupt total disappearance of balsam?,"Impatiens glandulifera Himalayan balsam is considered a nuisance by some (eg a ""prohibited noxious weed"" under the Alberta Weed Control Act 2010) but it is colourful and the explosive pods are quite fun, ejecting seeds up to 7 metres (23 feet)† . Wikipedia mentions:     ordinary people could buy them for the cost of a packet of seeds to rival the expensive orchids grown in the greenhouses of the rich.   A specimen was introduced half a century ago to a river bank in a temperate climate where it established itself quite thoroughly in a few years, thrived for about a decade, grew rampant for a decade or so and then disappeared quite abruptly, a decade or two back.   Image courtesy Mick Lobb  During its most prolific spell it was also rampant a few miles downstream but disappeared from there at about the same time. While there may have been attempts to eradicate it downstream no such efforts were made in the location where it was introduced.  I gather flooding is likely to kill it off, though I happen to doubt that was the 'solution' even downstream (The seedbank lasts for approximately 18 months, so two years’ control should eradicate the plant) because I don't recall floods in successive years. It was certainly not the case upstream, where weirs control the water level.  Decrease in eutrophication/hypertrophication has been suggested as a possible control mechanism (ie, reduce nutrients to give local, adapted vegetation a better chance to compete). It seems a possible cause of the demise, as the stream flows through agricultural land and there had been some sewage leakage into it around the time of the rampant phase. However I am not aware of water quality tests from that time and the water is too well churned and aerated to show telltale signs of phytoplankton.  There is also 'the usual suspect', global warming. With its origin in the Himalayas perhaps the climate has warmed enough in half a century that temperatures no longer suit the plant. I doubt this however as the climate in Cornwall for example is likely warmer and growth there has been vigorous.  The Centre for Agriculture and Biosciences International has released rust fungus in some areas, to control ""policeman's helmet"". I don't know how to detect whether that is present but have not noticed any indication.  I am not planning to reintroduce a specimen but am wondering what happened. Are there possibilities I have not considered (maybe a couple of successive very cold winters?) or does any one of those I have mentioned seem the most plausible culprit?  † May be seen doing so on Wikipedia.

4300,Laying down Fescue sod in North Carolina in Late October. good idea?,"I just scheduled a pallet of Fescue sod to delivered to my home for Wednesday.

4303,How to eradicate bamboo from suburban SFH?,"My question, about eradicating bamboo, is similar to this one but that asker said his landscape is large, at 1-acre, and hillside in Oregon. I live in a single family home with a property footprint of 3300ish sq. ft.  I live in Orange County in southern California, so the climate is mostly dry, quite hot in summer, and mild winters with 2 or 3 months of rain in winter. I'm a first-time homeowner, and disheartened that the bamboo that the previous owner planted seems to have spread invasively. It was planted in our back patio, which is mostly covered with a thick 8-ish inch single-piece of slab (not individual tiles) with small openings around some of the edges, seemingly for small pockets of plants. The bamboo was planted in one of these openings. Although I knew bamboo spread invasively, I took no action, stupidly hoping that it'd just behave by itself thinking that the previous owners knew what they were doing and wouldn't plant anything with destructive/invasive potential. One year later (this year), I noticed bamboo sprouting up from some of the openings away from the original planting site, meaning the roots had spread around possibly under the slab. A few weekends ago, I uprooted the bamboo from the original planting site, pulling out lots of the roots that had indeed spread away from there. But I couldn't work on those that had spread outside my property or under the slab. I thought I'd done a good job because I'd pulled out so much of those roots. But now a few weeks later, I see more shoots popping up.  I'm disheartened because I think now that nothing less than 100% eradication can eliminate the invasive spread. Is there any specific advice the community can offer? Should I call a landscaping company to take care of this? Is ""bamboo removal"" a service they typically provide? Or should I use some form of herbicide over all the soil patches where I don't want the bamboo anymore? Or should I stop watering for several weeks (or however long)? Or must I resign myself to recurring battles with newly-rising shoots every few weeks? I'm not (yet) worried about the bamboo shoots damaging my floor or anything like that; I just hate the idea of an invasive plant running roughshod through my property, potential damage it could cause, hurting the home's resale value, and the ongoing maintenance, etc.  I'm open to, and grateful for, any/creative ideas. Thank you.  Update:  Thank you to commenters and answerer. Updated with pictures.  It's been a couple weeks since my original post (sorry for the delay, to those requesting pictures). Since then, shoots have started coming up in new locations; I can't help but anthropomorphize this bamboo, which makes me think the bamboo is getting ""panicked"" or ""desperate"" now that the original planting site has been dug out - which also makes me think of John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" when the creature went crazy after it'd been found out. I've tried to be diligent by ripping out these new shoots and as much of the rhizome system as possible - but again, the ""floor""/""slab"" (see pictures) is just too big and thick for me to attempt getting to the rhizome system that's traveled underneath it. I haven't yet, but I will search out glyphosate, as suggested by answerer @stormy below.  One worrisome aspect is that the bamboo has spread outside my property, i.e. under/outside my fence...so even if I maintain/eradicate the bamboo from within my property, I'm worried that the rhizome system that's gone outside my fence could spread back in...meaning this could end up being an unending cycle of the rhizome system spreading in and out and in and out of my property. Sigh.  Sorry again for the delay between original posting and update, but if these new pictures inspire new thoughts/suggestions, I'm grateful for them.       "
4304,What is damaging my pepper plant?,"I noticed about 4 days ago that leaves on one of my peppers got soft and started to hang down a little. I thought that it just needs some water so i watered it along with my 2 other peppers. Today the same pepper looks like it again needs more water, while the other 2 are in pretty much good shape. I inspected the plant and found out that a lot of leaves from its top half are completely dry and basically dead. The rest of them is either normal (young and small leaves look the best) or seems to be attacked by an insect (or a disease?) i can't identify by myself.    Attacked leaves can have small dry areas and strange little spots on them (maybe eggs of an insect):   And others look like they have been bitten (backlight for better visibility):   I have also noticed one tiny white/yellow bug walking on the plant. I couldn't take a clear picture of it, because it was to small.    Are these symptoms caused by an insect or is it a disease? If it is an insect, how can i get rid of it?

4308,Spots on marigold leaves,"I was sprouting some French marigolds and noticed some spots on the leaves. They didn't look good, especially since one of the plants didn't get them. I looked them out on the internet and figured it was some kind of leaf spot (though I don't know anything beyond that). Figuring it might have been because of being overly damp, I planted a second set except I started them outside (also in a seeding tray). I just checked them today and it looks like the cotyledons are starting to show signs of the spots along the outer edges though I won't for sure for a couple days. None of the other plants I sprouted with the same potting mix are showing any problems like this. The variety is Disco if that helps at all.  So a couple questions:   What are these spots and are they a problem? What can be done to prevent them? Should I give up on them and root them up? Will I be able to reuse the potting mix, or should I get rid of it too?    "

4320,Air pruning versus oxygenating,"I read about how air pruning can help your roots, because it stops the roots from growing when they reach the edge of the pot.  I also read that roots need oxygen in their soil, in order to breath.    Can someone give me an explanation as to why in one case, air stops the roots from growing, but in the other case, air is good for the roots?    My guess is that air pruning stops roots because of the ""dryness"" of the air, and it's not the actual ""air"" that's stopping the growth?   "
4321,How to propagate a hedge?,"I've got a whole yard of Amur Privet that hasn't been taken care of for quite some time. (I've newly moved in). Over about a year I've cut down and cared for my privets. There are a few low areas and very thin areas. How do I propagate them? I've tried trimming off pieces, putting them in rooting compound and trying to get them going that way with no luck whatsoever.  Any help at all would be great. "

4325,What to guild with Asparagus,"I have been working on applying permacultural techniques of layering in space and time, and most of my gardens work well on this principle but I am having trouble applying it to asparagus. What should I plant around my asparagus to reduce exposed soil and improve fertility?  I have done some research and found a lot of people seem to say that asparagus should be grown alone, but this poses weeding and soil fertility problems I would rather avoid long-term. So, how can I apply permacultural techniques to the growing of asparagus?  Asking here because it was declared off-topic on sustainability.se.com.  Note: I'm in Eastern Washington State, relatively dry, hot in the summer, cold in the winter, moderately growing season. "
4326,cottonwood bonsai?,"I am new to bonsai in fact, I have no bonsai tree's over the age of about 1 month. Funny, in my attempt to grow a Japanese Katsura from seed I had left one of my seeding pots outside. I came out to bring it back inside and saw a load of cotton seed stuck to it as the stuff was very prevalent in the wind that day. I picked it all off (or thought I did) and about 2 days later I noticed a little sprout. I almost pulled it but then I thought... what the heck, and I transplanted it into its own container.  So, now I have a little cottonwood tree sprout growing and I think I want to try and make it into a bonsai. So my question is:  Has anyone here made a cottonwood bonsai before and if so, any tips? Also, how long should I wait to plant this outside and how long should it stay there growing?  Some info:  USDA growing zone: 4b-5a  The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is ""Dfb"". (Warm Summer Continental Climate).  The average temperature for the year in Bozeman is 41.0°F (5°C). The warmest month, on average, is July with an average temperature of 65.0°F (18.3°C).

The lowest recorded temperature in Bozeman is -46.0°F (-43.3°C), which was recorded in January. "
4327,Brown turkey fig dormancy time,We picked up a brown turkey fig tree last summer. We plan on keeping it in a large pot rather than in the ground. We have a small space and understand they have a good sized root system. Plus we live in an iffy area for this tree when it comes to overnight lows (Kootenays in BC Canada).   At the end of year wrap up we brought it inside rather than protecting it outside. The location it's been in has not allowed the tree to go dormant and instead it's growing...too well!  My question is what should we do to give it the best chance this summer? Did we harm its year? Should we prune it now and get it outside (slowly) to give it some cold time? Or let it be and just move it out in when it's warm?

4332,"Pest, etiolation, soil or overwatering? Other causes of pale-brown tips in Aloe Vera","A friend has just given me an Aloe Vera with pale brown tips. Different sources  have lead me to multiple non-conclusive possible causes; mainly: pests, etiolation, wrong type of soil or overwatering...  ""The Guide for House Plants"", for example, warns that brown stains and seeing insects are a sign of pest or disease (I saw a small insect that looked like a black aphid but haven't seen it again)  On the other hand, the post ""Why are my aloe leaves turning white and brown?"" here in Stackexchange, points to etiolation as the cause of this, mainly because the center steam is somewhat pale. Yet, in my case, the pale part is mostly covered by the soil.       Moreover, the soil of my plant looks dark and peat-like rather than ""desert-like"" (which would drain faster), and it also looks pretty soaked. My friend told me she watered it yesterday and that she did it about each 3 weeks (when the soil looked totally dry), pouring about half a glass of water into it. It doesn't sound enough for a 20cm radius pot (near 8 inches) but I could introduce my finger almost through the bottom and it is all wet. So it might have been overwatered... (?)   I'm not able to reach a conclusion and obviously the treatment for each of the causes would be different...  Is there any way to nail down the cause?  "
4333,Growing Goji berry plant in Ohio,I am entertaining the idea of growing a Goji berry plant in my backyard.  I have several fruit trees already and have good soil conditions.  The plant would be permanently outdoors and would not be brought in during the winter.  I live in Northeast Ohio (Zone 6) and so winters can get a little harsh.     Can Goji berry plants survive an Ohio winter? Does anything special need to be done to winterize them? Is there any kind of special soil prep or maintenance that should be done? Is this plant a complete waste of time?  ;)  
4334,How much dirt can I put on pine tree roots?,"How much dirt can I safely add on top of an established pine tree's roots without harming the tree?  I want to add berming for landscape interest around and near the pine, which is 29 years old so rather large. [Edit]  If I add a mound of dirt in a few small areas near the drip line - just enough to tuck in a few young plants, not over the entire root area -  do you think that would cause any problems with the tree? I'm talking about a 2' diameter planting in a couple of spots near the edge of the root area which is 22' in diameter.  Also want to place a few 1to 2 foot rocks here and there within the drip line, would that be an issue? Thanks for your input! "
4335,Do I need to roll the lawn?,"My backyard has a turf since 2 years ago, when this model home has been built. However, I think the lawn has not been rolled, as when I walk around the soil is very loose, which I think has led to a very improper growth of the lawn. Do I need to roll it now in the spring and does it work after 2 years? If so, does a 200lb hand roller work? any more idea? "

4338,Reforestation in my town,"Recently, I saw a video about reforestation in Thailand by dropping millions of seed bombs and thought about doing something similar in my own area (at least to start with).  I have zero knowledge about gardening... But I would like to take an initiative about growing more trees.  Why do I want to grow trees? It feels right.   I really like nature and the life-cycle of different animals. One animal eats another animal. Those animals eat plants. Plant grows flowers. Some bees rely on flowers. Some plants become trees. Birds build their nests on trees. And we chop those trees for our bed and furniture. I'm not against the use of furniture, but we should at least grow more trees to meet our need. When I go to my office, I see people walking on footpaths under 35-40 degree Celsius (sometimes it touches 45). There is no shade. Many people died from heat stroke last year in my city. Providing shade to pedestrian helps.   So I need expert advice on how I can help my community. What sort of seeds would I need to buy and plant in my neighborhood. And anything else I need to know?  I live in Karachi, Pakistan. "
4339,How can I renew a Dieffenbachia that has lost all its lower leaves?,"I have two Dieffenbachia (dumb cane) plants in pots in my kitchen. One looks great, the other is struggling because I have not done a good job of keeping it watered. It has lost a lot of leaves, and now looks like two tall canes with a bunch of leaves at the top (the lower leaves all dried and have been removed). It is terribly unattractive. Is there any way to save the plant? I've read that you can cut it back, but since all of the leaves are at the top, I would be removing all of the leaves if I cut it back. I assume this would not work. Can I layer it?  "
4340,New fungus or mold on my basil plant soil,"My husband and I are new to gardening. We bought a basil plant a month or so again, and we've been cutting it and starting new plants. Today woke up to this weird mold or fungus. I can't seem to find pictures of it anywhere online, and I also can't seem to upload pics of my own. But it's pale orange/white. It kind of looks like Ritz cracker crumbs. It's in 3 separate localized areas on the soil at the base of my basil stems. We don't over water, just give it a good soaking every few days when the soil feels dry, but yesterday we had quite a rainstorm. My phone said it'd be light rain so I left the plants outside -- I had calendula growing in pots without drain holes, which flooded and I had to do ""emergency gardening"" and replant them. Is this just from too much water from one day? It's in well draining soil, and in a pot with a large hole with rocks at the bottom.  Help! Do I leave it and it'll go away once the soil becomes really dry? Or do I need to scrape it off and/or an inch or two of soil out? I sure wish I could post pics! "
4341,How much nitrogen per bale in a straw bale garden?,"I recently read a NY Times article about straw bale gardening. It says that you should add about 2 1/2 cups of 20% N fertilizer or three pounds of blood meal and feather meal per bale. Add water, wait for the temperature to decrease, and then plant.  I would really appreciate a more objective approach - but I can't find it in any of the guides (including the few instructions from ag extensions*) that I reviewed.  A typical two-string bale is 45lb with, say 10% moisture, so it has 40 lbs (18kg) of dry straw. composed of 45% C and 2% N: a carbon to nitrogen ratio of 24:1 (according to the USDA-NRCS).  What I am missing is the target range of C:N for the bale - for a mixture of vegetables (tomatoes, squash, beets, carrots) as seen in the article. Then, I could better estimate - and evaluate - what I am doing.  If I knew the target C:N ratio, and how to account for the uneven decomposition and N loss (leaching, denitrification) as well as the ""tolerance"" for over / under fertilization (i.e., the range of applications rates that would optimize food production), then I could take an arbitrary fertilizer with complete nutrition (NPK+) and have an estimate of how much to add based on the % N.  in summary, my questions are:   What is the target C:N for a straw bale garden? How much fertilizer should I add, in units of mass (g or lb) N? What is the range of values in 1 and/or 2 that would optimize mixed vegetable food production?     * for example, while the OKState extension says ""The nutrient supply for plants established in straw bales is also critical."" but gives no information on fertilization rate, only that insufficient nutrient supply can be be diagnosed (yellow leaves, unhealthy plants, etc.). "
4342,Can self-pollinating plants cross-pollinate?,"I recently purchased a top hat blueberry shrub. According to the leaflet it came with, it is self-pollinating. Does this mean that it can self-pollinate, or that it only self-pollinates? Would getting another 2-3 shrubs be beneficial at all? "
4343,Venus fly trap didn't consume its pray,"I bought a venus fly trap in my local grocery store, it had a plastic dome and a plastic pot that it was trapped in, I removed both the dome, and the pot and left it with the inner pot which has holes in the bottom. I put the plant in the lid of the dome and filled the lid with tapwater.  I feared it might starve as there aren't many bugs out yet, so I went out and caught a fly and fed it to the plant, I put the fly in one of its mouths and had it close. now several days later the mouth is opening but the bug is still there, seemingly untouched.   why won't it feed? should I be worried that it will starve?    should I try lifting the bug out and putting it into another mouth?

4344,Help identifying this vine with green and white heart shaped leaves?,"I honestly have no idea what this plant is. It seems to be some type of vine. I took a few pictures i will put below. As you can see there is some other plant growing in the same pot with the long leaves. I want to clone this vine plant eventually, it looks really nice when the vines get long. So will I be able to clone this plant? And what exactly is it?   P.S, it has no flowers as far as I have seen, this confuses me since I see no form of reproduction on it.     A cluster of leaves     A vine    More vines    A new leaf, the leaves grow out of these whitish membranse on the sides of other leaves. This leads me to believe that only one leaf can come from a single leaf.     Another new leaf growing in.     The beginning of a leaf.    An overview "
4345,What's the fastest way to dry peat before re-potting an overwatered succulent?,"I just got an Aloe Vera that was planted on peat, which can't drain the water well so it is making it suffer from overwatering (see my previous post with pics of it).   Re-potting it with more filtering/draining soil like river soil and/or anything different than peat or sea sand, is the recommended action. But I've read it is necessary to wait until the soil is dry to re-pot it.   The issue is that it was just watered 2 days ago and it might take at least 2 weeks before the soil dries, so I guess the damage could be lessened if I accelerate the drying process by something like putting the Aloe outside in the window sill for short periods; this would make it receive direct sunlight which would evaporate the water faster, but it might also burn the Aloe.  Do you think putting it outside for around 90 minutes in the morning and 90 minutes in the evening, avoiding the 12 to 4 pm period when the sun UVA UVB is stronger here in Madrid (this week would be an average of 21 Celsius degrees or 69.8 Fahrenheit), is a good idea or a bad one? Do you think it could be a good/better idea to change the length or periods of time? Do any of you have a better idea of how to dry the soil faster without damaging the plant? "
4346,Why does my weeping cherry tree have brown spots on its leaves?,"I have a 10-year old weeping cherry tree in my front yard. Last weekend I noticed that many leaves had brown spots toward the end of the branches. I trimmed those branches, but I wonder what has caused this. Is the tree sick?

4347,When to transplant spruce tree sprout from a small bucket,"I have a small sprout (30‒40 cm) of some species of spruce tree that is native (or at least welcome) to the Rocky Mountains of North America (purchased from the local Fish and Game Department’s nature centre). It is still in the small plastic bucket, and I want to transplant it in the roomier container.  When is it okay to move it? Is it too late to move it this winter (the daytime temperatures are consistently above freezing already)? When is it even normal to move perennial plants (trees) in general? I thought winter is a good time, since the plant is dormant, just like for trimming. Is it possible to move it more than once? I do not have the land to plant it in yet, but I want to move it from the medium-sized tub someday as well, would that be not much of a shock? Is there minimum time in between such moves? "
4348,Planting fruit tree after bud break,"According to the Arizona Master Gardener Manual:     The best time to plant bare root fruit trees is during the dormant period.

When I got home, most of the leaves had turned into complete jelly with 2 of them turning into jelly at their bases. I had no clue that heavy water could do this.  Is there any way to save/salvage part of the plant and replant them like my friend initially did? Or should I just give up?  "

There are many swamp oaks planted on the grounds, and in the footprint of where the twin towers stood.  The acorns were plentiful while I was there so I picked up a handful with the idea to grow my very own liberty tree from the 911 site.  I went online, learned how to get the acorn to sprout. SUCCESS!  I have 3 swamp oaks in 6 inch pots.  They are about a foot tall with anywhere from 3 to 6 leaves.  Very healthy looking leaves, but very skinny twig-like stems.  I have a grow light on them for about 8 hours a day.  My question is: What's next?  I want to plant them outside in the spring.  I've read a lot already about how to go about it, but lots of different opinions, and none for a swamp oak going in the gound in Connecticut.  Any suggestions?  What month? Soil prep?

4359,An evolution in grafting,"My question stems (pardon the pun) from two ideas:   That trees live for a very long time and that there have been many evolutions of trees in that time. It is possible to graft trees of the same genus together to form a tree composed of two different stocks.   Theoretically, if trees were held back from death, would it be possible to make a segment of trees tracking their evolution and following their ancestors?   For example, a branch of a lemon tree on the branch of the citrus ancestor tree, onto its ancestor, etc. until they reached the first tree. I think it could result in a tree that could produce every fruit of its lineage, but it's just a theory, right?  Obviously this is a purely theoretical idea, but I'm curious. Or, if it's not just a theoretical idea, and that trees could be ""brought back"" (like there are efforts for different animals). "

Feels kind of tropical.   Right now it's about 10' tall. I'm not sure if it's a bush or a tree (or if it matters).   The problem is that it was planted about 6' away from a nice Japanese Maple. So this looks rather silly at this scale next to the diminutive maple.   My question(s):   does anyone know what this is? at this size, could it be heavily pruned to encourage new growth and then maintained at a more manageable size (say 4' or so) at this size, could it be dug up and replanted somewhere else?  if it can be heavily pruned, can that be done now, or should I wait until next winter to do it?

So I'm looking around for a good solution.  I don't mind investing some time and effort, as long as the pay off is worth it.  My current thought is digging down a few inches, laying down some cardboard, pinning down some landscaping fabric, and putting a few inches of wood chips on top of that (I think I can find free wood chips from local logging operations).  A few questions:   is that overkill?  should I skip the fabric? how long can I expect this to last? would this be as weed free as I'm hoping?   And of course if you have a faster, easier, effective approach, I'd love to hear it.  Thanks. "

I measured the height of each one on a flat surface using a shortened wood paint stirrer and notched the blade at each height. The top two height levels are 3.5"" and 2.875"" respectively. I'm trying to get in between those, closer to 3"" or a tad higher than 3. Are there any ways to adjust in between these heights?

I will be doing the grading with a skid steer The rocks range in size. 8-12 inches at its smallest, and 16-24 at the largest. I live in Rockland, NY I dont know the type of soil i have, but there is rocks everywhere i dig - hence the name rockland county. I plan of replanting the slop. right now its just grass and weeds.  Thanks.      "
4370,Poor quality Lawn.,"Lawn was set 28 years ago. The lawn was planted in June and a prolonged dry period followed. Grass was slow to appear,but weeds took off immediately. I suspect that sub soil was used, rather than top soil, when the lawn was set.  In Winter or during damp summers, moss appears in most parts of the lawn. Over the years  the lawn hasn't really improved.  Grass seems to suffer greatly even after a short dry period. Should  I now take up the lawn completely and bring in new top soil,  should  I dig it up, clean off weeds, moss etc and lay new seed  again or this there a Plan C?  What is the best time of year to attempt this work?   "

4372,How to graft my 3 year old Avocado tree?,I have a 3 year old avocado tree about a meter and a half high. I planted it from a seed of an avocado I ate. I was told I need to graft it for it to hold fruit. What kind of graft should I do? What time of the year? Thank you :) 
4373,Repotting ginger in a window box,"I have a long tough box on my window which I stuck some root ginger in. The ginger was in my fridge and sprouting so I figured I'd see what happened. Fast forward a few years and it's a huge clump of root and a lot of it is above the soil level and pushing on the edge of the box. Clearly, I need to do something. In my head, I call it ""re-seating"" because that's what I'd do with PC RAM if it was not sitting right.  Anyway, the ginger is sprouting at the moment and I have three good stems already. Is this a bad time to re-seat the ginger? If so (and my guess is that this is a bad time) when is the soonest I can harvest and replant for least damage and best grow back?  Edit: (For clarity) This is a window box inside in my flat on the window. It is currently sprouting and bunched up and needs to be better planted soonish. "
4374,What extent of trunk carving is acceptable for tree health?,"I'm in central Florida, by the Atlantic. I have a few trees that would make exceptional canvases for tiki faces. What trees should I avoid? I've seen it implemented in my area, but didn't note the type of tree.   In addition, will I need to mind the depth and area of cuts to ensure the tree's health? Will coating exposed areas with paint, stain or lacquer endanger the tree long term (affect aesthetics)? "
4375,Medium you can add to soil to improve airiness and create loose soil,"I am making a list of mediums that I can use to make soil more loose and improve airiness.  Soil will be used primarily in pots. I am interested in both home made mediums and commercially available, but more in the home made ones.  Currently on the list: 1. coir 2. forest soil  What other mediums can be used?  UPDATE: I use garden soil for pots (and so far had zero diseases and pests), but I need to mix it with something to keep it loose over a long time.  What about straw? Is it okay to add it to soil? "
4376,Clay Yard Drainage Issues,"We just moved into a house with a yard that's about 45'x80' with some pretty bad drainage issues. After large rain the whole yard is water logged for days, with a few square yards where it actually pools. I think we'll need to level the yard to get rid of the low spots but before doing that I want to resolve the drainage issue. I've been reading about french drains and dry wells, but I'm not sure what the best and most cost effective solution would be.  On a somewhat dryer day I tried digging a bit to see what the soil was like and it looks like the top 10"" or so are very heavy clay. Would perhaps using a post hole auger or similar to make multiple paths through the clay be helpful? What are the steps I need to take to assess the situation?    Picture source. "
4377,Should I prune old dead sections of my rose bush while new growth is appearing at the base?,"My daughter gave me this rose bush last Mother's Day, which was exactly a year ago. It was planted in a large pot and purchased from a nursery. It's called Fragrant Plum, from this company. It grew nicely, and produced flowers in a beautiful combination of blue and purple I'd never seen before.   I trimmed the flowers throughout the summer, but never pruned the plant. Any areas that look like branches have been cut off came that way.   The plant appeared to have died during the winter, so I had given up on it, but I just found new growth way down at the base. Now I'm hoping I can save it.   The long branches that bore flowers last year appear dead. They're stiff, have no thorns, and, although one is partly green, neither shows any sign of life.    The very dark branches attached to the base do have thorns. There's even a little bit of new growth at another area where one of those branches meets the base (which I called junctions for lack of a better word), that wasn't visible when I took this picture last week, so I'm optimistic.   I think in general we're not supposed to prune shrubs during budding season, but I'm wondering if this plant is using energy to try and support the dead sections that would be better spent on the actual part that's growing.   Should I prune it now? If so, exactly where should I cut? If not now, should I prune it after blooming season, or wait until the fall when the weather turns cold?   Update: After receiving Bamboo's excellent advice, I tried twice to approach it to prune the dead growth. Each time I got close to it I acquired ticks, so I gave up! We've been watering and taking care of it as we always did. I just checked it today, June 3, 2017. Sadly, all signs of the life at the base, and everywhere else, are gone. Even the small area on the one of the branches which had been green, is now black.   Click on pictures for larger view.       "
4378,What is the best way to propogate Aralia nudicaulis (Wild Sarsaparilla)?,"I grew up with this plant covering the forest floors around my neck of the woods on Eastern Long Island, NY.  I have never seen it for sale, even at one of the many native plant nurseries we regularly buy from.   There is some information online about propagation, but it all seems fairly vague.  Has anyone grown this from seed, runner, or other means? If so, how? "
4379,How to extract nutrients from soil?,"I'm new to DIY farming and have invested in a vertical farming unit. I love the efficiency and effectiveness of these systems in providing nutrients, oxygen and water to the roots of plants in a small footprint.  The unit came with nutrients labelled A and B, which you would add ml of each to your water reservoir to make the water nutrient rich to grow tasty vegetables. This got me wondering... is it possible to extract my own plant nutrients from tons soil I have laying around?  is it possible and how would one achieve this? "
4380,"When to cut chives for drying, and can I separate them?","Should I wait until my chives have bloomed to cut them for or can I cut them anytime? Will the taste be different? I'm growing them in a small terracotta pot inside. They're small but I read online to snip them when they're about 8"" tall, and they're about that.  Also, this is a pod of 4 bulbs. Should I separate them? And will separating them help growth? Or a bigger pot (included a yard stick for size reference in pic). Some plants don't handle damage to roots very well, and I'm an amateur to edible gardening.     "
4381,New leaves from mango seedling are drying up and dying off but the plant is still growing,"I started some mango plants from seed and after a few weeks they're slowly growing. However, now that each plant has a new leaf or two, I've noticed that some of the newer leaves are drying up and falling off before they even get a chance to open up. The main stem is still producing new plant material so the plant isn't dying? Is it that the bigger leaves are sucking up all the nutrients or is it something else?   "
4382,Dwarf citrus Meyer lemon pot size,"I was given a lemon tree (pictured) which is about 1.2 metres tall. It's currently in small yellow pot depicted that has edges of approximately 16cm in length.    Ultimately I want to plant it in my garden, but I can't do that for about 10 months because the property is about to be renovated.   I know that lemon trees can do well in pots indefinitely, but is my current pot too small for the 10 month storage   I have a larger pot which is about 40cm in diameter. Should I transfer the plant from the small pot to the large pot, and then (in 10 months) to my garden? I was worried that multiple transfers would increase the chances that the plant would die.  Are there other factors that I should hold in mind? For example, my larger pot does not have drainage. "
4383,Measuring Photosynthetically Active Radiation with inexpensive sensors,I am looking to read the Photosynthetically Active Radiation in my grow area and I was curious if there is a way to do this without a PAR sensor?

Any advice on how to calculate PAR using something like an Arduino and some inexpensive sensors would be amazing! 
4384,Growing bitter melon or karela?,"I live near Vancouver, Canada, USDA zone 8a. Our summers are fairly mild, only becoming consistently hot from mid-July to end of August and maybe the beginning of September. I want to grow karela (the warty Indian bitter melon) or the Chinese bitter melon (smoother and larger). I have no idea whether the hotter part of our growing season is long enough.  I've saved some ripe seeds from some karela and I have 3 plants started - about 2-3 inches tall now. They're right against a south-facing window. I know a trick to get heat-loving vegetables to grow well in a garden and plan to use it. What I need to know, though, is how long from planting till the plant will set fruit. Like other Cucurbits, the first flowers will only be male.  Has anyone grown karela or bitter melon in this area and been successful? If you have, could you please share any info that could help me?

4385,What studies / evidence is there that Bokashi tea actually has extra nutritions for plants?,"So I've recently started bokashi bucket composting and I'm really enjoying it as it's an easy way to compost indoors.   The bokashi bucket also provides bokashi tea every couple of days and lots of places on the Internet and also even in the instruction manual of the bokashi bucket says that this liquid contains lots of good stuff for your plants provided it is diluted adequately as it's quite acidic.  However, I've just read an article ([website]  It contains 0.05% calcium, 0.14% potassium and 0.01% magnesium,   indicating low levels of nutrients. After diluting it by 100 it is   essentially water.   I thought this was an interesting claim. So I'm just wondering, is there actually any evidence that bokashi tea is any better than water or is it just conventional wisdom that just seems to make sense but hasn't actually been proven? Has anyone used bokashi tea and found it works? I just ask because the tea apparently has other uses as well so if it's not good for the garden, I might as well use it for other purposes. "
4386,What is the most efficient drip system setup for irrigating a tree in the desert?,"What is the most efficient (i.e., least water lost due to evaporation) drip system setup for irrigating a tree in the desert?  I've seen some elaborate setups, like this:    But having it above-ground like this would seem to result in a lot of water loss via evaporation.   I've also seen soaker hose setups laid out in a spiral.  Or this:   This chart shows how many emitters I need:   However, can I get by with only a half-dozen or so emitters per tree, and just water longer? Should the emitter tubes be buried in the ground, or should they should poke into the ground?  Would this be good?:  "
4387,Does moss require darkness?,"Everybody knows that plants need light for photosynthesis, to grow and remain healthy; but do they require (or benefit from) sleep/darkness; or can they be bathed in light 24/7?  I'm not talking about a need to shelter from the weather, UV &amp; IR radiation, etc. Just the visible light spectrum.  For instance: I have some moss growing indoors, under a bright LED light. Is it okay to leave it on constantly, to maximize growth; or should I rotate 12 hour shifts? "
4388,Do purple leafs of tomato return to normal state?,"I've got few tomato plants in the glassy room with lots of light. The temepartures dropped significantly over the last weeks from 25°C to -5. The room T where I kept the tomatoes could fall below 15°C, but I am pretty sure if was above 10. Tomatoes had a little purple dots on the leaves. That dots got substantially larger over the last 2 weeks, although the room T is above 15° all the time. Also the leaves have purple veins and the stems are also purple. So I added a fertilizer containing phosphorus.  Does the purple leaves, veins and stems ever return to normal green color? How bad do you think is the condition of my plant?

4396,What causes tomato plants to bear large fruit?,"Of course I know that some tomato varieties yield bigger tomatoes than others, but on a given plant, some of the fruits are bigger and some are smaller, so I am just wondering: Besides variety, what factors determine the size of a tomato (fruit)?  E.g.: Abundant water before they start to turn color swells them up? Abundant sun makes them ripen too fast before they get big? Hot weather? Fruit late in the season bigger or maybe smaller? Too many tomatoes on the plant makes them smaller? I'm sure there are plenty other possible reasons as well. "
4397,What is considered a low maintenance lawn for the north east?,"I've been reading a lot about types of lawn seed and lawn maintenance. It seems like KBG, ryegrass, and tall/fine fescue are the most common blends in the north east. It seems some are better for certain conditions over others. For example: full sun, full shade, sun and shade, etc.  What is the actual definition of a low maintenance lawn? Does that mean a lawn that you have to cut less? One that you have to water less? Or one you have to fertilize less? Or, all the the above?  Based on that definition, what is a blend of type of seed that falls into this definition of low maintenance for the northeast? Is it a specific type of seed or a combination blend of two? I am asking regardless of my conditions (sun, shade, or both), I just want to know what a low maintenance lawn means under the conditions that it can thrive correctly so I understand. I have neighbors near me that seem to rarely water and cut their lawns yet they are nice and green, well filled in, and not overgrown. Yet I seem to have lawn that grows fast and needs to be cut more frequently. "

4399,Watering plants with soaked forest soil,"I am thinking of mixing forest soil with water and water plants with that.  I was hoping that nutrients from soil would get released into the water, so in effect, fertilize the soil.  I am not aware in what chemicals P, K, Ca, Mg is ""stored"" in forest soil. My guess is that it is oxides and that it should dissolve rapidly.  So, overall, is it beneficial to the plant to water them with water in which forest soil was dispersed? Have anyone tried that? How long did you stir the solution of soil and water?  Plant in question are tomatoes, peppers. "

4401,When to mow overseeded penncross grass,"I have a small yard, about 450 square feet, that I have seeded with Penncross Creeping Bentgrass. I used seed. This is the second year and I overseeded this year because I had a few spots I damaged with liquid fertilizer that was too strong (hot).   I have new grass growing in the ares of need and some in the among the existing grass. I've used guide from Penncross on Seedland and it works great for general information. I am struggling to figure out when I should mow the lawn. For new lawn I've found several links that say 30 days is when you can expect to mow. I'm concerned if I wait too long that the existing grass will grow tall and choke out the new seedlings. So my question is, when can I start to mow my overseeded lawn that is overseeded with Penncross Creeping Bentgrass?  I use a manual reel mower and I usually mow at a height of 3/4"". After 14 days I have seed that has germinated and I have some existing grass that is over 3"" tall. I feel like the tall grass needs to be tamed so the Penncross can thrive and fully take over. Then maybe I can start to cut this stuff down near 3/16"" and practice my putting :). "
4402,Red Anthurium leaf damage and how to encourage blooms,I have had this red anthurium for 5 years and I was wondering if there is a way to make it bloom more.

4403,Raised beds border - made of a dry stone wall,"I find myself in the situation where I need to redo my raised vegetables and strawberry beds. I read What is a good alternative to pressure treated wood for raised beds? and Do chemicals leach from the sides of raised beds? which are excellent references and I was about to go with wood.  However, I have a huge heap of natural rocks (Griftstone and kind of granite and some others) which I got for creating, at some point in time, a dry stone wall in my garden which is a long slope.  I'm now wondering if I could use especially the griftstones to make a border of my raised beds. My main doubt is that the wall won't be closed. By definition there are holes and I'm afraid that water will dissolve the soil with time.  What do you think? "
4404,Placing nitrogen fixers around established trees?,"I have several young (1-4 years old) fruit trees and am considering planting nitrogen fixers around/underneath:   white clover (ground cover) lupine (herb layer) siberian pea shrub (shrub layer)   It seems intuitive that the N-fixers will only provide a benefit as far as their roots extend.  I don't want to damage the tree roots by digging too close. I think the tree roots will extend further outward over time as the trees grow.  Does it make sense, and is it safe for the trees, to dig planting holes for the lupine just outside the drip line of the trees? Or is there more potential for harm than good?  If I go to the effort of digging there (digging isn't easy here), I'd probably amend the general area with manure.  Similarly with the clover, I'm thinking about scraping away the mulch and scattering seed underneath the trees then covering with 0.5"" or so of composted manure. (Or covering the area with 1-2"" of compost and spreading seed there.) Are there any potential problems with this? "
4405,"how to increase Phosphorous, Potassium and Calcium in lawn soil","I recently used my local extension service to do a soil test. I did this before I fertilized for the spring so I got a post-winter reading on the soil. They said my lawn was very low in Phosphorous, Potassium, Calcium, and Magnesium:   Phosphorous: 1.8ppm, optimum range is 4-14ppm Potassium: 25ppm, optimum range is 100-160ppm Calcium: 244ppm, optimum range is 1000-1500ppm Magnesium: 31ppm, optimum range is 50-120ppm   In their recommendations they said to add dolomitic limestone due to low magnesium. They also said to apply varying amounts of N-P-K to amend the other nutrients that were low. They recommended 2-4lb N per 1000sqtft, 2lb P per 1000sqtft, and 4lb K per 1000sqtft. I'm struggling with finding a great fertilizer that can add all of those nutrients in the right ratios (other than N, that's an easy one). Are there other ways to get more Phosphorous, Potassium and Calcium in my soil? Would the dolomitic limestone help any of those in addition to helping the low magnesium?

4406,How to best care for mature trees?,I've got several mature trees in my yard. I just moved into the home and for the last two years not a lot of care was given to the trees. As a first step I've removed all the trees that were scattered around the tree step.     Question   Other than pruning what other measures can be taken to take care of a mature tree? Should I cover the stem with mulch? Should the mulch be mixed with something?  
4407,What weed covering should I use under my mulch?,"I am about to lay down new mulch in a flower bed for a customer, where weeds are highly prone to growing. I will also be weeding this flower bed throughout the year. My question is, what type of weed covering should I use? I have used fabric coverings before but the weeds broke right though.   Would I kill my flowers if I laid down plastic under the mulch and around the flowers?  "
4408,Should I remove this plant that is growing on top of my milkweed?,"We have this milkweed that is usually covered in caterpillars this time of year, but hasn't really grown any leaves since this little plant popped up right in the middle of it.

4410,Chinese Elm bonsai turning yellow after repotting,"I have a Chinese Elm bonsai. The tree was doing fine, sprouting many new twigs in the last month or two. After the growth slowed down I decided to repot the tree, because the original soil was too slow to dry out and also because the roots were starting to fill the pot.   I used something called Terramol as the substrate, it’s supposed to be something like Akadama. I didn’t mix it with anything. (The supplier says it can be used as is.) I had to trim some of the roots so that the plant would fit neatly in the pot. I was very careful doing it, only trimming a small part of the roots. I think my watering routine should be fine – I always water after the top part of the substrate gets sort of dry, and I keep pouring until the water comes out through the drain holes.   But after a week the tree looks tired and wilted, some of the leaves are turning yellow. Is this expected after repotting, or have I done something wrong? If I screwed up, what’s the best way to help the tree?  This is how the tree looks now, after repotting once more into a mix of Terramol (two parts) with grit (one part) and potting soil (one part):    And this is a detail of the pot &amp; substrate mixture:      Update: After a month or so after repotting the yellowing stopped and the plant started to look happy again. This is how the tree looks today:   "
4411,Snake plant leaf thinning,"So I've had this snake plant fit and healthy for the last 4 years or so, but recently some of the leaves have been thinning around the edges, going almost paper like.    It was recently repotted, and I'm somewhat suspicious that the new soil (although labelled as being for cacti and succulents) may not be draining correctly.  Would you say this is a symptom of over-watering / root rot?  Or something else.  Any advice appreciated.    Also, at this point I'm assuming those two leaves are pretty much done for, should I trim them?  Or leave them be. "
4412,Lilium flower withering,"I've just recently (2013.03.08) bought a lilium and an orchid plant from a big hardware/gardening chain store. The day after, I watered them early in the morning with room temperature water (unfortunately chlorine treated tap-water) as instructed and by the end of the day I noticed that some of the leaves of the Lilium have started to dry out and wither.  The plants pick a bit of the air stream of my air-condition, but it is set to 19°C (warm mode) and the room temperature is at 21°C - both of which might be the reason why the upper layer of the soil was dry 5 days after watering. They receive constant, but not direct, sunlight throughout the day.  I've been pruning the withered leaves, as they came off with ease and I thought it wouldn't do any additional harm.  Is this normal or is the plant unhealthy? Am I doing something I shouldn't be doing?  On the other hand the orchid is doing fine, but I am still concerned as I read somewhere that when something is wrong with an orchid plant it dies suddenly.

4413,Hardy plants for wind break in the Rocky Mountain West?,"Here in Montana, high winds are a common cause for both gardening problems and poor energy efficiency in homes (as well as maintenance issues). Can anyone recommend some low-maintenance plants that would shelter both other plants and the side of a leaky house from frequent high winds? I suspect evergreens would be best, but which ones? They need to withstand temperature extremes from below -30F to over 100F and winds that often gust over 30mph (50 possible) and be tall enough to serve as a wind break for at least a single-story building.

4414,"What are the growing conditions for Camelia azalea, especially its water needs?","I have bought this rare breed of Camellia, the Camellia azalea. It's originally from China I think. I have mixed in some coco husk to allow for good water flow and prevent clogging the soil with too much water.   The leaves recently started falling for no reason, still green and firm, with no wilting. There's also some browning at the tips of the fallen leaves.  Here's a page about the plant.    Does anyone know about this rare breed of Camellia and its growing requirements? Should I be watering it a lot or changing back the soil to something less leaky? Or does it not like the water too much? I am based in Hong Kong.  I really don't want this beautiful plant to die! I would be forever grateful to anyone who could give me some guidance. "
4415,Can I combine two or more fruit trees?,"I am from southern NH, my neighbor in the next neighborhood has a tree with both pears and apples. I have heard of this but never thought it was practical. I have a peach tree that is less than half alive, but still yields fruit on a small portion (or at least it did last year). I was planning on taking it down this year so I thought I could do an experiment.   Do I stand a chance at combining my combining my peach tree with probably an apple tree or anything else? Does anyone have any experience with this? I have been trying to research possibilities but I mostly get led to people trying to sell me combination trees.  I am going to put a 50 pt bounty on this as soon as I am allowed so take your time in answering. I am most concerned with the different factors of success and failures of tree grafting because I would like to pursue this whether my peach tree is suitable or not. I am not only interested in any documented successes but willing to try where others have failed if anyone has any innovative suggestions or insights. "

Will it show signs of life that it is out of dormancy? "
4417,Can humans pollinate Catharanthus by hand?,"Can we pollinate Catharanthus without bees or insects? If yes, then how to do it?  Due to the floral structure of the Rosy Periwinkle, they require insects such as butterflies and moths that have long tongues, and serve as better pollinators for this plant. The flowers of the Madagascar Periwinkle are often visited by a wide variety of insects including butterflies, moths, bees and even beetles. Furthermore, other studies have shown that the Madagascar Periwinkle is a very unique species within its family because of its self-compatibility meaning that they are able to pollinate themselves.  But how we can do it if we want to do it? "

4419,What is the right way to prune a mulberry tree?,"I've planted a dormant bareroot 2' tall mulberry seedling, and I'm wondering what sort of pruning is required. It's a full size tree, not any sort of dwarf variety. It has several branches already.   Right now: should I do any initial pruning? (E.g. for apple trees it is often recommended to prune them to ""whips"".) On an annual basis: what are the recommended timing and practices?  "
4420,"Is eye-level coppicing of trees unique to Turkey, and what species are typically involved?","When travelling in Turkey some years ago, I noticed many trees (25-40cm diameter) that appeared to have been heavily pruned at a height of around 2m. Only just before leaving did I realise that this was a firewood production method where the long, almost cane-like, branches were being cut annually or semi-annually in a coppice-like fashion.  I recently located images from a blog article of a trip through central Turkey that contained images of trees of this form at:  Image 1:    Image 2:    Is this technique unique to Turkey or the Near-east, or it is practiced in other areas?   What is the reason for this approach in contrast to the lower level stumping of trees practiced since Neolithic times in Europe?  Can someone identify the species from the winter images provided? "

4422,Need help on basics for growing herbs and vegetables in pots,"I haven't bought the pots as yet, but I wanted to know how should I plant oregano, basil, parsley, mint, (maybe some other herbs) and cherry tomato, chili peppers and garlic.  Should I have a small pot per plant or should I group them in a large pot?  My balcony is facing south (I'm on the south hemisphere) so it has sun all day on its border and shadow closer to the wall.    I was thinking about having something like a vertical garden (2 of them one against the wall and other against the border, maybe? Also maybe stepped so they don't overlap each other, IDK)  Edit: also, what material do I need for the pots? "
4423,Big cactus identification and how long does it take?,"I found these huge cacti in a garden-center, the two on the right. The largest in the back was over 1.5 m in length! They were a little bit too expensive, so I thought maybe start from seed...  What species is this, and how long does it take before they are as large as these? And how to get them this big, is that possible as houseplant, or do you need a greenhouse for this?     Edit: I went back to the garden center, and found names on the labels! The two tall ones on the right are indeed South American cacti. They are called Trichocereus pasacana, a.k.a. Echinopsis atacamensis. So Echinopsis was a very good guess (see accepted answer). The two on the left were Pachycereus pringlei, just like the answer suggest!  The little one between the two tall ones on the right was sold, so I couldn't see what it was. "
4424,Is this a typical growth habit for a cactus?,"I was re-potting my 9+ year old cactus to a bigger pot yesterday and noticed a sizable portion of its stem is submerged.

4426,How should I care for a potted apple seedling?,"About two weeks ago, a friend of mine ate an apple and found that the seeds had already sprouted inside the apple.  I thought this was pretty cool, so I put them in a cup to grow.   They grew into ""real"" seedlings, so when I went home for spring break, I potted them and brought them back, and since then, I've been growing them under my desk lamp (and inside a greenhouse I fashioned from a water bottle) over the last week. They have grown to about 3 or 4 inches and I was wondering how best to care for them from this point.   Should I find nutrients to give them? A special bulb? Is the greenhouse the best idea? When will I know when to transfer them to a bigger pot/split them up? Is there anything else I should consider? "
4427,How do I prune an apple tree so it will grow short?,"I was just wondering, is it possible to prune an apple tree so that it will grow short?

4429,"Sowing cucumbers, do I really have to place the seed on its side and cover in clingfilm?",Instructions on the packet of cucumber seeds I'm holding say I need to:   Plant the seed on its side Cover the pot with clingfilm after sowing   I get that these are measures which will help germination. But how vital is it to get these fiddly and time-consuming details right?   Is one or the other or both of these precautions going to aid germination rates by 100%? Or 5%? Or what? 
4430,How much P2O5 should I add to tomatoes,"My tomatoes are developing purple spots at the bottom leaves. This is supposed to be a phosphorus deficiency. Tomatoes are growing in pots.  Small ones are in around 4 gallons (~14 L) and big ones are in 8 gallons (~28 L) pots.  I bought 100mL of 30% P2O5 and 20% K2O solution. So 30g of P2O5 and 20g of K2O It comes without instructions for tomatoes. How much should I add it to tomatoes? Or if you like chemistry, how concentrated solution should I prepare?  I am planning to water tomatoes with it. Should I spray it on the leaves too?  Update:     UPDATE:  Images taken 10h after adding 1g of p2o5 to 30kg of soil.  Images taken 58h after adding 1g of p2o5 to 30kg of soil.     Progression of slightly damaged leafs stopped completely or almost comletely, while the heavily damaged leaves still tend to get purpler. Just much slower. Like the plant isn't even trying to preserve them.  "
4431,What kind of palm tree is this and how do I care for it?,I bought a new house and have this palm tree in the front yard. No one lived in the house for over two years so it's been neglected but still looks healthy. What's the best way to clean it up and have looking really great? Also is there anything special I should do to fertilize it?   
4432,Optimizing use of aerator sandals,"I lust over one of these:    This is the kind of aerator that is towed behind a lawn tractor, with some cinder blocks or other weights on the ledge to help the tines dig in.  So far, I have not been able to justify the expense for something that will spend 364.5 days per year stuffed in the back of the shed.  I rented one once, but the rental place near me no longer offers one.  In the mean time I have these:    These are sandals with nail-like protrusions on the bottom that strap over your shoes.  I've used these each of the last couple years across my small suburban yard.  I am finding I have the following challenges with these sandals:   Keeping them on.  Even when I bear down on the straps as hard as I can, they still seem to slip off every fourth step or so.  I can usually wiggle my shoe back into place, but sometimes I have to sit down and re-strap them.  Walking duck-toed seems to reduce the problem, but see item #4. Keeping my balance.  The first time I tried these, I stumbled a few times.  I then added a hiking staff and it helped a lot.  Like with #1, walking duck-toed helps at the expense of #4. Ensuring good coverage.  I take short steps and follow a zig-zag path across the yard, using things like trees, fence posts, and the corners of structures as landmarks to keep in line.  However, there is still a fair distance between steps, and probably between each zig and zag, that does not get covered.  I know I don't need to puncture every single inch, but I wonder if I am getting enough. After effects.  I am just old enough to have entered the wonderful world of arthritis.  For three or four days after my latest foray with these sandals- taking high steps and walking duck-toed the whole time- my poor hips and knees were screaming at me.  Even though I only needed about 90 minutes to criss-cross my quarter-acre, that was enough to keep the makers of Naproxen in business for a while longer.   Has anyone else experienced similar issues?  How have you adapted and overcome? "
4433,Growing onions from an onion,"I would like to experiment on growing onions form an onion, instead of buying each year seeds, sets or little plants.  I heard that planting one onion does not immediately gives more onions. Opposite to shallots, which apparently you can plant and you'll get a bunch of shallots instead. And for leek you can do the same.  So my question is more or less what is the life cycle of an onion? Can I plant my onion, where from I'll get a plant and seeds, which I can use next year? Do I need several plants or are both sexes present on one plant?  On the question: Onion seeds v. onion sets I read onion seeds are perishable. So if I harvest them this summer I should immediately start them again (in little breeding pots)? But you should only plant onions right after winter? Can I dry them and use them for the first coming season? "
4434,What is this opening on the bottom of my tomato plant's stem?,"I'm trying to grow my own tomatoes from seed, and they're getting quite big now. So naturally, the first problems start to pop up.  Like this:    Can anyone tell me what it is, and if I can do anything about it? It reminds me of something trees sometimes have, too.  Another plant kind of has the same thing, but there it HAS rotted the root:    Is this what'll happen to my first plant, too? "
4435,What are these specks of white fuzz in some of my potting soil?,"I was transplanting seedlings of chives and parsley and noticed white fuzzy specks clustered in the soil. Because it exists in both sets of seedlings - neither of which started with this fuzzy stuff - I imagine it is something in the soil or it is a mold they both got.          These seedlings grew indoors under a grow light by a window, occasionally with a heating mat on beneath them. The soil was kept pretty moist - rarely fully wet or dry - and to keep it that way took frequent watering since the grow light would dry the soil of these small seedlings daily.  What are these white fuzzy specks? My guess is some kind of fungal activity, but I'm not sure if it's bad. These seedlings have been growing well. I plan to transplant some of these to the garden soon, or bigger pots, or keep in their pots - any precautions or steps I should take in light of this fuzz's appearance? "
4436,Is this an offshoot of a tree or a separate plant?,"Plants native to the Sonoran Desert require watering every 6 months. The following plant, which I am not sure is native to the Sonoran Desert or not, was found to thrive in the Sonoran Desert solely off rain. What is this plant?  Is this an offshoot of a tree?

4437,Removing sunken pavers and replacing with grass,"A section of my backyard (13.75 X 15.17) is paver stones that have sunk.  The pavers abut the house so when it rains, too much water is draining towards the house. I'd like to remove the pavers entirely and replace with grass.  I looked under one of the stones and all I see is dirt. My questions are: 1. Should I look to see if it's only dirt? (which would prob explain the sinking) 2. Once the pavers are removed, how do I figure out how much dirt I will need to replace the pavers (including how high I should lay the dirt)? 3. Will I need sand? 4. How do I lay the dirt to prevent draining towards the house?  Thank you so much for your help! "
4438,When is the best time to move daffodil bulbs?,"A while back, I planted a patch of daffodils in my lawn. I've regretted it ever since when I have to mow around the plants after they've bloomed, it looks a mess with only the leaves after the blooms have gone and the grass suffers after the leaves have gone, too.  When is the best time to fork-up the bulbs and transplant them to a border? They're still in-leaf at the moment so it'll be easier to find the little jokers but should I wait until all the 'goodness' has returned to the bulb? "

4441,"Flattened/Deflated cactus, snapped cactus and white spots","I've been on holiday for 2 weeks, and today I put my cacti out into the sun for the first time in a 2 weeks. I noticed immediately that one section of one cactus had ""deflated"", or collapsed in on itself.  You can see white spots on here.  As I carried another cactus it snapped. I was carrying it gently, not forcefully at all.  I inspected it and have seen some white spots on them, which I never noticed before, though admittedly never looked too closely. I have read that these may be insect infestations.  I attach some pictures for your thoughts, but my questions are really  1.) How do I treat? 2.) Can I recover the snapped section? If so how? 3.) Should I keep existing healthy Cacti away from these?  Thanks  Regards "
4442,Oil/sap from the trees,"So we moved to a new home last week. There are two different trees, one in the backyard, one in the front. However, both trees have some oil or sap like things on the leaves, and what's worse, wind spreads the oil all over my car or anything under the trees. See attached picture please. What is causing the oil? The trees themselves or bugs? Are the white dots on the leaves bug eggs? I do see many bugs on the trees. Thx   "

The plant without any flowers looks to me to be the same type.  I only read about daffodils without flowers being termed as ""blind"" this year, maybe that is something that various plants can do too.

4444,How do I make seed starting green mulch form newspaper?,"I'm trying to grow some shade grass, but heavy rains washed my first attempt partially away. I've read that using straw is not the best idea because the straw had weed seeds nad needs to be racked afterward. I've also read about something called green mulch, that is a combination of newspaper and other stuff that you can just add and forget. I can't seem to find it at anyplace locally, was thinking maybe its possible to make it myself by shredding newspaper and maybe adding food coloring or something? Has anyone used something similar to start grass?  "

4447,Do tomato plants like temperature and humidity changes?,"I am growing some tomatoes in pots in a toy greenhouse. I've put a thermometer/ humidity meter inside.  The relative humidity changes from around 55% to 75%, and correspond to highest temperature of 26 Celsius (79 &deg;F) and lowest around 17 &deg;C (63 &deg;F).  Both temperature and relative humidity are completely normal, but do plants prefer these changes? By which I mean, do the tomato greenhouse pros try to maintain a constant temperature and relative humidity, in order to maximize crop? "
4448,Can I save frost damaged tomatoes?,"We had an unusually late frost after we had already transplanted our tomato starts outside this year. I covered the plants with canvas drop-cloths over the tomato trellises, but all the leaves and the top of the stems ended up dying. However, the main stems of the plants are green, and they've started to sprout new branches and leaves from their bases. Will the entire plant regrow and produce tomatoes, or should I just pull them up and start over? If they still have a chance, should I prune away any dead spots at the top of the stems? It's been about a week since it frosted, so I don't think there's any danger of it happening again. (Although the frost last week was over a week after the supposed ""last frost date"" this year.) "
4449,Is it possible to transplant irises without the rhizome?,"I bought a house and put some raised beds in the yard, on top of what we thought (in very early spring) was just lawn. It turns out there were irises (small purple ones, I don't know the variety) there. They now grow up through the raised bed, and are crowding out the plants I put the bed in for. I love irises, and would love to move them someplace else, but the rhizomes are down through 8"" of soil in the bed, plus however far below the surface they were to start with. I've tried to dig them up, and get lots and lots of root, but the rhizomes are almost all breaking off and coming up separately in a second dig. Any chance these rooty but rhizome free irises are going to survive? Should I just give up on this project and try to kill them off completely?     What they mostly look like:  Other side:  "

4452,Will the worm population in my raised beds be OK during cold or hot weather?,"I'm in zone 4 and just finishing up building some 3' tall garden boxes.  In the winter, the whole thing will definitely freeze. I'm worried that my earthworms are going to have to burrow 3' + 16"" frost line to escape the cold.  In the summer, the soil inside the box will probably get up to 75 degrees, which is warmer than I think native earthworms are used to. They can probably just burrow a few inches to escape the heat normally, where 3' of 75 degrees might be tough.  Is that a problem for worms? Is there something I can do with layers of dirt or material to help them overcome this?  "

4455,How to move trees on a highway using a pickup truck?,"From time to time I want to move trees anywhere from 5-500 miles to either a new nursery location or permanent planting location. Usually these trees are potted, sometimes they're bare root, rarely are they ball &amp; burlap.  How should one move trees using a pickup truck? When possible, I just put potted trees in the cab. Trees larger than a few feet need to go in the bed however. With bushes I've transported them standing up but this seems very risky with wind damage. The best way I found so far was to actually lay the trees gently on their side, root-end against the cab and crown toward the tailgate (or even hanging over the tailgate with a ribbon tied to their top if they're longer than the bed). I then tied the root/pot against the cab/down against the bed to keep the tree from sliding away from the cab, potentially damaging its crown. Then I covered it using a tonneau cover (which only worked because I only had a couple of potted trees at that time - if I had to stack many pots of trees that way I'd probably need an agricultural fabric or a truck bed canopy).  How do experts (e.g. nursery workers) move many/long trees in pickup trucks? If using a trailer, what kind and how? "

Some factors I can think of:    intensity of light  concentration of CO2 in the air.   Some ideas to fix both: you could place reflective surfaces near a your crop. In case of greenhouse, you could also raise CO2 levels with a CO2 generator. Raising from current 0.04% to 0.5% (12.5x increase) does not require a lot of combustion.  I haven't seen anyone doing this. Why not? What are pros and cons and caveats? "

(Click on the photo to zoom in)   Where do these creepy crawlies come from? I am growing the basil on the balcony of my sixth-floor apartment. Do you think it might be because of a small compost pot that I have on the balcony too?   I am not sure I can save any of my plants. The other ones show fewer of these white creepy crawlies but I am sure more are hidden. The question I have is for future batches of sweet basil, what can I do to prevent these infestation.

4467,Baby apple tree under attack by...aphids? What to do?,"I have a little backyard nursery which includes a few young grafted apple trees. Today I saw a bunch of ants gathering around the top of one of the baby apple trees, and green nodes seeming to pop out of the stem. At first I thought these might be ant eggs. I shooed the ants away but the little green things were harder to get off. Upon closer inspection, I think the green things are some sort of aphid but am not sure, but they're not ant eggs at all. Photos at end of post.  What course of action should I take to protect the apple tree (and other trees if applicable)?  When I thought they were ant eggs I considered pruning off the affected area, but hesitated since it's one of two main terminal shoots. Knowing it's not eggs, but rather creatures I can pluck off, pruning seems less appropriate. I've used a neem oil / water solution before with success against pests indoors, so I'm considering that option too. Lastly, I wonder if having so many trees close together matters? I've seen other nurseries put potted trees in groups by species so I figured it's fine, and I have a nice amount of diversity on the lawn and of potted trees on the pallets so I'd hope that'd help prevent any bad pest problems.      Some context and photos:  The apple trees are potted using fresh (from a bag) potting soil with wood chips on top.

4468,How well would mediterranean plants/trees grow in a greenhouse in northern Europe?,"This is the situation: I live quite far up north (Trondheim, Norway), and wish to achieve greater diversity in yield from the garden. Although the climate is not as tough as the position would suggest (see [website]My question is this: how well would these types of mediterranean (and perhaps tropical) fruit thrive in a northern greenhouse? Would the minimal amount of sunlight be a problem, or is it mainly the temperature that these trees need? "

4471,Will dead-headed dandelions flowers germinate in lawn?,"When fighting dandelions in a lawn, I know it is common practice to dead-head the yellow flowers before they morph into the pappus stage with the feathery seeds, but will the seeds in the yellow flowers germinate if left in the lawn?  A neighbor told me that they will, but I question it.  Are the seeds fertile/mature at that point?  Once the yellow flowers are plucked from the plant, can they still mature while on the ground?  I can not find info on this anywhere on the interwebs. "
4472,Should I give up on these Dill and Rosemary seeds?,"I'm a total amateur to potted plants, as I'm living in my own apartment (in NYC) for the first time and I used to live in a rural area. I bought some flower pots, miracle gro starting/seedling mix, and this 10 variety seed pack of various herbs.  So my timeline of events goes like this  Day 1: I put some dirt from the bag of miracle-gro in a small pot, sprinkle dill seeds in, then cover lightly, as seed packet recommends. I then water a bit. I notice the water sits on top without going in to the soil, and then after a minute, it goes right through the drainage hole immediately; very little retention. I don't pay much heed at this point. I do the same for rosemary. I sprinkle a little water into these plants every morning by putting a paper tower in a glass of water and gently squeezing out a bit onto the top of the soil. The pots aren't very big, so a squeeze basically causes the whole top of the soil to be covered in a small puddle, which sits there for a minute or two and then immediately goes to the bottom, mostly out of the drain hole.  Day 8ish: The soil still seems kind of bad at holding water. I sprinkle water on top, enough to darken the soil, and three minutes later I stick my finger in and it's totally dry. I look up online that sometimes bagged soil gets so dry that it becomes water resistant, and that sometimes soaking it works. I don't want to drown the seeds, so I try some new ones. I take a bunch of soil from the bag, soak it really well for about 8 hours, then let drain overnight. In the morning the soil is clumpy like it's still a bit wet inside, but not damp. I have two more pots; I put basil seeds in one and oregano seeds in the other. I cover a bit with bagged soil (not the stuff I soaked) and put on the window. I continue watering the first two plants (dill and rosemary) but I don't water the basil and dill since the soil seems damp from the soaking.   Day 14ish (now): I wake up to see a few basil shoot and one or two oregano ones as well. Still nothing from the other two pots. I'm wondering if it's time to give up on the Dill and Rosemary? Maybe I'm being impatient, I'm sure different varieties take different times to germinate but I planted the second batch a week after and they are germinating first, probably due to my soaking of the soil.  Do you think it is possible to soak more soil, salvage the dill and rosemary seeds, and start over with them? Or are they probably irreparably  damaged?   Additionally, I'm a bit unsure of when to start watering (and how much) the basil and oregano shoots. The soil still seems slightly clumpy, but not as much as before. I don't want to stick my finger in in case I disturb the new seedlings.  "
4473,What to do (after two weeks) with a waterlogged pot plant?,"See here for question about what I should have done at the time: What to do (immediately) with a waterlogged pot plant?  TL;DR  What should I do now, given that I suspect that I've created a plant pot that drains poorly?    I recently repotted a bunch of house plants (Edit: 2 pelargoniums &amp; some mint) into larger pots, with new compost.  I mixed into the compost some water-retention crystals - the kind that absorb loads of water and can then release that water gradually. I did this because I struggle with under-watering the plants and was hoping that this would result in the dampness of the soil being more stable over time.  A) If this was a terrible idea from the get-go let me know :)  Perhaps I mis-judged the amount of crystals, or perhaps it was an error to soak the crystal-enhanced pots like I do for the rest of my plants, but the upshot was that the pots became extremely wet for a long period - I would say waterlogged.  There was water seeping out of the pot into the saucer for 2-3 days (which I would regularly empty), and the surface of the soil was definitely wet to the touch. I then didn't water the pot for a week and a half, and left the plant outside on a South-East facing balcony for a very hot(23-27 degrees) and sunny week. and by the end of that week and a half, the soil is still not particularly dry (although it is at least not actively WET now).  I perceive that the plants definitely suffered from this - several (though not all) of the leaves very suddenly went extremely pale and then died, other leaves have gained a pale halo around their edge, and for the 3-4 days after I did this, the plants appeared to wilt (as though I'd UNDER-watered them) though it has now recovered.  I have multiple questions, so the above set up has been duplicated on multiple posts, but my question here is ...    The leaf-death appears to have stopped now (I've removed the dying/dead leaves and the rest seem OK), and at least one of the plants looks reasonably healthy now (it's opened up new flower heads)  This makes me wonder whether I should just leave it as it is, and be careful not to over water it in future.  B) What should I have do now, given that I'm in this situation? "
4474,Really virulent mosquitos - dealing with them and their bites,"With a lot of tree cover and a nearby river, the one fly in the ointment(!) at our new place is it has a lot of mosquitos and midges. The latter don't seem to be too much of a bother but the mosquitos, living in long grass and ivy especially, must be of some particularly virulent sub-species or I'm just very sensitive to them: when bitten nothing happens for a day or so, then I get a large swollen lump anything up to a 2"" (5cm) across. I may also get raised blisters or it may start continuously weeping for 2-3 days. That's just off one bite!  From a gardening perspective, can I do anything to keep the place clear of them? I know they breed in standing water but with a river nearby I can't eliminate that. I've started clearing ivy which they seem to love, to reduce damp places for them to hang out, but I'm wondering about a more drastic solution - similar to how I go out with my back-pack of weedkiller, can I treat areas with some sort of pesticide - is this even legal, let alone feasible?  In terms of the bites themselves (well, that's a bit off-topic)... but should I find my reaction moderates with repeated exposure? Or could the opposite happen like with people getting more and more allergic to peanuts until it's dangerous? "

Are they related to the over-watering or is that just a coincidence? "
4477,How can I store onion bulbs?,"I just got six gallons of red onion bulbs for planting, since the store was getting rid of them at 50¢/gallon.  I intend to plant them late fall and let them go over winter, since that worked so well for me last year.  How can I store the bulbs for four months until late fall?  Further, six gallons is alot of bulbs of one variaty (I was wanting two gallons of white, two of yellow, and two of red, but accidentally got six of red only).  So, I'd like to plant half this fall (4 months away), and half next fall (16 months). How can I store the bulbs for 16 months?  I have half gallon mason jars, and a vacuum jar sealer - would that be sufficient? I can place the jar down in a storm shelter, or in a dark pantry cabinet, or place them in a freezer. "

Some time ago we noticed the twisted ""stems"". First time after the plant was watered, the stems straightened up, but in a few days got curly-ish again. The next time the plant was watered no positive changes were noticed.  A few questions arise:   Is it normal? Is it dangerous? What causes it? What do we do now?    "

But nowhere here has them, and I've checked everywhere. I finally found a different brand of the seeds at a small local spot, and even the cashier said ""hmmm, I've never seen anyone buy these"".   It makes me wonder if these plants are hard to find here because the conditions needed differ than pickling or straight cukes. Or maybe they're just rare. Can I grow these in Norfolk, VA, USA? If so, I'm assuming (I could be wrong) it's too late for this season, but, when is the best time for me to plant seeds?   "
4480,"Blueberry dying leaves, flowers","Hi I'm having major issues with my blueberry bushes. I had three in a large planter and they fruited last year just fine. The third one randomly dried up and died a couple of months ago, now one of the others looks Ill and possibly the other one. When the first one died I stripped out all of the soil and replaced it with fresh erecacius soil, I made sure the roots were sprayed off and looking ok before I put them in the new soil. They looked to be fine for a month and then the bush on the right flowers / fruit went all purple and leaves started to fall off. Iv only watered with rain water, not fertilised it, it's had new compost a month or so ago, really can't work out what's wrong with them.                    Here is a video of the plant : [website]"

4482,Identifying cause of poor growth in rudbeckia,"My rudbeckia is starting to come out, and some of the leaves at the tips are curled, dry, and in some of the plants yellow.  Last year these plants did mostly fine, considering it was an incredibly dry summer and I did not water much.  As I was taking these pictures I was pulling a weed near the base of one of these plans, and some kind of grubby critter stuck to my hand. Not sure if it's to blame. Picture of the bug at the end.  Location is Southeast Michigan, USA.  Any ideas on identification and treatment?  PS: did some more careful inspection of the plants today, looking for small bugs and whatnot. Saw nothing. It did occur to me that we've had an unusually cold spring, with light frosts many times for the past couple weeks. It's just starting to warm up now. Could it simply be frost damage?      "
4483,Raising bed of Peonies,"I have a bed of flowers which I would like to raise by 2-2½ feet (61cm - 76cm) with the soil added to the top, but I am concerned about the idea when I have well established Peonies.  Is it possible to raise the bed after cutting them down as close to the ground as possible and just add soil on top, or is it best to remove them from the ground first and replant once I have built the raised bed and filled it with soil?  Although the Royal Horticultural Society's webpage on Peonies says that they are hardy plants, where they are well established and flower very well every year, I am just concerned that things could go badly for them if I don't treat them correctly. "
4484,What is the cause of this tomato plant leaf curl?,"I have never experienced leaf curl to this extreme before. Started from seed,  these plants were perfect in 4 inch pots. After transplanting to a large pot, the leaf curling started within several days. The pot lacked good drainage, being a self watering pot. The pot is outside, and I drilled some drainage holes over a week ago. The leaf curling had continued to get worse.   Could the overly wet soil caused this?  Could the Tomato Tone and Kelp meal caused this?   No signs of bugs.  UPDATE:  I have planted in a raised bed for a decade and have only had issues with aphids and septorium leaf spot.  Mulch has pretty much eradicated the spot fungus.  I have a green thumb and rarely have to deal with failure.  I have always been gentle, but firm with transplanting.  The soil in the pot was taken from my neighbor's ""compost pile""; which is really just old flower potting soil dumped yearly.  I am suspecting that a disease was present.  The photos were taken about 2 weeks after transplanting and they were not rootbound in the 4 inch pots.     "
4485,Minimal install of artificial grass for small enclosed pet area,"I recently built a small enclosed outdoor area for my cats to enjoy the outside (aka a ""catio""). There is a pet door for them to come and go as they please. Human included for scale.    We also have a small dog that we want to use it when we're not home to relieve himself. Therefore, we plan to remove the gravel and replace it with artificial grass.  I've watched several DIY artificial grass installing videos online. The basic preparation steps seem to boil down to:   Remove current landscaping material (in our case, gravel). Grade the exposed dirt. Build wooden frame around perimeter. Pour some kind of compacted leveling substrate over the dirt and pack it flat. Install artificial grass on top of substrate. Attach outer edge of grass to wooden frame.   This enclosed area is only for small animals. The animals are mainly indoor pets, so the installation does not need to be very durable or need to stand up to heavy use. It seems like a lot of the preparation for an artificial grass installation is predicated around being able to withstand full-size humans running around on it for years.  That said, what is the minimum artificial grass installation we can get away with for our specific use case? Can we get away with laying the grass directly on the dirt below? Do we still need to build a perimeter or can we stake the grass directly into the dirt? Are there other ""cheats"" we can do that will be good enough for a pet area and allow us to save time and money?  Edit: There is a dog door that gives both species of animals unlimited access into and out of the enclosure. We expect only the dog will use the grass to relieve himself, and then only when we're not home to let him outside into the larger backyard. "
4486,What happens to my tomatos?,"The leaves of my tomatoes (three diverse sorts) don't look good.  On the fourth day outside (still in the process of hardening), they started to show the light yellow to brown spots on some leaves, as you can see on the photos.  They not only show these stains, but also stopped growing for already two weeks, until now.  What happened to my tomatoes and what can I do to help them? We’ve had surprisingly clear weather, was it just too much sun?    Additional Information   They have lost their first pair of leaves I grew them from seeds. I used low nutrient soil from the bag for the first growing stage Planted in bigger pots about a week ago In the bigger pots I used tomato soil, containing nutrients for a couple of weeks Watered when needed, but before the plants showed signs Watered with soft water (no rainwater available) Watered with a watering can, right onto the soil only, no rain so far No additional fertilizer used so far No spraying with anything About half of them were under plastic domes outside     Photos    "
4487,"Getting Rid of Pill Bugs and Earwigs, Kindly","I've planted a lot of seeds this year, (marigold, green beans, cornflower, poppy, sunflower, etc.) I started with 50+ green beans plants and now have 2 left, countless marigolds and now have 4 plants, half of my sunflowers were eaten, along with a lot of my other flower seedlings. I'm fairly certain that it's from all of the earwigs and sowbugs we have here.  My problem is, I have a hard time killing things. Is there some way to deter them from my garden without killing? Some essential oils or sprays? Also, I don't want to deter any bees, birds, or butterflies, since they are a big part of why I enjoy my gardens.  Thank you so much for your reponses. "
4488,What is eating the leaves of this rose plant?,"  We recently purchased this rose plant from a local nursery. However, something is eating the leaves of this plant. This seems to have happened overnight. Can anyone offer an educated guess as to what it is, and how to stop this happening? Would some kind of chemical spray do the trick, for example?  As far as I can tell, whatever is eating the leaves of this plant hasn't attacked any of the other plants in the garden. Note: this isn't a real garden. It's a small collection of mostly potted plants on the balcony of our home.  I'm located in Bombay, India. "
4489,How can I stop removed branch stumps from spouting 'beards'?,"I've a lot of substantial trees, mostly sycamores (related to maples I think, they might have a different name in the US?)  I can see over the past the last owners pruned branches on the main trunk but each time, a spray of new branches has sprouted around the stump. In some cases they clearly cut these back and then each of those sprouted - the end result is a messy 'beard' of new branches coming from the trunk.  Is there a way to stop this happening? Should they be pruned at the right time, or the raw stumps treated to prevent regrowth, perhaps? Or is this just how some trees grow and I have to resign myself to managing it?  Please note my growth is coming directly from the stumps of the cut branches. Which is exactly what the answer to How can I stop a sycamore tree from sprouting new growth? doesn't cover, that focuses on sprouts from the trunk/roots rather than from the 'scar' of my pruning. I am not pollarding my tree to encourage new growth, I am removing unwanted branches where I want no growth. "
4490,"Venus Flytrap: repot, sun and water","I am a proud new owner of my very first Venus Flytrap (I came into the store to get some cute flowery plants, but I came out with this beauty instead :D)  I am not sure if this is only one plant or three  (to my inexpert eye, it seems three plants in the pot)   So, my question is if I should repot it to separate the three of them in individual pots. I've heard that repotting Venus Flytraps is dangerous for them, so I am quite scared of doing it and kill the plant(s).  Aside from that, I've learn that Venus Flytraps like light and sun. I live in the east of Spain and summer is coming, so we are currently having like 33 degrees Celsius (and rising). I think that, even if Flytraps like hot weather, this is SO much hot, so I keep it inside the house (where it's cooler), but I put it in direct sunlight when the sun is going down and weaker. Do you think this is ok?  About watering it, to be honest I haven't done it still (its soil seems slightly wet still), but I've read that putting the pot in some distilled water about once a week can be the best option. Do you agree?   Thanks a lot in advance!  I would really really like to keep this lady alive and growing!  Edit: More clarification and questions after @Dalton  answer:  Ok, so I can leave the pot ""as it is"" for now, and check again in a few months (after dormancy period) and repot to separate them if they have grown too much. I've checked about the substrate needed, and I am pretty sure I can get the ""ingredients"" in Amazon, so it shouldn't be a problem.  I purchased my plant from Ikea, I don't know in what kind of soil it's planted , but to me it looks like regular potting soil. I've read here ([website]The pot they are currently in is not really tall, so this is why I think on putting them into water regularly (maybe once or twice a week, when they need it) instead of let them always in a tray of water. Tap water where I live is horrible and super hard (lots of calcium carbonate) and it hardly ever rains, so I think I'll buy distilled water.  I live near the sea, so there is humidity but usually not too much (it depends on the day, and where the wind is coming from). So I asume that keeping the plants in my north-facing balcony (making sure the soil doesn't dry) should work. I have another potted plants outside (cypresses, and other not identified trees I sowed from seeds) that seem to be quite happy with all the heat and light, so I hope these Venus Flytrap are not the exception.  About the dormant period, winters are actually quite mild here (temperature rarely drops below 5C/41F). Should I just leave the plant in outside, just watering it less?  And finally, about feeding them. I gave the plant a house fly that my cat had just hunted (that's what I call ""team work"" haha), but a couple of days later I found out that the plant had caught a couple of flies by her own. Good work! "
4491,Appearance of Traps on Nepenthes,"I've had a Nepenthes (I believe Alata) for several years now. I have a question, probably because I have not been too observant: After a trap appears on a leaf and then subsequently dies off, will another trap grow where the old trap had been? Or is it ""one trap per leaf.""? If it is the latter, I would then cut off the dead or dying traps to give the entire plant a nicer appearance. "
4492,Barnyard odor problem in compost pile,"I'm attempting to learn how to compost. Most of the material available to me is grass clippings (not many leaves on my property). I had success last year, but this year my pile is exuding a strong odor. The composition of my piles are roughly as follows:  2017   Grass clippings: 82% Coffee grounds: 9% Chicken manure: 6% Fruit / vegetable scraps: 3%   2016   Grass clippings: 73% Wood chips: 7% Composted steer manure: 6% Sand: 6% Coffee grounds: 5% Fruit / vegetable scraps: 3%   The 2016 pile didn't really smell much. The 2017 pile has a barnyard odor (somewhere between a cow manure and chicken manure smell)--sometimes detectable 60 ft away when the wind is blowing.  The volume of both piles is roughly the same (1 - 2 yards). I've kept both piles watered (roughly the consistency of a wrung-out sponge.) I've turned each pile every 1 - 2 weeks.  Any ideas why this year's compost pile smells more than last? Is it just the fact that I used rawer chicken manure (it didn't smell that bad when I took it out of the bag) than the already composted steer manure I used last year? Is it the absence of wood chips? Is it the high acidity of the coffee grounds along with the nitrogen from the grass? I applied fertilizer to the grass this year before I mowed it and put it on the pile. Putting lime on the 2017 pile seems to have helped some. "
4493,Is the rapid new growth on this rose bush a sign of Rosette?,"I recently trimmed back a rose bush (I believe it's a Liebeszauber Hybrid Tea Rose?) that sits in some shade in my front yard, as its branches grow pretty long and eventually start leaning into its neighboring shrubbery.  The roses that had bloomed on it were now mostly wilted, so I removed them too along with the couple of remaining good ones, because I could then spray the entire plant with insect and mite control, as its leaves were getting eaten up pretty badly.    A gardener a year earlier had suspected a couple of the branches showed signed of rosette and that I should immediately trim them from the base so that it didn't spread further.  I had it trimmed back pretty severely at the time, and it grew back really nicely.  Being more familiar now with rosette than I was then, I have a question as to whether this bush is again showing signs of the disease.  I've just now noticed three really long branches shooting up above the plant:    This plant's new leaves usually have a red coloration to them, and they don't currently have an odd growth pattern to them, so nothing there is out of the ordinary.  I've seen examples of really bad ""witches' brooms"" on rose bushes, and this doesn't have that.  What I'm curious about, though, is the irregular thorn pattern on these new shoots.  Again, it's nowhere near as bad as other photos I've seen of plants with rosette, but I didn't know if this is cause for alarm:      Is that normal for this type of rose when it rapidly grows back after being trimmed?  Update: here's an additional photo showing the base of the plant, per JStorage's suggestion that these are suckers from the root system of a rose graft:   "

4498,Should I be worried about this mottling on the stems?,"I am a notorious plant-killer, so my mom bought me a plant. I'm not sure what the logic is, but it was branded as a Tough Plant so I guess she figured I couldn't kill it. Sir Leaflet's been doing surprisingly okay under my near-total negligence, but recently the stems have started developing these darker patches and I'm worried I'm about to send another plant to plant-heaven.   It's a Zamioculcas, and in the eight months or so that I've had it it's nearly doubled in height and has all sorts of new growth. It's sturdy, the leaves are waxy, and the black spots on the stems are just as strong as the surrounding growth; no mushiness or anything. The spots are on nearly every stem, are not raised and don't seem to be affecting the leaves.  It sits in my room and gets nearly direct sun for about 2-4 hours a day (there's a house right outside so I get half-sun over their roof), and indirect sun for another 6-8 or so. I water it when I remember, which isn't nearly often enough and the soil is frequently too dry. Then I flood it with half a waterbottle every couple of weeks when it occurs to me. I am, in short, just about the worst plant-caretaker.  Maybe I'm just over-paranoid about sending another plant to its grave, but is this something I've caused? Can I fix it? I don't want Sir Leaflets to go the way of his ancestors.   "

4500,How to identify epigeic worms for composting?,"I have read that there are thousands of species of earthworms and the ones that are best suited for composting are epigeic worms. Ideally, I would use Eisenia fetida but it's difficult to find them locally. So I have started experimenting by using worms from bait shops. I have prepared an environment for them with cardboard bedding and apple cores and potato peels. I added a handful of soil as well. Every time I open the worm bin, I will see a couple of them right at the top. Are these epigeic worms? Also I noticed that there are soil tracks on the potato peels that have just been added. It probably means that the worms have crawled on top of it. Is this a behaviorial pattern that is unique to epigeic worms? Are there other things that only epigeic worms do?  ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION: I living in South East Asia and trying to do vermicomposting in an apartment. "
4501,Yucca – brown mushy spots on the leaves,"We have given our Yucca's new flower soil. Now they have mushy brown spots on the leaves. Before, they stood in the living room without direct sun. Now they are outside (sun in the day (morning 2 hours and evening 3 hours) and at night about 16 ° Celsius).  Do they need more water because of the sunshine? Normally, they do not need much water. Are the temperature fluctuations not good? Sunlight and at night 16 ° C?  An idea what caused these brown spots?  Our dragon trees have similar problems.    "
4502,Avocado Pit Questions,"I'm fairly new to gardening, planting, and whatnot. But I did get an avocado from my local farmers market. (It was organic.)   But I took the pit out, I followed all the steps on basically all the tutorials I've watched/read. Except for peeling the skin of the avocado pit. Half of the tutorials said to take it off, and half said not to.   And recently the top has been getting a little dry, is that okay? And will the plant germinate, while the top half (out of the water) is dry? Should I keep the top half, not moist but wet?   "
4503,Should I harvest potatoes even if they haven't fully flowered?,"I planted some potatoes about 10 - 14 weeks ago. They have tall strong tops. Only a few small buds/flowers appear, then drop off. They have been well watered every day.   Should we start to harvest now? What if no flowers appear? "
4504,Discoloration of leaves on Carolina Reaper plants,"I started several Carolina Reaper and Cayenne plants indoors and I have recently moved them outside as the temperatures got high enough. This is my first year growing them.  A week ago, I noticed what was initially a slight discoloration of leaves (a beige tint to the mid part of a leaf on one plant), the problem has escalated since then. Now I'm dealing with clear discoloration of leaves on all but one of my Carolina Reaper plants.       What could be causing this? Some parasites? Maybe sunscald? I noticed that the discoloration is more pronounced on the plants receiving more sunlight.  I've checked the undersides of the leaves but they seem clear of unwelcome guests, at least ones visible to the naked eye.  The Cayenne peppers are growing in the exact same spot but they seem unaffected. "
4505,Will a Hibiscus recover having dropped all its leaves?,"   Will a Hibiscus recover having dropped all its leaves?   In the hot UK weather this year a hibiscus I recently planted out has lost all of its leaves. At first it got a bit dehydrated but then I kept it really well watered, but I couldn't save it.  What gives it its best chance?  Should I continue to water? "
4506,Is this branch from the blueberry root stock?,"So I have about 6 blueberry plants and last summer (which was very very dry, drought for about two months) there were woody plants coming up at the bases of about 4 of them. They're not the same leaves as the blueberry plants and this year their flowers aren't at all the same. Are they suckers from root stock? Are they something else?  I'm in Buffalo, NY      "
4507,Companion gardening - I only have one bed,"In my garden, I currently have one bed divided into sections, but the division is informal. I have alliums planted on the far left, in the middle are peppers and tomatoes, and on the right I have zucchini.  For the fall seasons, I want to plant some brassicas, some beans, corn, spinach, etc. I keep reading that certain plants don't like each other - apparently brassicas and beans don't play nicely. But I only have one physical bed. It's probably twenty or thirty feet long, and there's separation between the plants, but it is one bed. Is separating them by type sufficient, or do I just need to not plant brassicas and beans in the same year period? Is following going to be an issue - i.e. given that brassicas apparently don't like alliums, can I follow alliums with brassicas as long as I don't plant them together?  help? :) "
4508,"Capsicum ( Peppers ) leaves have holes, turned yellow, curled no bugs visible","Capsicum ( Melbourne, Australia ), outdoor on balcony in a pot, started to have holes on leaves, turned yellow, curled, but no bugs visible. Has proper drainage, watered around every 2-3 days (may water too much?), around 4 hrs direct sunlight from my spot per day.  I have other Capsicum sowed around same time but don't have the same symptoms? What's going on :( ??      "
4509,What do I actually need to do in order to size/buy a DIY drip garden watering system?,"I'm looking at adding a drip-watering system to my garden. I have a garden that is about 500 square feet, with roughly 40 tomato/pepper sized plants, a handful of raspberries, and about 100 feet worth of peas/green beans.  I'm trying to figure out what I need to order from Amazon for a drip system, but it's surprisingly difficult (I can't find any drip system components in local stores to 'build my own').  I'm guesstimating that I'll need:   100 feet of 1/2 tubing 250 feet of 1/4 tubing 40 drippers for the plants (1 gallon/hour?) Some 1/4 tubing with holes for the peas/green beans A bunch of 1/4"" connectors regulator timer standard hose adapter ??   Is there a good way to design this other than trial/error? I can't find anything online short of overbuying a kit. "
4510,Is my cactus infested with mealy bugs?,"I have had this cactus for about 5 (or more) years, and have been treating it pretty shamefully due to me only recently researching how to garden and unfortunately being one of those who didn't care too much before. I want to keep it alive, as it was originally a tiny cutting from one of my grandmothers cactus'.    She had potted it in a tiny pot with a lot of drainage stones at the bottom, which was perfect for the baby but I am aware it needs repotting now. Water doesn't seem to stay in the soil at all now, just drains straight through. Was planning to put into a pot 2-3x the size with fresh potting soil (I assume it can handle the same soil as my herbs do?). That's easy enough. I'll keep it inside at a window as that's where it's been it's whole life.    The problem is that i'm worried that this white fluff that i've always dismissed as part of the plant is mealy bugs. In the above picture you can also see white discolouring around the middle of the plant. I don't know what kind of cactus I have, unfortunately, but my grandmothers ballooned out into a ball shape and mine never has even after 5 years. I've put this down to mistreatment (it was left on a kitchen shelf in my parents house for 3 years with sporadic watering) but apparently mealy bugs cause stunted growth too. It keeps growing up, not out. Is it just because it was originally an offcut 'stem' so it's never going to become a ball? If it is mealy bugs, is this a huge infestation that is going to be really difficult to deal with?   Thank you for any advice! If anybody might know what kind of cactus this is so that I can research online for how to look after them, that would be really great too. :) "
4511,My lemons' leafs are drying. What should I do?,"   I'm trying to grow many bonsais (Lemon, Pine, Cypress, Chestnuts, Peach). I was doing fine and all of the bonsais are in the same place. However, recently my lemons started to show some kind of an illness. As in the photos above, their leafs are drying and they have never been anhydrous. I took very good care of them.  They are in pots outside of my window. The window is looking to north side and there is another apartment on the cross side. So they do not expose to burning sun more than one hour in summers. I live in Istanbul, Turkey.  Can you tell me, why this happens? And how to take care of it? "
4512,What are these sticky droplets and pests on my persimmon trees?,"Some of my persimmon leaves have tiny sticky droplets at the back of some of their leaves. It is late spring here in Japan and leaves are green. Droplets show up on small leaves with pinkish colors but some larger green leaves have droplets as well, likewise on back side of their leaves. Some sources say these are called honeydews and is the proof that plants are infected, and they are; last year I had a massive pests outbreak and my baby persimmon trees (1 to 2 year-old) were nearly annihilated. I have seen only several of those pests this year (they are only up to one millimeter in length and hard to get rid of) but they will soon multiply unless I do something. So my questions are,   What are these droplets? Are there any links to pests (is 'honeydew=infection' theory correct)?    "
4513,"How should I ""free"" these trapped sprouts?","  Look at the sprout on the right: You can see there is a clump of dirt and a little mineral thing stuck on its ""head"". Should I let it keep growing like this? Should I pick it off? I'm worried about damaging it.  These are Basil sprouts, in an indoor pot.  "
4514,What kind of vegetable plant is this?,  Hello! My daughter and I planted a veggie garden together and cannot remember what we planted! We have no idea what this is?  Anyone know? 
4515,Need help identifying this worm,I noticed small holes in my kale and was concerned. When I looked under the leaf I saw this green worm (easy to spot). On more inspection I identified another 15 worms on this kale plant and another few on a different kale plant (same type). I have a number of questions. What is this worm? How did it get there all of a sudden?  How do they multiply?  How do I get rid of them organically?  Will it attack other types of kale plants I have in the same raised bed?  Will it attack yellow squash plants in the same raised bed?     
4516,What is this plant with long thin leaves with red marks?,"  I need help identifying what type of plant this is. I bought some seed for basil, oregano, parsley, etc. and this grew among them. I was wondering what it could be? I live near Toronto if that may help, if its a wild plant? "
4517,Should I turn soil upside down when cultivating?,"Should the soil be turned upside down when cultivating?  For example,  this machine will turn the soil upside down. I've heard from my relative that you shouldn't do that because it severely disrupts the microorganisms. Some prefer to be closer to the top, others lower or something like that. Instead you should just ""flip"" the soil so that portions of it remain at the same height.  What do you think about this? "
4518,What is eating my bay plant?,"I have a young bay tree in a pot, which I received from my parents. It lives outside on a South-East Facing balcony.  For a long time after my parents gave it to me (maybe 8 months ago?) it didn't seem to be growing at all, and various of the existing leaves were gradually yellowing. There were also lots of holes in the existing old leaves which didn't seem to be expanding or increasing in number, so I assumed them to have been damage from previous insects. All-in-all it seemed pretty poorly, and I suspected that it had not really survived being repotted and given to me.  A month ago it suddenly started creating shoots, and has now grown a nice batch of new leaves (excellent!) but a week ago I was surprised to see more holes on the new leaves.  What are they, and can I do anything to prevent them?      "
4519,Why are commercial tomato seedling so thick and strong?,"Why are commercial tomato seedling so thick, strong and have so many branches? Take this image for example:   But on the other hand, most of my plants are super tall and very thin, although they have plenty of space, good light and potted in commerically available potting soil.  Any tips and tricks for how to raise thick and strong tomato seedlings? I make them thicker by cutting the main growth, but not all people do that and still have strong plants. "
4520,Is there an ideal drainage to soil layer ratio in terrarium etc.?,"The question is about the size, ratio and composition of the drainage and soil layers in some improvised terrarium. It's made out of a 8'' (20cm) truncated/shaved off glass sphere (basically a cookie/candy jar); accessories include some colorful fish tank gravel, activated coal, a nylon bag, some potting and dark soil, as well as a couple of small random plants...      I read that:   Maintaining the soil moisture is difficult even with an adequate drainage layer. It's theoretically possible to restrict root growth; a smaller area to grow roots in means less soil to grow in I would imagine. How deep the root zone is varies from plant to plant. Coal is only a must in you have a closed up terrarium.   I've seen different types of layering, proportions, even mixing the coal with the gravel or even with the soil in some instances... is it just about aesthetics?     Is there an ideal drainage to soil layer ratio in a terrarium; is it 1:1?   How would you setup the layers here, in particular the soil layer, so as to restrict root growth and ultimately constrain growth to the jar; 1 inch per? In terms of composition, how much coal does one use and is it layered above or below the gravel, or would you mix it in any other way; does it matter where it is and can it be detrimental in some cases? Do you see any issues with having the soil layer made out of different types of mix (such as potting and this dark mix) side by side?   "
4521,What to do (immediately) with a waterlogged pot plant?,"See here for question about what I should do now: What to do (after two weeks) with a waterlogged pot plant?  TL;DR  What should I have do, immediately, if I suspect that a repotted plant pot is draining poorly?    I recently repotted a bunch of house plants into larger pots, with new compost.  I mixed into the compost some water-retention crystals - the kind that absorb loads of water and can then release that water gradually. I did this because I struggle with under-watering the plants and was hoping that this would result in the dampness of the soil being more stable over time.  A) If this was a terrible idea from the get-go let me know :)  Perhaps I mis-judged the amount of crystals, or perhaps it was an error to soak the crystal-enhanced pots like I do for the rest of my plants, but the upshot was that the pots became extremely wet for a long period - I would say waterlogged.  There was water seeping out of the pot into the saucer for 2-3 days (which I would regularly empty), and the surface of the soil was definitely wet to the touch. I then didn't water the pot for a week and a half, and left the plant outside on a South-East facing balcony for a very hot(23-27 degrees) and sunny week. and by the end of that week and a half, the soil is still not particularly dry (although it is at least not actively WET now).  I perceive that the plants definitely suffered from this - several (though not all) of the leaves very suddenly went extremely pale and then died, other leaves have gained a pale halo around their edge, and for the 3-4 days after I did this, the plants appeared to wilt (as though I'd UNDER-watered them) though it has now recovered  I have multiple questions, so the above set up has been duplicated on multiple posts, but my question here is ...    B) What should I have done, that afternoon or the next day, when I realised that the pot was waterlogged? "
4522,Increase pH value of already planted soil in a balcony flower box?,"Two days ago I had soil of pH 5.5. I impatiently planted my lavender and now I'm worried because lavender needs a pH of 6.5 to 7.5.   I did mix the soil with about 1/4 (volume) of quartz sand and some small stones, but I guess that only avoids the soil being soaked and doesn't influence the pH value.   Tap water, which is what I use for watering, has an average pH of 7.6 over here (Berlin, that is) - might that help?  1) How badly did I mess up? I really want this lavender to thrive and to survive the winter. I already killed a whole balcony full of lavender last year because I didn't know about the importance of avoiding soaked soil, and I just can't live through that again cue dramatic gesture.  2) Is there a somewhat easy way to increase the pH value at root level now that they're planted?    I read somewhere that limestone takes years to permeate the soil when added to the top of it  .. or should I add baking soda into my water (ratio of baking soda per liter [gallon] of soil anyone?)  .. or should I get ""pH up"" solution for hydroponic growing equipment (I think they're mainly sold for people who homegrow weed)  .. or should I dig the plants back up, mix in limestone and replant them? After two days the roots probably haven't grown into the added soil yet and it wouldn't bother the plants (?). It would just be annoying for the human involved.    "
4523,Nerve plant bleaching & recovery,"My nerve plant (Fittonia) was recently not doing too well, and I suspected (correctly, as it turned out) that it was getting more light that it needed — after moving it to a shadier spot in the house, it has since recovered and is growing some new leaves.  However, even in this new spot, there seem to be a few oddities... specifically, some (not most) leaves seem to look bleached (as opposed to burnt):   And even though new leaves are growing, it's nowhere near as fully grown as it once was — most of the stems look healthy, but it's not nearly as bushy as before:   Should I move it somewhere yet more shaded than its current location? As it stands, it receives ~1 hour of direct sunlight in the afternoon. Should I be pruning it in some way? Any help to bring this nerve plant back to full health would be much appreciated :) "
4524,Is it safe to eat veggies grown in soil that has soured?,"If soil smells sour will it make garden vegetables inedible? the pot my peppers were growing in didn't drain well. I fixed it, but every time I water them it still smells sour. Are the peppers going to be safe to eat? "
4525,Dying tree with many holes,"There is a medium-sized tree on my property that’s in trouble (it’s some sort of fruiting berry tree: cherry?). I just noticed that it is way behind the other trees in terms of leaves, about 1/3 of the tree has no leaves at all and the other 2/3 seems to have a limited number of small leaves. Certainly nothing like what I would expect for late-June in New Hampshire.  Upon closer inspection I noticed that there are hundreds or thousands of small holes in rows. They are about 1/4” in diameter and absolutely cover the main trunk of the tree.  Based on a quick search it seems like maybe this is the result of a woodpecker? I do not recall hearing any incessant pecking but obviously something has done some damage to this tree.  My question is two-part: 1) is there anything that can be done to save this tree? Will it be OK with very limited leaves for the season? 2) Is there anything I should do to protect the other trees on the property? This is the only tree of its type we have, but there are many other maple, birch, and apple trees that I would hate to lose.    "
4526,Is Zanthoxylum simulans (Sichuan pepper) self-pollinating?,One can find a lot of contradicting information about this topic on the web. It would be nice to have a definite answer to this question.   Does anyone have a solitary plant (with guaranteed no other plants in the neighbourhood) that produces berries? Or are there any studies that came to a conclusion? 
4527,Can I make my own potting soil with what I have?,"I have miracle grow gardening soil as well as Hoffman and Espoma cactus mixes. Can I mix these two (part cactus mix part gardening mix) together for potting geraniums and lobelia? I'm out of general potting mix and am curious if mixing the two together would be an OK alternative? If not, what is the harm or reasons not to? "
4528,Which backpack sprayer (stainless steel vs plastic wand) to spray acidic solution to kill weeds?,I am debating which Chapin backpack sprayer to buy. The major difference between Chaptin 61900 and 61800 (see bottom of the page for comparison) is that 61900's wand is stainless steel. I am planning to use it with homemade solution (with white vinegar plus salt and detergent) to kill weeds. But will this solution be bad with stainless steel (ie: corrosive)? 
4529,Is this tomato stem rot contagious?,"Is the condition of this stem something to be concerned about?  The plant seems healthy otherwise as well as the other tomato plants in the raised bed.  Do I need to rip it out and destroy it?  I've dealt with Septorium Leaf Spot in the past,  hence the grass mulch.       "
4530,What could I do to make my terrace more comfortable?,"I have this  terrace in front of my house.  It is paved with very knee-abrasive dales. And I would like to make it a better place for my child which will soon learn how to walk and fall there. Moreover the dales get dark with time, pretty bad looking. I tried using high pressure cleaner, but it is a lot of work for a bad result, because the sand beneath the dales comes out...  South-faced, it gets really hot and uncomfortable. I feel it is too much work for me to remove wild grass that continuously comes growing here.    Does anyone has any ideas on how I could make the place better, i.e. avoid weeding (mowing it from time to time would be ok), have less heating radiating from the place, and a less abrasive surface?    I thought of a textile to cover a good part of it, but does it last long? Does it come with any inconvenient? I love observing plants growing, so I wouldn't mind covering it completely with fast-spreading, walk-through and drought resistant weeds or plants. Any suggestion ?    Especially, which kind of flat-covering plants would be appropriate for such a difficult place? I leave in East-France, a little high in the hills (650m above see level), this makes maybe something in the 7b-6a hardiness zone.   Here is what comes naturally here:  Savory:    Thyme:    White Clover:    something else?  And these two others I don't know of:  "
4531,What are these small growths on my huckleberry?,My huckleberry branches are growing through these.   Is it a fungus?

4532,Advice Needed - Dying? Tree line (privacy desired),"Situation:  Homes Back Yard borders a rural road, say 1 car per minute.  There was a line of some kind of arborvitae planted there ~10 years prior. Tree health various from OK to long dead on the tree line, the two hollys seem ok. See photos below. Roughly 30 trees along the 160ft property line.   Tree height is great on many of these trees, 20+ feet. Most of the death is at the bottom of the trees. I would hate to rip everything out and replant 6-8 ft trees. (Location NY, no one has any mature trees, remaining fall out from Hurricane Sandy.)   Is there any hope for these trees, or any idea what has/is killing them? If the tree has growth at the top but is dead cooked at the bottom is the tree alive?  A pool is going in the backyard within the coming year, so I am actually thinking of building a 6-8ft privacy fence in front of the tree line and leaving the trees. I Would then slowly cut out the dead trees and plant new trees (different species I suspect). Any thoughts on this? In that regard the backyard viewer would only see the fence and then the tree tops (still alive) as the fully dead trees are slowly removed and new trees are replanted.  Question:  What would you do?    Ultimate Goal: Total visibility blockage of road from backyard and 2nd floor of house. So 20+ft of blockage.  Patience: limited.    Thank you!     "
4533,How can I stop bushes growing through a mesh fence?,"My neighbour has lots of thorny bushes and ivy that grow against (and more importantly through) the fence on our shared boundary. They aren't the gardening type and have no inclination to remove the plants but I'm getting fed up of trimming them back. The fence is made of very sturdy wooden posts and beams with a wire mesh across them.  I would like to know what I could put up against the fence that would stop bushes growing through the mesh. An added bonus would be something that would stop them growing under the fence too.  I'm not asking for a specific product recommendation, but if you do recommend a product, don't forget to disclose any affiliations.    I would like to know a technique or type of product I could use. Someone suggested putting some bamboo fencing up against it but I think the bushes would still get through the gaps. I was wondering if there is a type of plastic sheeting or something that could be used?  Edit Here is a photo of the fence, I've added lines to show where the post/beams are. The gap between the posts/beams is approx 50x80 cm. The posts are approx 15x10 cm     "
4534,Why do you need to change potato seeds every couple of years?,"My relatives say that you need to change potato seeds every couple of years. They didn't specify why.  Why is that? Is it because we normally leave small potatoes for seeds and generate negative selection?  Would potato crop be better if we planted the biggest potatoes every year?  Update:  The question is about planting parent potatoes, and than their children and then grandchildren, and than gran grand children is presumably a bad think to do. "
4535,Light patch on tree trunk,"I have a rather young citrus tree (about 3 years, and been planted here for maybe half a year). I've noticed some weird light patches on the tree trunk, as shown in the image below. They seem to be located only towards the bottom part of the tree. I only noticed it yesterday. It feels wooden like the rest of the tree. It's not wet or anything.  The tree itself looks otherwise very healthy and seems to be passing through a growth spurt of some sort. The weather was very hot recently (36C/97F) and I've been watering it every day.  The only wildlife in the area are cats (I'm wondering whether it's a cat sharpening it's claws on it?)  What could it be?   "
4536,Is there any reason not to keep lemons on the tree after they are ripe?,"Are there any known problems with leaving lemons on the tree after they are ripe?    Last year I had a heavy crop and I just picked them as I needed them.  The following spring the tree lost most of its leaves and produced only one single lemon this year.    The tree has had problems with yellowing leaves and curling which I (reluctantly) treated with a copper spray and I applied Epsom salts around the base in case of magnesium deficiency. It has also been the wettest of summers in New Zealand, but that hasn't stopped my orange tree or neighbours' lemon trees from producing.  I suspect I sapped the tree's energy by leaving the fruit on too long.  Could that be the case?  "
4537,How long should the soil for succulents stay moist?,"How long should the soil for succulent plants stay moist?  I know you are only supposed to water the succulents once the soil is dry, and that succulent roots can rot if they are too wet, but how long is ideal for the soil to stay moist?  I'm asking because I just planted a lot of succulents in larger pots using ""G&amp;B ORGANICS PALM, CACTUS &amp; CITRUS For In-Ground &amp; Container Planter"" soil but even being outside (san jose CA) with 6hrs of direct sun the soil still feels quite moist 5 days after watering.  I'm ok letting it go until it is completely dry but I feel like this is a really long time and I don't want the roots to rot. "
4538,Can I transplant the cucumbers in these pictures?,"I have two cucumber plants in pots (pics below) the one in the terracotta pots is a type of slicing cucumber and the cream colored pot is pickling cukes. Neither are burpless.   I read that moving and transplanting cucumbers can do a lot of damage but the pots appear to be too small. I don't know much about growing cucumbers, but I know I always transplant my tomatoes into big 5gallon buckets after they've reached about a foot tall but they transplant easily since they're in the nightshade family. These are both about two feet.   I just bought a trellis to put behind them between the pots and a bench. What should I do? Should I leave them in their current pots because it'll do more damage than harm or transplant them? If so, how big should the pots be? Is there anything special I should do to prevent shock? Also, when I remove the rigged wire trellis's I have now, is it okay to snip the viney, spindly light green vines that have curled along, or do I gently unwind them? Please help!     "
4539,Ming Aralia is turning yellow and dropping branches,"I've had my Ming Aralia for about 2.5 years now and it would occasionally drop leaves and branches. As of this spring (approx 1.5 months ago) the leaf and branch dropping accelerated to the point that even new growth is quickly yellowing and dying.   I previously posted about the same plant here: What kind of tree is this?1  I've had fungus gnat issues in the past, but I rarely see them near the plant now.  I water it occasionally, but not excessively. It gets moderate sun throughout the day, and the weather has been humid but not too warm or cool.  Any suggestions as to what I should do? Really old growth is still present, but as you can see in the pic below, nearly half the branches on one side have fallen off.         "
4540,Can I save my Avocado tree from the extreme heat?,"I live in Arizona. I have a 2 year old avocado tree in a pot, not in the ground. Last week it was exposed to the extreme heat wave that hit us. I made sure the soil was moist every day. Twice a week I use the pond's backwash to water it. This week the leaves are brown and drooping. Can I save it? Should I bring it inside? I have it under a shade umbrella but it still gets sun in the afternoon. Is it too late?  "
4541,Beet leaves bubbling,"A few of my beet plants (~5%) have these odd skin-like bubbles forming on one or two of their leaves.  When I pop them they're filled with these patches of black particles (possibly dead pests of some sort?).  Any ideas what they're from, and/or if they're malicious?  I'm in the high desert in Albuquerque, NM where it's been oscillating between intense sun, cool (40s-50sF) nights, and spotty rain.  I have had an outbreak of leaf miners on the beet leaves and nearby on some cauliflower and spinach leaves.  Could this be related?     "
4542,Why have only the female flowers bloomed in my pumpkin patch,"I planted two Giant Atlantic pumpkin plants in my garden around 9 weeks or so ago.  The male flowers where the first to show, many of them but haven't bloomed and are quite firm to the touch still.  Since then three females (1 on one plant, 2 on the other) have grown, bloomed and started to wilt (in the last couple of days) without any sign of the males blooming so that I can pollinate.  I understand that the male pumpkins are supposed to bloom first.  Is something wrong? what? and is there anything I can do?  More details  They were bred indoors for the first 6 weeks and transplanted outdoors in new soil/compost 13 foot holes.  The rest of the garden (which they are now creeping over) is old soil, which I've been loosely mixing with compost as they grow over it. I've watered them 4-8 litres a day, at the base and also via funnel to the roots.  Once or twice a week, adding high potash feed.  There's not much else in the garden except some very new sunflower sprouts. I don't know the pH of the soil and have no way to find out.  I am in the U.K. (Scotland) it's been a combination of hot and sunny and cold and rainy although the soil has been no lower than 12C the entire time, that I can see.  For most of their life they have been under a plastic, flexible greenhouse-type cover (until the last week or so).  (This is also my first foray into gardening) "
4543,Chia seeds:can I plant food grade chia seeds?,"I am trying to grow indoor plants that my pet bird can eat. I have wheat grass (cat grass) that has done very well, and he loves it but I also read that birds can eat chia, the plant and the seeds. I can't seem to find chia seeds at any of my garden stores and do not want to buy a chia pet. I don't find them nearly as attractive as growing a plant in a regular pot. My holistic food store and one of our high end grocery stores sells chia seeds. Can I just plant those? If not, why not? Is there anything extra I'd need to do first before planting like soaking to germinate? "
4544,Compost pile in vegetable garden area,I am putting in a new garden and thinking about putting our compost pile in one corner.  Will this attract harmful bugs to any degree that may interfere with the health of the plants growing nearby?  Are there any other drawbacks to siting the compost heap in a vegetable garden that I should consider? 
4545,"How can I remove crabgrass from a Zoysia lawn, and flower beds?","We just bought a new house in Orlando. The home is great but we noticed crab grass taking over and a few other weeds. I'm a total noob with grass stuff, although I'm researching all I can.   The grass type is Zoysia.   Trugreen recently came and did their application for the lawn but they said they couldn't do anything with the crab grass. I went and bought round up. I was planning on to spray all crab grass invested areas and then probably lay sod or just reseed? I'm not sure if you can just throw seeds in there. (Total noob).  Also, I have flower beds in front and back of the house. I wanted to put stones in there and do some brick edging. There are weeds there as well. What is process of cleaning that out? The guy at Home Depot told me to dig out the weeds, spray some round up, put a weed mat on top and then cover that with fresh top soil and then plant my new plants and go from there whether I wanna do mulch or stones.   Am I on the right path? Please advise.  "

So any suggestion or anything am doing wrong ?     thanks     Update :  new soil mixture : sand + red soil + canals soft soil + natural compost    "
4547,How to position water mesh filters?,"Is it important for at what angle I mount a mesh water filter? What positions are acceptable?   Details: this is connected to urban potable water tap from in an area with medium hardness water. The reason for putting is because I have a dripline and mini drippers and I want to avoid clogging.   My intent is to mount it under the tap, so the flow direction would be from up to down. I suspect it does not matter how I mount it as long I can access it for cleaning. "
4548,Why isn't my pomegranate tree bearing fruit?,I have a good size pomegranate tree I planted in the ground about 6 years ago. The plant is healthy and bears flowers and tiny fruit which quickly fall off rather than developing into a good size pomegranate. I get fruit later in the year but only a handful. I hear similar complaints from neighbors.   What am I doing wrong? What is the fruiting season in zone 9b?      
4549,Plums half sweet and half sour,"When I purchased my house last year I hoped that the tree with purple leaves in my front yard would produce fruit. Fortunately it has produced little plums about the size of a golf ball. This is my first experience owning a fruit tree so I apologize if the following is a silly question.   When I pick a plum that appears to be ripe, half of the flesh is sweet and the other half of the same plum is sour. I don't recall experiencing this with plums or other stone fruit I've purchased from the supermarket. In the supermarket stone fruit generally has a uniform flavor throughout. Is this a normal occurrence for little plums like these? If so is there anything I can do now to encourage the entire plum to be sweet now? If that ship has sailed what can I do so the plums are more uniformly sweeter next year? "
4550,Bulldog Edging Knife Useless,"I was all excited yesterday when I got home from work. I had received an email from Amazon saying my new Bulldog Edging Knife had been delivered.  I opened up the box, unwrapped the tool, and was so disappointed. These are like one of the most expensive edging knifes you can buy, yet here is its "" sharp edge "".    It is like 2mm thick, very very dull. Does anyone have any experience with these tools? Aren't they supposed to be sharp? The one I borrowed from my neighbour was quite sharp. "
4551,Is landscape fabric stressing my plants?,"About a month ago I did a little bit of landscaping at home. My dad insisted that we put landscape fabric down, even though I said I didn't care to use it.   The type of landscape fabric that was used seemed overly heavy to me. It looks something like this My parents have a weed barrier at their home, but its more of a cloth look, like this.  A few days after planting a few new plants, putting down the weed mat, and adding new mulch some of the new plants were looking a little weary. I at first thought it was maybe just a small shock. Three weeks later, here I am with the same weary looking plants, one plant has lost it's flower buds, and a rose bush that has been there from the beginning also lost all of it's flowers.   I've kept the plants watered and occasionally lift the weed barrier to make sure the soil is still moist, which it has been. The fact that the rose bush has died is what makes me wonder if it's the landscape fabric that is causing the problem. My rose bush thrived all last summer with zero problems, even with the amount of extreme heat we had.   My first thought was maybe the landscape barrier is too thick and is shedding most of the water away from the base of the plants.  So the question is, could it really be the landscape fabric that is causing my problems? If it is the cause of the problem, what are some other minimal effort ways to control weeds?

4552,"What is the result of ""unpredictable"" cross-pollination of beets?","I inherited a community plot this summer along with a sprinkling of second-season plants which were overlooked at harvest in the fall. I have one beet which is currently bolting (do you say bolting for beets?). I was planning on collecting the seeds, but then I read online that beets can wind pollinate with chard from up to 2 miles away!  I did a search to find out what possible chard-beet hybrid might result, but I couldn't find any descriptions.   I understand that the results of cross-pollination are unpredictable, but what might I expect? Less tasty/sweet roots? Smaller roots? More chard like foliage? Is it just not worth taking the risk, and should I just buy more carefully cultivated seeds? "
4553,"Avocado help, 2 simple questions pls","  Hi, this is my first tree and first ever successful plant.  I have pinched the top 2 leaves already. Question 1 - the bottom 2 leaves (pic. top right)  have dry patches. All the others are looking fine. Shall I cut them?  Question 2 - Am I supposed to completely cover the stone with soil? "
4554,Will pooping in a flowerpot before planting ivy help it grow?,"I have heard poop can actually be really good fertilizer. Truth be told, in my county, the solid waste division takes figure remains and uses it as fertilizer that is sold for planting.  With this in mind, what would happen if I took some soil, put it in a flowerpot and then pooped on it, and then covered that with more soil? Would this be a good fertilizer and help a plant grow? I'm not joking at all.  "
4555,Tree identification Washington State,Tree Identification. Any ideas what this is? They emerged red. I feel like it's way too early for them to be cherry and way to small for them to be plums? And they don't look like cherry plums either. Will they get bigger maybe? I can't find any pictures or videos of young plums to compare.     
4556,Bite marks on tomato leaves,"Can anyone help me identify some bite marks please? I'm attaching pictures.     I've seen some ants around, I'm planning to get rid of them. These marks however seem to have some ""saliva"" left-over, which is weird. I thought it could be a snail/slug, but I didn't find any slime trail anywhere around the plant, nor in the ground close to the plant. As you may notice I'm using growbags, so it could be that it's hiding below the growbag during the day. Still, I didn't find slime trails around.  Today is the first day I've noticed these ones, and they are only present in 2 plants, out of the 10 I have. I have them in a row, so it's likely that this pest is living close by this end of the row. These are tomatillos, which is a variety of mexican green tomato.  Any guesses and recommendations?  By the way, I heard cinammon powder would keep ants away, so I sprinkled a circle around the base of my plants, but I think it didn't work that well. I'm not sure, becuase it has been raining recently and the water washed it away. How to keep ants away, in your experience? Should I continue with the cinammon?  Thank you very much for your help! "
4557,Is this still Cress?,I bought some Cress a while ago to go in Egg Mayo sandwhiches. I decided to plant some of the Cress and now it's morphed into something that doesn't resemble Cress anymore.  I've researched types of Cress from different countries but none of them resemble the Cress that's now growing.  Can anyone shed some light on if this is actually Cress or if something else is now growing? (It's the middle plant in the photo). Is this plant still edible?   
4558,Ants digging next to the root of my newly planted Japanese maple,"Damn  It has been raining here every day and I have not had a look at my Coral Bark Japanese maple in a while Today I had a look and I noticed ants digging their nest/galleries around the tree, some of these are darker because my wife ""put some windex"" on them (that is a joke but she used vinegar)  How do I get rig of these beasts? Is my tree in danger?  The ants are small size not carpenter ants    the tree looks like this     During my research into this I came accross this thread [website]I have also cross checked about ants -it seems that they are not a problem, I guess they will go away as I will continue to water the tree daily every evening "

4560,Germinating succulent seeds,"First a little background,  I live in Sri Lanka where the temperature is at about 30c throughout the year. The sun is also very strong for the entire year and yeah we don't have different seasons here. On December it gets to about 25c but that's not much of a difference. The sun rises at about 6am and sets at 6pm. Starting from 10am to 3pm there is full sunlight and it's a bit hard to a person to work outdoors for more than 30minutes in direct sunlight. Also, in the area that I live, we don't have succulent nurseries or a place to buy succulent potting soil.   Previously, I bought succulent seeds from eBay but they turned out to be some weed. The ""succulent"" seedlings died instantly when I gave them a bit of morning sun from a shaded window(maybe they died because they weren't succulents).   These are the steps I followed to germinate them.    Take some normal soil and add extra stones into it so it will drain faster.  Put it into microwave at 800w for 2minutes.  Wait for it to cool down and then add seeds on the surface then cover it with a clear cover to trap the moisture inside.    This is what they turned out to be.   I'm pretty sure that these aren't succulents.   Now my questions.   Am I mistaken and those are succulent seedlings ? I bought new succulent seeds. Lets assume they are real succulent seeds.So I'm going to give it a try again. The steps I followed to germinate ""succulents"" were correct or something was wrong?  I have also bought a 10w grow led chip. Can I use it to grow the seedlings? If so, how high should I place the led grow light? (When lit, it's colour is similar to pink) How often should I water the succulents as they grow up? The soil that I mixed up drains fast. I watered the soil 3days ago just to check and it still is a bit wet to the touch.  How fast should the soil dry up?  If the succulents germinate how many hours of sunlight should I give them?  If it's possible to use the grow lights. How many hours of light should I give?    Sorry for the image quality. It's the only image that I have of them.   Thank you.  "
4561,Can you plant a strawberry from fruit?,I have an alpine strawberry plant which produces fruit (and no runners).   How can I make a second plant from this one?   Can I remove the seeds from a fruit and plant them? 
4562,Why is there such a difference in size between the same tomato plant's saplings?,"I have miniature ""balcony"" tomatoes which I've planted from seeds last year, and they gave fruit which have been sitting in the fridge slowly drying down and shriveling for about half a year. A few months back I decided to try and plant these shriveled up tomatoes without taking them apart to get to the seeds inside, just to see what would happen. I think all of them sprouted, but there is a noticeable difference in sizes of the new plants. As you would expect, most fruits have produced groups of small saplings, but some have grown into few, but much more massive.  You can barely see the gaps in soil because I used sprouting pods and planted some of them together into one pot. Why is there such a great difference between the saplings? Is it just because the bigger ones had so few other seeds to compete with for nutrients? Because it doesn't look to me like it would be that big a deal, but I may be wrong. Could it be because the roots got stuck inside the tomato fruit's skin? Or is it because some fruit have had more time to mature better than others?   "
4563,Did I use enough grass seed on my new lawn?,"I recently used Scotts Turf Builder Grass Seed Sun &amp; Shade Mix to start a new lawn from seed. I believe I followed the application instructions correctly when I sowed the seed 11 days ago, but I'm not sure I used enough seed. I bought enough seed for the square footage of lawn, but the Scotts brand rotary spreader dumped it all out before I could make the recommended second pass. Here are some pictures I took today.       Should I apply more seed? Will whats growing there expand to fill bare patches?  Further information:     I live in the Boston area (zone 6). We had heavy rain (about an inch) on day 1 and 2. We've had two or three light showers (less than 0.2 inches) since then. Air temperatures have ranged from 55 to 80 degrees.   Yes, the lawn was watered prior to taking this picture. I installed an irrigation system that I've been using to water the lawn. I've been watering an area when I see that 1/2 to 2/3 of the soil surface is dry. The original soil was sandy with many rocks. After removing the original vegetation I added about an inch of compost and tilled it into the soil. The other lawncare products I applied were Scotts starter fertilizer and Scotts grub killer (grubs damaged the original lawn), all in accordance with manufacturer instructions. After sowing the seed I spread a thin (less than a quarter of an inch) layer of peat moss.   This area of the lawn gets direct sunlight from early morning to early afternoon.   I have a new reel mower that is set to 3 inches.   I used a roller filled halfway with water to compact the soil. I went over everything twice after I spread the peat moss.  "
4564,What do I do once my weeds turn brown?,"I put down some spray Ortho concentrate weed killer almost 2 weeks ago. Now many of my weedy areas are turning brown and look like they are drying up (grass still looks ok).  What do I do now? Will the weeds simply disappear? Should I rake them out or pull them up?  Also, the weed killer doesn't seem to have gotten all the weeds in the first round: what is the best course of action for getting rid of the remaining weeds?  If the best option is more weed killer or different weed killer, when will it be ok to apply that?     "
4565,Why are my Ponderosa lemon tree leaves yellowing from the veins outward?,"My Ponderosa lemon tree is 3-4 years old, but I've only had it for 6-7 months. It has flowered and is now producing 4 lemons but two leaves fell off with this yellowing from the veins in the center outward toward the circular edges.   It is in a 5-6 gallon wooden barrel container, has been fertilized twice since the beginning of March with Jobes fruit &amp; tree, Citrus tone organic, Dr. Earths all purpose. Can you tell me what is going on?  It has also started to lean a little bit but I'm thinking that's just the way it's growing?    About watering, I water both my pomegranate and lemon tree once a week. The temperature here in New York has been very bi-polar! It has gone from 45 degrees to 80 within days. We've had a lot of rain storms, and water levels are way above average at record levels since 1829. "
4566,What kind of worm is this which lives in the soil of my potted mango tree?,"When I was replanting my mango tree to a bigger pot I found some weird, very small, worms crawling around in the now rotten mango seed. I made a macro picture of them which you can see here:    I also made a macro video, for my blog, were you can see them crawling around. You can find the video here: [website]My question is, what kind of worm is this? Could this worm be of local origin (Swedish) or could it have infected the mango seed before being imported to Sweden and therefore originate from the country which produces the mangos?  I also found some kind of insect living together with the worm in the mango seed. You can see the macro picture below. I am not sure if this insect is related, but it was actually this insect I discovered first when repotting the tree. It was when searching for more of these insects, to remove them, when I discovered these worms.    I would say the insect was about 0.5 to 1 mm big and white/yellow:ish, the color is different in the picture as I tried to make it more visible. I think the worm was longer than the insect but much thinner. It would probably have been impossible for me to discover the worm at all if it wouldn’t have moved so much. "
4567,Identify this plant that's taking over my yard,"What is this plant?  This is slowly taking over my yard.  You can see from one of the pictures that it's a vining plant of some sort.  It will lay roots and then spread out.  It came in to my yard a couple years ago from a bad batch of top soil and it's been spreading ever since.  Follow up question... how do I kill it?  It did not respond to Scott's Weed and Feed.  I've been pulling it out by hand and overseeding with grass, but it's a battle I'm losing.  I need a better approach but I don't know what I'm up against.  For a climate reference, I live in western Pennsylvania.  enter image description here       "

4571,What should I do for unknown tree bark injury on a Chinese Pistache?,"I just noticed a tree bark issue on my Chinese Pistache. Is this no harm damage or an infection I should worry about? Is there anything I should do for it?  There is plenty of mulch around the tree to prevent accidental lawn mower strikes. The damage is in the area where the tree bends with excessive swaying in the wind. It used to go near horizontal when a storm arrived. I've since controlled for it by loosely tying the trunk to prevent bends past 45 degrees.  Other Details   1.5"" diameter trunk and at least 12 ft high  Newly planted this past Easter (2 months) In southern Texas. Gets lots of full sun Healthy leaves, no other diseases noticed Arrived with a bad infestation of sharpshooter insects. Treated and pretty sure they are gone now.   Update  Per stormy's answer, I consulted an arborist. Nursery is reputable and leaned towards animal damage. Said it reminded him of damage deer make when rubbing against trees. Seeing that my tree is fenced in, highly unlikely to be deer. I watched my tree like a hawk and discovered the culprit.  My cat was using the tree as a scratching post. Pic attached at bottom. I surrounded trunk with a wire mesh. Cat was not happy about it. Arborist thinks the tree will be fine though will take years to recover from the damage.      "
4572,What's the best way to get turf to grow on stone-filled 1m high gabion retaining garden?,"I'm in the UK. We have leveled the bottom of our garden by means of using 1m high gabion baskets filled up with stone, and back filling the whole area again with stone which is about 30m2. The reason there is so much stone is the house was built on a quarry.  The resulting area I'm told will be virtually impossible to grown turf on top as the water will just dissipate, even with 4""-6"" of soil above.  What would be the best and most cost effective solution to get turf to grow there? What type of soil or preparation would be the best?  I really don't want artificial grass. "
